Once the bike was built out and on wheels the name ACID TIGER was given to it by the now proud owner and head of our R &amp; D, Nate Bradley.

He patterened the finish after what you would see on a new car model that is out getting road tested before being relased to the public. Something to hide the shapes and details that was under that surface was the goal of the finish. &nbsp;It became anything but that.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05652.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05652.jpg 1000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05652-200x300.jpg 200w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05652-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05652-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05652-39x59.jpg 39w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05652-800x1200.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" pagespeed_url_hash=\"3466556591\" onload=\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);\"></p><p>THE BUILD:</p><p>Enve Adventure fork</p><p>SRAM AXS 1x</p><p>44 tooth single ring</p><p>Shimano XTR cassette 10-45</p><p>White Industries; Hubs, bottom bracket and head set</p><p>Moots Stem</p><p>Moots Cinch Post</p><p>Panaracer Gravel King SK in 50mm</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05508-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05508-2.jpg 1000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05508-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05508-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05508-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05508-2-39x59.jpg 39w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/MAV05508-2-800x1200.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" pagespeed_url_hash=\"4058733590\" onload=\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);\"></p><p>Check out the<a href=\"https://moots.com/bike/routt-45/\"> ROUTT 45</a>.</p><p>photo credits: Andy Chasteen</p></div></div>","author":"Jon Cariveau","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"7a72c6338dac6b0449e550b78dbd1cfab1abee0ab4b259b5cfed3f202876f886","category":"Cycling"}
