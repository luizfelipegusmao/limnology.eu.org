The new Scope All-Road wheels get the same aerodynamic 30, 40 &amp; 57mm depths as the Road line-up, but jumps to a 23mm internal, hooked tubeless rim to better fit high-volume all-road tires and even wider gravel bike tires.</p><h2>Scope All-Road wider aero carbon gravel wheels</h2><p><span><iframe width=\"696\" height=\"392\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin

offset by a 5W rolling-resistance reduction, ultimately making the wider tire setup faster and more comfortable.</p><h3>Tech Details &amp; Build Options</h3><p><a
