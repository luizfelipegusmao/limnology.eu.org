The Italian outsprinted Giulio Ciccone for the victory, Alex Aranburu was third across the line.</p><p>“What a stage and what a team. They worked all day and I think it’s the best thing to win in the final when you see a team like this,” Ballerini said after the race.</p><p>Ballerini will remain in the funky primary coloured leader’s jersey for stage three with a 16 second lead over Aranburu.</p><p>The stage two finale looked like it would be a standard sprint finish, with any breakaway attempts brought back in the final four kilometres. But, with wet and slippery roads the run into the line was not smooth sailing for the peloton.</p><p>A crash in the final 1.5 km took down the world champion Julian Alaphilippe along with Aleksandr Vlasov. Matteo Jorgenson also went down a few hundred meters from the line. After the race, Jorgenson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatteoJorg/status/1360261703448027136?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tweeted</a> that the crash had been caused by a fan leaning over the barriers into the path of the Team Movistar rider.</p><p>The third stage of Tour de la Provence will finish at Chalet Reynard, 9.7 km up the iconic Mont Ventoux.</p><h3>Fabio Jakobsen undergoes jaw surgery as part of Tour of Poland recovery</h3><p>Fabio Jakobsen has undergone surgery for jaw implants as part of his Tour of Poland rehabilitation. Jakobsen also had scars in his mouth reconstructed, both procedures were related to the numerous facial injuries Jakobsen sustained in the Tour of Poland crash.</p><p>Compared to the various other surgeries Jakobsen has had post-crash the recovery time for the jaw and mouth surgeries should be short.</p><p>“Yesterday I had another operation, that went well,” Jakobsen wrote on his Instagram. “The surgeons drilled implants in my upper and lower jaw and reconstructed the scars in my mouth. For now a week of rest and let the body do its healing. Hopefully, next week I can restart training again and build up towards races!”</p><p>Jakobsen is hoping to be back to racing soon and was at team camp riding alongside his Deceuninck-QucikStep teammates in January.</p><h3>Gent-Wevelgem announces men’s and women’s team lineups</h3><p>Gent-Wevelgem, set to take place on March 28th, has announced the men’s and women’s teams who will contest for a slightly-cobbled victory.</p><p>For <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GentWevelgem/status/1360160322687037440?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the women</a>, all nine of the WorldTour teams will be in attendance, along with 15 UCI Continental teams.
