The 26-year-old eventually withdrew from the race on lap 5 and was then seen sitting on the grass in the pits area, in obvious pain.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CORVOS_00033345-009-1340x893.jpg\"></figure><p>The section Van der Poel crashed on included a ramp during training but that ramp was removed for the race. Dutch media AD Sportwereld reports that Van der Poel told his teammate Milan Vader that he thought the ramp was still there. Vader said, “I think MvdP wanted to roll off the drop but ramp wasn’t there. He should have known. I told him at lunch.”</p><p>Van der Poel said on twitter, “I didn’t know. The ramp was there during the recon. I only heard they removed it during the test event”</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Van der Poel has gone to the hospital to undergo checks on his injured hip.</p><p>Van der Poel came into the Tokyo MTB race as one of the favourites for gold, alongside fellow multi-discipline star Pidcock. Less than a month ago Van der Poel was leading the Tour de France after a swashbuckling stage win on stage 2. Earlier this year he won his fourth cyclocross world title.</p></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"22514ac26bb9f734e9340d6a03ce4fede2b57144c69f2c88ddee9a345d8230a9","category":"Cycling"}
