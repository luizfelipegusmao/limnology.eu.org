The Renegade is still meant to be a lightning fast tire on hardpack and features the block-in-block tread on the shoulders with a smoother rolling center tread. The Fast Trak is more of a mixed conditions XC tire that is still fast, but offers more grip in many situations. Lastly, the Ground Control is meant as an all-season XC tread which is the choice especially when things get muddy.</p><p><a

Specialized claims that the tread block-in-block tread design allows the outer knob structure to support the inner block for more stable handling.</p><p>When mounted to a 28mm internal width rim, the 29 x 2.35″ tires initially measured a bit undersized at 2.31″ wide – though like most tires we expect them to stretch a bit over time.</p><h2>Casing Tech</h2><p><a

But like everything in life, there are compromises to be made – that increased grip comes at the expense of all-out speed with Specialized rubber compounds getting faster the lower the number. The higher the number, the more damping properties from the rubber compound itself.</p><p>Their new XC tires are offered in three combinations – T5, T5/T7 combo, and T7. T5 tires are built for race-day speeds, whereas the T5/T7 combo tires run T5 down the center with T7 shoulders for extra grip.

From left to right, above you have a Fast Trak T5 Control, Fast Trak Grid T7, and a Ground Control T7, all in 29 x 2.35″ widths. Compared to the Grid casings, the Fast Trak Control casing feels crazy light and supple, meaning the S-Works version has to be an impressive specimen.</p><h2>Pricing</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized XC rider at sunset\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07141522/Specialized-XC-mountain-bike-tires-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Available now, the Specialized XC tires will sell for $70 a piece for the S-Works versions, and $60 a piece for the Control and Grid casings.
