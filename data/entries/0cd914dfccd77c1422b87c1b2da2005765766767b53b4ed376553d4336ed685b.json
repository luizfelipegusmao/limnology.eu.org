In approximately 50% of cases, the cause is idiopathic gastroparesis (IGD). Recent studies suggest a link between chronic enteroviral infections and persistent gas-trointestinal symptoms, including delayed gastric emptying. This study investigates the effects of a silydianin-rich extract from Silybum marianum seeds on enteroviral infections in vitro and the mitigation of delayed gastric emptying in mice. Silydianin, a key bioactive compound known for its liver-protective and antioxidant properties, has not been extensively studied for its impact on enteroviral infections and gastroparesis; Methods NMR spectroscopy (¹H, ¹³C, and DEPT) identi-fied silydianin as the primary compound, with minor flavonolignans and trace amounts of an oxidation product. The study assessed the cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of the extract at various stages of the viral life cycle, including virucidal activity, cell protection, and post-infection effects, using neutral red assays in RD cells, with results confirmed by real-time PCR. The viruses studied included Coxsackievirus B2, Coxsackievirus A10, Poliovirus SL-1, and Enterovirus EV71. The impact on delayed gastric emptying was evaluated in a mouse model of gastroparesis using doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg compared to a control; Results: The silydianin-rich extract exhibited con-sistent antiviral activity, with the highest selectivity index (SI) for EV71 (4.08) during virucidal activity. It provided moderate cell protection, with EC50 values ranging from 120.88 to 186.10 µg/mL and SI values from 2.20 to 3.39. Post-infection treatment showed varying efficacy, with Coxsackie A10 demonstrating the highest SI (3.90). In vivo, the extract at 200 mg/kg significantly improved gastric emptying to 96.47% and slightly increased gastrointestinal transit from 50.33% to 61.46%; Conclusions These results suggest that silydianin may be effective in treating enteroviral infections and enhancing intestinal function, making it a promising candidate for gastroparesis treatment and warranting further research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cd914dfccd77c1422b87c1b2da2005765766767b53b4ed376553d4336ed685b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
