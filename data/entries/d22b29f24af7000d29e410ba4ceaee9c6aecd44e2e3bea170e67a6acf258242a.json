{"title":"Association between executive functions and COMT Val<sup>108/158</sup>Met polymorphism among healthy younger and older adults: A preliminary study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303343","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Zoltan Apa, Jessica Gilsoul, Vinciane Dideberg, Fabienne Collette</p>\r\nBackground and objectives <p>Genetic variability in the dopaminergic system could contribute to age-related impairments in executive control. In this study, we examined whether genetic polymorphism for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT Val<sup>158</sup>Met) is related to performance on updating, shifting and inhibition tasks.</p> Methods <p>We administered a battery of executive tasks assessing updating, shifting and inhibition functions to 45 older and 55 younger healthy participants, and created composite z-scores associated to each function. Six groups were created based on genetic alleles (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met) derived from the <i>COMT</i> gene and age (younger, older). Age and genotype effects were assessed with <i>t</i>-test and ANOVA (p&lt;0.05).</p> Results <p>A lower performance was observed in the older group for the three executive processes, and more particularly for inhibition. Moreover, older participants homozygous for the Val allele have a lower performance on the inhibition composite in comparison to younger Val/Val.</p> Conclusions <p>These results confirm presence of executive performance decrease in healthy aging. With regard to genetic effect, older participants seem particularly disadvantaged when they have a lower baseline dopamine level (i.e., Val/Val homozygous) that is magnified by aging, and when the executive measure emphasize the need of stable representations (as in inhibition task requiring to maintain active the instruction to not perform an automated process).</p>","author":"Zoltan Apa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d22b29f24af7000d29e410ba4ceaee9c6aecd44e2e3bea170e67a6acf258242a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
