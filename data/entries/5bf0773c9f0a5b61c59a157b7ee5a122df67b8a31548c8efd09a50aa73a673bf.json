{"title":"Early-stage health technology assessment of fractional flow reserve coronary computed tomography versus standard diagnostics in patients with stable chest pain in The Netherlands","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305189","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Iris W. A. Boot, R. Nils Planken, Alexander W. den Hartog, Hubertus J. M. Vrijhoef</p>\r\nObjectives <p>The aim of this early-stage Health Technology Assessment (HTA) was to assess the difference in healthcare costs and effects of fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography (FFRct) compared to standard diagnostics in patients with stable chest pain in The Netherlands.</p> Methods <p>A decision-tree model was developed to assess the difference in total costs from the hospital perspective, probability of correct diagnoses, and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events at one year follow-up. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the main drivers of the cost difference between the strategies. A threshold analysis on the added price of FFRct analysis (computational analysis only) was conducted.</p> Results <p>The mean one-year costs were €2,680 per patient for FFRct and €2,915 per patient for standard diagnostics. The one-year probability of correct diagnoses was 0.78 and 0.61, and the probability of major adverse cardiovascular events was 1.92x10<sup>-5</sup> and 0.01, respectively. The probability and costs of revascularization and the specificity of coronary computed tomography angiography had the greatest effect on the difference in costs between the strategies. The added price of FFRct analysis should be below €935 per patient to be considered the least costly option.</p> Conclusions <p>The early-stage HTA findings suggest that FFRct may reduce total healthcare spending, probability of incorrect diagnoses, and major adverse cardiovascular events compared to current diagnostics for patients with stable chest pain in the Dutch healthcare setting over one year. Future cost-effectiveness studies should determine a value-based pricing for FFRct and quantify the economic value of the anticipated therapeutic impact.</p>","author":"Iris W. A.
