{"title":"Heavy Metal Music, Hip-Hop Music, and Construction Noise Induces Depressive Symptoms in Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1768/v1","date":1727143559000,"content":"Music has been proposed for a long time as a treatment for mental disorders. However, some special types of music or stimulating sounds might induce negative emotions. Herein, 8-week-old male mice were exposed to two specific genres of music, hip-hop (HH) and heavy metal (HM), and construction noise (CN), and a series of behavioral experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of these music or sounds on the emotion of mice. The experiment lasted 1 week in which 8-week-old male mice were used as animal models. We found that long term exposure HM, HH, and CN induced depressive symptoms with a decrease in dopamine receptor 1 and BDNF in the mixture of hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. Our results have highly addressed that certain special types of sound or music might induce negative emotions and loss of dopaminergic neurons in mice, and it is necessary to intervene in adolescences who are exposed to these music or sounds for a long time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56385a4d5dec2d0fc790f954c9b45436cab30e3cf2c4ba530f4dcd0c6a8d577b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
