For research articles, abstracts should give a Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) has gained worldwide popularity because of its notable mechanical response. This research studied the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and flexural tensile strength of UHPC. Batches were made with the addition of steel and PVA fibers using a standard procedure defined in the research. The experimental data from the compressive strength test was analyzed in the Statistica 10 software to investigate the fibers' influence on UHPC's mechanical properties. An analysis of the elastic modulus prediction was carried out according to international standards. It was found that the normalized equations for the elastic modulus are not adequate for its estimation. The statistical analysis indicated that the range of fiber quantities analyzed did not significantly affect the compressive strength and the elastic modulus. Regarding the optimized mix, its flexural tensile strength indicates that the fiber content must be higher for UHPC to be suitable for structural use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1009d7031580324b220e5fa2e0ad52f0ebb647fff2cc73f1fd5164775f6b080b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
