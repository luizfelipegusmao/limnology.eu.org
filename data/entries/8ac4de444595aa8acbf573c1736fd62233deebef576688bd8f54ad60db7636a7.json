{"title":"Virtual Reality-Assisted Informed Consent for Anesthesia: A Prospective and Randomized Proof-of-Concept Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2287/v1","date":1727694212000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Informed consent for anesthesia poses both legal challenges and problems of understandable communication. Fulfilling all requirements through anesthesiologists directly interacting with patients is a time- and staff-consuming strategy. Given today's smart technologies, notably including virtual reality (VR), we explored in a prospective randomized study whether 'VR-assisted informed consent' could improve this situation. Methods: Fifty patients scheduled for orthopedic surgery were randomized. In the control group, informed consent was obtained via patient-specialist dialogs only. The patients in the study group, wearing a head-mount display, watched an 8-minute immersive 3D movie with standard explanations of general anesthesia, followed by a patient-specialist dialog to address open question. The time spent on the dialogs in both groups was evaluated as primary outcome variable. As secondary variables, we analyzed both a three-item Likert scale on patient satisfaction with the VR experience and cost differences between both groups. Results: Patient-specialist dialogs were carried on for median (IQR) durations of 93 (20–182) seconds in the study group versus 665 (261–829) seconds in the control group (P&amp;lt;0.001). All patients exposed to VR rated this experience as favorable (87.5%) or neutral (12.5%). Based on anesthesiologists' incomes in the US and UK, our approach would reduce the staff expenditure for each patient-specialist dialog by median amounts of ≈40 or ≈11 US dollars, respectively (2× P&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusions: 'VR-assisted informed consent' for anesthesia is well accepted by patients and reduces the time requirements for patient-specialist dialogs, thus pointing out a potential avenue towards increasing the work-time efficiency of anesthesiologists.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ac4de444595aa8acbf573c1736fd62233deebef576688bd8f54ad60db7636a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
