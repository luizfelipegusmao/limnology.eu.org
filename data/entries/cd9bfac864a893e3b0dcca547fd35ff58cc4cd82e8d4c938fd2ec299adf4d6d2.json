{"title":"Non-Abelian Topological Defects in QGP as Dark Matter Candidates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1082/v1","date":1718604365000,"content":"In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that topological defects formed in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) of the early universe, specifically flux tubes and domain walls, could serve as stable dark matter candidates. Theoretical analysis of the QCD vacuum structure reveals that these defects can form due to nontrivial topological configurations, with the Lagrangian density incorporating topological terms. We model the formation and stability of flux tubes and domain walls, estimating their energy densities and dynamics within the QGP. Flux tubes, with energy per unit length approximately given by $\\mu \\approx \\frac{\\sigma}{g_s^2}$, and domain walls, characterized by a surface energy density $\\sigma_{\\text{DW}} \\sim \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}^3$, exhibit unique gravitational signatures. These signatures include distinct gravitational lensing patterns due to their linear and planar mass distributions, making them detectable through astrophysical surveys. Furthermore, their minimal interaction with conventional matter aligns well with observational constraints on dark matter properties. We discuss potential experimental approaches for detecting these defects, including high-energy collider experiments and detailed analysis of gravitational lensing data. Our findings suggest that topological defects in the QGP provide a compelling and novel solution to the dark matter problem, offering a new direction for both theoretical investigation and experimental verification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd9bfac864a893e3b0dcca547fd35ff58cc4cd82e8d4c938fd2ec299adf4d6d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
