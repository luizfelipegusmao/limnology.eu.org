{"title":"Ecological patterns of benthic foraminiferal communities driven by seasonal and spatial environmental gradients in an Arctic fjord","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12691?af=R","date":1726625697000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Arctic fjords, being transitional areas between glacier-covered land and the ocean, are characterized by strong environmental gradients. The seasonal melting of glaciers generates strong turbidity and primary production antagonist gradients, which can affect benthic habitats. Two sampling campaigns were carried out in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Arctic Ocean) in May and August 2021 to investigate seasonal changes in benthic foraminifera spatial distribution and ecosystem functioning along a longitudinal transect of 10 km from the Kronebreen tidewater glacier front. Concurrently, organic matter quantity and biochemical composition, sediment grain size, and physical parameters of the water masses were investigated as possible driving factors of benthic ecosystem responses. In a previous study, three statistically determined foraminiferal biozonations (glacier proximal, medial, and distal) were observed on the basis of their species content within the closest 10 km from the glacier front, presenting similar assemblages in both seasons. Our results indicate that foraminiferal distribution at the local scale is mainly driven by physical and geochemical gradients induced by melting waters and sediment discharges from the tidewater glacier occurring during summer. Due to the climate change, the melting season is expected to last longer and increasing global temperature will much probably accelerate the melting processes. Our findings strongly support the use of foraminifera as bioindicators to monitor the effects of ongoing climate change on the benthic ecosystems of Arctic fjords and, accessorily, as proxies for reconstructing glacier front positions in the recent past.</p>","author":"Corentin Guilhermic, \nMaria Pia Nardelli, \nAurélia Mouret, \nAntonio Pusceddu, \nAgnès Baltzer, \nHélène Howa","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"74af78ccf7bad941cac62fa19205dde7a1f07db608db077f866d8d4e9bca0796","category":"Environment"}
