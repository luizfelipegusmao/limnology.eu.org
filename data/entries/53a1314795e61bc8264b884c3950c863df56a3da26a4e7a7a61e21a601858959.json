{"title":"Detection of Different Lemon Pre-Harvest Additive Treatments by Means an Electronic Nose Prototype","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0679/v1","date":1718096251000,"content":"This study was carried out with a low-cost electronic nose prototype based on eight metal oxide sensors (MQ) in order to characterize samples of lemons treated with 0.5% and 0.1% of sodium benzoate. The MQ sensors designed are sensitive to one or more chemicals to detect the presence of a variety of chemicals in the air. The sensor MQ135 detects ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and benzene. Signal data were studied to obtain a pattern recognition of rotten in lemon fruits. Network analysis was used to obtain a calibration of measures among the stage of lemons. In this article, an electronic nose prototype based on 8 MQ metal oxide sensors has been used in order to analyze and characterize different lemon varieties to which different chemical treatments have been applied in pre-harvest. PCA-based data analyzes were used to observe clusters in the data. Through the combined use of the data obtained by the nose and these Sequential Neural Networks (SNNs) a classification tool for lemon varieties and applied treatments has been obtained. It is shown the ability of this device to be used as a reliable discrimination method, in addition to providing low cost and optimization of time and expert resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53a1314795e61bc8264b884c3950c863df56a3da26a4e7a7a61e21a601858959","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
