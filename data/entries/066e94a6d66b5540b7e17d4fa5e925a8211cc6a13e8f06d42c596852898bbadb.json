{"title":"A First Model Foundation Design of Wood Pillar in Banjarmasin Swampland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1720/v1","date":1721667363000,"content":"Swampy land in Banjarmasin has special characteristics for building house constructions. The foundation for very low soil bearing capacity requires special treatment as well. Many building collapses are caused by foundation failures due to mismatched building loads and foundation functions, as well as construction material errors. The need for house design follows the development of building functions. Nowadays, a one-story house is no longer sufficient due to limited land. The need to elevate houses to two stories or to develop houses (renovations) often leads to foundation construction errors. The commonly used foundation, wooden pile foundation, has limited load-bearing capacity, necessitating modification steps in the form of foundation reinforcement. Several steps, including material combinations or combinations of various types of foundations, can be implemented. Therefore, a specific model is required to obtain a foundation design that can accommodate construction needs. The aim of the research is to create a foundation design model capable of reinforcing wooden pile foundations for both house construction development and as a reference for building one-story and two-story houses. In this research, field observations will be conducted at various house construction sites in Banjarmasin, both residential and individual objects. Data will be presented descriptively and analyzed to obtain an applicable model as a reference for house construction on swampy land. The model will provide an applicable depiction and will be tested against foundation construction implementation methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"066e94a6d66b5540b7e17d4fa5e925a8211cc6a13e8f06d42c596852898bbadb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
