{"title":"Identifying meta-research with researchers as study subjects: Protocol for a scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303905","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Gregory Laynor, Elizabeth R. Stevens</p>\r\nBackground <p>Meta-research in which researchers are the study subjects can illuminate how to better support researchers and enhance the development of research capacity. Comprehensively compiling the literature in this area can help define best practices for research capacity development and reveal gaps in the literature. However, there are challenges to assessing and synthesizing the breadth of the meta-research literature produced.</p> Methods <p>In this article, we discuss the current barriers to conducting literature reviews on meta-research and strategies to address these barriers. We then outline proposed methods for conducting a scoping review on meta-research with researchers as study subjects.</p> Discussion <p>Due to its interdisciplinary nature, broad scope, and difficult to pinpoint terminology, little is known about the state of meta-research with researchers as the study subjects. For this reason, there is a need for a scoping review that will identify research performed in which researchers were the study subjects.</p>","author":"Gregory Laynor","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"48fdec9548081b506d40646b1870482a19272699f2b4064223491b2cda48d5b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
