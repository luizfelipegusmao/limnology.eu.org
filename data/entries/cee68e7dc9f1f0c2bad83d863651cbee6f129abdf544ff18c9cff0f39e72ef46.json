{"title":"Khat consumption and undernutrition among adult population in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299538","date":1713880800000,"content":"<p>by Abdu Oumer</p>\r\nBackground <p>In Ethiopia, malnutrition is a public health threat causing a significant burden of morbidity, mortality, and economic crisis. Simultaneously, khat consumption is alarmingly increasing among adults, yet it might contribute to the existing burden of malnutrition, where the current evidence is inconclusive. Hence, this review was to estimate the association between khat consumption and undernutrition among adults in Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A comprehensive search for Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed, coupled with a thorough manual search of the literature, was done up to date, October 18, 2023, using relevant search terms: “impact,\" \"effects,\" “khat chewing,\" “khat consumption,\" \"Ethiopia,\" “nutritional status,\" and \"undernutrition.\" An updated PRISMA guideline was used to select relevant literature. The extracted data was summarized in narrative summaries, descriptions, and meta-analyses. The risk of bias was assessed. The results are presented in forest plots and funnel plots to assess publication bias. A pooled effect size (odds ratio) with a 95% certainty level was reported.</p> Results <p>While a total of 17 articles (n = 45,679) were included in the narrative review, only 15 articles were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. The majority of studies had a low and moderate risk of bias (based on risk of bias assessment tool), mainly due to unclear exposure assessment and high study heterogeneity. A total of 11 studies were cross-sectional studies (71%), three were comparative studies (17.4%), and three were case control studies (17.4%). There is a higher risk of publication bias as evidenced by the funnel plot. Overall, five studies were from the Oromia region, and three studies were conducted at the national level. Overall, chewing had been shown to significantly increase the risk of undernutrition by 53% (pooled OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.09–2.16) under a random effect model. Under the fixed effect model, higher weight was given to national-level studies with higher samples, where chewing contributed to a 12% increased risk of undernutrition (AOR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01–2.23). Hence, khat chewing could raise the odds of undernutrition by 12–53%.</p> Conclusion <p>There is evidence of an association between khat chewing and an increased risk of undernutrition among adults in Ethiopia, which highlights the need for public health interventions to address the potential adverse effects of khat chewing on nutritional status.</p>","author":"Abdu Oumer","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cee68e7dc9f1f0c2bad83d863651cbee6f129abdf544ff18c9cff0f39e72ef46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
