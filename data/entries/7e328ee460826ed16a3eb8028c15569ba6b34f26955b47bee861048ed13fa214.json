{"title":"The Interlinking Metabolic Association between Type 2 Diabetes and Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1919/v2","date":1724834750000,"content":"Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cancer share common risk factors including obesity, in-flammation, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia. High insulin levels activate PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway promoting cancer cell growth, survival, proliferation, metastasis, and an-ti-apoptosis. The inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway for cancer remains a promising therapy, however, the combination of therapeutic inhibitors may solve the resistance to such agents. Understanding the metabolic link between diabetes and cancer can assist in improving the therapeutic strategies used for the management of cancer patients with diabetes and vice versa. This review provides an overview of shared molecular mechanisms between diabetes and cancer as well as discusses established and emerging therapeutic anti-cancer agents targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in cancer management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e328ee460826ed16a3eb8028c15569ba6b34f26955b47bee861048ed13fa214","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
