{"title":"Practical diets for California yellowtail, <i>Seriola dorsalis</i>: Use of advanced soybean meal products on growth performance, body composition, intestinal morphology, and immune gene expression","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304679","date":1717768800000,"content":"<p>by Abdulmalik A.

Allen Davis</p>\r\n\r\nCalifornia yellowtail (CYT), Seriola dorsalis, is a promising candidate for aquaculture due to its rapid growth and high-quality flesh, particularly in markets like Japan, Australia, China, and the United States. Soy protein has shown success as a replacement for marine protein sources in CYT diets, reducing fishmeal levels, though concerns about potential intestinal inflammation persist with the inclusion of solvent-extracted soybean meal. To address this, processing strategies like fractionation, enzymatic treatment, heat treatment, and microbial fermentation have been employed to mitigate the negative impacts of soybean meal on fish nutrition and immune systems. This study focuses on optimizing soybean meal inclusion levels by incorporating advanced soy variants into CYT diets. The eight-week feeding trial, conducted in a recirculation system, featured six diets with sequential inclusion levels (0, 50, 100%) of high protein low oligosaccharide soybean meal (Bright Day, Benson Hill, St Louis, MO) and enzyme-treated soybean meal (HP 300, Hamlet Protein Inc., Findlay, OH), replacing solvent-extracted soybean. The study compares these formulations against a soy-free animal protein-based diet. At the end of the trial, fish were sampled for growth performance, body proximate composition, intestinal morphology, and immune response from gut samples. Results showed consistent FCR (<i>P</i> = 0.775), weight gain (<i>P</i> = 0.242), and high survival rate (99.4 ± 0.5%) among dietary treatments (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). Histological evaluations revealed no gut inflammation and gene expression analysis demonstrated no significant variations in immune, physiological, and digestive markers <i>apn</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.687), <i>mga</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.397), <i>gpx1</i> (P = 0.279), <i>atpase</i> (P = 0.590), <i>il1β</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.659). The study concludes that incorporating advanced soybean meal products, replacing up to 20% of fishmeal does not negatively affect CYT’s growth and intestinal health. This suggests that all three soy sources, contributing 35% of total protein (15.4 g 100 g<sup>-1</sup> diet), can be included in practical diets without compromising CYT’s intestinal integrity or growth. These findings have positive implications for the commercial production of CYT and future research on the incorporation of plant-based proteins in aquaculture diets.","author":"Abdulmalik A.
