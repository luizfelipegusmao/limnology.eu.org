{"title":"Research on Influencing Factors of College Students&rsquo; Leadership: A Systematic Review of the Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0177/v1","date":1727867693000,"content":"Leadership is an important driving force in the process of college students' self-improvement and development, and improving college students' self-leadership is conducive to improving their comprehensive quality and ability. Based on literature research, this paper explores the factors affecting the development of college students' leadership, and then proposes a series of ways to improve college students' leadership, so as to promote the further development of college students' leadership education. A systematic literature review method was used to conduct a systematic review of 223 articles published in peer-reviewed journals from databases such as CNKI and Web of Science. The research shows that in practice, college students' leadership is defined as a kind of personal ability and implies two presuppositions: (1) Leadership is a kind of personal behavior, and individuals have the decision-making right to exercise leadership.There is no direct causal relationship between leadership behavior and organizational positions, especially position power. The above two presuppositions are caused by the fundamental changes in the connotation of leaders in the era of knowledge economy . This research will help to deeply understand the essence and influencing factors of student leadership training, and provide theoretical and decision-making reference for schools at all levels to train student leadership.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8dd10d9c7d8297ea62f78e5d01a860ae9163f69820269e533b0ec75d3d67ea8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
