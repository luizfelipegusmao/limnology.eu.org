{"title":"Energy Consumption of Electric Vehicles in Europe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1974/v1","date":1719533772000,"content":"With firm commitment to energy labelling, it is not a question of if but only of when the European Union will introduce an energy label for electric cars. To support such policy efforts, we conducted a scoping analysis of energy consumption and efficiency trade-offs for 342 electric car models sold in Europe. The results suggest that certified and real-world energy consumption average 19 ± 4 kWh/100 km and 21 ± 4 kWh/100 km, translating into drive ranges of 440 ± 120 km and 380 ± 110 km, respectively. Energy consumption is correlated with vehicle mass, frontal area, and battery capacity, but less so with rated power and vehicle price. Each 100 kg of vehicle mass and 0.1 m2 of frontal area tend to increase energy consumption by 0.20 ± 0.06 kWh/100 km and 0.72 ± 0.05 kWh/100 km. Raising battery capacity by 10 kWh increases vehicle mass by 145 kg, energy consumption by 0.6 kWh/100 km, and drive range by 45 km. Efficient vehicles are available at any price but drive range has a cost. Our findings point to considerable efficiency trade-offs that could be tapped by a dedicated energy label. We propose several options for categorizing vehicles on an efficiency scale from A to G, with and without additional utility parameters. Our analysis provides rationale for energy labelling of electric cars in Europe and could inspire similar analyses for other vehicle categories such as e-scooters, lightweight three- and four-wheelers, e-busses, e-trucks, and electric non-road machinery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"804642fe442d76ced5e5d63c6b937ed4f5e900c02e86f26da8beef448732b57a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
