{"title":"Sustainability Assessment of Machinery Safety in a Manufacturing Organisation &ndash; Supporting Machinery Safety Decision Making with AHP and CART Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0868/v1","date":1710427759000,"content":"Machine safety is not only a prerequisite for successful production, but also the foundation for sustainability and growth of any manufacturing organisation. The latest approaches in this rapidly developing field are the integration of effective risk management tools and strategies into occupational health and safety (OHS) systems. In this article, using a specific example from practice, we will show how using multi-criteria decision making (AHP) support Machinery Safety Decision Making (MSDM) from the point of reducing losses. Using Classification and Regression Tree Analysis (CART), we estimated the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and thus the sustainability level of the relevant safety measures. These were proposed risk reduction measures that typically raised uncertainty among managers regarding the estimation of cost-effectiveness. The advantage of application decision trees approach is possibility to identify and establish relatively homogeneous groups of undesirable events and their impact on the organisation's objectives. A comprehensive model has been developed to support management decision making in manufacturing organizations in implementing and improving safety measures in line with manufacturing sustainability goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3311d00879631558c6f92f626e175ef3e09c6b607a20a2ad2dcb1cbef8befb0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
