{"title":"UV-A Supplementation in Plant Factory with Artificial Lighting Improves Growth, Photosynthesis, and Phytonutrients in Kale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0470/v1","date":1717985203000,"content":"UV-A (315–400 nm) is a component of solar radiation impacting plant physiology. Consequently, the impact was investigated of UV-A supplementation on various aspects of kale cultivation in a plant factory with artificial lighting. Three UV-A intensity treatments (5, 10, or 15 W/m2) were applied to kale plants for 5 days before harvesting. The results revealed that 5 or 10 W/m2 UV-A supplementation provided significant advantages for kale growth. The fresh weight of the kale shoots increased by over 35–50% after UV-A exposure. In particular, the 10 W/m2 UV-A exposure significantly improved the photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency and quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Y(II)). In addition, the treatment with UV-A positively impacted changes in leaf spectral indices, resulting in decreases in the simple ratio index (SR), the nor-malized phaeophytinization index (NPQI), and the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE). Furthermore, the phytonutrients in kale (vitamin C, soluble protein, and total phenolics) were enhanced using the 10 W/m2 UV-A treatment. One notable outcome was the consistent reduction in nitrate contents across all UV-A treatment intensities. Therefore, supplementing kale cultiva-tion with UV-A radiation was a valuable strategy for enhancing kale yield and quality in plant factory production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"867035b8b9bc4479a8663957029e310e5d477fd5c3c79dc244ada400a6416ab3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
