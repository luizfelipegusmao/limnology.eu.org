{"title":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes as a Neuroregeneration Treatment for Alzheimer&#039;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0229/v1","date":1722914417000,"content":"Background: Neuroprotective and immunomodulatory microRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural growth factors, and anti-inflammatory cytokines are contained in nano-sized extracellular vesicles called mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exo). These vesicles attenuate neuro-inflammation, promote neo-vascularization, induce neurogenesis, and decrease the apoptotic loss of neural cells.\nMethods: Systematic retrieval of information was performed on PubMed. 60 articles were found in a search on Mesenchymal Stem Cell, Exosomes, and Alzheimer's Disease. These 2 articles were Meta-analyses, Randomized Controlled Trials, clinical trials, and Systematic Reviews. The rest were Literature review articles. These articles were till the year 2024. Appropriate studies were isolated, and important information from each of them was understood and entered into a database from which the information was used in this article. The clinical trials on Mesenchymal Stem Cell Exosomes for Alzheimer's Disease were searched on clinicaltrials.gov.\nResults: Several experimental investigations have shown that MSC-Exo improves cognitive im-pairment in rats. In this review paper, we summarized existing understanding regarding the molecular and cellular pathways behind MSC-Exo-based cognitive function restoration, with a focus on MSC-Exos therapeutic potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. \nConclusion: AD is a significant health issue in our culture and is linked to several important neuropathological characteristics. Exosomes generated from stem cells, such as MSCs or NSCs, have been examined more and more in a variety of AD models, indicating that they may be viable therapeutic agents for the treatment of diverse disorders. Exosome yields may be increased and their therapeutic efficacy can be improved using a range of tailored techniques and culture conditions. It is necessary to provide standardized guidelines for exosome manufacture to carry out excellent preclinical and clinical research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"667ee91fe712054038412f30391c0ceba94216dccf07ffff95f7b142a7da59f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
