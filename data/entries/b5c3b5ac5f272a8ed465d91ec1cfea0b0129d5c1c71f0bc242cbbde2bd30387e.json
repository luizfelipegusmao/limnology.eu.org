{"title":"Vitamin C Improves Oocyte In Vitro Maturation and Embryo Development in Cattle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0503/v1","date":1717763465000,"content":"Abstract: To obtain bovine oocytes in high quality, effects of vitamin C (VC) on in vitro maturation (IVM) of bovine oocytes and early embryo development were investigated. The results showed that: 1) The IVM medium containing 50 µg/mL VC improved the oocyte maturation rate, while no effects on the development of parthenogenetic embryos; 2) The in vitro culture (IVC) medium containing 20 µg/mL VC increased the cleavage rate of the in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos, enhanced the mRNA levels of pluripotency gene Oct4, Sox2, Cdx2 and Nanog in the blastocysts, but no effect on the blastocyst rate; 3) Combing supplemention of 50 µg/mL in IVM medium + 20 µg/ml VC in IVC medium (VC 50/20) increased the cleavage rate of IVF embryos and enhanced the mRNA levels of Oct4, Sox2, Cdx2 and Nanog in the blastocysts; 4) Combination of VC 0/20 and VC 50/20 enhanced the expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and VC 50/0 weakened the expression of pro-apoptotic gene Bax, while VC 0/40 and VC 0/60 increased Bax expression and decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in blastocysts. Together, VC supplementation at tuned concentration as well its combination in IVM and IVC media improves the developmental rates of bovine oocytes and embryos.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5c3b5ac5f272a8ed465d91ec1cfea0b0129d5c1c71f0bc242cbbde2bd30387e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
