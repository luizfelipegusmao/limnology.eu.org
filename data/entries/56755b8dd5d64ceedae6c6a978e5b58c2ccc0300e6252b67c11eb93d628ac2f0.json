{"title":"Redundant Space Manipulator Autonomous Guidance for In-Orbit Servicing via Deep Reinforcement Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0329/v1","date":1712244509000,"content":"The application of space robotic manipulators and heightened autonomy for ios represents a paramount pursuit for leading space agencies, given the substantial threat posed by space debris to operational satellites and forthcoming space endeavors. This work presents a guidance algorithm based on drl to solve for the space manipulator path-planning during the motion synchronization phase with the mission target. The goal is the trajectory generation and control of a spacecraft equipped with a 7-dof robotic manipulator, such that its end effector remains stationary with respect to the target point of capture. The ppo drl algorithm is used to optimize the manipulatorâ€™s guidance law, and the autonomous agent generates the desired joints rates of the robotic arm, which are then integrated and passed to a model-based feedback linearization controller. The agent is first trained to optimize its guidance policy and then tested extensively to validate the results against a simulated environment representing the motion synchronization scenario of an ios mission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56755b8dd5d64ceedae6c6a978e5b58c2ccc0300e6252b67c11eb93d628ac2f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
