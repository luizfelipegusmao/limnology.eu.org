Herein, we designed functional wooden window with the unique ability to photocatalytically degrade indoor pollutants, specifically urea. The transparent wooden window has been prepared via one-pot hydrothermal polymerization on a chemical-treated wood in order to incorporate resorcinol–formaldehyde. A hybrid wood denoted as resorcinol–formaldehyde-wood composite capable of photocatalytically degrading urea has been obtained. Mechanism study shows that the urea is degraded on composite interface via the as-formed hydroxyl radicals (·OH) generated from hydrogen peroxide. Further employing a large-scale (150 mm × 200 mm) resorcinol–formaldehyde-wood window for control of toilet urea pollution, a 100% urea removal efficiency was achieved in less than one hour.   </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"db332b3862d844f5e4aca0f8f4a25d4a3593b83f092304115e1c67cdb78d6dac","category":"Environment"}
