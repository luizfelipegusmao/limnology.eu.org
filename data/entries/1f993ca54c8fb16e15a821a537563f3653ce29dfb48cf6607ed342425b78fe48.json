{"title":"Risk factors affecting spinal fusion: A meta-analysis of 39 cohort studies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304473","date":1717768800000,"content":"<p>by Shudong Yang, Beijun Zhou, Jiaxuan Mo, Ruidi He, Kunbo Mei, Zhi Zeng, Gaigai Yang, Yuwei Chen, Mingjiang Luo, Siliang Tang, Zhihong Xiao</p>\r\nPurpose <p>We performed a meta-analysis to identify risk factors affecting spinal fusion.</p> Methods <p>We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 6, 2023, for articles that report risk factors affecting spinal fusion. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using fixed-effects models for each factor for which the interstudy heterogeneity I<sup>2</sup> was &lt; 50%, while random-effects models were used when the interstudy heterogeneity I<sup>2</sup> was ≥ 50%. Using sample size, Egger’s P value, and heterogeneity across studies as criteria, we categorized the quality of evidence from observational studies as high-quality (Class I), moderate-quality (Class II or III), or low-quality (Class IV). Furthermore, the trim-and-fill procedure and leave-one-out protocol were conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and verify result stability.</p> Results <p>Of the 1,257 citations screened, 39 unique cohort studies comprising 7,145 patients were included in the data synthesis. High-quality (Class I) evidence showed that patients with a smoking habit (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.21) and without the use of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 3.33 to 5.86) were at higher risk for fusion failure. Moderate-quality (Class II or III) evidence showed that fusion failure was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.90), diabetes (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.59 to 7.36), allograft (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.96), conventional pedicle screw (CPS) fixation (OR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.23 to 10.20) and posterolateral fusion (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.25 to 10.49).</p> Conclusions <p>Conspicuous risk factors affecting spinal fusion include three patient-related risk factors (smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and diabetes) and four surgery-related risk factors (without the use of BMP-2, allograft, CPS fixation, and posterolateral fusion). These findings may help clinicians strengthen awareness for early intervention in patients at high risk of developing fusion failure.</p>","author":"Shudong Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1f993ca54c8fb16e15a821a537563f3653ce29dfb48cf6607ed342425b78fe48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
