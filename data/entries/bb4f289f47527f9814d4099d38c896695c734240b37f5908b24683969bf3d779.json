{"title":"Associations between Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Timed Up and Go Test in Elderly Participants of Public Physical Activity Programs: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0169/v1","date":1717495243000,"content":"Indices such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC) and Waist to Height Ratio (WHtR) have emerged as tools to assess cardiovascular risks associated with abdominal obesity. The Timed Up and Go Test (TTUG) assesses mobility and the risk of falls, especially in the elderly and individuals with physical limitations. Objective: To correlate anthropometric indicators of cardiovascular risk (BMI, WC, WHtR) and performance in the TTUG in elderly people who practice physical activity. Methods: Cross-sectional study, CAAE: 27116319.1.0000.8044, elderly people, both sexes, average age 68 years. Anthropometric data was collected: BMI, WC, WHtR and TUG test results. Results: Average values: weight (67.8 ± 12.7 kg), height (157.2 ± 8.4 cm), TTUG (10.3 ± 2.5 26 seconds), WC (93.3 ± 10.9 cm), waist-to-height ratio (0.59) and BMI (27.4 ± 4.4): Correlations between 27 TTUG and age (r = -0.086, p = 0.683), TTUG and BMI (r = 0.29, p = 0.892) WC and WHtR (r = 0.927, p 28 &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study revealed correlations between anthropometric indicators of cardio vascular risk (BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio) and performance in the TUG test in the elderly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb4f289f47527f9814d4099d38c896695c734240b37f5908b24683969bf3d779","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
