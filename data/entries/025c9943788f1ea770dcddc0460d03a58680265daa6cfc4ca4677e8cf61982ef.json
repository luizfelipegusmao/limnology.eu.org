{"title":"LiDAR Technology for UAV Detection: From Fundamentals and Operational Principles to Advanced Detection and Classification Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1344/v1","date":1729146713000,"content":"As UAVs are increasingly employed across various industries, the demand for robust and accurate detection has become crucial. LiDAR has developed as a vital sensor technology because to its ability to offer rich 3D spatial information, particularly in applications such as security and airspace monitoring. This review systematically explores recent innovations in LiDAR-based drone detection, deeply focusing on the principle and components of LiDAR sensor, its classifications based on different parameters and scanning mechanisms, as well as the approaches for processing LiDAR data. The review briefly compares several deep learning approaches, including point-based, voxel-based, and hybrid models, that have improved drone detection, tracking, and classification. We also explore the integration of multi-modal sensor fusion, which combines LiDAR data with other complimentary modalities to improve UAV detection and tracking in complex environments such as GNSS-denied zones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"025c9943788f1ea770dcddc0460d03a58680265daa6cfc4ca4677e8cf61982ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
