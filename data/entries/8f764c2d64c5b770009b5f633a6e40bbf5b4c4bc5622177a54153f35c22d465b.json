Skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials experience a topological skyrmion Hall effect, which results in a non-colinear motion of the skyrmions in a direction perpendicular to that of the electron current [<a href=\"#ozae044.501-B1\">1</a>]. This phenomenon is not desirable for spintronic devices. However, the skyrmion Hall effect is suppressed in antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials due to competing magnetic order on different sublattices [<a href=\"#ozae044.501-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.501-B3\">3</a>]. Thus, understanding the topological non-trivial spin textures in ferrimagnets is of importance. In this work, we directly visualized topological spin textures as a function of temperature and magnetic field in a ferrimagnetic Mn<sub>2-x</sub>Zn<sub>x</sub>Sb (x=0.85) crystal by using cryogenic Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) and magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy. The crystal structure was also studied at high-resolution using scanning TEM (STEM) high-angle annular dark field (HAADF).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8f764c2d64c5b770009b5f633a6e40bbf5b4c4bc5622177a54153f35c22d465b","category":"Environment"}
