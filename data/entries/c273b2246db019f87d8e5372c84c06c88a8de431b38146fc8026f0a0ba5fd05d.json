{"title":"TruckSim-based study of the rollover accident mechanisms of container semitrailers on freeway interchange loop ramps","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309139","date":1725458400000,"content":"<p>by Shibo Zhang, Xuefeng Yang, Yishan Liu, Li Wang, Pingfei Li, Hui Li, Yong Luo, Yi Li, Qiaoyuan Liu</p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, to investigate the factors affecting container semitrailer rollovers while driving on interchange loop ramps, a simulation model was established in TruckSim on the basis of data collected from an in-depth investigation of the vehicle, road, and driving behaviors in a real accident. The established model was validated by reproducing the accident in a simulation. The effects of vehicle speed, the height of the cargo’s center of gravity, tractor-semitrailer interactions, and the radius of the circular curve on container semitrailer rollover were investigated using the established model. The results reveal that if the height of the container semitrailer is within the limits in Chinese standards and the container semitrailer is moving at a speed of less than 45.3 km/h, it can safely travel through a loop ramp with a circular curve radius of 60 m. The height of the cargo’s center of gravity and the lateral load transfer ratio have a negative relationship, and a higher center of gravity reduces the safe speed for a container semitrailer traveling through a loop ramp. During rollover, the rear axle of the semitrailer first begins to roll over and then drives the tractor to overturn.","author":"Shibo Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c273b2246db019f87d8e5372c84c06c88a8de431b38146fc8026f0a0ba5fd05d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
