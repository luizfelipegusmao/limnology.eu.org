{"title":"Floodplain Restoration and Its Effects on Summer Water Temperature and Macroinvertebrates in Whychus Creek, Oregon (USA)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4383?af=R","date":1727081255000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Stream restoration is a proposed climate adaptation tool; however, outcomes of floodplain restoration on stream temperature have been debated. Despite a growing number of studies that investigated water temperature in restored streams, few have quantified temperature variations in new habitat types created by restored hydrogeomorphic processes to explore the effects on aquatic macroinvertebrates. We evaluated the hypotheses: (1) restoration increases habitat diversity, (2) habitat diversity increases water temperature variability, and (3) restoration increases the diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblage and temperature associations. In August 2021, we collected environmental data to describe the aquatic habitats, water temperature and quality (continuous and discrete), and macroinvertebrates in 40 riffle, pool, and off-channel sites in a stream being restored, Whychus Creek, Oregon, USA. Our study is a site comparison of three reachesâ€”one restored in 2012, another restored in 2016, and an unrestored (control) that will soon undergo restoration. Evaluations of the hypotheses show: (1) Habitat diversity in restored reaches is effectively three types of aquatic habitats versus only one in the control (riffles), (2) water temperature variability in habitats created by restoration (off-channel) is high and low, and suggest a range of hyporheic connectivity and flow paths are present, and (3) restoration created a different macroinvertebrate assemblage, with 16 additional taxa in off-channel habitats, and the range in macroinvertebrate thermal optima is approximately doubled when off-channel macroinvertebrate thermal optima are accounted for. Our results support the idea that floodplain restoration creates more diverse thermal conditions and different macroinvertebrate communities in restored stream reaches.</p>","author":"Wesley N.
