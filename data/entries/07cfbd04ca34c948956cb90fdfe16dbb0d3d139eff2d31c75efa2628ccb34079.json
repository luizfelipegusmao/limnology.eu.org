{"title":"An Itch under the DRESS: A Vancomycin-Evoked Presentation in a Patient with Multiple Comorbidities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1578/v1","date":1721369721000,"content":"A 70-year-old female with a significant medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic back pain, and a left hip prosthetic joint infection experienced complications following a total hip replacement. After multiple revisions and eventual discharge to a rehabilitation facility, she developed surgical site bleeding and a femoral head dislocation extending into the pelvis. At our hospital, imaging revealed a failed hip arthroplasty with extensive damage and infection, necessitating complex revision surgery and an antibiotic regimen. During her treatment, she developed a diffuse rash diagnosed as vancomycin-induced hypersensitivity reaction (DRESS), prompting a switch to oral linezolid and systemic corticosteroids. Despite transient eosinophilia and elevated inflammatory markers, her condition stabilized, and she was discharged with instructions for follow-up. This case underscores the importance of vigilant monitoring and timely intervention in managing complex postoperative infections and drug reactions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07cfbd04ca34c948956cb90fdfe16dbb0d3d139eff2d31c75efa2628ccb34079","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
