{"title":"Revealing the Ultrastructure and Intracellular Distributions of Secretory Granules in Malignant Human Mast Cells by Volume Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.477/7719843?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The human mast cell-1 (HMC-1) cell line was established from a patient with mast cell leukemia and is the first established continuously growing HMC line which has been widely employed for <span>in vitro</span> studies of human mast cell biology. HMC-1 has been further subcloned into two sublines: HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2, having one point and two-point mutations in the protooncogene <span>c-kit,</span> respectively. It has been hypothesized that these specific mutations in <span>c-kit</span> are associated with changes in granule biogenesis except for the phenotype and cellular growth rate [<a href=\"#ozae044.477-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.477-B2\">2</a>]. In our previous study, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrography of ultra-thin sections showed that the secretory granules in the two sublines of resting HMC-1 cells have different ultrastructures. And the structural evolution of granules in HMC-1.2 is prominent upon drug treatment with sodium butyrate [<a href=\"#ozae044.477-B2\">2</a>]. However, individual 2D images of cell thin sections couldnâ€™t give a full picture of differences in terms of granular distribution, content density or ultrastructures. It is therefore necessary to develop approaches that can better distinguish changes in granule using more robust techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bf3d212214a8fbbca09a1bb478e42c02bbf982dc8ae653f8d297a4cfa38e6315","category":"Environment"}
