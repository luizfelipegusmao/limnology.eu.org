{"title":"Development of a Three-Dimensional Inversion Program for Magnetotellurics Using Finite Volume and Adjoint State Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2236/v3","date":1729597337000,"content":"The finite volume method (FVM) is a kind of numerical analysis method that is simple and can take into account the topography as the finite element method (FEM). The adjoint state method (ASM) can easily and efficiently calculate the gradient vector of the objective function for the inversion. We developed a program to apply these methods to 3-D Magnetotelluric (MT) inversion and verified it using test models. In the forward modelling, it was confirmed that the program could perform analysis properly and efficiently considering topography and subsurface resistivity heterogeneity. Furthermore, we conducted the inversion using a synthetic open dataset and could reconstruct the true model of the dataset. The comparison with the previous work revealed that the computation time was comparable in spite of the fact that we calculated without MPI implementation, which the previous work used.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47d042c1ccfc99093839abbe1d4abd68e6f946b966fdc51cc5b87923ba235b7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
