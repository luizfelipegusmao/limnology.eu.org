{"title":"Bacillus lumedeirus sp. nov., a Gram-Positive Spore-Forming Rod Isolated from a Pharmaceutical Facility Production Environment and Added to the MALDI Biotyper&reg; Database","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1745/v1","date":1729764356000,"content":"A Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped and spore forming bacterium strain designation B190/17, was isolated from an air monitoring sample of a Brazilian immunobiological production facility in 2017. The strain was not identifiable by biochemical methodology VITEK® 2 or by MALDI-TOF MS with VITEK® MS RUO and MALDI Biotyper®. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed 98.51% similarity with Bacillus wudalianchiensis FJAT 27215T, 98.28% with ‘Bacillus aerolatus’ CX 253T, 97.96% with Bacillus badius MTCC 1458T, 97.63% with Bacillus xiapuensis FJAT 46582T and 97.21% with Bacillus thermotolerans SGZ8T. Biochemical data showed the strain was alanine arylamidase, Ala-Phe-Pro arylamidase, ELLMAN, leucine arylamidase, phenyalanine arylamidase and tyrosine arylamidase positive. The genomic DNA G+C% content of B190/17 was 41.6 mol%. The phylogenetic, genomic taxonomy and biochemical tests suggested that B190/17 represents a novel species and should be classified as the type strain of a novel Bacillus species. The name Bacillus lumedeirus sp. nov. is proposed. After characterization, B190/17 was added to the MALDI Biotyper® database as Bacillus lumedeirus sp. nov.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe35138dd6fccc646899e8b74ce670a8f38e589f6105a21cefafda489d2f4252","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
