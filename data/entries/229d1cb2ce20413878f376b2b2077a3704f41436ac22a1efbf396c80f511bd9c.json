{"title":"Comparative Review Study of Modular Construction with Traditional On-site Construction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0301/v1","date":1717594407000,"content":"With the increase in technological advancements, architects and engineers over the past couple of decades have been trying to achieve high efficiency within construction projects. Their goals also include reducing global warming effects from construction and building new construction faster for the growing population in urban cities. This requires using a construction method that is less harmful to the environment and faster than other traditional methods. Modular construction, also known as modular construction, is the method that has the potential to make this happen. This review paper discusses what modular construction is and how it is different from the traditional on-site construction. Environmental impacts of using modular construction and what leads to it being more efficient and faster than on-site construction. The study doesnâ€™t suggest that modular construction is the solution to all the problems being faced in the construction industry today, but it is a potential solution that if used in the right situation and correct manner, can have a huge positive impact on the construction industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"229d1cb2ce20413878f376b2b2077a3704f41436ac22a1efbf396c80f511bd9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
