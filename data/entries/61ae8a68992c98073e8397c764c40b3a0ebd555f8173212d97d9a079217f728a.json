{"title":"Rosetta gen. nov. (Chlorophyta): Resolving the identity of red snow algal rosettes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13438?af=R","date":1712751025000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Thick-walled rosette-like snow algae were long thought to be a life stage of various other species of snow algae. Rosette-like cells have not been cultured, but by manually isolating cells from 38 field samples in southern British Columbia, we assigned a variety of rosette morphologies to DNA sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of Rubisco large-subunit (<i>rbc</i>L) gene, ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rRNA region, and 18S rRNA gene revealed that the rosette-like cells form a new clade within the phylogroup Chloromonadinia. Based on these data, we designate a new genus, <i>Rosetta</i>, which comprises five novel species: <i>R. castellata</i>, <i>R. floranivea</i>, <i>R. stellaria</i>, <i>R. rubriterra</i>, and <i>R. papavera</i>. In a survey of 762 snow samples from British Columbia, we observed <i>R. floranivea</i> exclusively on snow overlying high-elevation glaciers, whereas <i>R. castellata</i> was observed at lower elevations, near the tree line. The other three species were rarely observed. Spherical red cells enveloped in a thin translucent sac were conspecific with <i>Rosetta</i>, possibly a developmental stage. These results highlight the unexplored diversity among snow algae and emphasize the utility of single-cell isolation to advance the centuries-old problem of disentangling life stages and cryptic species.</p>","author":"Casey B.
