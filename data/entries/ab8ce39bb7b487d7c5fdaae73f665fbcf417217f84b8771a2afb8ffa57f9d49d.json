{"title":"Incremental Nonlinear Dynamics Inversion and Incremental Backstepping: Experimental Attitude Control of a Tail-sitter UAV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0614/v1","date":1715265725000,"content":"Incremental control strategies provide undeniable advantages for controlling Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) due to their reduced model dependency and accurate tracking capacities. This is of particular relevance for hybrid UAVs, specially for tail-sitters, which perform complex manoeuvres when transitioning to and from aerodynamic flight. This paper summarizes the research undertaken in the application of the Incremental Nonlinear Dynamics Inversion (INDI) and Incremental Backstepping (IBKS) to a small tail-sitter UAV. After the application of these control strategies in a simulated scenario, the implementation in a Micro-Controller Unit was validated in a Hardware-in-the-Loop scenario. Following such validation, indoor experimental trials were undertaken in order to evaluate the capacity of these controllers to stabilize and control the real aircraft. The stabilization in the flight trials was successfully implemented and allow to conclude that both INDI and IBKS are control strategies suited to control a tail-sitter in vertical flight, providing accurate tracking capabilities under smooth actuation. Furthermore, it was found that the IBKS is significantly more computationally demanding than the INDI, although having a global proof of stability that is of interest in aircraft control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab8ce39bb7b487d7c5fdaae73f665fbcf417217f84b8771a2afb8ffa57f9d49d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
