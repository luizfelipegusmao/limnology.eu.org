{"title":"Formulating a road map for decarbonization in United States via resource efficiency, renewable energy, and globalization: Evidence from time‐frequency‐quantile approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12571?af=R","date":1729335221000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Renewable energy, resource efficiency, and globalization are recognized as pivotal factors in the pursuit of environmental sustainability. This study's novelty lies in examining the impact of resource efficiency, the influence of globalization, and the adoption of renewable energy sources on energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the United States spanning the years from 1990 to 2020 is the focus of this study. Additionally, this investigation leveraged a diverse range of time-frequency-quantile techniques, encompassing quantile-on-quantile regressions, wavelet coherence, cross quantile coherence, wavelet-based quantile correlation, and quantile regression, which is an additional novel aspect of this study. The findings of this research indicate that resource efficiency, the utilization of renewable energy sources, and the forces of globalization collectively contribute to enhancing ecological sustainability by reducing energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> in the United States across a range of quantiles, time periods, and temporal contexts. The study posits that these findings offer a comprehensive framework that can guide policymakers in the United States toward taking tangible measures to advance ecological sustainability while curbing energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>","author":"Abraham Ayobamiji Awosusi, \nOktay Özkan, \nZahoor Ahmed, \nDemet Eroğlu Sevinç, \nTomiwa Sunday Adebayo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"68b8b799ab0036f5b4a0ed134af8359397481528d9ff9cbff883fb27528c047e","category":"Environment"}
