{"title":"Artificial Intelligence‚ÄêEnabled Metaverse for Sustainable Smart Cities: Technologies, Applications, Challenges and Future Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0465/v1","date":1728298682000,"content":"In recent years, rapid urbanization has intensified the need for sustainable solutions to address growing demands on urban infrastructure, climate change, and resource constraints. As smart cities strive to enhance citizen experiences by improving infrastructure, increasing accessibility, and accelerating economic growth, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Metaverse offer transformative potential for developing sustainable urban environments. However, integrating AI with the Metaverse for sustainable smart city development remains underexplored amid data management and processing challenges, privacy, security, and technological integration. This study addresses this gap by reviewing advancements in AI and its role within the Metaverse's architecture in smart cities. It explores how AI enables data analysis, enhances user experiences through computer vision and natural language processing, optimizes connectivity with 6G and Edge AI, strengthens security through blockchain, and manages the creation of digital twins. Through a comprehensive analysis of peer-reviewed publications and research projects, the review investigates how AI is integrated into key technologies to realize the Metaverse for sustainable smart cities. Specific applications in smart environments, mobility, energy, health, governance, and the economy are highlighted through AI-enabled use cases, offering a practical roadmap for implementing solutions to enhance citizens' quality of life, promote economic growth, and achieve sustainability. Lastly, future directions are discussed, addressing potential challenges by emphasizing interoperability and scalability and underscoring the need for robust data governance frameworks and AI ethics guidelines to address privacy, security, and ethical concerns. This approach aims to unlock the full potential of AI in enhancing the sustainability of smart cities within the Metaverse.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1aa165914bd415220e26bb879dd5325a4fdc9c127b98b70a5db5a15703057b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
