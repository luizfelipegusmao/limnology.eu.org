{"title":"Arsenic stress triggers active exudation of arsenic–phytochelatin complexes from Lupinus albus roots","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5897/7691770?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Arsenic (As) contamination of soils threatens the health of millions globally through accumulation in crops. While plants detoxify As via phytochelatin (PC) complexation and efflux of arsenite from roots, arsenite efflux mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, white lupin (<span>Lupinus albus</span>) was grown in semi-hydroponics, and exudation of glutathione (GSH) derivatives and PCs in response to As was measured using LC-MS/MS. Inhibiting synthesis of the PC precursor GSH with <span>l</span>-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or ABC transporters with vanadate drastically reduced (&gt;22%) GSH derivative and PC<sub>2</sub> exudation, but not PC<sub>3</sub> exudation. This was accompanied by As hypersensitivity in plants treated with BSO and moderate sensitivity with vanadate treatment. Investigating As–PC complexation revealed two distinct As–PC complexes, As bound to GSH and PC<sub>2</sub> (GS–As–PC<sub>2</sub>) and As bound to PC<sub>3</sub> (As–PC<sub>3</sub>), in exudates of As-treated lupin plants. Vanadate inhibited As–PC exudation, while BSO inhibited both the synthesis and exudation of As–PC complexes. These results demonstrate a role for GSH derivatives and PC exudation in lupin As tolerance and reveal As–PC exudation as a new potential mechanism contributing to active As efflux in plants. Overall, this study uncovers insights into rhizosphere As detoxification with potential to help mitigate pollution and reduce As accumulation in crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"560b91a862807e9c5c56b74987b294bed63d22613bdf8e951222207dfc05b253","category":"Environment"}
