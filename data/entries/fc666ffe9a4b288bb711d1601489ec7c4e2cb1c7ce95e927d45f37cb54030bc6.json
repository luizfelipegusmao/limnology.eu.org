{"title":"The relationship between inbound tourism and economic growth: Case of Botswana","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12290?af=R","date":1707569126000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigates the relationship between inbound tourism expansion and economic growth in Botswana, employing time series data from 1988 to 2019. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds tests and Toda and Yamamoto causality test were utilized for cointegration and direction of causality analyses, respectively. The study findings suggest and validate a tourism-led growth hypothesis (TLGH) both in the long and short run. However, inbound tourism expansion has a modest impact on the country's economic growth, which causes concern and need forÂ improvement. Therefore, the study suggests that there should be strengthening and expediting of tourism product diversification for enhanced tourism experiences and tourist spending. The tourism sector should be restructured to curb high economic and financial leakages, create strong linkages with other sectors, and adopt a mixed-price model to promote domestic tourism and local beneficiation.</p>","author":"Dandy Badimo, \nZhao Yuhuan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"fc666ffe9a4b288bb711d1601489ec7c4e2cb1c7ce95e927d45f37cb54030bc6","category":"Environment"}
