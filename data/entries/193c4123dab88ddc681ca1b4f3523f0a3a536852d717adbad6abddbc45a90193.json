{"title":"De-escalating Treatment Strategies for Patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2)-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0327/v1","date":1725504889000,"content":"Almost one fifth of breast cancer cases express Human Epidermal Growth Factor-2 (HER2), and such expression is associated with highly proliferative tumor and poor prognosis. The introduction of anti-HER2 therapies has dramatically changed the natural course of this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. However, anti-HER2 therapy can be associated with substantial toxicities, mostly cardiac, and high cost. Over the past few years, there has been growing interest in de-escalation of anti-HER2 therapies to minimize adverse events and healthcare costs, while maintaining the efficacy of treatment. Data from clinical observations and single-arm studies have eluted to the minimal impact of anti-HER2 therapy in low-risk patients, like those with node-negative and small tumors. Though single-arm, the APT trial, in which patients with node-negative, small tumors received single-agent paclitaxel for 12 cycles plus trastuzumab for 1 year, was a practice-changing study. Several other recently published studies, like the PERSEPHONE trial, have shown more convincing data that 6 months of trastuzumab is not inferior to 12 months, in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), suggesting that de-escalating strategies with shorter treatment may be appropriate for some low-risk patients. Other de-escalating strategies involved adaptive, response-directed approach, and personalized therapy that depends on tumor genomic profiling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"193c4123dab88ddc681ca1b4f3523f0a3a536852d717adbad6abddbc45a90193","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
