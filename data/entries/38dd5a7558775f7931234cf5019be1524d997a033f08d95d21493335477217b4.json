{"title":"Analyzing the Impact of Ephemerality on the Migration of Users from Conventional to Ephemeral Online Social Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0802/v1","date":1728559592000,"content":"The rise in popularity of online social networks has led a large number of users to share a substantial amount of personal information on these platforms. This trend has caused privacy issues and security concerns among the users since the increased availability of personal data online increases the risk of unauthorized access, identity theft, and misuse of information. In response to these concerns, the ephemeral and anonymous online social networks have emerged in recent years. Platforms like Snapchat, Signal and WhatsApp have enabled a disappearing message setting allowing users to view and share content online for a limited period of time, before its self-destruction. The shift towards ephemeral social networks marks a new development in social media usage. Despite introducing this new dynamic to social media, various issues such as data breaches, cyber-bullying, and misinformation persist and continue to affect both conventional and upcoming social networks adversely. In an attempt to study online social networks from an ephemerality perspective, this study, spanning a period of ten years, employs a survey based approach to compare and analyze the usage patterns of users on conventional and ephemeral social networks over the period of ten years, and seeks to determine the factors affecting the usage and eventual likelihood of users migrating from conventional online social networks to ephemeral social networking platforms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38dd5a7558775f7931234cf5019be1524d997a033f08d95d21493335477217b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
