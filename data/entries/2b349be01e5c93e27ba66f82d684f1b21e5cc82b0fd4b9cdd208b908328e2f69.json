{"title":"Are impacts of the invasive alien plant Crassula helmsii mediated by detritus? A litter experiment in a temperate pond","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05571-w","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Because of the high growth rates often achieved by invasive alien macrophytes, their establishment in recipient ecosystems may alter the abundance and composition of litter entering detrital pathways, representing a significant—but often overlooked—ecological effect of these invasions. <em>Crassula helmsii</em> (Kirk) Cockayne (New Zealand pygmyweed) is an invasive alien macrophyte, notorious for its profuse growth in invaded waterbodies. <em>C. helmsii</em> is perennial and often forms dense stands, producing abundant detritus. To investigate whether some of <em>C. helmsii’s</em> impacts are mediated by this detritus, we conducted an 85-day litterbag experiment comparing decomposition of <em>C. helmsii</em> with that of <em>Callitriche stagnalis</em> Scop. (water-starwort), a commonly co-occurring native macrophyte. Macroinvertebrate assemblage composition was comparable between macrophyte species throughout the experiment, but shifted as plants decayed. Litterbags were initially dominated by the invasive shredder <em>Crangonyx pseudogracilis</em> Bousfield, 1958 and later by <em>Euglesa casertana</em> (Poli, 1791), an interstitial suspension feeder. <em>C. helmsii</em> litter decomposed more slowly, with proportionally less invertebrate-mediated breakdown, but was ultimately colonised by more abundant macroinvertebrates, including more <em>C. pseudogracilis</em>. Decomposition may be slowed by <em>C. helmsii</em>’s high carbon: nitrogen ratio. These results suggest that <em>C. helmsii</em> invasion may impact macroinvertebrate assemblages via the production of long-lasting and relatively unpalatable detritus.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"2b349be01e5c93e27ba66f82d684f1b21e5cc82b0fd4b9cdd208b908328e2f69","category":"Environment"}
