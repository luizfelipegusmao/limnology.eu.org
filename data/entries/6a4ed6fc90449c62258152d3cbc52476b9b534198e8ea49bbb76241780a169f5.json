{"title":"Inhalation of particulate matter containing environmentally persistent free radicals induces endothelial dysfunction mediated via AhR activation at the air-blood interface","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/2/246/7600429?rss=1","date":1706918400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Particulate matter (PM) containing environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFR) is formed by the incomplete combustion of organic wastes, resulting in the chemisorption of pollutants to the surface of PM containing redox-active transition metals. In prior studies in mice, EPFR inhalation impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. These findings were associated with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation in the alveolar type-II (AT-II) cells that form the air-blood interface in the lung. We thus hypothesized that AhR activation in AT-II cells promotes the systemic release of mediators that promote endothelium dysfunction peripheral to the lung. To test our hypothesis, we knocked down AhR in AT-II cells of male and female mice and exposed them to 280 µg/m<sup>3</sup> EPFR lo (2.7e + 16 radicals/g) or EPFR (5.5e + 17 radicals/g) compared with filtered air for 4 h/day for 1 day or 5 days. AT-II-AhR activation-induced EPFR-mediated endothelial dysfunction, reducing endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by 59%, and <span>eNOS</span> expression by 50%. It also increased endothelin-1 mRNA levels in the lungs and peptide levels in the plasma in a paracrine fashion, along with soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and <span>iNOS</span> mRNA expression, possibly via NF-<sub>k</sub>B activation. Finally, AhR-dependent increases in antioxidant response signaling, coupled to increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine in the lungs of EPFR-exposed littermate control but not AT-II AhR KO mice suggested that ATII-specific AhR activation promotes oxidative and nitrative stress. Thus, AhR activation at the air-blood interface mediates endothelial dysfunction observed peripheral to the lung, potentially via release of systemic mediators.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"6a4ed6fc90449c62258152d3cbc52476b9b534198e8ea49bbb76241780a169f5","category":"Environment"}
