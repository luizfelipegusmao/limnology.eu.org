{"title":"Integrating Remote Sensing Image and Sea Ice Recognition for Optimal Polar Ship Path Planning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2220/v1","date":1727578611000,"content":"A large amount of sea ice exists in the polar regions, which is prone to ship-ice collisions leading to ship breakage and sinking events. Complex environmental factors pose challenges to navigation safety, and it is particularly important to perceive the polar environment and make decisions in advance. In this paper, You only look once (YOLOv5) is targeted to be optimized according to the characteristics of ice remote sensing images, which includes adding Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism, improving spatial pyramid pooling, and replacing Flexible Rectified Linear Unit (FReLU) activation function. In order to verify the effect of the optimized algorithm, ablation experiments are set up, and the accuracy of the optimized algorithm is improved by 3.5% com-pared with the original YOLOv5. Comparison experiments with other target identification algo-rithms are conducted, and the results show that the optimized YOLOv5 has higher accuracy and better robustness, and can identify small target sea ice that is difficult to identify in large-size re-mote sensing images. Polar ship path planning based on the identification results. The identifica-tion output of remote sensing ice images is used as the input for the construction of path planning maps, and raster maps corresponding to the actual polar scenes are built. Taking the path length, the number of ship turns, and the sea ice risk value as the objective function, the Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids (Theta*) algorithm is used to simulate the path planning under different sea conditions with different sea ice concentration, and a path with a shorter length, a smoother path, and a higher safety coefficient is found.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f76f71f9ab32385617577490dfa1c05bcb661eda6f8bba0e330046dd88d2b92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
