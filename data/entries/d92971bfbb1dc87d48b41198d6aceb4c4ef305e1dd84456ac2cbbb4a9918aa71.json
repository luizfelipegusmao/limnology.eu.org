{"title":"Role of <i>CYP9E2</i> and a long non-coding RNA gene in resistance to a spinosad insecticide in the Colorado potato beetle, <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304037","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Emine Kaplanoglu, Ian M. Scott, Jessica Vickruck, Cam Donly</p>\r\n\r\nSpinosads are insecticides used to control insect pests, especially in organic farming where limited tools for pest management exist. However, resistance has developed to spinosads in economically important pests, including Colorado potato beetle (CPB), <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i>. In this study, we used bioassays to determine spinosad sensitivity of two field populations of CPB, one from an organic farm exposed exclusively to spinosad and one from a conventional farm exposed to a variety of insecticides, and a reference insecticide na√Øve population. We found the field populations exhibited significant levels of resistance compared with the sensitive population. Then, we compared transcriptome profiles between the two field populations to identify genes associated primarily with spinosad resistance and found a cytochrome P450, <i>CYP9E2</i>, and a long non-coding RNA gene, <i>lncRNA-2</i>, were upregulated in the exclusively spinosad-exposed population. Knock-down of these two genes simultaneously in beetles of the spinosad-exposed population using RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a significant increase in mortality when gene knock-down was followed by spinosad exposure, whereas single knock-downs of each gene produced smaller effects. In addition, knock-down of the <i>lncRNA-2</i> gene individually resulted in significant reduction in <i>CYP9E2</i> transcripts. Finally, <i>in silico</i> analysis using an RNA-RNA interaction tool revealed that <i>CYP9E2</i> mRNA contains multiple binding sites for the <i>lncRNA-2</i> transcript. Our results imply that <i>CYP9E2</i> and <i>lncRNA-2</i> jointly contribute to spinosad resistance in CPB, and <i>lncRNA-2</i> is involved in regulation of <i>CYP9E2</i> expression. These results provide evidence that metabolic resistance, driven by overexpression of CYP and lncRNA genes, contributes to spinosad resistance in CPB.","author":"Emine Kaplanoglu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d92971bfbb1dc87d48b41198d6aceb4c4ef305e1dd84456ac2cbbb4a9918aa71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
