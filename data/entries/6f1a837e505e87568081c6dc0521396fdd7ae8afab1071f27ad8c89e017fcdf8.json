{"title":"Next-Generation Antennas Key Enabler: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) Technology Potential to Address Limitations of Traditional Antennas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1845/v1","date":1716883812000,"content":"This review explores the potential of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) to address limitations of traditional antennas and empower next-generation wireless networks. IRS technology offers a paradigm shift by passively manipulating radio waves, enhancing signal coverage, network capacity, and energy efficiency. IRS technology utilizes flat surfaces equipped with tiny, adjustable reflectors. Unlike traditional antennas that actively send and receive radio waves, IRS passively manipulates incoming signals by reflecting them in specific directions with controlled adjustments. This approach significantly improves signal coverage and strength, particularly in areas with poor reception. The review reveals the IRS technology offers significant advantages over traditional antennas. It can enhance signal coverage by reflecting radio waves, boost network capacity which allows networks to handle a larger number of users simultaneously, promote lower energy consumption compare, and unlock potential of 6G Networks and beyond. Additionally, IRS enables functionalities such as enhanced localization and ultra-fast data transfer. Integrating IRS with next-generation antennas unlocks new possibilities. This includes reconfigurable antennas that dynamically adjust radiation patterns, compact and low-profile designs, and multi-functional antennas that support various services simultaneously. In conclusion, this paves the way for a new generation of robust and sustainable wireless communication systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f1a837e505e87568081c6dc0521396fdd7ae8afab1071f27ad8c89e017fcdf8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
