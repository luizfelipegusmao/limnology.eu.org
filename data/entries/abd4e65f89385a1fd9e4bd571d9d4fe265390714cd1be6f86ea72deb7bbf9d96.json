{"title":"Clinicopathological Observations in Acute Stroke Patients Treated with Intravenous Thrombolysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1204/v1","date":1723780425000,"content":"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and intravenous thrombo-lysis, while improving functional outcomes, still leaves a significant mortality rate. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and pathological data of thrombolysed stroke patients who subsequently died and underwent autopsy, focusing on hemorrhagic transformation (HT). Over a 10-year period, 1426 acute ischemic stroke patients re-ceived thrombolysis at our center, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 11.7%. Autop-sies were performed on 98 of the 167 deceased patients. HT was found in 47% of these cases, only less than half occurring within a day of thrombolysis. Significant inde-pendent predictors of HT included higher lactate dehydrogenase (LD) levels and higher INR values at admission. HT directly caused death in 30% of cases, often through herniation, while other complications (pulmonary embolism, pneumonia) were also common. These findings underscore the importance of postmortem investi-gations to accurately determine the incidence of HT and contributing factors. Our data indicate that in the vast majority of HT cases, the role of contributing factors other than rt-PA may be important. Of the routinely assessed clinical and laboratory parameters at admission only LD and INR were found to be independent predictors of HT in the autopsied studied cohort.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abd4e65f89385a1fd9e4bd571d9d4fe265390714cd1be6f86ea72deb7bbf9d96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
