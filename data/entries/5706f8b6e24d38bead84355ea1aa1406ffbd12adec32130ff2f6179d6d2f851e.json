{"title":"Edible‐algae base composite film containing gelatin for food packaging from macroalgae, Gracilaroid (Gracilaria fisheri)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13531?af=R","date":1713181717000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Conventional petroleum-based packaging films cause severe environmental problems. In this work bio-edible film as a safe to replace petroleum-based polymers was introduced. A food application for edible sachets and a composite edible film (EF) from marine algae, <i>Gracilaria fisheri</i> (GF) extract were proposed.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Carbohydrates were the most prevalent component in fresh GF fronds. Under neutral conditions at 90 °C for 40 min, the extract's structure was determined by FTIR to be a carrageenan-like polysaccharide. Glycerol was the best plasticizer for EF formation since it had the highest tensile strength (TS). The integration of gelatin into the algal composite film with gelatin (CFG) was validated by significant. The best casting temperatures for 2 h were 70 and 100 °C among the four tested temperatures (25, 60, 70, and 100 °C). Temperatures did not result in significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in any character (color values, TS, water vapor permeability, oxygen transmission, thickness, and water activity), except elongation at break. Visually, the CFG had a slightly yellow appearance. The best-to-worst order of film stability in the three tested solvents was oil, distilled water (DW), and ethanol. Its stability in ethanol (0–100%), temperature of DW (30–100 °C), and pH (3–7 in DW) demonstrated inverse variations with the concentration or different conditions, except for pH 8–10 in DW. All treatments were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) different.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The novel material made from polysaccharides from algae, G. <i>fisheri,</i> was used to improve EF. The edible sachet application was plausible from the EF.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
