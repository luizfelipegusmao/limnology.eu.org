{"title":"Is heat wave a predictor of diarrhoea in Dhaka, Bangladesh? A time-series analysis in a South Asian tropical monsoon climate","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003629","date":1725372000000,"content":"<p>by Farhana Haque, Fiona C.

We defined elevated daily mean and maximum temperature over the 95<sup>th</sup> and 99<sup>th</sup> percentiles lasting for at least one day between March to October 1981–2010 as TAV95 and TAV99 and D95 and D99 heat wave, respectively. We investigated the association between heat wave and daily counts of hospitalisations for all-cause diarrhoea in Dhaka, Bangladesh using time series regression analysis employing constrained distributed lag-linear models. Effects were assessed for all ages and children aged under 5 years of age. Diarrhoea hospitalisation increased by 6.7% (95% CI: 4.6%– 8.9%), 8.3% (3.7–13.1), 7.0 (4.8–9.3) and 7.4 (3.1–11.9) in all ages on a TAV95, TAV99, D95 and D99 heat wave day, respectively. These effects were more pronounced for under-5 children with an increase of 13.9% (95% CI: 8.3–19.9), 24.2% (11.3–38.7), 17.0 (11.0–23.5) and 19.5 (7.7–32.6) in diarrhoea hospitalisations on a TAV95, TAV99, D95 and D99 heat wave day, respectively. At lags of 3 days, we noticed a negative association indicating a ‘harvesting’ effect. Our findings suggest that heat wave was a significant risk factor for diarrhoea hospitalisation in Dhaka. Further research is needed to elucidate the causal pathways and identify the preventive measures necessary to mitigate the impacts of heat waves on diarrhoea. Given that no heat wave definitions exist for Dhaka, these results may help to define heat waves for Dhaka and trigger public health interventions including heat alerts to prevent heat-related morbidity in Dhaka, Bangladesh.","author":"Farhana Haque","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c63a156c886f7c168fd7325ecacee91db1c132ad08ff88560db85073682df7cd","category":"Environment"}
