{"title":"Thymidine Analogue Mutations with M184V Significantly Decrease Phenotypic Susceptibility of HIV-1 subtype C Reverse Transcriptase to Islatravir","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1632/v1","date":1729583208000,"content":"Islatravir (ISL) is the first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTtI) with novel modes of action. Data on ISL resistance is currently limited, particularly to HIV-1 non-B subtypes. This study aimed to assess prevalent nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations in HIV-1 subtype C for phenotypic resistance to ISL. Prevalent single and combinations of NRTI resistance mutations were selected from a routine HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance testing database and introduced into HIV-1 subtype C-like pseudoviruses, which were then tested for ISL susceptibility. Single NRTI resistance mutations were susceptible or showed only a low level of resistance to ISL. This included thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs, i.e., M41L, D67N, K70R, T215FY, K219EQ) and non-TAMs (i.e., A62V, K65R, K70ET, L74IV, A114S, Y115F, M184V). Combinations of M184V with one or more additional NRTI resistance mutations generally displayed reduced ISL susceptibilities. This was more prominent for combinations that included M184V+TAMs, and particularly M184V+TAM-2 mutations. Combinations that included M184V+K65R did not impact significantly on ISL susceptibility. Our study suggests that ISL would be effective in treating people living with HIV (PLWH) failing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/lamivudine (3TC) or TDF/emtricitabine (FTC)-containing regimens but would be less effective in PLH failing zidovudine (AZT) with 3TC or FTC-containing regimens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88692d899ad4b8fed93bd44ad9bb91241898bde4c3ffa747f0e172283548393e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
