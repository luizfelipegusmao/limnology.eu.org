{"title":"A Novel Sampling Method for Collecting the Polyp Stage of the Invasive Freshwater Hydrozoan Craspedacusta sowerbii in Aquatic Habitats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2112/v1","date":1717145335000,"content":"Current sampling methods for detecting the presence of the invasive freshwater hydrozoan Craspedacusta sowerbii rely mainly on visual confirmation of the medusa stage. Confirming the presence of the polyp stage is equally important to observing medusae since typical late summer/early fall occurrences or observations of medusae are sporadic though becoming more frequent. The polyp stage is important as it is the organismâ€™s primary stage and is present throughout the year depending on water temperatures. Therefore, sampling methods for the polyp stage are commonly the collection of substrates such as rocks, plants or pieces of wood in a given body of water and can be cumbersome to examine. Based on preliminary culturing of the polyp stage on glass and plastic microscope slides in the lab, we designed a novel sampling methodology based on submerging 4 substrate types (small glass petri dishes, Hester-Dendy plates, plastic and glass microscope slides) to confirm the presence of C. sowerbii polyps in the field. We tested this method in various lakes in the Illinois-Indiana region (USA). The sampling method we designed was effective in that C. sowerbii polyps (and sometimes colonies) were found on both plastic and glass slides. While this method can be sufficient for detection of the polyp stage, it also shows significant potential for improvement; we highlight water flow and competition and predation from other organisms as significant factors influencing the collection of C. sowerbii polyps for future methodologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4745ceb4dcc0d6f0d3c31a1117de51df4dbe1e19def22a5fa31b6dc294c6461b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
