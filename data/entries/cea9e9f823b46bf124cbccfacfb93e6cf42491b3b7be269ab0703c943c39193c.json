Finally, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biad117\">O'Neal and colleagues</a> highlight the nearly universal importance of indirect effects in ecological processes, but they note that terminology is often unclear and confusing, hampering efforts to assess the environmental risks of human alteration of the landscape (development). All three of the previous articles conclude with clear policy recommendations. All three of the previous articles conclude with clear policy recommendations. While on the topic of clarity, our book review editor, J. Arvid  Ã…gren, reviews West and Turnbull's book on how to write science articles and adds a few tips of his own.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"cea9e9f823b46bf124cbccfacfb93e6cf42491b3b7be269ab0703c943c39193c","category":"Environment"}
