{"title":"Optical microscopic imaging, manipulation, and analysis methods for morphogenesis research","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/3/226/7475867?rss=1","date":1702598400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Morphogenesis is a developmental process of organisms being shaped through complex and cooperative cellular movements. To understand the interplay between genetic programs and the resulting multicellular morphogenesis, it is essential to characterize the morphologies and dynamics at the single-cell level and to understand how physical forces serve as both signaling components and driving forces of tissue deformations. In recent years, advances in microscopy techniques have led to improvements in imaging speed, resolution and depth. Concurrently, the development of various software packages has supported large-scale, analyses of challenging images at the single-cell resolution. While these tools have enhanced our ability to examine dynamics of cells and mechanical processes during morphogenesis, their effective integration requires specialized expertise. With this background, this review provides a practical overview of those techniques. First, we introduce microscopic techniques for multicellular imaging and image analysis software tools with a focus on cell segmentation and tracking. Second, we provide an overview of cutting-edge techniques for mechanical manipulation of cells and tissues. Finally, we introduce recent findings on morphogenetic mechanisms and mechanosensations that have been achieved by effectively combining microscopy, image analysis tools and mechanical manipulation techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"6750b573b23a604ba208993a4ff2085f52615cb2594d436b7fbec5eac00f23b5","category":"Environment"}
