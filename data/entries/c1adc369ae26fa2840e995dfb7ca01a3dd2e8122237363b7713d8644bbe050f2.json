{"title":"Molecular analyses support revision of species diversity of the moss genus Bryum in Antarctica","link":"https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/205/1/15/7591933?rss=1","date":1706572800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Bryum</span> is a moss genus that is widely distributed across the planet. Many of its species are characterized by large phenotypic and morphological plasticity, generating uncertainty in species identification exclusively based on morphological characteristics. In Antarctica, the extreme and harsh environmental conditions are further likely to promote intra-specific morphological variation, leading to complexity in the taxonomic attribution of <span>Bryum</span> species. In this study, we apply molecular phylogenetic analyses to assist in developing accurate species identification of <span>B. pseudotriquetrum</span> and two other relatively abundant <span>Bryum</span> species (<span>B. archangelicum</span> and <span>B. pallescens</span>) currently reported as Antarctic species.A total of 51 <span>Bryum</span> samples collected in Antarctica (22) and from all other continents (29) were sequenced for ITS nrDNA and <span>rps</span>4 cpDNA regions, using markers widely used in moss phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic trees were constructed including ITS (23) and <span>rps</span>4 (34) sequences representing the three more frequent of the seven <span>Bryum</span> species currently reported from Antarctica as well as several other <span>Bryum</span> species and related genera, incorporating all sequence data available in the literature and accessible databases. The molecular analyses provide strong support for a match between morphological and molecular attribution of specimens identified as <span>B. pseudotriquetrum</span>. The data also provide evidence of currently unrecognized <span>Bryum</span> diversity in Antarctica, with the identification of one individual of <span>B. uliginosum</span>. However, the analyses suggest that all Antarctic specimens currently assigned to other <span>Bryum</span> species are morphological variants of <span>B. pseudotriquetrum</span>. The integration of molecular and morphological analyses supports the presence of <span>B. pseudotriquetrum</span> as the most widely distributed species of the genus in Antarctica and of <span>B. uliginosum</span> with a much more restricted distribution (South Sandwich Islands). Our data suggest that further investigation is required of <span>B. archangelicum</span> and <span>B. pallescens</span> in other continents globally, as the identity of none of the herbarium specimens examined in this study could be confirmed with molecular data.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"84b5fa2619594e061395c38d918de42c13a5b0cd8ac0441f237084e35d0e4410","entryHash":"c1adc369ae26fa2840e995dfb7ca01a3dd2e8122237363b7713d8644bbe050f2","category":"Environment"}
