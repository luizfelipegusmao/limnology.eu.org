{"title":"Detection and Characterization of Methylated Circulating Tumor DNAs in Gastric Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1865/v1","date":1714379672000,"content":"Gastric cancer is the 5th most common disease in the world and the 4th most common cause of death. It is diagnosed through esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, however there are limitations in finding lesions in the early stages. Recently, research has been actively conducted to use liquid biopsy to diagnose various cancers, including gastric cancer. Various substances derived from cancer are reflected in the blood. By analyzing these substances, it was expected that not only the presence or absence of cancer but also the type of cancer can be diagnosed. However, the amount of these substances is extremely small, and even these have various variables depending on the characteristics of the individual or the characteristics of the cancer. To overcome these, we collected methylated DNA fragments using MeDIP and compared them with normal plasma to characterize gastric cancer tissue or patient’s plasma. And we attempted to diagnose gastric cancer using the characteristics of cancer reflected in the blood through the cancer tissue and patient’s plasma. As a result, we confirmed that the consistency of common methylated fragments between tissue and plasma was approximately 41.2%, and found the possibility of diagnosing and characterizing cancer using the characteristics of the fragments through SFR and 5'end-motif analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7f30c175e81c254923213e3d4e8f76f453a35bce812372f74a17781de6f79f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
