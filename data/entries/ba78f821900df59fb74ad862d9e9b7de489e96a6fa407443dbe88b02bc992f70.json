{"title":"Ciliary Function, Antigen Stasis and Asthma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0174/v1","date":1714715305000,"content":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is caused by pathologic variants in over 50 different genes that affect the structure and function of motile cilia. Low nasal NO (nNO) is a biomarker for diagnosis in patients with features of PCD; but the reason why it is low is unclear. At the cellular level, a characteristic feature shared by most PCD patients is that antigens and other particles are not cleared from the epithelial surface. Poor antigen clearance results in pro-oxidant pathway activation and airway epithelial damage and may predispose PCD patients to DUOX1- and IL33- mediated asthma. Secondary ciliary dysfunction, such as that caused by viruses or by smoking, can also contribute to asthma development. Variants in genes underlying the function of cilia, can be associated with poor lung function, even in the absence of PCD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in PCD â€“ related genes can be associated with increased asthma severity. The role of cilia and antigen stasis is the pathophysiology of asthma is an important area for research, because specific airway clearance techniques and other therapeutic interventions, such as antioxidants, could be of value in preventing the development of asthma and asthma-like symptoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba78f821900df59fb74ad862d9e9b7de489e96a6fa407443dbe88b02bc992f70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
