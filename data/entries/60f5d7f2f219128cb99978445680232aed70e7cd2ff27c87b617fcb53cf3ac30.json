{"title":"Nano(bio)materials Do Not Affect Macrophage Phenotype â€“ A Study Conducted by the REFINE Project","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0336/v1","date":1715062660000,"content":"Macrophages are well known for the involvement in the biocompatibility, as well as biodistribution, of nano(bio)materials. Although there are a number of rodent cell lines, they may not fully recapitulate primary cell responses; particularly for those of human cells. Isolation of tissue resident macrophages, from humans, is difficult and may result in insufficient cells with which to determine the possible interaction with nano(bio)materials. Isolation of primary human monocytes, and differentiation to monocyte-derived macrophages, may provide a useful tool with which to study, further, these interactions. To that end, we developed a standard operating procedure for this differentiation, as part of the REFINE project, and used it to measure the secretion of bioactive molecules from M1 and M2 differentiated monocytes in response to model nano(bio)materials, following an initial assessment of pyrogenic contamination which may confound, potential, observations. The SOP was deployed in two partner institutions with, broadly, similar results. The work presented here shows the utility of this assay but, highlights the relevance of donor variability in responses to nano(bio)materials. Whilst donor variability can provide some, logistical, challenges to application of such assays, this variability is much closer to the heterogeneous cells that are present in vivo, compared to homogeneous, non-human, cell lines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60f5d7f2f219128cb99978445680232aed70e7cd2ff27c87b617fcb53cf3ac30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
