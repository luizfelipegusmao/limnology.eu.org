{"title":"Examining The Effects of Carbon Dioxide Emissions on Human Brain Activity Using Agent-Based Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0590/v1","date":1710391909000,"content":"The escalating levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) due to anthropogenic activities have raised significant concerns regarding their far-reaching consequences, including potential impacts on human brain function. This study employs Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and a comprehensive literature review to comprehensively examine the effects of varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations on human brain activity. Historical and projected CO2concentration data, along with neuroscientific insights, were integrated into the ABM framework to simulate brain activity responses under different CO2 scenarios. The simulations revealed that elevated CO2 levels disrupt neural activity and alter neurotransmitter profiles, indicating potential cognitive consequences. Sensitivity analysis emphasized the importance of accurate parameterization for robust simulations. The findings underscore the urgent need to address global CO2 emissions to preserve cognitive health. Further research is essential to validate and refine the model, incorporating additional factors for a comprehensive understanding of the cognitive repercussions of rising CO2 levels, crucial for informed policy-making and public awareness campaigns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a18e4fb73f0f56384adff03b0180cba63b0beee50c88aaa09b334a13cbc1f39b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
