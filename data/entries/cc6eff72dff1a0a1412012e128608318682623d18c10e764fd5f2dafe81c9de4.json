{"title":"EPR Correlations Using Quaternion Spin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202301.0570/v8","date":1721183226000,"content":"{We present a statistical simulation replicating the correlation observed in EPR coincidence experiments without needing non-local connectivity. We define spin coherence as a spin attribute that complements polarization by being anti-symmetric and generating helicity. Point particle spin becomes structured with two orthogonal magnetic moments, each with a spin of $\\frac{1}{2}$â€”these moments couple in free flight to create a spin-1 boson. Depending on its orientation in the field, when it encounters a filter, it either decouples into two independent fermion spins of $\\frac{1}{2}$, or it remains a boson and precesses without decoupling. The only variable in this study is the angle that orients a spin on the Bloch sphere, first identified in the 1920s. There are no hidden variables. The new features introduced in this work result from changing the spin symmetry from SU(2) to the quaternion group, $Q_8$, which complexifies the Dirac field.             The transition from a free-flight boson to a measured fermion is the reason for the observed violation of Bell's Inequalities and resolves the EPR paradox.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc6eff72dff1a0a1412012e128608318682623d18c10e764fd5f2dafe81c9de4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
