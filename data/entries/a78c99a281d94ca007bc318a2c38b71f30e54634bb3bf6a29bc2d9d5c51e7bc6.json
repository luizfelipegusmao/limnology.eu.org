For EM, ultrastructure preservation is essential and is traditionally done with chemical fixation and resin embedding. However, these chemical agents can induce artefacts. Instead, physical fixation is shown to be a powerful method allowing for high-resolution imaging of samples in the native hydrated state. Cryogenic (cryo)CLEM is already a well-established method on 2D cell cultures [<a href=\"#ozae044.1037-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1037-B2\">2</a>], but is virtually unexplored for volume imaging on 3D samples such as tissues and organoids [<a href=\"#ozae044.1037-B3\">3</a>], which are more biologically relevant.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a78c99a281d94ca007bc318a2c38b71f30e54634bb3bf6a29bc2d9d5c51e7bc6","category":"Environment"}
