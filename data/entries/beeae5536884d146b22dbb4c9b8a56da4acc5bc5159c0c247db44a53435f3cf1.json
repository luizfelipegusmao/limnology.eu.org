Vallejo-Vaz, Rocío Salsoso, Francisco J. Medrano, Enrique J. Calderón</p>\r\nBackground <p><i>Pneumocytis jirovecii</i> infection in preterm newborns has recently been associated with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Changes in the bacterial microbiota of the airways have also been described in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, until now there has been no information on the airway mycobiota in newborns. The purpose of this study was to describe the airway mycobiota in term and preterm newborns and its possible association with respiratory distress syndrome.</p> Methods <p>Twenty-six matched preterm newborns with and without respiratory distress syndrome were studied, as well as 13 term babies. The identification of the fungal microbiota was carried out using molecular procedures in aspirated nasal samples at birth.</p> Results <p>The <i>ascomycota</i> phylum was identified in 89.7% of newborns, while the <i>basidiomycota</i> phylum was found in 33.3%. <i>Cladosporium</i> was the predominant genus in both term and preterm infants 38.4% vs. 73% without statistical differences. <i>Candida sake</i> and <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i> were only found in preterm infants, suggesting a potential relationship with the risk of prematurity.</p> Conclusions <p>This is the first report to describe the fungal microbiota of the airways in term and preterm infants with and without respiratory distress syndrome. Although no differences have been observed, the number of cases analyzed could be small to obtain conclusive results, and more studies are needed to understand the role of the fungal microbiota of the airways in neonatal respiratory pathology.</p>","author":"Vicente Friaza","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"beeae5536884d146b22dbb4c9b8a56da4acc5bc5159c0c247db44a53435f3cf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
