{"title":"Comparison of the Proteome of Staphylococcus aureus Planktonic Culture and 3-Day Biofilm Reveals Potential Role of Key Proteins in Biofilm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1668/v1","date":1716795284000,"content":"Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci account for about 80% of infections associated with medical devices and are associated with an increased virulence due to their ability to form biofilm. In this study, we aimed to construct a comprehensive reference map followed by significant pathway analysis in the proteome of S. aureus biofilm grown for 3-days as compared with 24 h planktonic using a high-resolution tandem mass tag (TMT)-based mass spectrometry. We identified proteins associated with secondary metabolites, ABC transporters, biosynthesis of amino acids, response to stress, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were significantly upregulated in 3-day biofilm. In contrast, proteins associated with virulence factors, microbial metabolism in diverse environments secondary metabolites, translation, and energy metabolism were significantly downregulated. Among the significantly dysregulated proteins, hyaluronidase (hysA) in conjunction with chitinase may play significant role in the elimination and/or prevention of biofilm development. This study advances the current S. aureus subproteomes, identified potential pathways significant to biofilm biology and helped to understand their potential role in S. aureus which may shed light on developing new therapeutic regimes including antibiofilm agents in the treatment of biofilm-infections related with implantable medical devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58007ded78712a64d16dfeed78d0ba37b973ddb136d2d526daec6b6ee5c0f15c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
