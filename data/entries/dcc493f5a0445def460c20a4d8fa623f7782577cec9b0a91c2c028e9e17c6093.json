However, their toxicity, non-biodegradability and water solubility render them persistent water pollutants. Consequently, IL degradation from water is an emerging topic of research interest nowadays. Sonolysis is one of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) based on ultrasound (US). During sonolysis, acoustic cavitation decomposes water into reactive hydroxyl (•OH) and hydrogen (•H) radicals, which then oxidize IL. This review discussed different AOPs for wastewater treatment reflecting their shortcomings, with a special focus on the operating conditions and effectiveness of US-based hybrid AOPs for IL degradation. The synergistic effects of US over other AOPs are investigated. Hybid-sonolysis has proven to significantly enhance IL mineralization in shorter reaction time by generating more reactive-free radicals in an aqueous medium at experimentally optimized conditions. Finally, this review identifies research gap and proposes future directions of IL degradation. It will serve as a valuable resource for future studies of IL degradation using US techniques.</p>","author":"Santosh D. Ashtaputrey, \nPratibha S.
