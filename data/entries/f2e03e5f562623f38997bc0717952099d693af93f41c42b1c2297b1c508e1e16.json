{"title":"The Role of Oxytocin in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0810/v1","date":1712827189000,"content":"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age representing the primary cause of anovulatory infertility. The nonapeptide oxytocin (OT) plays an important role in cognitive, emotional, and reproductive functions in human beings. Oxytocin receptors are expressed in several body parts including the ovaries.  Despite this, the possible role played by oxytocin in symptoms of PCOS is not clear. The present systematic review aimed at understanding, the presence of possible oxytocin level alterations in PCOS, the connection between alterations of OT levels and the symptoms of PCOS, and the effect of oxytocin administration in PCOS. After a systematic search in the principal databases, seven studies, five human and two animal, were included.  Most of the studies highlighted the role played by oxytocin in fertility issues related to PCOS. Studies that analyzed oxytocin basal levels in PCOS women agreed that PCOS is associated with a reduction in the serum level of oxytocin. Two studies found that in PCOS the serum levels of oxytocin were lower than healthy controls. One human and one animal study agreed about lower levels of PCOS, confirming a possible implication of a dysfunction of OT, in the pathogenesis of PCOS.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2e03e5f562623f38997bc0717952099d693af93f41c42b1c2297b1c508e1e16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
