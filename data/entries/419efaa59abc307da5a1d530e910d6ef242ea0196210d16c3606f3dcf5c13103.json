{"title":"Difficulties in distinguishing Monacha claustralis from M. cartusiana in Germany and Poland","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyae030/7737910?rss=1","date":1724198400000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>The two invasive snail species <span>Monacha claustralis</span> and <span>M. cartusiana</span> have been distinguished by their genital anatomy and mitochondrial haplotype. We assessed these distinctions in several populations from eastern Germany and northwestern Poland, as well as in reference populations (in part utilizing published illustrations). Absolute genital dimensions were unreliable characters because of their correlation with body size, which varies considerably within species. The ratio of epiphallus to vagina lengths was mostly effective in classifying animals from the reference populations, and it correlated closely with the second principal component of a multivariate analysis. It correlated also with the prominence of the vaginal sac, another identification character. However, even some individuals amongst the reference populations would have been misidentified by this ratio, and two German populations spanned a range of intermediate morphologies. These populations contained mitochondrial sequences of both species, but within-site variation in anatomy was not well explained by haplogroup; these seem to be populations of hybrids. The two Polish populations had anatomies of <span>M. cartusiana</span>, yet mitochondrial sequences of <span>M. claustralis</span>; surprisingly, samples from the same sites 11 years earlier were reported to have had <span>M. claustralis</span> anatomy. We warn that clear-cut identifications of Central European populations may increasingly often be unattainable and advocate investigation of whether the two taxa intergrade also in their native ranges.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"419efaa59abc307da5a1d530e910d6ef242ea0196210d16c3606f3dcf5c13103","category":"Environment"}
