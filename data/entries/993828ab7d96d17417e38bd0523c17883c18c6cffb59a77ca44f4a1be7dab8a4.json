{"title":"Early survival in Atlantic salmon is associated with parental genotypes at loci linked to timing of maturation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/8/1441/7670823?rss=1","date":1715558400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Large effect loci often contain genes with critical developmental functions and potentially broad effects across life stages. However, their life stage-specific fitness consequences are rarely explored. In Atlantic salmon, variation in two large-effect loci, <span>six6</span> and <span>vgll3</span>, is linked to age at maturity and several physiological and behavioral traits in early life. By genotyping the progeny of wild Atlantic salmon that were planted into natural streams with nutrient manipulations, we tested if genetic variation in these loci is associated with survival in early life. We found that higher early-life survival was linked to the genotype associated with late maturation in the <span>vgll3</span>, but with early maturation in the <span>six6</span> locus. These effects were significant in high nutrients but not in low-nutrient streams. The differences in early survival were not explained by additive genetic effects in the offspring generation but by maternal genotypes in the <span>six6</span> locus and by both parentsâ€™ genotypes in the <span>vgll3</span> locus. Our results suggest that indirect genetic effects of large-effect loci can be significant determinants of offspring fitness. This study demonstrates an intriguing case of how large-effect loci can exhibit complex fitness associations across life stages in the wild and indicates that predicting evolutionary dynamics is difficult.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"993828ab7d96d17417e38bd0523c17883c18c6cffb59a77ca44f4a1be7dab8a4","category":"Environment"}
