{"title":"Quantifying Combat Effectiveness Through Frontline Variation: A Time-Series Analysis of the Russo-Ukrainian War","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0121/v1","date":1714636742000,"content":"Traditional methodologies for measuring combat effectiveness rely on various contribution factors, where the main challenge lies in the complexity and subjectivity of these factors. Using frontline variation to measure combat effectiveness circumvents the limitations of many previous methods regarding complexity and subjectivity. Employing this methodology, we have quantitatively measured the combat effectiveness of both parties in the Russo-Ukrainian War across various temporal scales. Utilizing the time series data derived from our measurements, we constructed Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Annual Candlestick Charts to illustrate the variation trends in combat effectiveness between the two sides across different temporal scales. This comprehensive approach facilitated a nuanced and all-encompassing analysis of the conflict, capturing the intricate dynamics of individual military engagements and the broader strategic operations' context. This case underscores the distinctive utility of our method in quantifying combat effectiveness, offering detailed and strategically significant insights.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6021187a3bd6c377bbeab99d07c7238a418940324877e11cb3cb8a1ae8de2c4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
