{"title":"Study of the State of Woody Plants in Arid Conditions of Mangistau (Kazakhstan)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0783/v1","date":1715581551000,"content":"This study, conducted with meticulous attention to detail, comprehensively examines the state of plants and their adaptation to Kazakhstan's extra-arid climatic zone of the Mangistau. It uses the collections of woody plants from the Mangyshlak Experimental Botanical Garden in Aktau as a case study and extrapolates the results to the entire region. The study area is arid and unsuitable for many plants, so examining physiological adaptation mechanisms and strategies for preserving plants in unfavourable conditions is crucial. The study employed a range of methods, including the measurement of the intensity of transpiration, leaf hydration, and the content of chlorophyll A, B, and carotenoids. These methods were chosen for their proven effectiveness in similar studies and their ability to provide accurate and reliable data. The samples were also assessed using a point system for resistance to drought, phytophagy, gas tolerance, salt tolerance, winter hardiness, and soil fertility. The results obtained and entered into the IEBG platform “DinTseR” to assess the value of the introduction using a diagnostic scale revealed a high variability (up to 51.7-52.2%) of physiological indicators of growth and development. The highest values of transpiration intensity were observed in deciduous trees and shrubs, rose varieties (205-243 mg/g fresh leaf mass per hour), leaf water content - in climbing plants (68.9%), chlorophyll A and B content - in deciduous plants, and plants - old trees, fruit trees and varietal roses (3.46-3.93 and 1.34-1.84%). Their concentration in coniferous species is almost two times lower (0.63%). A correlation was also made between various significant factors. Twenty regression equations and forecasts have been identified that can be used to diagnose and assess resistance, thereby reducing the cost of determining the introduction value in the conditions of Mangistau. These findings are essential in understanding and preserving the unique flora of the Mangistau region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a204181c19d60c85ae89fdda391be8f0e176616a9d56eec5fb189a18750d036","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
