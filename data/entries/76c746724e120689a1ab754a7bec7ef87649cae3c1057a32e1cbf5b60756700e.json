{"title":"Computation of the Digital Elevation Model and Ice Dynamics of Talos Dome and the Frontier Mountain Region (North Victoria Land/Antarctica) by Synthetic Aperture Radar (Sar) Interferometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1836/v1","date":1729692327000,"content":"In Antarctica, SAR interferometry was largely used in coastal glacial areas, while in rare cases this method was used on the Antarctic plateau. In this paper, the authors present a digital elevation and ice flow map based on SAR interferometry for an area encompassing Talos Dome (TD) and the Frontier Mountain (FM) meteorite site in North Victoria Land/Antarctica. A digital elevation model (DEM) was calculated using a double SAR interferometry method. The DEM of the region was calculated by extracting approximately 100 control points from the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA). The two DEMs differ slightly in some areas, probably due to the penetration of the SAR-C band signal into the cold firn. The largest differences are found in the western area of TD, where the radar penetration is more pronounced and fits well with the layer structures calculated by the georadar and the snow accumulation observations. By differentiating a 70-day interferogram with the calculated DEM, a displacement interferogram was calculated that represents the ice dynamics. The resulting ice flow pattern clearly shows the catchment areas of the Priestley and Rennick Glaciers as well as the ice flow from the west towards Wilkes Basin. The ice velocity field was analyzed in the area of FM. This area has become well known due to the search for meteorites. The velocity field in combination with the calculated DEM confirms the generally accepted theories about the accumulation of meteorites over the Antarctic Plateau.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"76c746724e120689a1ab754a7bec7ef87649cae3c1057a32e1cbf5b60756700e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
