{"title":"The Bifunctional Dimer Caffeine-Indan Attenuates &alpha;-Synuclein Misfolding, Neurodegeneration and Behavioural Deficits After Chronic Stimulation of Adenosine A1 Receptors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0901/v1","date":1718258798000,"content":"We previously found that chronic adenosine A1 receptor stimulation with N6-Cyclopentyladenosine increased α-synuclein misfolding and neurodegeneration in a novel α-synucleinopathy model, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. Here, we aimed to synthesize a dimer caffeine-indan linked by a 6-carbon chain to cross the blood-brain barrier and tested its ability to bind α-synuclein, reducing misfolding, behavioural abnormalities, and neurodegeneration in our rodent model. Behavioural tests and histological stains assessed neuroprotective effects of the dimer compound. A rapid synthesis of the 18F-labelled analogue enabled Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography imaging for biodistribution measurement. Molecular docking analysis showed that the dimer binds to α-synuclein N- and C-termini and the non-amyloid-β-component (NAC) domain, similar to 1-aminoindan, and this binding promotes a neuroprotective α-synuclein “loop” conformation. The dimer also binds to the orthosteric binding site for adenosine within the adenosine A1 receptor. Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging showed the dimer abolished α-synuclein upregulation and aggregation in the substantia nigra and hippocampus, and the dimer mitigated cognitive deficits, anxiety, despair, and motor abnormalities. The 18F-labelled dimer remained stable post-injection and distributed in various organs, notably in the brain, suggesting its potential as a Positron Emission Tomography tracer for α-synuclein and adenosine A1 receptor in Parkinson’s disease therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"372b1e0b71ba49b0eb0fa615a02afda8fd08c116a81eb394610b0288be8a53e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
