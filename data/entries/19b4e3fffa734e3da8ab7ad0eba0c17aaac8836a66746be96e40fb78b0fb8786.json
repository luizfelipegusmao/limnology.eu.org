{"title":"Unveiling Ecological Footprints in BRICS+ Nations: Analyzing Natural Resource Exploration, Renewable Energy Consumption, and Economic Growth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2165/v2","date":1725334225000,"content":"This study examines the impact of natural resource exploitation, renewable energy consumption, economic growth, biocapacity, and information and communication technologies (ICT) on the ecological footprint of BRICS+ nations using panel data from 1991 to 2019. Advanced econometric techniques, including FMOLS, DOLS, CCR, and GMM, reveal significant findings relevant to sustainability-focused policymakers. The results show that natural resource exploitation significantly contributes to environmental degradation, while renewable energy consumption mitigates these effects to varying degrees across the studied countries. Although economic growth is crucial, it worsens ecological footprints unless accompanied by sustainable practices. ICT and biocapacity emerge as key factors in promoting environmental sustainability, with ICT enhancing innovation and efficiency to reduce ecological impacts. The study emphasizes the need for tailored policy frameworks that align economic growth with environmental sustainability, advocating for the adoption of renewable energy, eco-innovations, and green finance initiatives suited to the unique conditions of BRICS+ nations. The findings aim to guide policymakers in advancing sustainable development and mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of rapid industrialization and urbanization, while contributing to the global discourse on achieving a balance between economic growth and ecological well-being in developing countries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19b4e3fffa734e3da8ab7ad0eba0c17aaac8836a66746be96e40fb78b0fb8786","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
