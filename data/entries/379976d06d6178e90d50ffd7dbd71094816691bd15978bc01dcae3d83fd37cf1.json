{"title":"$2^m - 1$ as the Integer Formulation to Govern the Dynamics of Collatz-Type Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0961/v4","date":1721743588000,"content":"It has been discovered that representing odd integers as modified binary expressions ending with $2^m - 1$ for $m \\geq 1$ helps in understanding the dynamics of Collatz-type sequences. Starting with the original Collatz sequence $3n + 1$, it is found that when the odd step is applied to an odd integer ending with $2^m - 1$, an even integer that ends in $2^{m+1} + 2^m - 2$ is obtained, which is exactly once divisible by 2, unless the lowest index reduces to zero. This implies that the sequence alternates between odd and even steps $m$ times. This governs the dynamics of the Collatz-type sequences because the value of $m$ determines the number of times the integer can be divided by 2 in each even step. A shortcut method is then presented that gives the even integer after $m$ odd-even steps are completed. This formulation also allows construction of odd integers to follow specific patterns of odd and even steps. The shortcut method for the modified Collatz sequence $5n+1$ is also presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"379976d06d6178e90d50ffd7dbd71094816691bd15978bc01dcae3d83fd37cf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
