{"title":"Unraveling the Impact of Salt and Alkali Stress on Forage Yield and Nutritional Value: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1341/v1","date":1729213532000,"content":"This review examines the nutritional value of forages grown in saline and alkaline soil, aiding in the formulation of optimal feed for ruminant animals. Coastal soil deterioration due to increasing salinity and alkalinity poses challenges to forage production, impacting plant height and biomass. Salinity's effect on forage crops varies, with some exhibiting increased protein content and improved quality, while others suffer decreased growth and yield. Further research is needed to understand salinity tolerance mechanisms and develop strategies for salt-affected areas. Salt-affected forages exhibit a higher leaf-to-stem ratio, increased shoot nitrogen and crude protein contents, and ADF and NDF contents decreased, making them valuable for livestock nutrition. Consequently, there is a growing agricultural strategy to cultivate naturally salt-tolerant forage species in saline and arid environments. In conclusion, considering the nutritional value and biomass yield of forages in saline-alkali land is crucial for livestock production. By utilizing salt-tolerant forage crops and implementing effective management practices, the challenges posed by high salt levels in the soil can be overcome, ensuring a reliable feed source for livestock in these areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70008bf5b8141e9b619cf60d9a5a55ab8bc7c5dc1680bd728c35585dfc8e4bd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
