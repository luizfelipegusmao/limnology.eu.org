{"title":"Recent Developments of Combination Immunotherapy with Other Therapies and Nanoparticle-Based Therapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1833/v1","date":1714285883000,"content":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), lacking specific receptors found in other breast cancer subtypes, poses significant treatment challenges due to limited therapeutic options. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel treatment approaches for TNBC. In the last few decades, many attempts have been reported for alternative tools for TNBC treatment: immunotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, combination therapy, and nanotechnology-based therapy. Among them, combination therapy and nanotechnology-based therapy show the most promise for TNBC treatment. This review outlines recent advancements in these areas, highlighting the efficacy of combination therapy (immunotherapy paired with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiotherapy) in both preclinical and clinical stages and nanotechnology-based therapies utilizing various nanoparticles loaded with anticancer agents, nucleic acids, immunotherapeutics, or CRISPRs in preclinical stages for TNBC treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9677efc751ec5c31cff2b40fc1df515b6bdfde2fc51ea6ac4eb8e979cea311d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
