{"title":"High-Intensity Laser Therapy in Pain Management of Knee Osteoarthritis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0815/v1","date":1720580882000,"content":"Knee osteoarthritis (KO) is an important health condition, affecting one third of the people aged 65 years or more. Pain is the main cause of disability. Pain management in KO includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities. Patient education, lifestyle changes, physical exercise and physical agents are prescribed as a first approach for pain control. Laser therapy is part of many therapeutical protocols, with two forms, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and high-intensity laser therapy (HILT). The paper aimed at stressing the advantages of HILT, based on a greater wavelength, higher energy delivery and deeper tissue penetration. Research on 23 published trials revealed that analgesic effect is rapid, cumulative and long lasting. Compared to sham, to LLLT or to other associations of therapeutical modalities, HILT provided significantly better results on pain reduction and functional improvement. Ultrasound examination showed reduction of intraarticular inflammation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50f9fa242699fd5d4a058616e092f53a6034dc0566d30fa2abf5780e88acfa0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
