{"title":"Understanding the Influence of Digital Technology on Human Cognitive Processes: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1844/v1","date":1714292786000,"content":"In the era of rapid digitalisation, the widespread integration of digital technology into various aspects of daily life has sparked significant interest in understanding its impact on cognitive mental processes. While the emerging data suggests that its influence may be positive or negative, the depth of evidence regarding neurobiological mechanisms remains limited. This review aims to synthesise previously published studies and explore the implications of digital technology components, specifically those resembling mobile technology, internet search engines, and conversational artificial intelligence models, on cognitive functions embedded in the brainâ€™s ability to reorganise itself, known as neuroplasticity. Despite acknowledged limitations, through an exhaustive approach, this paper intends to offer a dynamic perspective on the effects of digital media on the human brain, before the onset of addiction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"495ba4efcac66e4406d1cfdf9dc1fb8f8c2e830a3f0667e01b9a0e808f58491d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
