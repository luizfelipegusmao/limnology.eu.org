{"title":"The Artefactual Branch Effect and Phylogenetic Conflict: Species Delimitation with Gene Flow in Mangrove Pit Vipers (Trimeresurus purpureomaculatus-erythrurus Complex)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/72/6/1209/7227837?rss=1","date":1689897600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mangrove pit vipers of the <span>Trimeresurus purpureomaculatus-erythrurus</span> complex are the only species of viper known to naturally inhabit mangroves. Despite serving integral ecological functions in mangrove ecosystems, the evolutionary history, distribution, and species boundaries of mangrove pit vipers remain poorly understood, partly due to overlapping distributions, confusing phenotypic variations, and the lack of focused studies. Here, we present the first genomic study on mangrove pit vipers and introduce a robust hypothesis-driven species delimitation framework that considers gene flow and phylogenetic uncertainty in conjunction with a novel application of a new class of speciation-based delimitation model implemented through the program <span>Delineate.</span> Our results showed that gene flow produced phylogenetic conflict in our focal species and substantiates the artefactual branch effect where highly admixed populations appear as divergent nonmonophyletic lineages arranged in a stepwise manner at the basal position of clades. Despite the confounding effects of gene flow, we were able to obtain unequivocal support for the recognition of a new species based on the intersection and congruence of multiple lines of evidence. This study demonstrates that an integrative hypothesis-driven approach predicated on the consideration of multiple plausible evolutionary histories, population structure/differentiation, gene flow, and the implementation of a speciation-based delimitation model can effectively delimit species in the presence of gene flow and phylogenetic conflict.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Systematic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ff28aeeb9b03783edee2039c6a58e13e932a0eb216cc2d8b21d5a99c6800e59a","entryHash":"06ac4d6639bbec27127bdd4991a910f94543dad9f93765d303cfc7407fc00475","category":"Environment"}
