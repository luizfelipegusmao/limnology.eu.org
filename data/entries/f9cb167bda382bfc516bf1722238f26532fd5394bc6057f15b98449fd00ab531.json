{"title":"Gut microbiota composition of the isopod <i>Ligia</i> in South Korea exposed to expanded polystyrene pollution","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308246","date":1723039200000,"content":"<p>by Young-Mi Lee, Kwang-Min Choi, Seong Hee Mun, Je-Won Yoo, Jee-Hyun Jung</p>\r\n\r\nPlastics pose a considerable challenge to aquatic ecosystems because of their increasing global usage and non-biodegradable properties. Coastal plastic debris can persist in ecosystems; however, its effects on resident organisms remain unclear. A metagenomic analysis of the isopoda <i>Ligia</i>, collected from clean (Nae-do, ND) and plastic-contaminated sites (Maemul-do, MD) in South Korea, was conducted to clarify the effects of microplastic contamination on the gut microbiota. <i>Ligia</i> gut microbiotaâ€™s total operational taxonomic units were higher in ND than in MD. Alpha diversity did not differ significantly between the two <i>Ligia</i> gut microbial communities collected from ND and MD, although richness (Observed species) was lower in MD than in ND. Proteobacteria (67.47%, ND; 57.30%, MD) and Bacteroidetes (13.63%, ND; 20.76%, MD) were the most abundant phyla found at both sites. Significant different genera in <i>Ligia</i> from EPS-polluted sites were observed. Functional gene analysis revealed that 19 plastic degradation-related genes, including those encoding hydrogenase, esterase, and carboxylesterase, were present in the gut microbes of <i>Ligia</i> from MD, indicating the potential role of the <i>Ligia</i> gut microbiota in plastic degradation. This study provides the first comparative field evidence of the gut microbiota dynamics of plastic detritus consumers in marine ecosystems.","author":"Young-Mi Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f9cb167bda382bfc516bf1722238f26532fd5394bc6057f15b98449fd00ab531","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
