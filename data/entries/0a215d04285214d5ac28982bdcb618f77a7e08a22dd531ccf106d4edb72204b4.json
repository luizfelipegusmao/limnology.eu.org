{"title":"Research on Catalytic Pyrolysis Process of Coconut Coat of Tropical Agricultural and Forestry Wastes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1596/v1","date":1726979866000,"content":"The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, heating rate, nitrogen flow rate and catalyst quality on the oil yield and oxygen content in the oil were investigated by using the single factor principle. Too high and too low reaction temperature, nitrogen flow rate, heating rate and reaction time have improved the yield of bio-oil, but the oxygen content in bio-oil is higher. The reduction of catalytic dose is beneficial to the increase of oil yield but not conducive to the increase of aromatic compound content. The optimal reaction conditions were observed as reaction temperature of 500℃, nitrogen flow rate of 110 mL/min, heating rate of 20℃/min, reaction time of 15min, mass ratio of catalyst to coconut coat powder was 1, and the oil yield was 4.97%, aquatic yield was 35.80%, and solid yield was 30.78%. The gas yield was 28.45%, the oxygen content was 10.3%, and the aromatic compound content was 89.7%.The analysis of catalytic cracking mechanism shows that most of the oxygen-containing compounds in the bio-oil are generated into water and aromatic compounds by catalytic cracking reaction at high temperature, thus removing oxygen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a215d04285214d5ac28982bdcb618f77a7e08a22dd531ccf106d4edb72204b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
