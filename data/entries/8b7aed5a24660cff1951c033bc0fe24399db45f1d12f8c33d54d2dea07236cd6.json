The first aberration correction in SEM was achieved using multipole correctors [<a href=\"#ozae044.320-B1\">1</a>]. Since then, the field has been focused on correcting optics and improving the initial designs. These aberration correctors are very expensive and not easy to tune. Another approach to aberration correction can be wavefront-sensing based correction [<a href=\"#ozae044.320-B2\">2</a>]. In that regard, probe intensity and phase information become pivotal. Recently, there has been an effort to reconstruct probe intensity [<a href=\"#ozae044.320-B3\">3-6</a>] and probe phase using the reconstructed intensities [<a href=\"#ozae044.320-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.320-B8\">8</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8b7aed5a24660cff1951c033bc0fe24399db45f1d12f8c33d54d2dea07236cd6","category":"Environment"}
