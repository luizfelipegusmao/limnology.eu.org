{"title":"In vitro and in vivo digestibility of prebiotic galactooligosacharides synthesized by β‐galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbruecki subsp. bulgaricus CRL450","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13504?af=R","date":1712923399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The general assumption that prebiotics reach the colon without any alterations has been challenged. Some <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies have demonstrated that ‘non-digestible’ oligosaccharides are digested to different degrees depending on their structural composition. In the present study, we compared different methods aiming to assess the digestibility of oligosaccharides synthesized by <i>β</i>-galactosidase (<i>β</i>-gal) of <i>Lactobacillus delbruecki</i> subsp. <i>bulgaricus</i> CRL450 (CRL450-<i>β</i>-gal) from lactose, lactulose and lactitol.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In the simulated gastrointestinal fluid method, no changes were observed. However, the oligosaccharides synthesized by CRL450-<i>β</i>-gal were partially hydrolyzed <i>in vitro</i>, depending on their structure and composition, with rat small intestinal extract (RSIE) and small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from pig. Digestion of some oligosaccharides increased when mixtures were fed to C57BL/6 mice used as <i>in vivo</i> model; however, lactulose-oligosaccharides were the most resistant to the physiological conditions of mice. In general <i>β</i> (1→6) linked products showed higher resistance compared to <i>β</i> (1→3) oligosaccharides.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>In vitro</i> digestion methods, without disaccharidases, may underestimate the importance of carbohydrates hydrolysis in the small intestine. Although BVMM and RSIE digestion assays are appropriate <i>in vitro</i> methods for these studies, <i>in vivo</i> studies remain the most reliable for understanding what actually happens in the digestion of oligosaccharides. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Agustina Fara, \nOswaldo Hernández Hernández, \nJorge Palacios, \nAntonia Montilla, \nGabriela Zárate","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4b73847482f180c73e095711d5762d4015b964c56a30d9db3e2f61a9edd5895b","category":"Environment"}
