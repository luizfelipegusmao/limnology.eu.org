{"title":"Unveiling salinity-driven shifts in microbial community composition across compartments of naturally saline inland streams","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05479-5","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Riverine environments host diverse microbial communities, exhibiting distinctive assemblies at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. Despite the complexity of microbial life in rivers, the underlying factors that shape the community structure across different compartments remain elusive. Herein, we characterized microbial community composition of biofilm and planktonic (water column) compartments in five naturally saline inland streams and a freshwater stream to examine changes in microbial communities following salinization via sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene. Significant differences in specific conductivity, oxidationâ€“reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and pH among the sampled streams were measured, as were significant differences in the microbial community composition between the planktonic and biofilm. The bacterial families <em>Bacillaceae</em>, <em>Vicinamibacterceae</em>, and <em>Micrococcaceae</em> were significantly more abundant in the biofilm compartment, while <em>Methylophilaceae, Alcaligenaceae, Spirosomaceae, Burkholderiaceae,</em> and <em>Comamonadaceae</em> were more abundant in the planktonic compartment. In addition, salinity (based on specific conductivity) influenced the microbial community composition in both compartments, with higher sensitivity of the planktonic compartment. Increases in the bacterial families <em>Shewanellaceae</em>, <em>Marinomonadaceae</em>, and <em>Saccharospirillaceae</em> or loss of <em>Anaeromyxobacteraceae</em> could be indicative of increased salinity within inland streams. Our results suggest that monitoring of microbial assemblages of freshwater ecosystems could be used as early warning signs of increased salinization levels.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"f895485cbfec03bc25611aec48abd54e5a5cb8c927988ce5ead5ae619bdfc3ac","category":"Environment"}
