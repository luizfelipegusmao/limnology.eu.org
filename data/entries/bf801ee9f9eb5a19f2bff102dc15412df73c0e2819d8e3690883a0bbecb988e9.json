{"title":"Innovative Cross-sectional Configurations for Low-Cost Bamboo Composite (LCBC) Structural Columns","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0293/v1","date":1719981419000,"content":"This paper investigates the effect of innovative cross-sectional configurations on Low-Cost Bamboo Composite (LCBC) structural members. The study employs both experimental and numerical methods with different resin matrices and bamboo species. In this study, LCBC short columns are designed with different innovative cross-sectional configurations in an attempt to overcome the costly production processes of engineered bamboo. This approach uses bundles of bamboo, both in culm and strip forms. A compatible, environmentally responsible, and economically justifiable resin matrix is used to fabricate an LCBC member. The production of LCBC members does not necessitate highly advanced technology. This capability enables the production of LCBC members in custom-designed cross-sectional shapes and lengths. This study introduces the Russian doll (RD), Big Russian doll (BRD), Hawser (HAW), and Scrimber (SCR) cross-sectional configurations. Extra-large, large, medium, and small sizes of bamboo are employed. Synthetic Epoxy (EXP), a Bio-based Experimental soft filler (BE1), Bio-Epoxy (BE2), Furan-based (PF1) matrices are applied. Furthermore, Moso, Guadua, Madake, and Tali bamboo species are incorporated. The results of this study reveal that the most efficient cross-sectional configuration for compressive strength is the HAW configuration, closely followed by SCR configuration. LCBC members with bio-resins have shown excellent promise in competing in strength with those made with their synthetic counterparts. The theoretical and numerical modeling of the LCBC members showed excellent correlation with the experimental results which provides the capacity to design LCBC for engineering projects. The LCBC design can be further developed with more bamboo and less resin content.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf801ee9f9eb5a19f2bff102dc15412df73c0e2819d8e3690883a0bbecb988e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
