{"title":"Development of an Eco-Friendly Nanogel Incorporating Pectis brevipedunculata Essential Oil as Larvicidal Agent Against Aedes aegypti","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2001/v1","date":1727259031000,"content":"Arboviruses, transmitted by mosquitoes like Aedes aegypti, pose significant public health challenges globally, particularly in tropical regions. The rapid spread and adaptation of viruses such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya have emphasized the need for innovative control methods. Larvicide property of essential oils has emerged as a potential alternative to conventional insecticides. This work showed the development of an eco-friendly nanogel using a low-energy, solvent-free method, incorporating the copolymer F127 and carbopol 974p with a high concentration of essential oil from Pectis brevipedunculata (Gardner) Sch.Bip. (Pb). The resulting nanogel displayed excellent physical stability and was maintained under varying temperature conditions. Characterization techniques, including FTIR and DLS, confirmed the stable incorporation of essential oil (EOPb) within the nanogel matrix. The in vitro assays against Aedes aegypti larvae revealed that at 500 μg/mL, the mortality rates was 96.0% ± 7.0 after 24 h and 100.0% ± 0.0 after 48 h. The positive control group treated with temephos, achieved 100% mortality at both time points, validating the experimental conditions and providing a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of the nGF2002Pb nanogel. These results indicate that the nGF2002Pb demonstrates a pronounced concentration-dependent larvicidal effect against Aedes aegypti, offering an innovative and sustainable approach for arbovirus vector control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d4421dbaa07b30191f892e4d38e7ed62683bf35519c31d31fde78c05863d936","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
