{"title":"The Original M2 And M6 Mouse Models Of Glioblastoma: Morphological And Molecular Characteristics Of Transplanted Tumor Tissue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0363/v1","date":1720076779000,"content":"Important tumor biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and mechanisms of tumorigenesis were discovered in animal models. Mouse models of malignant gliomas were represented by transplantable, chemically-induced, and genetically-engineered cells. The aim of the study was to investigate the morphological, molecular, and immunological characteristics of two original glioblastoma (GB) strains, M2 and M6. These are new, chemically-induced, trans-plantable tissue models of malignant diffuse mouse glioma. Tissues from M2 GB and M6 GB were transplanted into immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. The clinical manifestations of M2 GB and M6 GB growth in mice include motility disorders, cachexia, and priapism. Morphologically, M2 GB and M6 GB are characterized by diffuse proliferation, cellular and nuclear polymorphism, high mitotic activity, and pathological forms of mitosis due to the aggressive nature of these tumors. Flow cytometry showed that CD3+ T lymphocytes (~32%) and F4/80+ macrophages (~28-50%) highly infiltrated both tumors. M2 GB had higher levels of F4/80+ macrophages than M6 GB. Cdkn2a, S100b, Mki67, Pten, Vegfa, Hif1a, Sox2, Abcb1, and Gfap genes were overexpressed in both tumors. Cd133, Tp53, and Pdgfra expression was increased in M2 GB. High expression of Pi3k and Gdnf was observed in M6 GB. Expression of Cd44, Pi3k, Hif1a, Gdnf and Egfr was higher in the M6 GB tissues com-pared to M2 GB, while Cdkn2a, Tp53, Cd133 and Pdgfra were higher in the M2 GB tissue compared to M6 GB. The transplantable M2 GB and M6 GB tissue models have intratumor immune responses, clinical and morphological features similar to human GB, as well as gene expression patterns that are important for further studies on tumorigenesis. These models can be used to develop diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and study carcino-genesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a261f06c99436db5081a2bb3d230dbef34cc18be395b839380fea1fc264f240b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
