{"title":"Additive Manufacturing of Ti3AlC2/TiC and Ti3AlC2/SiC Ceramics Using Fused Granules Fabrication Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0134/v1","date":1714637837000,"content":"In this work SiC-Ti3AlC2 and TiC-Ti3AlC2 composites produced by additive manufacturing are investigated. The fused granules fabrication (FGF) method as one of the material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) technology is used to obtain composite samples. Composites with different ratios between components and different powder:polymer ratios are investigated. The technological features of the additive formation of composites are investigated, as well as their structure and properties. The optimal sintering temperature to form the best mechanical properties for both composites is 1300 Â°C. The composites have a regulatable porosity. Ti3AlC2 content, sintering temperature, and polymer content in the feedstock are the main parameters that regulates the porosity of FGF samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63cd09c0b24bfb36ef747d89046fc7c6c459540694b040383ebdf7d2d4579784","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
