{"title":"Ipsa Senectus Morbus Est? Approaching the Unmet Needs in Geriatric Depression: Results From a National Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1678/v1","date":1719300589000,"content":"Depressive disorders represent the leading contributors to mental health-related global burden, and they are often diagnosed in the context of many comorbid disorders, such as cardiovascular disorders, Stroke, Parkinson’s Disease, Major Neurocognitive Disorders and Headache, thus worsening their outcomes. Depression is a challenge for “real-world” clinicians, due to the low rates of remission despite the increasing number of antidepressant strategies currently available. Indeed, current antidepressant strategies often fail to achieve acceptable rates of remission. One of the main challenges of “real-world” management of depression is represented by geriatric depression, which is common and under diagnosed. The challenge of diagnosis and treatment of geriatric depression in real world calls for the need of a deeper exploration of its management in clinical practice. This is the purpose of the present cross-sectional survey, aimed at evaluating the clinical approach to late-life depression in a sample of expert physicians working in geriatric settings in Italy, thus trying to provide useful insights on geriatric depression care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67db54bc4a09f4970f1360c2b3a98e088a91f182f198e13ae4598f68e36d532a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
