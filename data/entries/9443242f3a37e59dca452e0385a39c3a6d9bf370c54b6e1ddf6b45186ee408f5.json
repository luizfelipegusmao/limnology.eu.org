{"title":"MAX control: SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 (SMAX)1-LIKE (SMXL) proteins repress growth in Physcomitrium patens","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1574/7578684?rss=1","date":1705968000000,"content":"<span>The KAI2 ligand (KL) is one or several unknown signaling molecule(s) involved in important plant processes, potentially representing an unidentified phytohormone. KL signaling, while interconnected with strigolactone (SL) signaling, distinctly influences plant development and photomorphogenesis. Both pathways utilize closely related receptor proteins, and in angiosperms, these receptors bind to the same F-box protein, MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2), initiating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 (SMAX)1-LIKE (SMXL) proteins. Intriguingly, in the moss <span>Physcomitrium patens</span>, SL signaling is independent of MAX2 (<a href=\"#koae016-B2\">Lopez-Obando et al. 2018</a>), highlighting a unique aspect of this organism's biology. Previous research has explored multiple KL and SL receptors in <span>P. patens</span>, assigning them to their signaling pathways (<a href=\"#koae016-B3\">Lopez-Obando et al. 2021</a>). In a new study, Ambre Guillory and colleagues (<a href=\"#koae016-B1\">Guillory et al. 2024</a>) now demonstrate that SMXL proteins act as negative growth regulators in <span>P. patens</span>, functioning downstream of MAX2 in the KL signaling pathway.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"9443242f3a37e59dca452e0385a39c3a6d9bf370c54b6e1ddf6b45186ee408f5","category":"Environment"}
