{"title":"Novel Aspects in the Voltametric Determination of Heavy Metals: A Minireview","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1924/v1","date":1716959012000,"content":"Heavy metals represent a class of chemical elements that includes metalloids, bases and transition metals, lanthanides and actinides. They are distinguished for their toxicity in small concentrations and for their negative effects on the environment and human health. They are present in various samples, mainly in water, industrial waste and food. The determination of heavy metals is carried out mainly by analytical methods, using spectroscopy, spectrometry and electroanalysis, while studies are being carried out for the development of new and faster methodologies and techniques for their analysis, with particular emphasis on voltammetry. This review deals with the determination of heavy metals mainly in environmental samples (water) using voltammetry. In particular, the methods of their determination are evaluated in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and applicability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82416eb9dfaa4a30e11a51a79d4a7a3dcbe54bb0624a2d9584e2467022491f80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
