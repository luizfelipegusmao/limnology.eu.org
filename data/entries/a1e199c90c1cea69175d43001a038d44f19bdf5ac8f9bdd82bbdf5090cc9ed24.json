{"title":"Evolutionary and Phylogenetic Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Variants: A Genetic Comparative Study of Taiyuan and Wuhan Cities of China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1459/v1","date":1713853767000,"content":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive sense single stranded RNA genome containing virus which has infected millions of people all over the world particularly China. The virus has been mutating rapidly enough resulting in the emergence of new variants and sub-variants which have reportedly been spread from Wuhan city of China, the epicenter of the virus, to the rest of China and all over the world. The occurrence of mutations in the viral genome especially in the viral spike protein region has resulted in the evolution of multiple variants and sub-variants which gives the virus benefit of host immune evasion and render the modern-day vaccines and therapeutics ineffective. Therefore, there is a continuous need to study the genetic characteristics and evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Hence, in this study, a total of 833 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 variants (including the wild-type or reference sequence) from Taiyuan and Wuhan cities of China were genetically characterized and studies their phylogenetic and evolutionary dynamics using phylogenetics, genetic similarity, and phylogenetic network analysis. Our results show a lot of useful information regarding the evolutionary dynamics of the viral variants, their genetic similarities/dissimilarities, and their phylogenetic relationships. It has been reported in this study that the SARS-CoV-2 variants have nine recombinant events which suggest very important information regarding the viral evolution. In addition, the phylogenetic network analysis shows the number of mutations resulting in emergence and clustering of the viral variants of both cities which reveal significant information regarding the phylodynamics of the virus. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first ever genetic comparative study of Taiyuan and Wuhan cities. This study will help better understand the virus, cope with the emergence, and spread of new variants at local level as well as at international level and inform the public health authorities to make better informed decisions in designing new viral vaccines and therapeutics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1e199c90c1cea69175d43001a038d44f19bdf5ac8f9bdd82bbdf5090cc9ed24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
