This study aims to estimate OOP costs incurred by cancer patients, assess their productivity loss, and analyse the financial coping mechanisms employed by individuals within the lower-income bracket. The study employed face-to-face interviews among cancer patients aged 40 years and above, currently undergoing treatment, and belonging to the lower-income group. Participants were recruited from six public cancer referral hospitals. OOP expenses, encompassing medical and non-medical costs, along with productivity loss, were measured. A generalized linear model was applied to identify potential OOP determinants. Additionally, the coping mechanisms employed by individuals to finance their cancer OOP expenses were also determined. Among the 430 participants recruited, predominantly female (63.5%), and aged 60 or older (53.9%). The annual mean total cancer costs per patient were US$ 2,398.28 (±2,168.74), including 15% for medical costs US$ 350.95 (±560.24), 34% for non-medical costs US$820.24 (±818.24), and 51% for productivity loss costs US$1,227.09 (±1,809.09). Transportation, nutritional supplements, outpatient treatment, and medical supplies were notable cost contributors to total OOP expenditures. Ethnicity (β = 1.44; 95%CI = 1.15–1.79), household income (β = 1.40; 95%CI = 1.10–1.78), annual outpatient visits (β = 1.00; 95%CI = 1.00–1.01), age (β = 0.74; 95%CI = 0.56–0.98), and employment status (β = 0.54; 95%CI = 0.72–1.34) were identified as significant predictors of OOP costs among cancer patients. Notably, 91% of participants relied on household salaries and savings, while 15% resorted to interest-free borrowing, 11% sold possessions, and 0.5% borrowed with interest to finance their expenses. This study offers crucial insights into the economic impact of cancer on individuals and their families, providing policymakers with valuable information to tackle challenges faced in their journey. Despite substantial public healthcare subsidies, the study revealed that cancer costs can remain a potential barrier to accessing essential treatment. Therefore, there is a need for reinforced system-level infrastructure to facilitate targeted financial navigation services.","author":"Farhana Aminuddin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"752cc1bcbef2144f434d9cd076b8b4644d8c26f03c0ca1624cbafa2c40b1d341","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
