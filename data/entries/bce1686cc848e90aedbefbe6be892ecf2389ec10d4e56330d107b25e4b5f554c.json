{"title":"Cement Clinker Modified by Photocatalyst &ndash; Selected Mechanical Properties and Photocatalytic Activity during NO and BTEX Decomposition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2179/v1","date":1724934529000,"content":"In this paper, a new way to obtain photoactive cements was presented. In this method amorphous TiO2 is added to cooler during the cooling of the cement clinker (Górażdże company) during cement production. Amorphous TiO2 was taken from the installation for obtaining titanium dioxide using the sulphate method. During the studies amorphous TiO2 was added to clinker at different temperature 300, 600, 700 and 800 °C. The properties of the obtained cement were tested during the bending and compressive strength and beginning and the end of bending setting time measurements. The adhesion of the obtained materials to concrete block, ceramic brick and plasterboard were also evaluated. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained materials was studied during NO and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-,m-,o-xylenes decomposition) decomposition. Cement with 5 wt.% TiO2 added to clinker at 700 C had the highest photocatalytic activity and the best mechanical properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bce1686cc848e90aedbefbe6be892ecf2389ec10d4e56330d107b25e4b5f554c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
