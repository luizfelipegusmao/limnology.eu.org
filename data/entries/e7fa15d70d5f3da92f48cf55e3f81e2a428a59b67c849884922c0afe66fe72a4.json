{"title":"Development of management indicators of nursing for minimizing physical restraints focused on older adult patients hospitalized in acute care settings: A Delphi consensus study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306920","date":1720620000000,"content":"<p>by Maya Minamizaki, Mana Doi, Yuka Kanoya</p>\r\n\r\nNursing management activities are important in influencing staff nurses’ action to prevent or withdraw physical restraints. However, limited studies have been conducted empirically to determine the nursing management activities required for minimizing physical restraints. Therefore, there is a need for basic standards of nursing management activities to minimize physical restraints in acute care settings. This study aimed to develop nursing management indicators to minimize physical restraint (MaIN-PR) in hospitalized older adult patients in an acute care setting. It was conducted between June and October 2021 in Japan using a Delphi consensus approach. Fifty nurses working at top or middle management levels or as certified nurse specialists in gerontological nursing enrolled as participants. The potential indicators obtained from the literature review and interviews were organized inductively to develop two types of draft indicators: (1) 35 items for top management and (2) 33 items for middle management. We asked the nursing managers and certified nurse specialists in gerontological nursing to assess the validity of each indicator in three rounds. Of the 50 initial panelists, 12 from top management and 13 from middle management continued till the third round. MaIN-PR contained 35 indicators for top management and 28 indicators for middle management and were classified into the following six metrics: planning, motivating, training, commanding, organizing, and controlling. To the best of our knowledge, the current MaIN-PR are the first set of nursing management indicators for minimizing physical restraint, including perspectives on geriatric nursing in acute care settings. These indicators could guide both top and middle nursing management, thus supporting staff nurses’ judgment in minimizing physical restraints to enhance the quality of older adult patient care.","author":"Maya Minamizaki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e7fa15d70d5f3da92f48cf55e3f81e2a428a59b67c849884922c0afe66fe72a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
