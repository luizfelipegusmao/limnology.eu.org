{"title":"Extraction Methods for Carotenoids, Xanthophylls and Chlorophylls","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2306/v1","date":1722251568000,"content":"The extraction methods for carotenoids, xanthophylls and chlorophylls are essential processes involved in the recovery of bioactive compounds from a wide variety of natural sources, including plants, marine organisms, microorganisms and animals. These bioactive compounds, characterized by their significant functional and structurally active properties, play a crucial role in various industries, such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and food. Due to their presence in small quantities and conjugated form in nature, the extraction of these compounds can be laborious and often requires meticulous purification steps. Interestingly, the primary and secondary metabolites present in plants contribute significantly to the production of these bioactive compounds, adding to their complexity and importance. Notably, carotenoids, as natural pigments with antioxidant and nutritional properties, are known for offering numerous health benefits and are instrumental in various biological processes, including the photoprotection of plants and the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. It is fascinating to observe that by-products generated from agricultural activities and food processing serve as abundant sources of these bioactive compounds, aligning with the principles of the circular economy and sustainable resource management. Given the diverse health benefits and multifaceted applications of these natural pigments, there is a growing interest in not only extracting but also utilizing them for industrial, nutritional and pharmacological purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9c77fa7f64bc569525a8873fda51f7bfd0cc3b674652df1573fd8adfb89b730","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
