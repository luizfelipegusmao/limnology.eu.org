{"title":"Theory of Morphodynamic Information Processing: Linking Sensing to Behaviour","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.1210/v2","date":1725446731000,"content":"The traditional understanding of brain function has predominantly focused on chemical and electrical processes. However, new research in fruit fly (Drosophila) binocular vision reveals ultrafast photomechanical photoreceptor movements significantly enhance information processing, thereby impacting a fly's perception of its environment and behaviour. The coding advantages resulting from these mechanical processes suggest that similar physical motion-based coding strategies may affect neural communication ubiquitously. The theory of neural morphodynamics proposes that rapid biomechanical movements and microstructural changes at the level of neurons and synapses enhance the speed and efficiency of sensory information processing, intrinsic thoughts, and actions by regulating neural information in a phasic manner. We propose that morphodynamic information processing evolved to drive predictive coding, synchronising cognitive processes across neural networks to match the behavioural demands at hand effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"777889961143fbc1f85d7e8d89ae2434a66cf32f640026999ed7e919a7803926","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
