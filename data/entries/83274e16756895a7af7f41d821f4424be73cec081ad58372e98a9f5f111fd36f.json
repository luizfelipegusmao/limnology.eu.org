{"title":"Performance of Linear and Spiral Hashing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0413/v1","date":1720079068000,"content":"Linear Hashing is an important algorithm for many key-value stores. Spiral Storage was invented to overcome the poor fringe behavior of Linear Hashing, but after an influential study by Larson, seems to have been discarded. Since almost 50 years have passed, we repeat Larsonâ€™s comparison with in-memory implementation of both to see whether his verdict still stands. Our study shows that Spiral Storage has slightly better look-up performance, but slightly poorer insert performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83274e16756895a7af7f41d821f4424be73cec081ad58372e98a9f5f111fd36f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
