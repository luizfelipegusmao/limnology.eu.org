{"title":"Feeding habits of the deep-sea shrimp Plesionika quasigrandis Chace, 1985 (Decapoda: Caridea: Pandalidae) in the southeastern Arabian Sea","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae041/7714362?rss=1","date":1721088000000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>Species of <span>Plesionika</span><a href=\"#CIT0038\">Spence Bate, 1888</a> holds significant importance in the commercial harvesting of deep-sea shrimps along the southern coasts of India. Despite <span>Plesionika quasigrandis</span><a href=\"#CIT0012\">Chace, 1985</a> being a crucial resource on the southwest coast of India, there is a need for comprehensive information on its food and feeding habits. We investigated the diet of <span>P. quasigrandis</span> in relation to sex, size, and season. The species exhibited a diet primarily consisting of crustaceans, foraminiferans, and detritus. Both males and females showed a noteworthy reliance on detritus, as indicated by an index of preponderance values exceeding 45.8. The species displayed active scavenging behaviour alongside predatory dietary habits. We observed a decrease in feeding intensity from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon in both males and females. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed significant differences in the diets of <span>P. quasigrandis</span>, considering the combined effects of size and sex (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). No significant distinctions were noted in the diet composition between males and females in relation to season.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"979932b69a1721f14648546567130873c1b80824885130f6fb052b72d1746070","category":"Environment"}
