{"title":"Consciousness = Metaphysics + Physics + Biology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0647/v1","date":1725874103000,"content":"Theories about consciousness—what it is/is not; who does/does not possess it; included/excluded functional modes; how/when it appears to be operational—are regularly published in books and articles. This essay opines that while many, if not most, of those speculations contain elements properly subsumed within a comprehensive doctrine, none satisfactorily fulfills its subject’s immense scope. Consciousness = Metaphysics + Physics + Biology is intended to rectify the situation by providing omitted components. As the title states, this is a wide-ranging approach neglecting many relevant details found in cited references, but also including ideas not found elsewhere in the easily accessible literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8726251a7c97aa2d84e313c60baf18de76f1265ca8001f466f4bf6a4265d9d37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
