However, the complex mechanisms underlying these blooms make prediction and prevention challenging. Here, we employed empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and machine learning to reveal the causes and predict diatom blooms from 2003 to 2017 in the Han River of China. The diatom cell density ranged from 0.1 to 5.1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells L<sup>−1</sup>, whereas algal blooms often lasted for 10 days with density exceeding 10<sup>7</sup> cells L<sup>−1</sup>. The EDM results elucidated that, under consistent high nutrient concentrations, algal blooms were primarily regulated by eight environmental factors: water temperature in the Han River; water levels, flow velocities, and streamflow discharges in the Han River and the Yangtze River; and water level variation in the Han River. The poor performance (coefficient of determination <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0) of the multiple linear regression, EDM, and random forest models indicated the challenge of predicting algae density. Therefore, we used machine learning classification models to predict algal blooms occurrences. With the resampling techniques to account for imbalanced data, machine learning models achieved perfect classification prediction (Kappa value = 1) of the 13 algae-bloom events with a 10-day lead time during a 15-year period, providing an important reference for preemptive warning of riverine algal blooms.</p>","author":"Jing Tian, \nGangsheng Wang, \nDaifeng Xiang, \nSheng Huang, \nWanyu Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"e28dce43b0e1a0ec01d11906c98418ac74f0fc04ad3d79b7eb7e0b90b7eff3ba","category":"Environment"}
