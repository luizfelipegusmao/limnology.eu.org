{"title":"Effects of bamboo leaf flavonoids on growth performance, antioxidants, immune function, intestinal morphology, and cecal microbiota in broilers","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13602?af=R","date":1722924325000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Bamboo leaf flavonoids (BLF) are the main bioactive ingredients in bamboo leaves. They have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and other effects. In this study, the effects of dietary BLF on growth performance, immune response, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microbiota of broilers were investigated. A total of 288 broilers were divided into three groups with eight replicates and 12 birds in each replicate. Broilers were fed a basic diet or the basic diet supplemented with 1000 or 2000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> BLF for 56 days.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that supplementation of BLF increased body weight (BW) and average daily weight gain (ADG), and reduced average daily feed intake (ADFI) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) content of broilers in the BLF1000 group was increased and the interleukin 1<i>β</i> (IL-1<i>β</i>) and tumor necrosis factor-<i>α</i> (TNF-<i>α</i>) content was decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The levels of IgM and IL-10 in jejunum mucosa were found to be enhanced by BLF (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The BLF1000 group exhibited a significant reduction in the concentration of TNF-<i>α</i> (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Serum and jejunum mucosa total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels in the BLF1000 group were increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The serum catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) effects of the BLF1000 group and serum CAT effects of BLF2000 group were increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The CON group demonstrated a lower relative abundance of <i>Christensenellaceae</i>_R-7_group and <i>Oscillibacter</i> than the BLF group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Dietary BLF inclusion enhanced the growth performance, immune, and antioxidant functions, improved the intestinal morphology, and ameliorated the intestinal microflora structure in broiler. Adding 1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> BLF to the broiler diet can be considered as an effective growth promoter. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chao Wu, \nHui Ma, \nShuwan Lu, \nXueyan Shi, \nJinsong Liu, \nCaimei Yang, \nRuiqiang Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ddabda15a2fb88585d5811ce779b3a37120c8c34a38ebb488d3904b62179c3e8","category":"Environment"}
