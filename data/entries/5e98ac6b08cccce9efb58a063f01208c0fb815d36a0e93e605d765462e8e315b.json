{"title":"Oxidative Stress and Antioxidation in Testicular Leydig: Implications for Male Fertility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1855/v1","date":1729695706000,"content":"Leydig cells, pivotal for male fertility, undergo significant oxidative stress due to their proximity to macrophages and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by extracellular structures. This stress disrupts Leydig cell function, impairing steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis, ultimately leading to male infertility. Oxidative stress triggers apoptosis and inhibits testosterone production, crucial for spermatogenesis regulation. Understanding the mechanisms of oxidative stress and antioxidation on Leydig cells is vital. Some studies highlight the role of antioxidants in mitigating oxidative damage, emphasizing critical pathway of Sirt1 in oxidative stress and Nrf2 in antioxidation. Future research should focus on screening antioxidant substances and optimizing antioxidant dosages for Leydig cell protection and testosterone restoration, thereby enhancing reproductive performance. This review provides insights into combating male infertility by addressing Leydig cell oxidative stress and antioxidation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e98ac6b08cccce9efb58a063f01208c0fb815d36a0e93e605d765462e8e315b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
