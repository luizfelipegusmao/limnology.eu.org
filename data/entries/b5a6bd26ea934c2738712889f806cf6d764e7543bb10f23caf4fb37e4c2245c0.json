{"title":"Preliminary Study on the Restoration of the Phospholipid Profile in Serum from Patients with COVID-19 by Treatment with Vitamin E","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0539/v1","date":1718004494000,"content":"SARS-CoV-2 is an obligatory intracellular pathogen that requires of a lipid bilayer membrane for its transport, to build its nucleocapsid envelope and to fuse with the host cell. The biological membranes are constituted by phospholipids (PLs) and vitamin E (Vit E) protects them from oxidative stress (OS). The aim of this study was to demonstrate if the treatment with Vit E restores the modified profile of the FA in PLs in serum from patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). We evaluated Vit E, total fatty acids (TFA), fatty acid of the phospholipids (FAPL), total phospholipids (TPLs), 8-isoprostane, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandins (PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum from 22 COVID-19 patients before and after treatment with Vit E and compared the values with those from 23 healthy subjects (HS). COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in Vit E, TPLs, FAPL and TFA in serum in comparison to HS (p≤0.01) and Vit E treatment restored their levels (p≤0.04). Likewise, there was an increase IL-6 and CRP in COVID-19 patients in comparison with HS (p≤0.001) and the treatment with Vit E decreased their levels (p≤0.001). Treatment with Vit E contributes to restore the modified profile of the PLs in the SARS-CoV-2 infection and this leads to a decrease of OS and of the inflammatory process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5a6bd26ea934c2738712889f806cf6d764e7543bb10f23caf4fb37e4c2245c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
