A laser is focused into a liquid ink, triggering a reaction that solidifies the ink. Besides polymers, recent efforts focus on the printing of non-organic materials. However, the latter usually require post-processing steps at high temperatures, limiting the use of multi-material architectures since high temperatures affect the polymer structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.616-B3\">3</a>]. Recent advancements in direct printing of semiconducting ZnO using hydrothermal synthesis have allowed for direct laser printing of functional microelectronic devices without post-processing [<a href=\"#ozae044.616-B3\">3</a>]. However, the presence of water in the ink leads to severe bubble formation during laser heating due to the relatively low boiling point of water (100 °C). The current study explores an alternative approach using dimethyl sulfoxid (DMSO, boiling point of 189 °C) for photothermal printing of ZnO crystals with sub-µm feature sizes. Using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that single crystalline ZnO can be printed on amorphous substrates, opening the possibility of new applications, e.g., printed piezoelectric devices. Still, a better understanding of the growth of the ZnO crystals is required for improved control over the fabrication of the printed structures and their electronic properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2a093baa80f809da48904108feb69997bcc99f3640fc2aeefed0a8bf471edca3","category":"Environment"}
