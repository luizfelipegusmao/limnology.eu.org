{"title":"Preparation of transition metal‐modified biochar materials and their effects on the removal of bisphenol A by persulfate activation","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14348?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Metal-loaded biochar (BC) catalytic systems are widely used for the removal of organic pollutants. However, there is still a lack of relevant research on the impact of different preparation conditions on the performance of synthetic materials. In the present research, CuO and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were loaded on the surface of Ginkgo biloba BC by a hydrothermal method and a chemical co-precipitation method to prepare carbon-based metal catalytic materials. Bisphenol A (BPA) was selected as the target pollutant to study the activation effect of the metal-loaded BC to persulfate (PS). The results showed that the catalytic performance of the CuO/BC materials was better than that of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/BC and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/CuO/BC. By exploring the influence of the preparation process on the catalytic performance, it can be obtained that the optimal calcination temperature was 350°C and the optimal loading ratio was 2.5:1(w/w) for CuO/BC materials. The CuO/BC prepared under this condition could remove 81.5% of BPA within 60 min. The research results are beneficial to promote the efficient utilization of metal-loaded BC in the field of organic pollutant removal.</p>","author":"Li Hua, \nHui Zhao, \nFanglin Dang, \nLumengfei Yu, \nTing Wei","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"ba6a5618849a48dd6d6ef7c47367d590d1f6f6e4488e57341966d8fa8eaf61d3","category":"Environment"}
