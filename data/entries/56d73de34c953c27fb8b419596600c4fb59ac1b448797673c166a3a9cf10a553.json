{"title":"Joint position and force senses in young female tennis players and untrained adolescents","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312483","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Bartłomiej Niespodziński, Tomasz Waldziński, Aleksandra Durzyńska, Jan Mieszkowski, Małgorzata Knaś, Andrzej Kochanowicz</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of the study was to determine the differences between tennis players and untrained peers in the development of upper limb proprioception in 10–15-year-olds. A group of 67 girls (12.75 ± 1.46 years old), including 33 tennis players and 34 age-matched untrained controls, was divided into three age groups: A1, 10–11-years-old; A2, 12–13-years-old; and A3, 14–15-years-old. Joint position sense (JPS) and force sense (FS) were assessed by reproducing memorized target angle or torque value of three joints: glenohumeral, elbow, and radiocarpal. The JPS error for the elbow joint in group A1 was 71% and 80% higher (p &lt; 0.01) than that in groups A2 and A3, respectively, and the performance of all tennis players was 27.5% (p = 0.01) better than that of untrained controls. For FS, proprioception of only the more demanding task tested (reproduction of 50% maximal voluntary contraction) and specific function (elbow and radiocarpal extension, and glenohumeral internal rotation) showed development with age. The error values for elbow extension (A1, A2) and the glenohumeral joint (A3) of tennis players were lower than those of age-matched controls. We conclude that the development of FS in the upper limb varied and was related to the specific functions and joints. The 10–13-year-old tennis players showed elbow extensor FS performance at the level of the older participants, while the 14–15-year-old tennis players were characterized with superior FS internal rotation performance in the glenohumeral joint.","author":"Bartłomiej Niespodziński","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"56d73de34c953c27fb8b419596600c4fb59ac1b448797673c166a3a9cf10a553","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
