The polymer films containing a photoacid generator and commercially available photon upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) were decomposed to form isobutene and/or carbon dioxide by irradiation of NIR and subsequent heating. The thermal decomposition behaviors of the polymers were investigated and discussed in terms of the chemical structures of degradable units. The thermal stability of the polymers was found to be in the order: tertiary ester &gt; tertiary carbonate. We believe that the degradation of NIR and subsequent heating contributes easy recycling of composite materials.</p>","author":"Haruyuki Okamura, \nKiwa Mihono","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"11fd7efd438c941169e270c3499244a900bd6d91860309995d301c3b7469d287","category":"Environment"}
