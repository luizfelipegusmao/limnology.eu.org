{"title":"Effect of sorghum bran addition on antioxidant activities, sensory properties, and in vitro starch digestibility of Chinese southern‐style steamed bread","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13790?af=R","date":1722603297000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Chinese steamed bread (CSB) is one of the most important staple foods in China and is also popular in South-East Asia. Developing functional CSB could improve people's resistance to inflammatory and non inflammatory diseases. This work investigated the effect of sorghum bran addition on antioxidant activities, sensory properties, and <i>in vitro</i> starch digestibility of Chinese southern-style steamed bread (CSSB).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, the enhanced CSSB with 0–200 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of fine black and tannin (sumac) sorghum bran addition was developed. A small change in phenol content and antioxidant activity was observed at various stages in the processing procedure before steaming. Moreover, a high retention of antioxidant phenolics CSSB with sorghum bran addition was observed. Sorghum bran addition significantly increased the total phenol content and antioxidant activity of CSSB by 4.5–10 times, on average, relative to control. Sorghum bran addition significantly also increased the content of resistant starch, and significantly decreased <i>in vitro</i> starch digestibility in CSSB; these effects were likely due to the joint inhibitory effect of tannins and ferulic acid on starch digestibility. Interestingly, the sorghum bran breads scored higher or similar to control in sensory color preference and overall appearance, but lower on most textural and mouthfeel attributes.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Sorghum bran addition significantly increased the antioxidant activity of CSSB and significantly decreased starch digestibility. Moreover, the color and appearance properties were maintained or improved. However, the sensorial textural attributes were negatively impacted by the sorghum bran substitutions. Strategies to improve the texture of bran-fortified breads would likely enhance their consumer acceptability. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Pingping Zhang, \nJoseph M Awika","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e6fbe9a792cee0013ebdcb3c14675bbb3d8ffa973a5e331ee2235ddf6f0336d0","category":"Environment"}
