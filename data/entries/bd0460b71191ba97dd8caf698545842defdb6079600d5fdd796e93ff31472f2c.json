This study evaluated the quality of CT and revealed the mechanism of its quality formation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The CT had a significant citrus flavor and a good antioxidant activity, and its sensory quality was superior to that of GT. Headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC–MS) analysis revealed that the scenting process resulted in a significant increase of alkenes such as β-pinene, trans-β-ocimene, α-farnesene, isoterpinolene, and γ-terpinene, as well as a significant decrease of alcohols such as α-terpineol, L-menthol, and linalool in CT in comparision with GT. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis revealed that the levels of flavonoids (such as neohesperidin, hesperidin, tangeritin, hesperetin 5-O-glucoside, and nobiletin) and alkaloids (such as trigonelline and theobromine) in CT increased significantly after scenting process, while the levels of amino acids (such as valine and L-phenylalanine) and organic acids (such as ascorbic acid) decreased significantly.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These observations showed that the scenting process promoted the absorption of aroma from citrus flowers by GT and the changes in its non-volatile metabolites, leading to the formation of citrus flavor quality in CT.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
