{"title":"The Paradox of the &lsquo;Care&rsquo; of London&rsquo;s Children: Discourses of &lsquo;Safety&rsquo; and &lsquo;Respect&rsquo; in England&rsquo;s Ministry of Justice Inspection Reports","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0737/v1","date":1723428935000,"content":"Using English prison inspectorate reports the article reports a Goffmanesque-informed discourse analysis of official accounts about the younger inmates of London’s Feltham prison and the conditions characterizing their lived experiences in this prison environment. The construction of this prison estate captures dilapidation, unhygienic conditions, and endless social danger. The stigmatizing construction of the child prisoner intimates a pervasive culture of violence and bullying resulting in their aversion to purposive activities. While, at first blush, prison inspec-torate reporting is based on the policy of ensuring a safe and rehabilitative prison experience for youth it is argued that the nature of the reporting of incarceration obviates a critique of the wider political fabric that custodial interventions reproduce. The Inspectorate operates within the state’s dominant class stratified political ideology. The adoption of a generic labelling discourse in the reports minimizes the communication of harms inflicted on children by criminal ‘justice’ that can only worsen their wellbeing and reproduce the harmful intensity of their imported marginality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"799bbac139264771d0562f1edcadae64eb1d5ecf7eed7ef3f5f47546bff88fcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
