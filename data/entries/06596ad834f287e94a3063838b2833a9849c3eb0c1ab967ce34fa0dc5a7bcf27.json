{"title":"Links Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms, Peer Relationships and Mental Health Outcomes in Western Australian Youth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1906/v1","date":1727179264000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Peer relationships are critical in the development of positive mental health during childhood and adolescence. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms can adversely affect the development of positive peer relationships, and thus, have significant long-term implications for mental health. This study explored long-term relationships between ADHD symptoms, peer relationships and mental health in Western Australian adolescents. Methods: Participants were 1246 Western Australian young people, n=507 males and n=739 females (mean ages 14.05 and 14.52 years respectively). Data were collected at three timepoints across three successive years. Participants completed measures of ADHD symptoms and existing peer problems in the first year; five measures of peer relationships in the second year; and four measures of mental health in the third year. Multiple regression and path analyses were used to determine whether ADHD symptoms predicted scores on the peer relationship and mental health measures, and whether peer relationships mediated links observed between ADHD symptoms and mental health. Results: ADHD symptoms significantly predicted both long-term problematic peer relationships and long-term adverse mental health outcomes. Three peer relationship variables were significant mediators of relationships between ADHD symptoms and mental health: sense of belonging, friendships and perceived isolation. Conclusions: ADHD symptoms significantly predict poor peer relationships and adverse mental health outcomes in Western Australian youth, regardless of whether a formal diagnosis has been assigned. Early interventions for young people with ADHD symptoms are needed for such individuals to enjoy positive mental health in their adult years.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06596ad834f287e94a3063838b2833a9849c3eb0c1ab967ce34fa0dc5a7bcf27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
