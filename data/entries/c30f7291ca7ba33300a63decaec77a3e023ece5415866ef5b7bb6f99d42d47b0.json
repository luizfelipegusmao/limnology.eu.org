Many of these new minerals exhibit P : H<sub>2</sub>O ratios of 15:4 and when analysed in an EPMA at ambient temperatures they show increasing oxide totals starting from 73% (oxygen is calculated by stoichiometry). Over the analysis time of approximately one hour, totals will rise to 89% as the weakly bound water is removed by the vacuum system and the surface shows increasing cracking, Fig 1. We have developed a strategy to minimise the exposure of the mineral surface to high vacuum [<a href=\"#ozae044.093-B1\">1</a>]. Firstly, a specially modified Leica ACE600 C/Metal coater that is equipped with an airlock is utilised and by transferring the sample into the high vacuum chamber via the airlock, the sample can be purged and then Ir coated in under 6 minutes, minimising exposure time to the vacuum. Removing the sample and then venting takes a further minute. Secondly, the coated sample is then loaded into the cryo-stage and placed in the airlock of the EPMA and pumped for 30 seconds to remove air and water. The airlock is then vented with dry N<sub>2</sub> and the cold-stage cooling initiated. The cold-stage temperature is monitored and after a temperature drop of 10°C is observed pumping is recommenced. In this way the sample is precooled prior to seeing high vacuum and little to no water loss is encountered getting the sample into the EPMA, Fig 2. The cold stage is then cooled to 80K, which is the base temperature. Total sample time in vacuum without being cooled is ∼10 minutes. Iridium metal films have been found to outperform carbon films at low temperatures and samples requiring cryo-microanalysis are always coated with Ir.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c30f7291ca7ba33300a63decaec77a3e023ece5415866ef5b7bb6f99d42d47b0","category":"Environment"}
