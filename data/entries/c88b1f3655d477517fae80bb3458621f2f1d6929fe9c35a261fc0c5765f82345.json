{"title":"A molecular phylogeny of the early-branching Genistoid lineages of papilionoid legumes reveals a new Amazonian genus segregated from Clathrotropis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/205/1/1/7342062?rss=1","date":1698969600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Molecular phylogenetic studies focused on the early-branching papilionoid legumes have revealed many new clades and supported several generic realignments, yet the monophyly of some of the constituent genera has remained unassessed. This is the case for the Amazonian genus <span>Clathrotropis</span> of the tribe Ormosieae. The genus, as traditionally circumscribed, comprises seven species of trees, including some of the most ecologically hyper dominant taxa across the Amazonian <span>terra firme</span> and seasonally flooded forests. Here we employed a Bayesian analysis of densely sampled nuclear ribosomal ITS/5.8S and plastid <span>matK</span> and <span>trnL</span> intron DNA sequences to evaluate the monophyly of <span>Clathrotropis</span>. All individual and concatenated analyses concurred in showing the non-monophyletic nature of <span>Clathrotropis</span>, whose species fall into three distantly related lineages: one, comprised of <span>C. brachypetala</span>, <span>C. brunnea</span>, <span>C. glaucophylla</span> and the ecologically dominant <span>C. macrocarpa</span>, is circumscribed here as the new genus <span>Cabari</span>; the two others, comprising <span>C. paradoxa</span> and the widespread <span>C. nitida</span>, are more closely related to <span>Spirotropis</span> of the tribe Ormosieae. Such phylogeny-based dismemberment of <span>Clathrotropis</span> is further supported by vegetative, floral, fruit, and seed characters. Although the genes analysed in this study have provided phylogenetically informative data supporting the need for a new circumscription of <span>Clathrotropis</span>, we suggest that future phylogenomic studies should seek to better resolve the relationships of the newly described genus <span>Cabari</span> across the phylogenetically recalcitrant early-branching nodes of the Genistoid clade.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"84b5fa2619594e061395c38d918de42c13a5b0cd8ac0441f237084e35d0e4410","entryHash":"c88b1f3655d477517fae80bb3458621f2f1d6929fe9c35a261fc0c5765f82345","category":"Environment"}
