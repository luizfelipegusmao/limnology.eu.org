{"title":"A New Approach for Predicting Strength Based on Temperature-Time History Using Two-Parameter Maturity ANN Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1621/v1","date":1729563243000,"content":"One widely used method to predict concrete strength development based on temperature variations during curing is the equivalent maturity time (te) method. This method uses the activation energy (Ea) as its key parameter, which reflects the cement’s sensitivity to temperature. However, research shows that the Ea value varies depending on factors such as cement type, water-cement ratio, temperature, and additives. The permanent subject of discussion is the question of what value of the Ea parameter should be assumed. In this paper, a new approach is proposed by using a neural network analysis method to develop a strength-temperature-time history model. It was assumed that the ANN-fc% model would have 4 inputs including hydration heat (Q), activation energy (Ea), temperature (T) and time (t). A data set was collected and research was carried out on mortars using: 6 cements, curing temperatures 5-35°C, strength within 90 days. The results showed that the ANN analysis method allows for estimating the relative compressive strength with sufficient accuracy. Input nodes analysis showed that Q influences early strength gain, while Ea affects later strength development. The method of using the ANN model to calculate strength depending on the temperature change during maturation was shown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9230a090ce935c35c9518ab3622a1e1d90d5101b8eef6c37203cf534ff871665","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
