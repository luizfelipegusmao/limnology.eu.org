A rare study was conducted on the hazard effect of beryllium (Be) on the central nervous system.<div>Aims</div>This study aims to show the ability of beryllium to cross the blood brain barrier. Demonstrate the effect of beryllium and tannic acid separately or with each other on brain ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>) and on norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, finally on the glutathione and malondialdehyde.<div>Animals grouping</div>Seventy-two rats were divided into four groups as control, Be, TA, and Be+TA where Be was injected intraperitoneally as 1Â mg/Kg b. wt, TA was orally administrated as 5% in aquas solution.<div>Results</div>The administration of beryllium showed its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and accumulated in cortex &gt; cerebellum&gt;hypothalamus also, a significant increase in Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup> cooperated with a significant decrease in K<sup>+</sup> ions content was observed. Norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin showed a general significant decrease in their content joined with a significant decrease in glutathione (GSH) and elevation in malondialdehydes (MDA) because of Be intoxication. On the other hands the daily oral administration of tannic acid showed a general significant decrease in Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup> ions content parallel with a significant increase K<sup>+</sup> also, a non-significant change in the three measured neurotransmitters was noticed.<div>Conclusion</div>Tannic acid showed a mitigation effect against Be intoxication which may regarded to the tannic acid antioxidant, chelating effect.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"c728dcc6ae8b93dc14d869412f84d054a81ee27e04a1623105566fce99233ef6","category":"Environment"}
