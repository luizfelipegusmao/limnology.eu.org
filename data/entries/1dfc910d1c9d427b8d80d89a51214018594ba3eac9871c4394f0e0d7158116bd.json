{"title":"Evaluation of Effect of Different Insertion Speeds and Torques on Implant Placement Status and Removal Torque in Polyurethane Dense D1 Bone Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0942/v1","date":1713171070000,"content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different insertion speeds at 8 different insertion torque values ranging from 25-60 during implantation in a dense polyurethane D1 bone model on the placement status and removal torque of dental implants. In this study, 50 pcf single layer polyurethane plates were used. In the study, a total of 320 implant sockets were divided into 2 groups as Group 1 (30 rpm) and Group 2 (50 rpm) in terms of insertion speed. Group 1 and Group 2 were divided into 8 subgroups as 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 torques. There were 20 implant sockets in each subgroup. During the implantations, implant placement status and removal torque values were assessed. There was a statistically significant difference between the 30 and 50 RPM groups in terms of overall implant placement status (p&amp;lt;0.01). It was found that the removal torque values at 50 RPM were statistically significantly higher than those at 30 RPM (p&amp;lt;0.01). This study showed that in dense D1 bone, the minimum parameters at which all implants could be placed at bone level were 50 torque at 30 rpm and 40 torque at 50 rpm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1dfc910d1c9d427b8d80d89a51214018594ba3eac9871c4394f0e0d7158116bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
