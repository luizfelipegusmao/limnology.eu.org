{"title":"Unraveling the Heterogeneity of Deficiency of Mismatch Repair Proteins in Endometrial Cancer: Predictive Biomarkers and Assessment Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1259/v1","date":1726498191000,"content":"Endometrial cancer (EC) poses a significant global health challenge, with increasing prevalence in 26 of 43 countries and over 13,000 deaths projected in the United States by 2024. This rise correlates with aging populations, the obesity epidemic, and changing reproductive patterns, including delayed childbearing. Despite the early diagnosis in 67% of cases, approximately 30% of cases present with regional or distant spread, leading to nearly 20% mortality rates. Unlike many cancers, EC mortality rates are escalating, outpacing therapeutic advancements until recently. One of the reasons for this was the lack of effective therapeutic options for advanced disease until recently. The introduction of immunotherapy has marked a turning point in EC treatment, particularly benefiting patients with defects in mismatch repair proteins (dMMRs). However, dMMR status alone does not ensure a favorable response, underscoring the need for precise patient selection. This review explores the pivotal role of mismatch repair proteins in EC, emphasizing their heterogeneity, the challenges in their assessment, and their potential as predictive biomarkers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c9925470ffc0db2dc8dbd22df7f1146a347ecba45abf2d2a34de74d3f976f57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
