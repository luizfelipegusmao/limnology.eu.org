{"title":"The Cyborg Cyclist: Articulating a Sociotechnical Imaginary of E-Velomobility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0101/v1","date":1725276959000,"content":"Popular, industry, and academic attention is increasingly being paid to Electrically-Assisted Pedal Cycles (EAPCs), also known as electric bikes, or e-bikes.  Attention has also begun to be given to ideas of the electric bicycle as a component of “electric velomobility” or “e-velomobility” and to the particular benefits of electric bicycles over conventional bicycles.   We present here the effects of EAPCs on the tangible quantitative levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions, increased mobility performance, and greater accessibility of cycling; and the intangible qualitative level of perceptions of electric cycling and those who engage in it, harmonized with transhumanist lines of thought in order to articulate a sociotechnical imaginary of the electric bicycle as an augmentation to a cyclist’s physical body.  Through a combination of original research and drawing on prior literature, we articulate the idea of a “cyborg cyclist” as a vision for present and future e-velomobilities, and emphasize the ability of appropriate technology to augment the capabilities of cyclists, viewing rider and machine as a single unit, while also warning of the possible risks of inappropriate types of electric bicycle. Such a view, we believe, adds a much-needed technology-positive view to present debates, and highlights especially the ability of the EAPC as a rehabilitative and augmentative mobility tool, and as a means of displacing more carbon-intensive means of transportation, particularly the private car.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f48879b77fed5274a6f12297206d534a56ab133abc1664dce089fd3d940e1c17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
