{"title":"Unfolding the Third Approximation of The Time‚ÄêDependent Controller&rsquo;s Designed Parameter (TDCDP) of Fokker Planck Kolmogorov (FPK) Probability Density Function(PDF)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0287/v1","date":1712146487000,"content":"A difficult open problem that has never been fully resolved in the literature to date is the behaviour of the (TDCDP) third approximation. As a giant step towards modern control theory, this cutting-edge paper will advance control theory and other relevant inter-disciplinary subjects. Because control theory is important in industry and engineering, this study will be especially beneficial to anyone working in these disciplines who wish to understand more about recent advances in control theory settings. In contrast, the wealth of applications of Fokker Planck Kolmogorov (FPK) equations numerous disciplines As a result, the study instantly gains more taste and credibility. At the end of the paper, there are several challenging open problems, some concluding remarks, and recommendations for further investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47815dd8fac169cb1d76d91190cb1182d18175be89fb98526c9117322ba5df8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
