{"title":"Combined Theoretical Signal (CTS): A Validated Universal Model Integrating Gravity and Quantum Physics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1233/v3","date":1717135849000,"content":"The Combined Theoretical Signal (CTS) model, with a 90% or higher validity rate, stands as the first validated universal model integrating gravity and quantum physics. This manuscript presents the final validation and enhancement of the CTS model using recent pulsar-sourced gravitational wave data (J2322+2057, J2234+0611, and J1012+5307) and strain data from GW150914 and GW151226. Our findings demonstrate a significant alignment between theoretical predictions and observational data, positioning CTS as a groundbreaking framework with profound implications for theoretical physics and cosmology. The CTS model not only bridges the gap between gravity and quantum mechanics but also offers a new perspective on the formation of massive black holes, the Quantum Cosmic Fabric (QCF), and the structure of the universe as an interconnected hierarchical tree of universes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ba35b0477a91e5593fa248640dd1e34856b7bffe044d8886cff2e8c92a56c87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
