{"title":"Estrogen Regulated Genes Compel Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cells, Whilst Stimulate Antitumor Activity in Peritumoral Immune Cells in a Janus-Faced Manner","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1905/v1","date":1721819351000,"content":"Background: Breast cancer incidence and mortality exhibit a rising trend globally among both premenopausal and postmenopausal women suggesting that there are serious errors in our preventive and therapeutic measures.Purpose: Providing a series of valuable, but misunderstood inventions highlighting the role of increasing estrogen signaling in prevention and therapy of breast cancer instead of its inhibition.     Results: 1. Breast cells and breast cancer cells with germline BRCA1/2 mutations similarly show defect in liganded estrogen receptor (ER) signaling demonstrating its role in genomic instability and cancer initiation. 2. In breast cancers, the increased expression of certain receptor family is an effort for self directed improvement of genomic defects, while the weakness or loss of receptors indicates a defect requiring medical repair. 3. ER overexpression in breast cancer cells is capable of strengthening estrogen signaling and DNA repair, while in ER negative tumors, HER2 overexpression tries to upregulate unliganded ER activation and genome stabilization. 4. ER positive breast cancers responsive to endocrine therapy may show a compensatory ER overexpression resulting in a transient tumor response. Breast tumors, non responsive to endocrine therapy, show HER2 overexpression for compensation the complete blockade of liganded ER activation. 5. In breast tumors, somatic mutations serve upregulation of liganded or unliganded activation of ERs helping genome stabilization and apoptotic death. 6. The dynamic communication between breast cancer and its microenvironment is a wonderful collaboration among molecular players fighting for genomic repair and apoptosis in the tumor. 7. In breast cancers, there is no resistance to genotoxic or immune blocker therapies, but rather the non responsive tumor cells exhausted all compensatory possibilities against therapeutic damages. Conclusion: Understanding the behavior and ambition of breast cancer cells may achieve a turn in therapy via applying a supportive care instead of genotoxic measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18f05f57121fe301d4fac4c889f0e766a32b68863b8ed8ae5c1b22eaebb732ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
