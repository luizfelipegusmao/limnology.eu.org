To this end, we tested behavioral responses of grass (<i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>), bighead (<i>Hypophthalmichthys nobilis</i>), and silver carp (<i>H. molitrix</i>) to L-alanine, L-arginine, L-glutamic acid, and L-aspartic acid. In grass carp, the first three amino acids have been shown to be beneficial for growth, and all four produce a strong olfactory response in this species. This study used pairs of conspecific fish in a video-recorded, sound-insulated, clear acrylic, tube-shaped tank; during trials, an amino acid stimulus was delivered at one end of that tank. Changes in space use, velocity, and acceleration across all amino acids differed significantly among species. Changes in space use by grass carp indicated avoidance of only two amino acids, L-alanine and L-aspartic acid. There was no evidence for attraction to amino acids for grass or silver carp. For bighead carp, change in spatial use on exposure to amino acids indicated attraction across the four amino acids. This attraction was enhanced by lowered velocity. Our results suggested that olfactory sensitivity does not directly translate to behavioral responses. Other sensory cues, for example tactile, visual, and/or taste, may mediate the selective foraging of grass carp. Amino acids may serve as a better olfactory attractant for bighead carp compared to grass or silver carp.</p>","author":"Mark L. Wildhaber, \nZachary D. Beaman, \nKarlie K. Ditter, \nBenjamin M.
