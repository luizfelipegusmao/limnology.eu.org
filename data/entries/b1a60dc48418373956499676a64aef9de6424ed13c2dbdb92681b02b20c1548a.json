{"title":"Optimizing Classroom Resource Allocation Using a Modified Salp Swarm Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1568/v1","date":1711442700000,"content":"Classroom resource allocation is a challenging problem in educational institutions. The use of cloud computing can aid in the optimization of this process by allowing resource providers to allocate resources to users in a timely and efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a modified Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) to optimize the allocation of classroom resources. The proposed approach involves generating a population of salps representing potential solutions to the resource allocation problem and updating the positions of the salps iteratively based on a fitness function and mathematical equations. We conducted simulations of the proposed algorithm on various numbers of tasks and sources to evaluate its performance. The results indicate that the modified SSA algorithm can efficiently allocate classroom resources, achieving lower completion time of tasks (makespan) with lower costs. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing an effective approach to solve the classroom resource allocation problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1a60dc48418373956499676a64aef9de6424ed13c2dbdb92681b02b20c1548a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
