{"title":"Patterns of Grewia (Malvaceae) diversity across geographical scales in Africa and Madagascar","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/133/5-6/773/7577760?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div>Quantifying spatial species richness is useful to describe biodiversity patterns across broad geographical areas, especially in large, poorly known plant groups. We explore patterns and predictors of species richness across Africa in one such group, the palaeotropical genus <span>Grewia</span> L. (Malvaceae).<div>Methods</div><span>Grewia</span> species richness was quantified by extracting herbarium records from GBIF and Tropicos and creating geographical grids at varying spatial scales. We assessed predictors of species richness using spatial regression models with 30 environmental variables. We explored species co-occurrence in Madagascar at finer resolutions using Schoener’s index and compared species range sizes and International Union for Conservation of Nature status among ecoregions. Lastly, we derived a trait matrix for a subset of species found in Madagascar to characterize morphological diversity across space.<div>Key Results</div><span>Grewia</span> species occur in 50 countries in Africa, with the highest number of species in Madagascar (93, with 80 species endemic). Species richness is highest in Madagascar, with ≤23 <span>Grewia</span> species in a grid cell, followed by coastal Tanzania/Kenya (≤13 species) and northern South Africa and central Angola (11 species each). Across Africa, higher species richness was predicted by variables related to aridity. In Madagascar, a greater range in environmental variables best predicted species richness, consistent with geographical grid cells of highest species richness occurring near biome/ecoregion transitions. In Madagascar, we also observe increasing dissimilarity in species composition with increasing geographical distance.<div>Conclusions</div>The spatial patterns and underlying environmental predictors that we uncover in <span>Grewia</span> represent an important step in our understanding of plant distribution and diversity patterns across Africa. Madagascar boasts nearly twice the <span>Grewia</span> species richness of the second most species-rich country in Africa, which might be explained by complex topography and environmental conditions across small spatial scales.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"3f25dd43ec673300586f7e97565f1d8f110f4a9287472f142bc3540624a3c266","category":"Environment"}
