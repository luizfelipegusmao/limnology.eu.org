{"title":"Growth Curve Models  and Clustering Techniques for the Study of New Sugarcane Hybrids: An Integrated Approach with K-Means, K-Medoids, and DBSCAN","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0179/v1","date":1725353989000,"content":"Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a crop of great industrial and alimentary importance, essential for the production of numerous products. Given its significance, genetic improvement programs exist that involve a rigorous study process, from material selection to the development of new varieties, requiring at least seven selection phases. This study modeled the growth curve of the sucrose percentage (SP) in 33 hybrids and six control varieties (MEX 69-290, ITV 92-1424, CP 72-2086, COLMEX 94-8, COLMEX 95-27, RB 85-5113) during the plant and ratoon periods in the experimental fields of the Melchor Ocampo Sugar Mill, Jalisco, Mexico. For clustering the materials, k-means, k-medoids, and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithms were used, considering four maturity types among the control varieties. The DBSCAN algorithm proved to be the most effective, as the means between groups were not statistically equal. The hybrids identified as candidates for subsequent phases due to their high SP were COSTA JAL, ATEMEX 99-48, ATEMEX 99-1, ATEMEX 99-61, MEX 70-486, MEX 80-1521, ITSAMEX 07-44814, ITSAMEX 06-6395, and ITSAMEX 07-1903. These results are crucial for improving the productivity and sustainability of the crop, with significant implications for the sugar industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"895e78c39aa2fb2f687211ed62410028fe3d553e4fd4e70778c9252c8a4f0bc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
