{"title":"Changes in functioning and health during the first 6-months of the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with a spinal cord injury","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299570","date":1709906400000,"content":"<p>by Ethan Simpson, William C. Miller, Julia Schmidt, Jaimie Borisoff, W. Ben Mortenson</p>\r\nStudy design <p>Single-cohort longitudinal survey design.</p> Objectives <p>To identify what ongoing impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on functioning and health in individuals with SCI. Using the ICF model as a guide, outcome measures were chosen to explore potential constructs and aspects of health and functioning which may have been affected by regulations.</p> Setting <p>Online, Canada.</p> Methods <p>Participants provided demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. They completed standardized online measures at three time points, each roughly one month apart (June, July, and August of 2020). The measures assessed mental health, resilience, boredom, social support, technology use, life space, and participation. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to identify longitudinal changes for each measure.</p> Results <p>We collected data from 21 participants with SCI (mean age 54 years, 12 male). We found a large effect size for participation (<i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.20), which increased over time. We also found medium effect sizes in both anxiety (<i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.12) and social network usage (<i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.12). Anxiety decreased over time and social networking usage fluctuated slightly but with an increase from time point one to time point two.</p> Conclusion <p>The results indicate that individuals with spinal cord injury appear to be staying relatively stable during the pandemic with improvements in a few key aspects, such as potentially increased participation and decreased anxiety. The results also suggest that it is important to continue fostering ways for individuals with spinal cord injury to stay connected, engaged, and informed.</p>","author":"Ethan Simpson","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5282ccb3869f848fc67ba072a0a764253a3c7d60ae47b592d3ca8bab54356f13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
