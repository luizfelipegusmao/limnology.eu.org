In 2021, the disease was eliminated in China after more than 70 years of efforts implementing an integrated mosquito management strategy. This strategy comprised indoor residual spray, insecticide-treated bed nets, irrigation management, and rice–fish coculture based on an understanding of taxonomic status and ecological behaviors of vector species, in conjunction with mass drug administration and promotion of public education. However, China still faces postelimination challenges, including the importation of approximately 2,000–4,000 cases of malaria into the country each year, as well as widespread resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in <span>An. sinensis</span>; these challenges require long-term vector surveillance to understand the distribution, population density, and development of resistance in vector mosquitoes to prevent local epidemics caused by imported malaria cases.</p></div>","author":"Tongyan Zhao and Rui-De Xue","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Entomology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a213ec7b64ebddde52fd1163df325e740564b5ca434e1b9e961510d51a3f261","entryHash":"59e888e54e732ecde2f751a92ada93c2c806e73692b7e51f76e53d4c058e9d6a","category":"Environment"}
