{"title":"A Botanical Bioflavonoid Composition from Scutellaria baicalensis and Acacia catechu Protected Mice against D-Galactose-Induced Immunosenescence, and Cyclophosphamide Induced Immune Suppression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0903/v1","date":1723531580000,"content":"Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation create a perpetual cycle in the elderly, where impaired immune function amplifies susceptibility to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress further weakens the immune response. This cycle is particularly detrimental to the respiratory system of the elderly, which is an easy target for constant exogenous harmful attacks during cold/flu season or under heavy air pollution. Herbal medicines that protect respiratory function are seen as safer alternatives to conventional therapies; however, there is limited availability of scientifically validated, safe, and effective natural supplements for these conditions. In this study, we evaluated a standardized bioflavonoid composition, UP446, which contains bioactives from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis and the heartwoods of Acacia catechu, as a natural and nutritional supplement for its antioxidative and immunoregulatory effects in oxidative stress-accelerated aging and chemically induced immune suppression mouse models. Immunosenescence was induced by continual subcutaneous injection of D-galactose (D-Gal) at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day in CD-1 mice. UP446 was administered orally at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg starting in the fifth week of immunosenescence induction. The study lasted a total of ten weeks. All mice received a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 14 days before the end of the study. Whole blood, serum, spleen homogenate, and thymus tissues were used for analysis.Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppression was triggered by three consecutive injections of cyclophosphamide at 80 mg/kg/day, followed by oral administration of UP446 for 18 days at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. Blood was collected from each animal at necropsy, and serum was isolated for IgA and IgG ELISA analysis. UP446 was found to improve immune response, as evidenced by stimulation of innate (NK cells) and adaptive immune responses (T cells and cytotoxic T cells), an increase in antioxidant capacity (glutathione peroxidase), preservation of vital immune organs (the thymus), and a reduction in NFÎºB. UP446 also increased serum levels of IgA and IgG. The findings presented in this report demonstrate the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory activities of UP446, suggesting its potential use in respiratory conditions involving immune stress due to aging, oxidative stress, and/or pathogenic challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aaec1c7ad5d2e6582c5d510dd8cad4d03af856e146cdc6f47fe38788291fb1aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
