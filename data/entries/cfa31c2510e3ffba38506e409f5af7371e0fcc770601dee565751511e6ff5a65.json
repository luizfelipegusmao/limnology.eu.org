{"title":"Hospital segregation, critical care strain, and inpatient mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301481","date":1712844000000,"content":"<p>by Anna Zhilkova, Laila Alsabahi, Donald Olson, Duncan Maru, Tsu-Yu Tsao, Michelle E. Morse</p>\r\nBackground <p>Hospital segregation by race, ethnicity, and health insurance coverage is prevalent, with some hospitals providing a disproportionate share of undercompensated care. We assessed whether New York City (NYC) hospitals serving a higher proportion of Medicaid and uninsured patients pre-pandemic experienced greater critical care strain during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether this greater strain was associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality.</p> Methods <p>In a retrospective analysis of all-payer NYC hospital discharge data, we examined changes in admissions, stratified by use of intensive care unit (ICU), from the baseline period in early 2020 to the first COVID-19 wave across hospital quartiles (265,329 admissions), and crude and risk-adjusted inpatient mortality rates, also stratified by ICU use, in the first COVID wave across hospital quartiles (23,032 inpatient deaths), based on the proportion of Medicaid or uninsured admissions from 2017–2019 (quartile 1 lowest to 4 highest). Logistic regressions were used to assess the cross-sectional association between ICU strain, defined as ICU volume in excess of the baseline average, and patient-level mortality.</p> Results <p>ICU admissions in the first COVID-19 wave were 84%, 97%, 108%, and 123% of the baseline levels by hospital quartile 1–4, respectively. The risk-adjusted mortality rates for ICU admissions were 36.4 (CI = 34.7,38.2), 43.6 (CI = 41.5,45.8), 45.9 (CI = 43.8,48.1), and 45.7 (CI = 43.6,48.0) per 100 admissions, and those for non-ICU admissions were 8.6 (CI = 8.3,9.0), 10.9 (CI = 10.6,11.3), 12.6 (CI = 12.1,13.0), and 12.1 (CI = 11.6,12.7) per 100 admissions by hospital quartile 1–4, respectively. Compared with the reference group of 100% or less of the baseline weekly average, ICU admissions on a day for which the ICU volume was 101–150%, 151–200%, and &gt; 200% of the baseline weekly average had odds ratios of 1.17 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.26), 2.63 (95% CI = 2.31, 3.00), and 3.26 (95% CI = 2.82, 3.78) for inpatient mortality, and non-ICU admissions on a day for which the ICU volume was 101–150%, 151–200%, and &gt; 200% of the baseline weekly average had odds ratios of 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22, 1.34), 2.60 (95% CI = 2.40, 2.82), and 3.44 (95% CI = 3.11, 3.63) for inpatient mortality.</p> Conclusions <p>Our findings are consistent with hospital segregation as a potential driver of COVID-related mortality inequities and highlight the need to desegregate health care to address structural racism, advance health equity, and improve pandemic resiliency.</p>","author":"Anna Zhilkova","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cfa31c2510e3ffba38506e409f5af7371e0fcc770601dee565751511e6ff5a65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
