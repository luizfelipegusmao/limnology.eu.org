{"title":"Potential of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) Larvae as Replacement for Fish Meal as the Standard Animal Protein Source for Broiler Chicken Feed in Uganda","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1749/v1","date":1729604110000,"content":"The black soldier fly larvae meal has attracted attention as a sustainable alternative protein ingredient in poultry feed. In the present study, we sought to determine the effect of black soldier fly larvae on the growth performance of broilers as replacement to fishmeal. Forty (40) one day old broiler chicks were randomly selected and distributed in 4 replicates. The Black soldier fly larvae were formulated and added to broilerâ€™s marsh as replacement to fishmeal. Birds were fed on four experimental diets formulated as follows 15% black soldier fly (BSF15), 20% (BSF20) and 25% (BSF25) corresponding to dietary BSF inclusion levels of 150 g/kg, 200 g/kg and 250 g/ kg, respectively and the control diet (BSF0) contained 20% of fishmeal (FM) as protein sources (250 g/kg). Feed and water were provided ad libitum. Proximate analysis showed that BSFLM contained comparable nutrient values to fishmeal. The highest average weight gain was achieved when birds were provided diet with 25% BSFLM. Based on this study, it can be concluded that black soldier fly larvae meal represents an alternative source of animal protein to replace fishmeal in broiler chicken diet in their diet without adverse effect on growth performance and consumer preferance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb99e32507dc9859c0d51b1e48b60bbda5e079d02d0d748eb5583eadf0b7f213","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
