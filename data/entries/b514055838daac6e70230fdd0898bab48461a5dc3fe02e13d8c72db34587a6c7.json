There are no studies on the susceptibility and synergistic activity of DDT and lambda-cyhalothrin on male <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Delta State, Nigeria. Even though studies have extensively reported resistance in female mosquitoes, the susceptibility of male mosquitoes to insecticide classes should be ascertained. In this study, we tested the susceptibility status and synergistic activity of DDT and Lambda-cyhalothrin on <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae</i> and <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> in Delta State, Nigeria, in order to ascertain the level of resistance and knockdown. In addition, we modelled the knockdown time using Probit analysis model. WHO bioassay method was used to expose two days old adult mosquitoes to 4% DDT and 0.05% lambda-cyhalothrin. The results showed that <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae</i> mosquitoes exposed to DDT and lambda-cyhalothrin were confirmed resistant (61% and 53% respectively). However, pre-exposing the resistant mosquito population to piperonyl butoxide (4%) showed an increase in mortality to 90% (possible resistance) in DDT and 98% (susceptible) in lambda-cyhalothrin. <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> mosquitoes exposed to DDT were susceptible (98%) while those exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin were confirmed resistant (87%) and this increased to complete mortality (100%) in PBO+lambda-cyhalothrin population. Furthermore, the results showed that the knockdown time (KDT<sub>50</sub> and KDT<sub>95</sub>) in <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae</i> exposed to DDT was 39.5–71.2 minutes and 124.5–146.4 minutes respectively, while that of lambda-cyhalothrin was 33.0–81.8 minutes and 64.0–124.4 minutes respectively. In <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i>, KDT<sub>50</sub> and KDT<sub>95</sub> was 23.9 and 61.7minutes for DDT exposure whereas it was 5.6–15.3 minutes and 36.1–72.3 minutes for lambda-cyhalothrin exposure. It can be concluded that male <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae</i> mosquitoes exposed to the insecticides were resistant and the causes may be linked to certain resistant genes in the mosquitoes. The chances of transferring resistance are possible in wild species and molecular-based studies on the resistant gene in male mosquitoes as well as the tendencies of transfer are required to establish this focus.","author":"Chioma C.
