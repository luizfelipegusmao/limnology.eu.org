{"title":"13 Awardee Talk: Goals, methods, and philosophy of graduate mentoring in reproductive physiology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/101/7757170?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Successful graduate and postdoctoral training programs in reproductive physiology are reciprocal relationships that, by default, benefit both trainee and mentor. Ideally, goals are for the mentor to facilitate and guide the long-term educational and professional aspirations of the trainee, while simultaneously creating an important member of the research team capable of meaningful contributions to the scientific enterprise. When this partnership fails to develop and flourish in a transparent and collaborative manner, the resulting disequilibrium leads to negative and costly impacts. Over the last 50 yr, I have observed the importance of several principles that, in my opinion, have a major influence on this process. The first of these begins at student recruitment and during the early part of a program after acceptance. Here, a clear understanding of any academic deficiencies and a commitment to rectify these deficiencies is essential. Academic programs of promising M.S. level candidates are sometimes heavily encumbered by this task. In contrast, Ph.D. programs are usually the final opportunity to take advantage of cutting-edge courses related to or supportive of reproductive biology and should be encouraged. Second, early development of a functional advisory committee is important and contributes broad experience and wisdom to the unique strengths and weaknesses of every student. Third, the trainee must learn early on the value of a mature attitude, a strong work ethic, and personal accountability. As an animal scientist, I want every student to be well-versed with hands on training/experience in basic animal physiology, nutrition, reproduction, experimental (surgical) techniques, and husbandry. Concurrently, they must learn to ensure that the well-being and ethical treatment of research animals always comes first. The foregoing is accomplished through personal example and never asking a student to do something you cannot or will not do yourself. Fourth, pursuing modern, cutting-edge techniques in the laboratory, regardless of long-term personal goals, should be an educational and experiential requirement. Fifth, development of meaningful and sound research projects requires hours of reading, thought and discussion. Students, particularly at the M.S. level, are often completely lost relative to the path forward. Allowing trainees to adopt pre-planned experiments within existing projects in the lab, with the mandate of developing new hypotheses and expanding beyond initial objectives, is a common theme. Pragmatically, this is also essential for maintaining laboratory focus and to service federal, state, and industry-funded projects effectively. Nonetheless, learning to develop and test new and sound hypotheses using appropriate experimental designs remains essential. Finally, no other factor has a greater impact on trainee success than the ability to communicate effectively using the English language. Unfortunately, this topic and problems associated with it usually form the caboose of most graduate training programs when it should have formed the engine.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5884aeae218a2b9730cade38eaeadb0e5ebcdf6de1e237473c69d32d0e8975f9","category":"Environment"}
