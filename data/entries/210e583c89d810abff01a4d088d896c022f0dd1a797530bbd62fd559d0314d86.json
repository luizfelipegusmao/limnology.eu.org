{"title":"Radish Root Ferment Filtrate for Cosmetic Preservation: A Study of Efficacy of Kopraphinol&copy;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0976/v1","date":1720708664000,"content":"The objective of this investigation was to characterize the antimicrobial activity of the natural preservative, intended for cosmetic purpose, Kopraphinol (INCI name: Lactobacillus/Radish Root Ferment Extract Filtrate). It was tested against a panel of selected bacteria and mycetes by using conventional microbiological techniques (determination of MIC, time killing assay), and a chal-lenge test was used to verify its potential preservative in an O/W cream. Kopraphinol has shown an interesting antimicrobial effectiveness comparable to methylparaben. Moreover, it fulfilled challenge test criterion A and has proven effective against microbial contamination. The results obtained show that Kopraphinol can be considered a promising and effective candidate for anti-microbial preservation of cosmetics and could successfully complement or even replace conven-tional preservatives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"210e583c89d810abff01a4d088d896c022f0dd1a797530bbd62fd559d0314d86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
