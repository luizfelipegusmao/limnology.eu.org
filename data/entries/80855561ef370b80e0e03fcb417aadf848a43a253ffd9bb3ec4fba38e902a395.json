Five mature healthy females were histologically observed. The reproductive systems of the five specimens exhibited similar morphological characteristics with a pair of saccular creamy white ovaries merging caudally into a single gonoduct. There were two germinal ridges lined with a layer of germinal epithelium (GE). The ovarian maturation of this species was considered asynchronous. The oogenic cells were classified into oogonia and oocytes at several developmental phases based on their size and characteristics. Oogonia were identified among the connective tissue in the middle area of the GE. The stromal compartment contained oocytes that were classified into four distinct phases: the primary growth (PG) phase having two steps (perinucleolar and oil droplets-cortical alveolar steps) and the secondary growth (SG) phase with three oocyte types, including early SG oocytes, late SG oocytes, and fully grown oocytes. The atretic oocytes (AO) were observed in all stages of oogenesis. Postovulatory follicles were also seen among the ovarian connective tissue. The occurrence of postovulatory follicles suggested that the specimens analysed in this study were in the spawning period. This research provides new insights into the identification of the reproductive cycles and morphological characteristics of the ovary of <i>H. trimaculatus</i>.</p>","author":"Sinlapachai Senarat, \nSupawadee Chumee, \nGen Kaneko, \nSatiya Wandee, \nAnan Kenthao, \nPiyamat Kongtueng, \nMari Carmen Uribe, \nKorakot Nganvongpanit, \nAtsuo Iida, \nPeerapon Sornying","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"80855561ef370b80e0e03fcb417aadf848a43a253ffd9bb3ec4fba38e902a395","category":"Environment"}
