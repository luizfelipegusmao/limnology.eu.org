{"title":"Individualized Supplementation of Immunoactive Micronutrients and Severity of Upper Respiratory Infection Symptoms &ndash; a Randomized Intervention Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1860/v1","date":1711724038000,"content":"Certain micronutrients exhibit immunomodulatory effects. However, no intervention has yet investigated the effect of an individualized supplementation on the severity of upper respiratory tract infections (URI). Therefore, we investigated whether a personalized supplementation moderates the incidence and severity of URI. Selenium, zinc, and vitamin D was measured from 59 healthy participants ) in dried blood spots. Accordingly, a personalized supplement was provided with or without the respective micronutrients. We used WURSS-21 questionnaires to assess the disease status. The blood values converged during the intervention and micronutrients no longer differed at the end of the intervention period between treated and untreated volunteers. The incidence and severity of the illness did not significantly differ between the groups. However, when analyzing the WURSS-21 score by the intention to treat, the initially randomized treatment arm revealed a significantly higher score than the placebo arm. Upon acute administration, individualized combination of selenium, zinc and vitamin D does not reduce the number or contribute to a milder course of URIs. Therefore, supplementation in acute infectious situations seems questionable. Further studies must address the habitual diet in more detail to better understand the impact of individual micronutrient status on the prevention of URI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7cc49aecb9b0d6e6e61c4801adad1379d898bf85ab250b35b2441d84e88f16b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
