{"title":"Accelerating Wound Repair: The Multifaceted Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1422/v1","date":1726665884000,"content":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) secretions, usually containing growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, have improved wound healing via a paracrine mechanism. This makes them particularly valuable as potential cell therapeutics. Similarly, wound healing is mainly regulated via paracrine signaling of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. Chronic wound healing has prolonged inflammatory, proliferative, or remodeling phases, resulting in tissue fibrosis and non-healing ulcers. The growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines secreted by MSCs can be applied to wounds by transplanting cells or using the secretome/conditioned medium (CM) of MSCs, which contains these secreted bioactive molecules. For their success in increasing the wound healing rate, MSCs offer a promising option for treating chronic wounds. This review provides a concise summary of current knowledge of the biological properties of MSCs and describes the use of MSCs for wound healing. In particular, the scope of this review focuses on the role of MSCs in wound healing by increasing wound healing rate with the secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. In addition, the function and type of MSCs also have been discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6013dd2df5df2b964e5c117fa08b876ee98cdfc95506e4dd882d5076ac63e894","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
