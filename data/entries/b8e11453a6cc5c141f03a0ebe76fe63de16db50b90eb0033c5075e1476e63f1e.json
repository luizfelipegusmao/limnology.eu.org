Several aspects about the disease still need to be elucidated. Animal models of GAE have allowed advances in these aspects. This work tested Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) as an animal model of GAE. For this, 32 animals were infected with 1x106 A. castellanii trophozoites, T4 genotype. Ameba recovery tests were carried out on plates of agar, vascular extravasation assays, behavioral tests and histopathological technique with H/E staining. Data were submitted to linear regression analysis, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test, performed in the GraphPad PrismÂ® 8.0 program, with a significance level of p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b8e11453a6cc5c141f03a0ebe76fe63de16db50b90eb0033c5075e1476e63f1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
