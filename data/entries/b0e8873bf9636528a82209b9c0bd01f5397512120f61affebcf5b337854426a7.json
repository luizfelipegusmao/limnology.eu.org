{"title":"Improved methods for total and chloroplast protein extraction from <i>Cajanus</i> species for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308909","date":1723730400000,"content":"<p>by Arunima S., Alakesh Das, Prakash Jyoti Kalita, Rahul Ishwar Patil, Neha Pandey, Mamta Bhattacharjee, Bidyut Kumar Sharma, Debajit Das, Sumita Acharjee</p>\r\n\r\nThe recent advances in pigeon pea genomics, including high-quality whole genome and chloroplast genome sequence information helped develop improved varieties. However, a comprehensive <i>Cajanus</i> proteome, including the organelle proteome, is yet to be fully mapped. The spatial delineation of pigeon pea proteins at sub-cellular levels and inter-organelle communication could offer valuable insights into its defense mechanism against various stresses. However, the major bottleneck in the proteomic study is the lack of a suitable method of protein extraction and sample preparation compatible with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDi-ToF). Our study introduces two efficient methods, one for isolating total proteins and another for organelle (chloroplast) proteins from various <i>Cajanus spp</i>. For total protein extraction, we have optimized a protocol using phenol in combination with a reducing agent (DTT) and protease inhibitor cocktail, also washing (6–7 times) with ice-cold acetone after overnight protein precipitation of total proteins. Our modified extraction method using phenol for total leaf protein yielded approximately 2-fold more proteins than the previously reported protocols from <i>C</i>. <i>cajan</i> (3.18 ± 0.11 mg/gm) and <i>C</i>. <i>scarabaeoides</i> (2.06 ± 0.08 mg/gm). We have also optimized a protocol for plastid protein extraction, which yielded 1.33 ± 0.25 mg/10 gm plastid proteins from <i>C</i>. <i>cajan</i> and 0.88 ± 0.19 mg/10 gm plastid proteins from <i>C</i>. <i>scarabaeoides</i>. The 2D-PAGE analysis revealed 678 ± 08 reproducible total protein spots from <i>C</i>. <i>cajan</i> and 597 ± 22 protein spots from <i>C</i>. <i>scarabaeoides</i>. Similarly, we found 566 ± 10 and 486 ± 14 reproducible chloroplast protein spots in <i>C</i>. <i>cajan and C</i>. <i>scarabaeoides</i>, respectively. We confirmed the plastid protein fractions through immunoblot analysis using antibodies against LHCb1/LHCⅡ type Ⅰ protein. We found both methods suitable for 2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry (MS). This is the first report on developing protocols for total and chloroplastic protein extraction of <i>Cajanus</i> spp. suitable for advanced proteomics research.","author":"Arunima S.","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b0e8873bf9636528a82209b9c0bd01f5397512120f61affebcf5b337854426a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
