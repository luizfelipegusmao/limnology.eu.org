{"title":"The epidemiology of hip and groin pain and Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome (FAIS) in male and female Gaelic games players","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309027","date":1727272800000,"content":"<p>by Shauna Jordan, Clare Lodge, Ulrik McCarthy-Persson, Helen French, Catherine Blake</p>\r\nObjectives <p>Hip and groin pain is common in Gaelic games players, but data are limited to elite males with poor representation of females. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, severity and factors associated with hip and groin pain and Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome (FAIS) in male and female Gaelic games players.</p> Methods <p>A representative national sample of Gaelic games players completed a survey providing demographic information and details related to self-reported episodes of hip and groin pain and FAIS diagnosis within the last year. Players from multiple age grades, codes (Football/Hurling/Camogie) and levels of Gaelic games were included.</p> Results <p>A total of 775 players responded to the survey. The annual prevalence of hip and groin pain was 54.8%. Almost half of players (48.8%) continued to participate in sport, while 18.7% ceased participation and 32.5% reported reduced participation. Although 40% of episodes lasted no longer than 3 weeks, there was a high recurrence rate (33.5%). FAIS was reported by eight players, representing 1.9% of hip and groin complaints. Logistic regression models indicate male sex, playing both codes of Gaelic games and participating in additional sport were significant factors in predicting hip and groin pain.</p> Conclusion <p>Hip and groin pain is prevalent in Gaelic Games with FAIS accounting for a small proportion of cases. However, consideration of indicators of severity (participation impact/symptom duration/medical attention) is essential in understanding the context and magnitude of these hip and groin issues. Male players and players engaging in multiple sports are more likely to experience hip and groin pain.</p>","author":"Shauna Jordan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dff3c5aa1080cc59a896a07ef5448666764f19634d9bc6e48a4e6849a49c5bb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
