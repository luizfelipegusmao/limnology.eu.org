{"title":"Raman spectroscopy – a visit to the literature on plant, food, and agricultural studies","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13803?af=R","date":1723446000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Raman spectroscopy, a fast, non-invasive, and label-free optical technique, has significantly advanced plant and food studies and precision agriculture by providing detailed molecular insights into biological tissues. Utilizing the Raman scattering effect generates unique spectral fingerprints that comprehensively analyze tissue composition, concentration, and molecular structure. These fingerprints are obtained without chemical additives or extensive sample preparation, making Raman spectroscopy particularly suitable for in-field applications. Technological enhancements such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering, Fourier-transform-Raman spectroscopy, and chemometrics have increased Raman spectroscopy sensitivity and precision. These and other advancements enable real-time monitoring of compound translocation within plants and improve the detection of chemical and biological contaminants, essential for food safety and crop optimization. Integrating Raman spectroscopy into agronomic practices is transformative and marks a shift toward more sustainable farming activities. It assesses crop quality – as well as the quality of the food that originated from crop production – early plant stress detection and supports targeted breeding programs. Advanced data processing techniques and machine learning integration efficiently handle complex spectral data, providing a dynamic and detailed view of food conditions and plant health under varying environmental and biological stresses. As global agriculture faces the dual challenges of increasing productivity and sustainability, Raman spectroscopy stands out as an indispensable tool, enhancing farming practices' precision, food safety, and environmental compatibility. This review is intended to select and briefly comment on outstanding literature to give researchers, students, and consultants a reference for works of literature in Raman spectroscopy mainly focused on plant, food, and agronomic sciences. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ernane Miranda Lemes","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"50f8567a69bf8c7365f6c4fb907e3a2f37bae818553fd5a8b314357f3a891462","category":"Environment"}
