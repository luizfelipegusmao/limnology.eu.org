{"title":"Design and Testing of Almaty Ankle Exoskeleton V.2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2294/v1","date":1727586405000,"content":"This paper presents the development and testing of the passive Almaty Ankle Exoskeleton V.2. The device features a new design with three electric linear actuators, and the shin and foot platforms are connected by links with spherical and universal joints. Functional testing demonstrates the prototype's ability to operate effectively within the natural range of ankle joint movements. Preliminary results indicate that the exoskeleton can reduce calf muscle activation in the work limb where the device is applied. In this the passive exoskeleton is designed for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, whose operation with numerical results is highlighted by focusing on parameters such as angular velocity, linear acceleration, and angles. These measurements provide valuable information about the exoskeleton's performance and efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7106ee273ce3f76825726a57530344517a0c13f7243b067c68f70f0bb5a6491","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
