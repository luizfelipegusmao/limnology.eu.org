{"title":"Mechanical Behaviors of a New Polymer-Based Restorative Material for Immediate Loading: An In-Vitro, Comparative, Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1132/v1","date":1723755115000,"content":"Metal-reinforced polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) is considered the gold standard material for immediate loading on dental implants. However, mechanical problems under loading cycles can occur, such as fractures. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel polymer-based material has been proposed. The aim of the present in vitro comparative research is to validate a novel composite polymer developed to replace metal-reinforced PMMA interim restoration due to its advantages of good mechanical proprieties, easier manufacturing, and handling. Ten interim restorations were CAD/CAM designed and fabricated (five in the composite \"ONLY\" group, and five in the metal-reinforced PMMA group). All the samples were screwed into the prototype models, simulating a complete edentulous mandible rehabilitated with six straight implants. Outcome measures were breakpoint (load, N) and displacement (mm) thought a static, compression test and material behavior under dynamic cyclic test method (fatigue test). A total of twenty samples were tested. Ten samples were used for each test (10 for static and 10 for dynamic), five samples were used in each group (test and control). All the specimens completed the mechanical tests, as planned. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for all, breakpoint, displacement and fatigue tests. Breakpoint in the test group was 1953.19 ± 543.73 N, while, it was 2031.10 ± 716.68 N in the control group, with no statistically significant difference (P=0.775). The displacement was 1.89 ± 0.34 mm in the test group and 1.98 ± 0.75 mm in the control group, again, with no statistically significant difference (P=0.763). Under dynamic cyclic test method, in the control group the mean load was 2504.6 ± 972.15 N, while, in the test group the mean load was 3382 ± 578.5 N. The difference between group was 877.4 ± 579.3 N (p value=0.121). With the limitation of this in vitro study, the novel composite polymer can be used to immediately load dental implants. Further clinical researches are needed to confirm this preliminary results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"120ef3bc921ee6985711ba51007d991d6cbdcdf25275c9686dd0f371b98749e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
