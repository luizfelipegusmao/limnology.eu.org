{"title":"Strength, Durability and Aesthetics of Corner Joints and Edge Banding in Furniture Design: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0577/v1","date":1728379258000,"content":"Corner joints and edge banding play crucial roles in the strength, durability, and aesthetics of furniture made from particleboards. This review highlights the importance of edge banding on corner joints in enhancing the overall quality of panel furniture. The choice of joint type, materials, and construction techniques can significantly influence the overall appearance and design of the furniture. The quality and design of corner joints directly affect the durability and longevity of furniture. Strong and well-designed corner joints ensure that furniture can withstand various forces and loads without failure or deformation. In addition, corner joints contribute to the aesthetics of furniture by providing seamless and visually appealing connections between different elements. Edge banding plays a crucial role in influencing the strength of corner joints in the furniture. Different edge-banding materials have varying levels of resistance to impact, scratches, and abrasion, which protect furniture surfaces. Overall, edge banding not only enhances the visual appeal of furniture, but also ensures its durability and longevity, both in the service of its purpose and during disassembly and/or transport due to the remodeling of the living space or its relocation. The findings aim to unify the knowledge and set parameters for further research on the quality of corner joints and edge bands in particleboard furniture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c07d402b0176708d522e627a1114c6616e076f3deb11e7b08ffa1fa3af8785b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
