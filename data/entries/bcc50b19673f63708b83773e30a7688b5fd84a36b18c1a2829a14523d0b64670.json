{"title":"Prediction of Gas-Water Multiphase Flow Behaviour and Hydrates Severity in Gas-Dominant Subsea Pipeline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1227/v1","date":1726489570000,"content":"This study focuses on enhancing the prediction of flow characteristics in gas pipelines under hydrate-forming conditions using a validated CFD model. Four-Quadrants approach was introduced to analyse the relationship between gas and water flowrates, and to provide further insights into hydrate formation, agglomeration, deposition, and pipeline plugging. The analysis considered subcooling temperatures, water volume fractions, and gas velocities, to assess the risk of hydrate plugging in subsea gas pipelines. Results indicate that higher subcooling temperatures significantly increase the risk of hydrate formation and plugging, especially at lower gas velocities. At subcooling temperatures above 7.1 K, hydrate agglomeration and deposition become more pronounced, leading to a greater risk of plugging. Similarly, water volume fractions above 0.06 were found to increase the likelihood of hydrate blockages. However, higher gas velocities were shown to reduce this risk by promoting the sloughing of hydrates and preventing deposition. The findings align with existing literature and offer practical insights for flow assurance in gas pipeline operations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcc50b19673f63708b83773e30a7688b5fd84a36b18c1a2829a14523d0b64670","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
