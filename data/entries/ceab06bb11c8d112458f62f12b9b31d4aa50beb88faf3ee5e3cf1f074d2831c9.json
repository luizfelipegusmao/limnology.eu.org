{"title":"Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll-A in Clear vs. Turbid Waters in Lakes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0962/v1","date":1723612983000,"content":"Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, is one of the few biological water quality indices detectable using satellite observations. However, models for estimating Chl-a from satellite signals are currently unavailable for many lakes. The application of Chl-a prediction algorithms may be affected by the variance in optical complexity within lakes. Using Lake Winnipeg in Canada as a case study, we demonstrated that separating models by the lake’s basins [north basin (NB) and south basin (SB)] can improve Chl-a predictions. By calibrating more than 40 commonly used Chl-a estimation models using Landsat data for Lake Winnipeg, we achieved higher correlations between in situ and predicted Chl-a when building models with separate Landsat-to-in-situ matchups from NB and SB (R² = 0.85 and 0.76, respectively; p &amp;lt; 0.05), compared to using matchups from the entire lake (R² = 0.38, p &amp;lt; 0.05). In the deeper, clearer waters of the NB, a green-to-blue band ratio provided better Chl-a predictions, while in the shallower, highly turbid SB, a red-to-green band ratio was more effective. Our approach can be used for rapid Chl-a modeling in large lakes using cloud-based platforms like Google Earth Engine with any available satellite or time series length.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ceab06bb11c8d112458f62f12b9b31d4aa50beb88faf3ee5e3cf1f074d2831c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
