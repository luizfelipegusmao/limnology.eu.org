{"title":"Question Answering through Enhanced Question Classification for Domain Adaptation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0933/v1","date":1713170145000,"content":"The field of Question Answering (QA) has achieved substantial advancements, particularly in specialized domains. However, adapting QA systems to new domains when trained in a distinct source domain and deployed in a different target domain presents significant challenges. This study explores the role of enhanced question classification in facilitating domain adaptation in QA systems. We introduce a comprehensive framework termed Enhanced Question Classification for Adaptive QA (EQCA-QA). This framework employs a sophisticated question classifier to categorize questions from both source and target datasets, followed by a joint training mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning through pseudo-labeling. To optimize performance, we reduce the inter-domain discrepancies using the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) method while also minimizing intra-class variances among QA pairs of identical question types for more precise adaptation. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering attempt at integrating enhanced question classification with self-supervised learning techniques to address domain adaptation challenges in QA. Our results show that EQCA-QA consistently surpasses the contemporary benchmarks across various datasets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1c7e36c9b35591d869fddc27cc6dac5f3671844b41868b699df292dfc81020c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
