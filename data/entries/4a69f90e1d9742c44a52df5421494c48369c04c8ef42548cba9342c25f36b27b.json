{"title":"Stress-Related Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Case Report with Positive Response to Alpha-Methyl-P-Tyrosine (AMPT) Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1544/v1","date":1718973831000,"content":"Alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT; also referred as metyrosine) is an approved medication for the treatment of pheochromocytoma. As a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor AMPT may be a potential candidate for the treatment of diseases involving catecholamine alterations. However, only small-scale clinical trials have tested AMPT repurposing in few other illnesses. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an heterogenous disorder with genetically associated vulnerability of catecholamine metabolism (e.g. catechol O-methyltransferase polymorphisms) holding an important impact of environmental factors. The current case report compiles genetic and longitudinal biochemical data for over a year follow-up of one patient sequentially diagnosed with sustained overstress, neurasthenia, CFS, and POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) over a 10-year period, and reports patientâ€™s symptom improvement in response to low-medium doses of AMPT.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a69f90e1d9742c44a52df5421494c48369c04c8ef42548cba9342c25f36b27b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
