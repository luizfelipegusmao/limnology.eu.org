{"title":"The importance of integrating phycological research, teaching, outreach, and engagement in a changing world","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13507?af=R","date":1728035953000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The ecological, evolutionary, economic, and cultural importance of algae necessitates a continued integration of phycological research, education, outreach, and engagement. Here, we comment on several topics discussed during a networking workshop—<i>Algae and the Environment</i>—that brought together phycological researchers from a variety of institutions and career stages. We share some of our perspectives on the state of phycology by examining gaps in teaching and research. We identify action areas where we urge the phycological community to prepare itself to embrace the rapidly changing world. We emphasize the need for more trained taxonomists as well as integration with molecular techniques, which may be expensive and complicated but are important. An essential benefit of these integrative studies is the creation of high-quality algal reference barcoding libraries augmented with morphological, physiological, and ecological data that are important for studies of systematics and crucial for the accuracy of the metabarcoding bioassessment. We highlight different teaching approaches for engaging undergraduate students in algal studies and the importance of algal field courses, forays, and professional phycological societies in supporting the algal training of students, professionals, and citizen scientists.</p>","author":"Rosalina Stancheva, \nMarco Cantonati, \nKalina Manoylov, \nPaula C.
