{"title":"Beyond the Surface: Cell Cycle Targeting in Skin Cancer Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1661/v1","date":1727074706000,"content":"Skin cancers, including melanoma, and non-melanoma- cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, are a diverse group of malignancies characterized by variations in their molecular and cellular features. Melanoma is a highly heterogenous tumor characterized by the dysregulation of a myriad of cell-cycle associated signaling pathways. In the non-melanoma skin cancers, such as cutaneous basal and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the role of cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins remains poorly understood with relatively limited investigation. Although revolutionary therapies against diverse molecular targets have been introduced over the last decade leading to significant prognostic benefit, advanced stages of melanoma remain exceptionally difficult to treat. The three cancers are united by evidence of stem-like, cancer initiating cell populations which dictate highly dynamic microenvironments and rely on disrupted cell cycle signaling to support treatment resistance and cancer progression. Potential of cell cycle targeting in skin cancer in underexplored in terms of identification of specific mechanisms supporting the maintenance of skin cancer stem cell pools and could offer potential targets to advance the therapy in these malignancies. In this review, we comprise the existing data on major cell of cell cycle regulators in skin cancer, the regulation of cancer stem cells and most recent developments and limitations surrounding cell cycle-targeted therapies, with a focus on the application of CDK inhibitors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22c3a2ee8c35532a1d3c67931534b1c7d32d905b3501bdfcfe5beb685b7a94e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
