{"title":"Direct Interaction Between CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reciprocally Preserves Stemness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2390/v1","date":1727682285000,"content":"A specialized microenvironment in the bone marrow, composed of stromal cells including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), support hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renewal and differentiation but also regulates leukemia development and progression. The reciprocal direct interaction between MSCs and CD34+ HSCs under physiological and pathological conditions has not been well characterized yet. Here, we established a direct co-culture model between MSCs and CD34+ HSCs or MSCs and acute myeloid leukemia cells (THP-1, Molm-13, and primary cells from patients) to study cell-cell communication. Following MSCs-CD34+ HSCs co-culture, the expression of adhesion markers N-cadherin and connexin 43 increased in both cell types, forming gap junction channels. Moreover, the clonogenic potential of CD34+ HSCs was increased. However, direct contact of acute myeloid leukemia cells with MSCs reduced the expression levels of connexin 43 and N-cadherin in MSCs. The impairment in gap junction formation could be ascertained to a defect in the acute myeloid leukemia derived MSCs. Interestingly, CD34+ HSCs and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines restrained MSCs from engaging into osteoblastic differentiation upon prolonged direct cell-cell contact. In conclusion, under physiological conditions, connexin 43 and N-cadherin interaction preserves stemness of both CD34+ HSCs and MSCs, a process that is compromised in acute myeloid leukemia, pointing out to the possible role of gap junctions in modulating stemness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3021ae712982652f3e6c618220482c0144465fc24a52e5cd0a9d9718eeae151e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
