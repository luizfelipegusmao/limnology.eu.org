{"title":"Prioritising Polysomnography in Children with Suspected Obstructive Sleep Apnoea: Key Role of Symptom Onset and Sleep Questionnaire Scores","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1034/v1","date":1726149007000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSA) in children disrupts standard breathing patterns and sleep architecture, potentially leading to severe consequences. Early identification and intervention for OSA are crucial to prevent these issues. This study explored the relationships between waiting times for polysomnography (PSG), clinical history, age at the time of PSG, and PSG outcomes in children; Methods: Two hundred and fourteen children were prospectively enrolled. Data were extracted from medical records on the age at referral for PSG and at the time of its execution, the waiting time for PSG, diagnosis (primary snoring, mild, moderate, and severe OSA), history of snoring and apnoea, medications taken, surgical interventions, passive smoke exposure, and allergies. The records also included the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ); Results: The mean age at referral for PSG was 5.2 (2.8) years, the waiting time for PSG was 5.2 (5.0) months, and the age at the time of PSG was 5.6 (2.8) years. Children with a shorter history of OSA (â‰¤12 months) underwent PSG at an earlier age (4.9 (2.7) years) compared to those with a more extended history (6.0 (2.7) years; p=0.006). A younger age at referral for PSG was associated with a lower PSQ score (r=0.167; p=0.015), a shorter history of apnoea (r=0.216; p=0.003) and snoring (r=0.187; p=0.023), but also with greater OSA severity, expressed as oxygen desaturation index (r=-0.152; p=0.026). In the correlation analysis, the waiting time for PSG, adjusted for age at referral, was longer in children with a prolonged history of apnoea (r=0.195; p=0.023) and snoring (r=0.259; p=0.002) but with a lower PSQ score (r=-0.172; p=0.045); Conclusions: Some children receive delayed treatment, increasing the risk of long-term complications. In evaluating children with suspected OSA, the duration of symptoms and the PSQ score at referral emerge as crucial factors that should be considered to optimise prioritisation for PSG access.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5484b731df92044640542ca867a0883facc5e787c0bf6d0d3d466c96a9a98d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
