The interfacial alignment (<span>e.g.</span>, twist angle, translation, and lattice mismatch between adjacent layers) is a critical degree of freedom for modulating moiré properties. Although global alignment can be tuned through various fabrication techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.733-B5\">5–8</a>], achieving precise control of local structures remains challenging due to the heterogenous nature of 2D multilayers [<a href=\"#ozae044.733-B9\">9</a>]. In addition, 2D moirés are highly susceptible to reconfiguration [<a href=\"#ozae044.733-B10\">10</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.733-B11\">11</a>]. Understanding the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the structural evolution of 2D moiré is crucial for achieving reliable property measurements and designing of these quantum systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4cb68e48b27d1aebe87819197df9487c4d1120dbd4d67af3f54cd5f9a690c79d","category":"Environment"}
