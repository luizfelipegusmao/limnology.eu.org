{"title":"Beyond Brainstorming: Design Thinking as a Catalyst for Transformation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0771/v1","date":1723447731000,"content":"In a constantly transforming retail financial sector, TCS has established a strategic alliance with Cencosud Scotiabank, expanding its role beyond consultancy to become an essential partner in the journey of growth and transformation. This collaboration reflects a shared commitment to advancing together in the competitive world of retail financial services, driving significant strategic change at Cencosud Scotiabank. As part of this effort, TCS has co-designed a series of practical workshops aimed at fostering and expanding the culture of innovation within the organization. These practical workshops are fundamental in the transformation process, providing deep and practical learning that serves as a solid foundation for the desired change. Each workshop session, carefully designed and executed according to an innovation playbook, aligns visual thinking tools with practical techniques to ensure smooth and effective execution of the work. The goal of these efforts is twofold: on the one hand, to strengthen the culture of innovation at Cencosud Scotiabank through collaboration; on the other, to firmly center the organization around the customer. The workshops are not just meetings; rather, they are collaborative spaces where creativity, deep user understanding, and agility converge to shape innovative solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a2245599492b490f824de2aff6fcfdab499a15f5f847beb4ab2c43742435ec3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
