{"title":"An Electrochemical Characterisation of Silica-Zirconia Oxide Nanostructured Materials for Fuel Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2181/v1","date":1727416226000,"content":"The effect of zirconium modified with silica dioxide in the conductivity of modified nanocomposite membrane in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) application. In this study silica-zirconia nanoparticles were successful synthesized by precipitation method. The surface area and surface morphology of Si-ZrO2 nanoparticles were observed under BET analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). SEM and XRD results show that silica was well incorporated into ZrO2 nanoparticles with the mixed shape of nanorods and nanosphere. HRTEM shows a crystallised small nanoparticle with average diameter about 5–8 nm. The element analysis (EDX) confirms the presence of silica and zirconia nanoparticles as well as oxygen on the surface. The addition of silica has impact on the surface area and pore size of Si-ZrO2 nanoparticles, with Si-ZrO2 nanoparticles having a higher surface area of 185 m2/g when calcinated at 600 °C. It was shown that the Si-ZrO2 can be used as an impregnating membrane to enhance the conductivity as observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), with a rectangular shape that exhibiting the best capacitance behaviour.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97acab639b5992493ba65cc573ae2638c12d6fe96c2df0fc1bb62aaa13ef10b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
