{"title":"Research Progress on Using Inorganic Nanomaterials to Enhance the Efficacy of Drug Therapy for Chronic Mountain Sickness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0051/v1","date":1727775527000,"content":"Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) poses a significant health risk to individuals who rapidly ascend to high altitudes, potentially endangering their lives. Inorganic nanoparticles offer an effective means of transporting and delivering drugs, protecting nucleic acids from nuclease degradation, and mediating the expression of target genes in specific cells. These nanoparticles are almost non-toxic, easy to prepare and store, possess a large surface area, exhibit good biocompatibility and degradability, and maintain good stability. They can be utilized in the treatment of CMS to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. This paper provides an overview of the impact of inorganic nanomaterials on CMS, discussing their roles as nanocarriers and their potential in CMS treatment. It aims to present novel therapeutic strategies for the clinical management of CMS and summarizes the relevant pathways through which nanomaterials contribute to plateau disease treatment, providing a theoretical foundation for future clinical research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22d08e3657cb671f93a72961d2f22a4e0db8792b4befea947145374ff96ca86c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
