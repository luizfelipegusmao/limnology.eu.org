{"title":"Deep Learning-based Approach for Optimizing Urban Commercial Space Expansion Using Artificial Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1325/v2","date":1712491107000,"content":"Amid escalating urbanization, devising rational commercial space layouts is a critical challenge. Leveraging machine learning, this study uses a Back-propagation (BP) neural network to optimize commercial spaces in Weinan City's central urban area. The results indicate an increased number of commercial facilities with a trend of multi-centered agglomeration and outward expansion. Based on these findings, we propose a strategic framework for rational commercial space development emphasizing aggregation centers, development axes, and spatial guidelines. This strategy provides valuable insights for urban planners in small and medium-sized cities in the Yellow River Basin and metropolitan areas, ultimately showcasing the power of machine learning in enhancing urban planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df6a6869dbad6a8f31d55ad929cc24e603e72c1cbc23c0df49d3d5b3ebbdc57b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
