{"title":"Rifampicin Loaded PLGA/Alginate Grafted pNVCL-Based Nanoparticles for Wound Healing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1365/v1","date":1726728229000,"content":"The topical therapy with rifampicin (RF)-based formulations is beneficial to treat infections and to healing the wounds. Despite recent research highlighting the antibiotic's significant an-ti-inflammatory properties, limited topical wound healing products are currently available. Present study aimed to prove that the newly synthesized nanoparticles based on grafted alginate and poly(N-vinylcaprolactam (pNVCL) and poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) contributes to the healing process of a wound. The methods used were at first the synthesis of the copolymer of al-ginate and pNVCL via grafting from technique and radical polymerization followed by wa-ter-in-oil-in water (W/O/W) emulsification by using as oil phase PLGA dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM). The formed nanoparticles were than characterized. The loaded RF was determined to be 160 µg/mL for a 20 mg formulation and within a four-hour time frame approximately 10% of the total loaded amount was released. The inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 192 µg/mL for the nanoparticle, 208 µg/mL for pure rifampicin, and 718 µg/mL for the rifampicin-loaded nanopar-ticles. Considering the double role Rifampicin was used for, the result was considered satisfactory in the way that these formulations could be used more with the wound irrigation post-surgery to avoid infections and to contribute to the healing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df84827df8bb15295b7c9d2c2eea9b1702fb2a4ca280fb16a98bd99c2d092bd0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
