{"title":"Sustainable Supply Chain Practices- A Qualitative Investigation of Green Logistics Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1089/v1","date":1718604388000,"content":"This study investigates green logistics strategies adopted by businesses to enhance sustainability within their supply chains, particularly focusing on reducing carbon footprints and environmental impacts associated with transportation and distribution activities. Through qualitative analysis and interviews with supply chain managers, industry experts, and sustainability officers, this research provides insights into motivations, strategies, challenges, and benefits related to green logistics practices. Key findings highlight the critical role of aligning green logistics with corporate sustainability goals. Advanced technologies such as telematics, GPS tracking, and data analytics are instrumental in optimizing transportation routes, reducing fuel consumption, and minimizing emissions. Additionally, strategies like using eco-friendly vehicles, energy-efficient warehouse operations, and implementing reverse logistics are identified as effective means to mitigate environmental impacts. Collaboration and partnerships with suppliers, logistics providers, and stakeholders are essential for sharing best practices and fostering joint initiatives. Despite benefits such as cost savings and enhanced corporate reputation, challenges include high initial investments, the absence of standardized metrics for environmental impact, and regulatory complexities. However, regulatory compliance also acts as a driver for green logistics adoption and presents opportunities for improving sustainability performance. The integration of sustainability goals with logistics strategies underscores the interdisciplinary nature of sustainable supply chain management. This holistic approach encompasses aspects of entrepreneurship, emotional intelligence, marketing, and supplier relationship management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a5949e0a32e318c7481c83333d29fdaea11f87c0eaf223ad1ad5ce044475448","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
