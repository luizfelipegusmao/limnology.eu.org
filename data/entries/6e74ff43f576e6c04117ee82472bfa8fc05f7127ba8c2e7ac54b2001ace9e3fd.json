{"title":"Potential economic impact on U.S. aquaculture of injurious species listing of major aquaculture species","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13044?af=R","date":1707993399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Regulatory changes to the Lacey Act and recent petitions to add aquaculture species in trade to the list of injurious wildlife could lead to prohibitions of interstate movement of live aquatic organisms with the potential for unintended, negative economic consequences. In this analysis, the economic impact of the potential federal prohibition of interstate transport of seven aquaculture species (blue catfish, tilapia, red swamp crawfish, grass carp, koi, guppy, and goldfish) currently in trade was assessed. Total economic impact was estimated to be $452 million (USD) annually, with a loss of 4819 jobs and a loss of $35 million in tax revenue. Effects could potentially occur on the largest sectors of U.S. aquaculture in as many as 80% of U.S. states and result in negative economic effects on as much as 21% of U.S. aquaculture farms.</p>","author":"Carole Ruth Engle, \nJonathan van Senten, \nQuenton M.
