However, genetic mutation analysis alone is not sufficient to fully explain the adaptive processes, and several studies report the existence of nongenetic (or epigenetic) inheritance that can enable adaptation to new environments. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis of the role of DNA methylation, a form of epigenetic modification, in adaptation of the plant pathogen <i>Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum</i> to the host during experimental evolution. Using SMRT-seq technology, we analyzed the methylomes of 31 experimentally evolved clones obtained after serial passages on 5 different plant species during 300 generations. Comparison with the methylome of the ancestral clone revealed a list of 50 differential methylated sites (DMSs) at the GTWWAC motif. Gene expression analysis of the 39 genes targeted by these DMSs revealed limited correlation between differential methylation and differential expression of the corresponding genes. Only 1 gene showed a correlation, the RSp0338 gene encoding the EpsR regulator protein. The MSRE-qPCR technology, used as an alternative approach for DNA methylation analysis, also found the 2 DMSs upstream RSp0338. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated the contribution of these 2 DMSs in host adaptation. As these DMSs appeared very early in the experimental evolution, we hypothesize that such fast epigenetic changes can allow rapid adaptation to the plant stem environment. In addition, we found that the change in DNA methylation upstream RSp0338 remains stable at least for 100 generations outside the host and thus can contribute to long-term adaptation to the host plant. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a direct link between bacterial epigenetic variation and adaptation to a new environment.","author":"Rekha Gopalan-Nair","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"baf77858bd43b436020396a775086fe44fe08192aa4eda29ec9f98e0d6d7f99d","category":"Environment"}
