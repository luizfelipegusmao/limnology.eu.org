However, the neural underpinnings of the interplay between inhibitory action control and emotions have only been marginally studied.

The results show that specific brain areas are selectively involved in stopping performance in either emotional or neutral settings.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Swiftly halting ongoing motor actions is essential to react to unforeseen and potentially perilous circumstances. However, the neural bases subtending the complex interplay between emotions and motor control have been scarcely investigated. Here, we used an emotional stop signal task (SST) to investigate whether specific neural circuits engaged by action suppression are differently modulated by emotional signals with respect to neutral ones. Participants performed an SST before and after the administration of one session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the pre-supplementary motor cortex (pre-SMA), the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), and the left primary motor cortex (lM1). Results show that rTMS over the pre-SMA improved the ability to inhibit prepotent action (i.e., better action control) when emotional stimuli were presented. In contrast, action control in a neutral context was fostered by rTMS over the rIFG. No changes were observed after lM1 stimulation. Intriguingly, individuals with higher impulsivity traits exhibited enhanced motor control when facing neutral stimuli following rIFG stimulation. These results further our understanding of the interplay between emotions and motor functions, shedding light on the selective modulation of neural pathways underpinning these processes.</p>","author":"Simone Battaglia, \nClaudio Nazzi, \nChiara Di Fazio, \nSara Borgomaneri","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"15dd97d9efbb36371b993e5ca6c46f9501d988fc332d67d8757cf31ddb37a118","category":"Environment"}
