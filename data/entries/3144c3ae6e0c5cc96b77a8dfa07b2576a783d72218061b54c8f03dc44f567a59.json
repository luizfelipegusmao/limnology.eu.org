{"title":"NPCC4: Advancing climate justice in climate adaptation strategies for New York City","link":"https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.15148?af=R","date":1724093105000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City (Equity) chapter of NPCC4 builds on the findings and recommendations from NPCC3 to identify additional metrics and adaptation efforts that can advance climate justice. First, the chapter assesses the efforts of the City to incorporate equity into climate adaptation efforts since NPCC3 and describes how the communities profiled in NPCC3 have implemented and evolved their approaches to addressing the intersecting climate, environmental, and social stressors that they continue to face. Second, it adds to the historical context of climate inequity by linking the bioregion's history of colonization, land dispossession, and slavery building on emerging evidence demonstrating how historical and contemporary land use patterns and decisions shape present and future climate risks and social vulnerability, including climate displacement. Third, it recommends a NYC-focused metric to identify areas of the city that are most vulnerable to the intersection of climate hazards, social vulnerability, and displacement. Finally, it highlights approaches to more equitable and just climate adaptation drawn from local, national, and international examples. As such, the chapter offers best practices that prioritize community-driven climate resilience approaches that are integrated, more equitable, and racially just.</p>","author":"Sheila R.
