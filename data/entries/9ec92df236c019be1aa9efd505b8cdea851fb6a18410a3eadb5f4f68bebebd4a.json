{"title":"Mononuclear Phagocytes, Cellular Immunity and Nobel Prizes: A Historic Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1936/v1","date":1721819139000,"content":"The Mononuclear Phagocyte System includes monocytes, macrophages, some dendritic cells and multinuclear giant cells. These cell populations display marked heterogeneity depending on their differentiation from embryonic and bone marrow haematopoietic progenitors, tissue location and activation. They contribute to tissue homeostasis by interacting with local and systemic immune and non-immune cells, through trophic, clearance and cytocidal functions. During evolution they contributed to innate host defense before effector mechanisms of specific adaptive immunity emerged. Mouse macrophages appear at midgestation and are distributed throughout the embryo to facilitate organogenesis and clear cells undergoing programmed cell death. Yolk sac-, AGM- and foetal liver-derived tissue resident macrophages persist throughout postnatal and adult life, supplemented by bone marrow-derived blood monocytes, as required after injury and infection. Nobel awards to Elie Metchnikoff and Paul Ehrlich in 1908 drew attention to cellular phagocytic and humoral immunity, respectively. In 2011, prizes were awarded to Jules Hoffmann and Bruce Beutler for contributions to innate immunity and to Ralph Steinman for discovery of Dendritic Cells and their role in antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. We trace milestones in the history of mononuclear phagocyte research from the perspective of Nobel awards bearing directly and indirectly on their role in cellular immunity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ec92df236c019be1aa9efd505b8cdea851fb6a18410a3eadb5f4f68bebebd4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
