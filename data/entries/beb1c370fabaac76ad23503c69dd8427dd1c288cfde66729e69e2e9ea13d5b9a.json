{"title":"Lack of variations in the salamander chytrid fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</i>, at its alleged origin: Updating its Japanese distribution with new evidence","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305228","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by David Lastra González, Kanto Nishikawa, Koshiro Eto, Shigeharu Terui, Ryo Kamimura, Nuria Viñuela Rodríguez, Natsuhiko Yoshikawa, Atsushi Tominaga</p>\r\n\r\nThe chytrid fungus <i>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</i> [Bsal] is causing declines in the amphibian populations. After a decade of mapping the pathogen in Europe, where it is causing dramatic outbreaks, and North America, where its arrival would affect to the salamander’s biodiversity hotspot, little is known about its current status in Asia, from presumably is native. Japan has several species considered as potential carriers, but no regulation is implemented against Bsal spreading. Previous Bsal known presence detected various cases on the Okinawa Island, southwestern Japan. Previous studies on its sister species, <i>B</i>. <i>dendrobatidis</i> presented a high genomic variation in this area and particularly on <i>Cynops ensicauda</i>. Here, we have done the largest monitoring to date in Japan on the <i>Cynops</i> genus, focusing on Okinawa Island and updating its distribution and providing more information to unravel the still unknown origin of Bsal. Interestingly, we have provided revealing facts about different detectability depending on the used molecular techniques and changes in its Japanese distribution. All in all, the Bsal presence in Japan, together with its low variability in the sequenced amplicons, and the lack of apparent mortalities, may indicate that this part of Asia has a high diversity of chytrids.","author":"David Lastra González","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"beb1c370fabaac76ad23503c69dd8427dd1c288cfde66729e69e2e9ea13d5b9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
