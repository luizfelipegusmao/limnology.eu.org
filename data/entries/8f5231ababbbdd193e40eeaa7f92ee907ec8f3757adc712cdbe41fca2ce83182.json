This geological unit has yielded several tetrapod fossils, including a well-represented assemblage of theropod dinosaurs, after more than eight decades of research. Here, we report new occurrences of spinosaurid theropods from the spinosaurine clade in the Kem Kem Group by providing anatomical descriptions and taxonomic identifications of 11 new specimens derived from the Tafilalt region of Morocco. Among the findings, we describe a cervical vertebra of <span>Sigilmassasaurus</span>, in addition to several cranial, axial, and appendicular elements that can safely be attributed to Spinosaurinae. Moreover, based on a unique combination of characteristics, we also describe an isolated and partial ischium belonging to an indeterminate carcharodontosaurid. We also deliver a detailed redescription of one of the most complete snouts of a spinosaurine known to date. Therefore, the theropod dinosaurs of the Kem Kem Group show considerable diversity, but many questions, especially related to the diversity of spinosaurids and the general abundance of carnivorous dinosaurs in this region, remain unclear until new materials are discovered and complete descriptions are made.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"8f5231ababbbdd193e40eeaa7f92ee907ec8f3757adc712cdbe41fca2ce83182","category":"Environment"}
