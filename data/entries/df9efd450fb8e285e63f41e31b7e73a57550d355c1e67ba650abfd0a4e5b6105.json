{"title":"Evaluation of Y2O3:Eu@SiO2 Nanoparticles as Photosensitizer for X-Ray Activated Photodynamic Therapy in Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1623/v1","date":1716537924000,"content":"Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), a clinical cancer therapeutic approach using light in killing cancer cells, is often limited by insufficient light penetration, inefficient photosensitizer energy transfer, and inadequate oxygen in hypoxic tumors. Employing X-ray to activate photosensitizer in PDT can potentially overcome these limitations. Here, we compared protocols to synthesize a novel nano-photosensitizer composed of a europium-doped yttrium oxide core with a silica shell (Y2O3:Eu@SiO2) which can be utilized in such therapeutic method, i.e., X-ray activated PDT (XPDT). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dihydroethidium (DHE) were utilized to evaluate the effects of various synthesis conditions on the characteristics of Y2O3:Eu@SiO2 and their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The in vivo tumor suppression effects of the Y2O3:Eu@SiO2 were assessed by 18F-fluorothymidine position emission tomography (18F-FLT PET) in human ovarian cancer xenografts using radiation sensitive CAOV3 and radiation resistant SKOV3 cell lines. Our data revealed a positive correlation between nanoparticle condensation time and core size as well as a negative correlation between urea concentrations and core size. Addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) during core synthesis enhanced particle dispersion. Two silica coating conditions showed the greatest efficiency in the enhancement of ROS generation. Furthermore, our in vivo study revealed suppression of tumor growth by Y2O3:Eu@SiO2 administration when compared to non-treated control. Silica shell provides flexibility to conjugate moieties that specifically target to cancers. This nano-photosensitizer demonstrates the significant promise for overcoming limitations of conventional PDT and combating various cancers in clinical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df9efd450fb8e285e63f41e31b7e73a57550d355c1e67ba650abfd0a4e5b6105","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
