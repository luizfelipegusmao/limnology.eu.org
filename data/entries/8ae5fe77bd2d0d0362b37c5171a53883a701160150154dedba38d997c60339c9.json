{"title":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of factors related to first line drugs refractoriness in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300930","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Claire Fayad, Kely Saad, Georges-Junior Kahwagi, Souheil Hallit, Darren Griffin, Rony Abou-Khalil, Elissar El-Hayek</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) is a prevalent form of epileptic disorder, specifically categorized within the realm of Genetic Generalized Epilepsy (GGE). Its hallmark features encompass unprovoked bilateral myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures that manifest during adolescence. While most JME patients respond favorably to anti-seizure medication (ASM), a subset experiences refractory JME, a condition where seizures persist despite rigorous ASM treatment, often termed “Drug-Resistant Epilepsy” (DRE). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the prevalence of refractory JME, and further to identify socio-demographic, electrophysiological and clinical risk factors associated with its occurrence. Pinpointing these factors is crucial as it offers the potential to predict ASM responsiveness, enabling early interventions and tailored care strategies for patients.</p> Material and methods <p>The systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Cochrane Handbook and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study evaluated outcomes post ASM treatment in JME cohorts by searching papers published up to September 2023 in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Predefined inclusion criteria were met by 25 eligible studies, forming the basis for analysis.</p> Results <p>A total of 22 potential risk factors for refractory JME were documented. Notably, robust risk factors for treatment resistance included Psychiatric Disorder (Odds Ratio (OR), 3.42 [2.54, 4.61] (95% Confidence Inverval (Cl)), Febrile Seizures (OR, 1.83 [1.14, 2.96] (95% Cl)), Alcohol Consumption (OR, 16.86 [1.94, 146.88] (95%Cl)), Aura (OR, 2.15 [1.04, 4.47] (95%Cl)), childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) evolving into JME (OR, 4.54 [1.61, 12.78] (95%CI)), occurrence of three seizure types (OR, 2.96 [1.96, 4.46] (95%CI)), and Focal EEG abnormalities (OR, 1.85 [1.13, 3.01] (95%Cl)). In addition, there were some non-significant risk factors for DRE because of noticeable heterogeneity.</p> Conclusion <p>In aggregate, over 36% of JME patients demonstrated drug resistance, with seven significant risk factors closely linked to this refractoriness. The interplay between these factors and whether they denote treatment non-response or heightened disease burden remains an open question and more studies would be required to fully examine their influence.</p>","author":"Claire Fayad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8ae5fe77bd2d0d0362b37c5171a53883a701160150154dedba38d997c60339c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
