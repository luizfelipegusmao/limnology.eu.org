Peres gates are recognized for their universality and energy \tefficient \tproperties and present an intriguing option for constructing reversible circuits. Reversible logic are \tcharacterized by its ability to uniquely determine input states from output states. The design methodology \tinvolves a \tcascading arrangement  of Peres gates each performing a reversible XOR operation on corresponding bits of the input \tnumbers and the carry out \tfrom the preceding stage. The paper presents a detailed schematic representation, simulation \tresults and analysis of the \tproposed designs of different adders and multipliers showcasing their potential for reversible \tapplications. The integration of Peres gates in the adder and multiplier design signifies a step forward in the exploration \tof reversible logic circuits and their applications in contemporary computing paradigms. The overall hardware reduction \tis the main achievement of this research in terms of quantum cost.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ade0f1959176e004109f3b32c413bb450ae1bf9b26e332683bc35b75964925b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
