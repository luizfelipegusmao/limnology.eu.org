{"title":"King Carol II’s Authoritarian Regime as a Precursor of the Communist Totalitarian Regime in Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0618/v1","date":1710151422000,"content":"The present article seeks to analyse the period 1938-1940, when the Romanian interwar democracy was suspended through the promulgation of the anti-liberal Constitution of 27 February 1938. The Constitution abolished the political parties and trade unions, replacing them with new institutions established according to royal decrees: the royal single party, known as the National Renaissance Front (Frontul Renaşterii Naţionale, FRN) and corporations of workers and employers, respectively. Starting from that moment, the regime, through its representatives, made recourse to a nationalist rhetoric directed against the democratic parliamentary system. Moreover, a cult of personality of the monarch can be identified in the speeches of the royal corporatist ‘parliament’, as well as in the doctrine of FRN and the Nation’s Party (its successor), but also in the regime’s youth organisation, ‘The Country’s Sentinel’ (Straja Ţării), whose First Sentinel was the authoritarian monarch himself. Thus, the cult of personality of Carol II represented one of the sources of inspiration for the dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu and for the leaders of this totalitarian regime.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e534678c0cdad574c9077fe339bdcffadedf5bae76f86e261708c7a82c79c384","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
