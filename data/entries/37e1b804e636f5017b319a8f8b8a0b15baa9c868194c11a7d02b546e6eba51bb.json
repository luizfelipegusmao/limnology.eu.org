{"title":"Recent Role of Microorganisms of the Mollicutes Class in the Aetiology of Bovine Respiratory Disease (Brd)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0581/v1","date":1728384480000,"content":"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) inflicts significant losses in cattle farming worldwide and is caused by the co-occurrence of various infectious agents which is often compounded by envi-ronmental factors. It is well known that microorganisms of the Mollicutes class are responsible for respiratory disorders in cattle, including BRD. This review highlights the current role of these microorganisms, in particular Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma dispar, in the aetiology of this disease complex, which has recently shifted towards a primary or predominant cause of the disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37e1b804e636f5017b319a8f8b8a0b15baa9c868194c11a7d02b546e6eba51bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
