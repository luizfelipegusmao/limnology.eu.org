{"title":"Analysis of Kinetic Curves of Mass Change During the Interaction of Active Gases with Certain Metals and Compounds with Simultaneous Evaporation of the Products of Reaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1442/v1","date":1713862658000,"content":"The influence of the secondary process of evaporation of the reaction product on the kinetics of interaction of gases (O2, Cl2, NH3, H2O and N2H4 vapors) with the surface of some metals (Cr, Pb, Si, Ge) and compounds (BN, SiO2, SiC) is discussed.  Also is considered  the case when the growth of the scale is preceded by the process of gas etching of the metal surface. A general equation is given that describes the scale growth-evaporation kinetic (sample mass change - time) curves during the interaction of gases with the surface of metals and compounds. Special cases of parabolic, cubic and fourth degree processes are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"234178237d2a3c60013e3c3491f86dd91f55c7d3676e817e46a5e60f15721959","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
