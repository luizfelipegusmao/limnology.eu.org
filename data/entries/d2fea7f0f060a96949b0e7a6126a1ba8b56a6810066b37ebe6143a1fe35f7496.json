{"title":"Repeated intratracheal instillation of whole‐cigarette smoke condensate to assess lung damage in a rat model","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24113?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Cigarette smoke induces an inflammatory response in the lungs by recruiting inflammatory cells, leading to lung diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. Existing inhalation exposure methods for assessing the adverse effects of cigarette smoke require expensive equipment and are labor-intensive. Therefore, we attempted to develop a novel method to assess these adverse effects using intratracheal instillation (ITI) of whole cigarette smoke condensate (WCSC). The WCSC (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/mL) was administered by ITI once daily for 6 or 12 days using an automatic video instillator. Repeated WCSC ITI increased the lung weight, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), neutrophil, and lymphocyte levels within bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared to the control. In the histopathological analysis of the lung tissue, a mild inflammatory response was observed in the 6 and 12 days 20 mg/mL WCSC exposure groups. The genome-wide RNA-seq expression patterns revealed that inflammatory and immune response-related genes, such as the chemokine signaling pathway, Th1/Th2 cell differentiation, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, were employed following WCSC exposure. In addition, <i>MCP-1</i> was time-dependent and increased in the 10 mg/mL exposure group compared to the control group. These results suggested that the WCSC might induce the potential pulmonary inflammatory response. Furthermore, we proposed that ITI may be a rapid and effective method of evaluating the adverse effects of WCSC within a short exposure period (less than 2 weeks), and it can be used to evaluate cigarette inhalation toxicity studies as an alternative method.</p>","author":"Jinhee Kim, \nYoon Cho, \nGi‐Jun Oh, \nHae‐Bin Park, \nMi Jin Yang, \nChul‐Min Park, \nYong‐Hyun Kim, \nKyung‐Chul Choi, \nRyeo‐Eun Go, \nMin‐Seok Kim","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"d2fea7f0f060a96949b0e7a6126a1ba8b56a6810066b37ebe6143a1fe35f7496","category":"Environment"}
