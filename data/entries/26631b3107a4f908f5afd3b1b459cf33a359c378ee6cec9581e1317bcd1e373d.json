{"title":"Dirac Theory as Relativistic Flow Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1779/v1","date":1721733887000,"content":"In previous papers we have shown how Schr\\\"{o}dinger's equation which includes an electromagnetic field interaction can be deduced from a fluid dynamical Lagrangian of a charged potential flow that interacts with an electromagnetic field. The quantum behaviour was derived from Fisher information terms which were added to the classical Lagrangian. It was thus shown that a quantum mechanical system is drived by information and not only electromagnetic fields. This program was applied also to Pauli's equations by removing the restriction of potential flow and using the Clebsch formalism. Although the analysis was quite successful there were still terms that did not admit interpretation, some of them can be easily traced to the relativistic Dirac theory. Here we repeat the analysis for a relativistic flow, pointing to a new approach for deriving relativistic quantum mechanics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26631b3107a4f908f5afd3b1b459cf33a359c378ee6cec9581e1317bcd1e373d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
