{"title":"Comprehensive prognostic assessment in kidney cancer: A multidimensional approach analyzing Fufang Sanling granules, genetic variants, and immune infiltration","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24225?af=R","date":1715774307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study delves into the potential therapeutic benefits of Fufang Sanling Granules for kidney cancer, focusing on their active components and the underlying mechanisms of their interaction with cancer-related targets. By constructing a drug-active component-target network based on eight herbs, key active compounds such as kaempferol, quercetin, and linolenic acid were identified, suggesting their pivotal roles in modulating immune responses and cellular signaling pathways relevant to cancer progression. The research further identified 51 central drug-disease genes through comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, implicating their involvement in crucial biological processes and pathways. A novel risk score model, encompassing six genes with significant prognostic value for renal cancer, was established and validated, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting patient outcomes through mutation analysis and survival studies. The model's predictive power was further confirmed by its ability to stratify patients into distinct risk groups with significant survival differences, highlighting its potential as a prognostic tool. Additionally, the study explored the relationship between gene expression within the identified black module and the risk score, uncovering significant associations with the extracellular matrix and immune infiltration patterns. This reveals the complex interplay between the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression. The integration of the risk score with clinical parameters through a nomogram significantly improved the model's predictive accuracy, offering a more comprehensive tool for predicting kidney cancer prognosis. In summary, by combining detailed molecular analyses with clinical insights, this study presents a robust framework for understanding the therapeutic potential of Fufang Sanling Granules in kidney cancer. It not only sheds light on the active components and their interactions with cancer-related genes but also introduces a reliable risk score model, paving the way for personalized treatment strategies and improved patient management in the future.</p>","author":"Junlan Zhu, \nYun Ye, \nXin Zhao, \nMeiling Wu, \nXuyao Wang, \nPeng Shu, \nJian Liu, \nXingguo Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"306f25a7c541c855e7360fa13f1be1b2d972babb726cd7d2854a800ab3eff5c8","category":"Environment"}
