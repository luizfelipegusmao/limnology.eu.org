{"title":"Assessing Benthic Recovery Below the United Kingdom’s First Large‐Scale, Offshore, Longline Mussel Farm","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/1393014?af=R","date":1728388153000,"content":"<p>The recent expansion of the aquaculture industry into the offshore marine environment is perceived to have a comparatively low environmental impact coupled with a high growth potential as a sustainable, large-scale source of healthy protein. This study assessed changes in sediment characteristics and infauna assemblages following the development of the first large-scale offshore longline mussel farm in the United Kingdom. By evaluating the effects of the farm on the sediment ecosystem and by studying infaunal sediment environmental parameters along a distance gradient away from the farm, the first before–after control–impact (BACI) study of an offshore shellfish farm is presented. Sediment grabs from the farm and control sites were analysed for sediment parameters (organic matter content (OM), particle size (PS), oxidation–reduction or redox potential (ORP) and trace elements) and infauna assemblages. There was no difference in sediment organic matter levels between the farm and control sites. Within the farm, the mean sediment grain size and ORP increased over time. Trace element concentrations were the lowest within farm sites compared to outside; concentrations increased with increasing distance from the farm. A total of 76 benthic macrofauna taxa were identified, with polychaetes being the dominant class. Over time, the number of taxa significantly increased within the farm while remaining relatively constant in control samples. Biodiversity metrics, including abundance and Shannon and Pielou’s index, were all greater within the farm compared to control areas. Overall, measures of assemblage health were higher within the farm than outside. This study demonstrates the long-term aquaculture–environment interactions that offshore shellfish farming can have on the seabed and its significance in terms of ecosystem services.</p>","author":"Llucia Mascorda-Cabre, \nPhil Hosegood, \nMartin J.
