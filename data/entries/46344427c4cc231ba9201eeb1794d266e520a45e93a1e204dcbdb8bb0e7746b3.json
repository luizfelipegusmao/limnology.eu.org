{"title":"Development of Hospital Management Information System Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1833/v1","date":1716888273000,"content":"Health care operations in many hospitals are experiencing increasing demand which is however hindered by the limited resources available. The imbalance between the demand and service provision capacity within the hospitals have resulted in long waiting times for service delivery due to overcrowding, high costs of treatment as well as low levels of patient’s satisfaction. The above problems are attributed to the development of hospital management information system. This dissertation is focused on investigating some of the causes of the increased cost and time consumption as well as low levels of patient’s satisfaction in the application of hospital management information system. The study used comparative design to make a comparison of the respondents from two different hospital facilities where 400 health workers were drawn for research. The questionnaire was used as a survey tool for the study that involved both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results of the study indicate various playing factors that arise due to the development of the hospital management information system. These factors include the large functionality of the system, the need for training of the end users, the increasing ageing population, and delays. The identified factors play a significant role in the way the information system impacts the time taken, the cost involved, and patient satisfaction. Keywords: health, hospital, doctors, technology, information system, time, and cost.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46344427c4cc231ba9201eeb1794d266e520a45e93a1e204dcbdb8bb0e7746b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
