{"title":"Stochastic attractor models of visual working memory","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301039","date":1712152800000,"content":"<p>by W.

These models have previously been shown to account for response-biases that are manifest across multiple trials of a visual working memory task. Here we adapt this approach by making the stable fixed points correspond to the multiple items to be remembered within a single-trial, in accordance with standard dynamical perspectives of memory, and find evidence that this multi-item model can provide a better account of behavioural data from continuous-report tasks. Additionally, the multi-item model proposes a simple mechanism by which swap-errors arise: memory traces diffuse away from their initial state and are captured by the attractors of other items. Swap-error curves reveal the evolution of this process as a continuous function of time throughout the maintenance interval and can be inferred from experimental data. Consistent with previous findings, we find that empirical memory performance is not well characterised by a purely-diffusive process but rather by a stochastic process that also embodies error-correcting dynamics.","author":"W.
