While AI has the potential to drive economic growth, enhance productivity, and elevate quality of life, it also brings forth concerns regarding job displacement, skill gaps, and unequal distribution of benefits. The latest research problem in the realm of AI and employment in Sabah revolves around ensuring inclusive and sustainable development amidst this technological disruption. This encompasses two key dimensions: skill development and education, and labor market dynamics. Addressing the research questions necessitates a multifaceted approach. Firstly, in the realm of skill development and education, there is a critical need to assess the adequacy of existing programs in equipping the workforce with AI-driven skills. Strategies such as promoting STEM education, fostering digital literacy, and facilitating lifelong learning initiatives, particularly among marginalized communities, are essential. Additionally, fostering collaboration between stakeholders and implementing curriculum reforms are pivotal steps in enhancing the alignment between educational curricula and the demands of an AI-driven economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a2781c047c52ed0747cd550f50d6941906bb1e97ec6f1a39f76d18874cfe49f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
