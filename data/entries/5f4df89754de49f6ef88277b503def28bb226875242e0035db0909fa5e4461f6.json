{"title":"PSIII-17 Comparative assessment of New Generation Phytase (HiPhorius vs. Ronozyme HiPhos in growing-finishing pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/301/7664915?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of HiPhorius (DSM-Firmenich), a new generation of phytase with improved temperature and pH stability, as a replacement of Ronozyme HiPhos (DSM-Firmenich) on performance of growing-finishing pigs fed corn and soybean meal-based diet. A total of 1,200 growing pigs [PIC genetics, with average initial body weight (BW) = 26.8 ± 0.6 kg] were divided into 60 pens, with each pen consisting of 20 pigs and equal number of gilts and barrows. Each pen within a location block was randomly assigned to one of 4 dietary treatments consisting of 2 sources of phytase (Ronozyme HiPhos and HiPhorius) at a low or a high level of available Phosphorus release (AvP, 0.15 and 0.19% respectively). To achieve a low (0.15%) or high (0.19%) AvP, 1,000 or 2,000 FYT/kg of Ronozyme HiPhos was used respectively. To achieve the same levels of AvP, a decreased inclusion of HiPhorius was used (600 and 1,000 FYT/kg for the low and high AvP, respectively). A five-phase feeding program was utilized until pigs reached market weights. All performance data were analyzed using GLIMMIX procedure in SAS (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) in a randomized complete block design with initial body weight as covariate. Least squares means were compared using Fisher’s LSD (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Overall (d 0 to d 92), there were no differences observed in any of the performance parameters [final BW, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), gain to feed ratio (G:F] regardless of the dietary treatments provided (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.20). There were also no differences in mortality and removals (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.20) and in final weight variation (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.20). In summary, using a reduced inclusion rate of HiPhorius (600 and 1,000 FYT/kg) resulted in similar overall growth performance as growing-finishing pigs fed Ronozyme HiPhos at 1,000 and 2,000 FYT/kg, respectively. The present study confirms the improved efficacy of the new generation phytase (HiPhorius) compared with Ronozyme HiPhos.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5f4df89754de49f6ef88277b503def28bb226875242e0035db0909fa5e4461f6","category":"Environment"}
