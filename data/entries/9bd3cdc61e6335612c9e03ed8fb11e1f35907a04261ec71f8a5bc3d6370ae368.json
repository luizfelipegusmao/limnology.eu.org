{"title":"Hydrolyzed Feather Meal Substitutes Poultry Meat in Diet of Dogs: Investigation of Animal Gut Microbiome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1707/v1","date":1727086845000,"content":"Two extruded diets isoenergetic, isonitrogenous, and isolipidic were formulated with poultry meal (CTR) as the source of animal-origin proteins (160 g/kg of feed) or with 90 g/kg of poultry meal and 70 g/kg of HFM (TRT) and were fed to eight dogs (four adult female and four adult male English Setters). Over 45 days, body weight, body condition, muscle condition, and fecal consistency scores were monitored at the beginning of the trial and after 3, 7, 15, and 45 days. No significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were observed for these parameters between diets and between sex. Fecal samples, collected at the same time points, were analyzed for microbiota composition. There was no significant difference in Shannon alpha diversity between the control (CTR) and experimental (TRT) diets or for diet × sampling time interaction and sex. However, beta diversity differed between diets (PERMANOVA p=0.001) and for diet × sampling interaction (p=0.009), with specific significant time points, and also differed by sex (p=0.047). LEfSe analysis showed Clostridiales, Coprococcus, Bacteroides plebeius, and others were more abundant in CTR, while Fusobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, and others were more abundant in TRT. Temporal shifts in taxa like Prevotella copri and Fusobacterium were observed, with 25 taxa differing by sex. The study highlights diet and sex effects on gut microbiota in dogs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bd3cdc61e6335612c9e03ed8fb11e1f35907a04261ec71f8a5bc3d6370ae368","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
