{"title":"Population genetics of recent natural colonization by the bull-headed shrike (Lanius bucephalus; Aves) suggests the importance of recurrent immigration on remote islands","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/141/4/559/7263128?rss=1","date":1694044800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Founder effects and recurrent immigration are two major factors that might potentially contribute to genetic differentiation and population persistence in the early stage of remote island colonization. However, their relative importance remains controversial. By conducting population genetic analyses of four remote island populations of the bull-headed shrike (<span>Lanius bucephalus</span>) established naturally within several decades in Japan, we examined the contributions of founder effects and recurrent immigration to these island populations. Based on the standard genetic indices and population structure analyses using 15 microsatellite loci, we suggested island-specific scenarios of colonization. Notably, the founder effect strongly influenced genetic differentiation in the population on the most remote oceanic island, Chichi-jima Island, which, however, became extinct 20 years after colonization, possibly owing to a lack of recurrent immigration. In contrast, another oceanic island, Minami-Daito Island, was probably subjected to multiple recurrent immigration events from the mainland, which obscured any genetic differentiation previously established by the founder effect. Temporal samples collected over 8 years on this island confidently supported this scenario. Underlying the island-specific scenarios of colonization, we provide evidence that recurrent immigration strongly affected the population persistence, overwhelming the initial founder effects. We argue for the importance of recurrent immigration even in colonization of highly remote islands.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"f0ac1f2226de881524dfbb4cb4328d2a7f3f5c53eb3a19dc51d6975b8d9d48b1","category":"Environment"}
