{"title":"Recognition of the game situation in baseball","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309328","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Yasuhiro Hashimoto, Hiroshi Takahashi, Hiromu Nagaura, Shinji Yoshitake, Hiroki Nakata</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examines baseball players’ recognition framework of out, ball, and strike counts in baseball games and clarifies the differences in psychological perspectives between batters and pitchers. The participants were 396 players (294 batters and 102 pitchers) belonging to baseball clubs at eight universities. Participants answered 288 questions for all game situations by combining out, ball, and strike counts and runner position. The advantages for batters or pitchers were evaluated using a 7-point Likert scale (from very advantageous for batters to very advantageous for pitchers). Factor analysis indicated four significant factors (36 items): “Batter’s advantage count,” “Pitcher’s advantage count,” “2 out young count,” and “0 out young count.” In a direct comparison of these factors between batters and pitchers, batters were more aware of their advantage over pitchers in the factors “Batter’s advantage count” and “0 out young count” and disadvantage in the “Pitcher’s advantage count.” Significant differences in recognition of these factors were observed between batters and pitchers. Batters were more susceptible to game situations than were pitchers. Our findings suggest that baseball players recognize several types of game situations, although not an infinite number.","author":"Yasuhiro Hashimoto","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9bfa351e35bebbbfb7dd48940024a44046ab67c7125fb890a4e642f42611cb22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
