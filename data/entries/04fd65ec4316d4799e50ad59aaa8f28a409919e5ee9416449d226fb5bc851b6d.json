{"title":"Differences in desiccation tolerance of two Australian freshwater mussel species with different life history characteristics is temperature dependent","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05570-x","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Mass die-offs, reduced species richness and local extinctions of freshwater mussels have resulted from river drying events, which often co-occur with high ambient temperatures. These events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under the influence of climate change. We aimed to identify the desiccation tolerance of two freshwater mussel species (the river mussel <em>Alathyria jacksoni</em> and the floodplain mussel <em>Velesunio ambiguus</em>) across a range of temperatures by simulating river drying events in laboratory conditions. Freshwater mussels were buried in sediment heated to 29, 32, 35, 38 and 41°C. Lethal times and lethal temperatures at which 50% mortality occurred were used to infer species-specific tolerances. The lethal time for 50% of mussels to reach mortality at 29°C was shorter for <em>A. jacksoni</em> (14 days) than <em>V. ambiguus</em> (58 days) but did not differ markedly at higher temperatures. Lethal temperatures were also similar between species over short durations (e.g. 39–40°C at 1 day). Our results suggest that the difference in desiccation tolerance between species diminishes toward their upper thermal limit. Management interventions aimed at reducing sediment temperatures, such as providing shade via riparian vegetation and wetting from environmental flows, could help alleviate the impact of drying events and climate change on both freshwater mussel species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"04fd65ec4316d4799e50ad59aaa8f28a409919e5ee9416449d226fb5bc851b6d","category":"Environment"}
