{"title":"The Method and Significance of Implementing the \"Three Certificates\" Teaching Model in Applied Undergraduate Colleges and Universities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0991/v1","date":1718345839000,"content":"Applied talent is not only a builder of human civilization but also a promoter of economic development. They not only need systematic and solid engineering theoretical knowledge but also rich engineering practical experience. Applied undergraduate colleges are the cradle for cultivating applied talent and shoulder the important mission of cultivating various types of applied talent for society. With the rapid development of higher education, the number of applied undergraduate institutions has sharply increased, but the quality of applied talent cultivated by them has shown a significant decline, which greatly restricts the pace of industrial development in the world. This article proposes a new concept of promoting the \"three certificates\" (graduation certificate, degree certificate, and skill certificate) education model in applied undergraduate colleges, which is of great significance for the country to cultivate composite talents with the ability of \"product design, production management, and product processing\" at the same time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c8793ac1cb79dff75366bdcf550ef5beff0d9ce38ef22562c26f8cccd145d7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
