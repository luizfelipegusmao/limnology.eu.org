{"title":"Healthcare professionals’ perceptions on providing support to informal carers within stroke care","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311915","date":1729000800000,"content":"<p>by Melissa Jammal, Gregory S. Kolt, Karen P. Y. Liu, Nariman Dennaoui, Emma S. George</p>\r\nBackground <p>The sudden nature of stroke onset does not provide carers with sufficient time to prepare for the demands associated with caring. Healthcare professionals can have a vital role in providing carers with support and training, which may reduce carer stress and strain, and allow for better health and rehabilitation outcomes for the stroke survivor. The experiences of healthcare professionals on supporting carers in stroke care, however, remain unclear.</p> Objective <p>To understand the experiences and perceptions of healthcare professionals working in stroke care on implementing resources and support to informal stroke carers.</p> Methods <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 healthcare professionals (5 occupational therapists, 5 physiotherapists, 1 psychologist) with at least 12 months’ experience in working with stroke survivors. Interviews ranged from 25–70 minutes in duration, and were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis.</p> Results <p>Three overarching categories that were explored were: (1) Experiences of working in stroke care and supporting carers; (2) Recommendations for a program designed for carers; and (3) Future priorities in stroke care. Participants discussed a variety of strategies they utilised to support carers including collaborating with other healthcare professionals and utilising skills and experience. Healthcare professionals highlighted the need for additional resources that are designed specifically for carers and explored key topics including carer stress and fatigue, support services, stroke education, and how to look after oneself. Participants identified priorities for stroke care including additional professional training and resource availability.</p> Conclusion <p>This study provided a unique insight from the perspectives of healthcare professionals on supporting carers. Participants identified the need for additional training and resources to equip healthcare professionals to better support carers. Future programs designed for carers should be informed by the needs and experiences of both informal carers and healthcare professionals.</p>","author":"Melissa Jammal","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6301a8a1a46c572bc6634327830aff9a013c5558068594d72b27518e202c3243","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
