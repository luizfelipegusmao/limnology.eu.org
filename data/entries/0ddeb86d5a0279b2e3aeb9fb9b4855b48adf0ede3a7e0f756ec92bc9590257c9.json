{"title":"The Potential Complementary Role of Imaging with 68Ga[68Ga-RGD] PET and MRI in Recurrent Adult Glioma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1120/v1","date":1718604086000,"content":"Abstract: Imaging of low (LGG) to high (HGG) grade gliomas is conventionally performed with MRI, which is the non-invasive gold-standard imaging modality to derive data. Gliomas (Grade 1,2,3,4) are lethal and demonstate poor outcomes despite novel therapies.\nIntegrins compose of heterodimeric parasympathetic nervous system; the aVb3 (RGD i.e. Galacto-Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) have been displayed as a potential biomarker that can be imaged via PET in order to trace the angiogenetic pathway. Gliomas are common primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours which are often pose a diagnostic challenge, even to stage and manage because of their heterogeneity in molecular aberrations. Several core mutational core hallmarks of gliomas are inducing/accessing vasculature, tumour promoting inflamation, polymorphic microbes and avoiding/resisting cell death; these ultimately lead to poor prognosis. In 2007, the classification of diffuse gliomas was based on the histopathology and subtype e.g. Pilocytic astrocytoma and low cell proliferation,\nin 2016, the classification of diffuse gliomas was based on the IDH status, 1p/19q codeletion, subtype and grade; then in 2021, the IDH status (wild-type or mutant), molecular profile, subtype and grade were added in order to improve the classification of diffuse gliomas.\nImaging (MRI) techniques progress stalled despite the imperfections in MRI e.g distinguishing RN (radionecrosis) and PsP (Pseudoprogression) hence the exploration of PET probes that detect important hallmarks of gliomas e.g. techniques such as [68Ga]68Ga-RGD positron emission tomography (PET) to be utilised to assess vasculature. This case report aimed to determine the potential clinical utility of molecular imaging with 68Ga-RGD PET used in complementary to traditional MRI techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ddeb86d5a0279b2e3aeb9fb9b4855b48adf0ede3a7e0f756ec92bc9590257c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
