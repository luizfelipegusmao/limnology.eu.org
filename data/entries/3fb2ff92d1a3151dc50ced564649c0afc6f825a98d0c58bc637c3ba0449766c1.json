{"title":"Influencing factors and realization paths for smart community construction in China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303687","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Wenjing Li, Lijian Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nThe analysis of influencing factors serves as the cornerstone for the research on smart community construction. Drawing upon both field research and extensive literature study, this paper explores the influencing factors of Chinaâ€™s smart community construction and its effective paths by taking 52 national pilot zones for community governance and service innovation in China as examples. In the constructed analytical framework of influencing factors, elements such as economic development, capital investment, information infrastructure, community governance, public support system, and smart platform are included. By the use of the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method, the results of the study show that community governance, public support system, and smart platform are necessary conditions for smart community construction, while economic development, capital investment and information infrastructure play a leading role in the four combined paths. Finally, this study provides a new perspective for theoretical research, a reference forgovernmental departments to make decisions, and experience for the construction of smart communities in other developing countries.","author":"Wenjing Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3fb2ff92d1a3151dc50ced564649c0afc6f825a98d0c58bc637c3ba0449766c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
