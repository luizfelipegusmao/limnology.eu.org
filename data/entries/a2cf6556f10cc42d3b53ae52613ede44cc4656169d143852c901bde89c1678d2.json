We have previously shown that the module miR156–SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE9 (SPL9)–DEWAX is involved in the diurnal regulation of wax production; however, it was not determined whether other SPLs are also involved in wax synthesis. Here, we report that SPL13 also regulates drought-induced wax production, by directly and indirectly affecting the expression of the two wax biosynthesis genes <span>ECERIFERUM1</span> (<span>CER1</span>) and <span>CER4</span>, respectively. In addition, we show that SPL13 together with SPL9 redundantly regulates wax accumulation under both normal and drought stress conditions, and that simultaneous mutation of both genes additively increases cuticle permeability and decreases drought tolerance. However, in contrast to SPL9, SPL13 does not seem to participate in the DEWAX-mediated diurnal regulation of wax production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"a2cf6556f10cc42d3b53ae52613ede44cc4656169d143852c901bde89c1678d2","category":"Environment"}
