If the phosphorus in the sewage were recovered, addressing this issue could significantly contribute to mitigating the global phosphorus crisis. In this study, corn straw, a common agricultural waste, was co-pyrolytically modified with eggshells, a type of food waste from university cafeterias. The resulting product, referred to as corn straw eggshell biochar (EGBC) was characterized using SEM, XRD, XPS, XRF, and other methods. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the optimal preparation conditions of EGBC and to explore its adsorption characteristics. EGBC showed strong adsorption effectiveness within a pH range of 5–12. The adsorption isotherm closely followed the Sips model (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9011), and the adsorption kinetics were more consistent with the pseudo-second-order model (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9899). The process was found to be both spontaneous and endothermic. Under optimal conditions, the phosphorus adsorption capacity of EGBC was measured to be 288.83 mg/g. This demonstrates the high efficiency of EGBC for phosphorus removal and illustrates an effective method of utilizing food waste for environmental remediation.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nBiochar prepared from waste eggshell was used to removal and recovery phosphorus in wastewater treatment.\nEGBC has an impressive adsorption capacity that can reach up to 288.83 mg/g.\nEGBC has excellent adsorption and filtration capabilities, and there is a sudden increase in concentration at 900 min in the breakthrough curve of EGBC.\nEGBC has good regeneration performance, with an adsorption effect of 65% and an adsorption capacity of 121 mg/g after four desorption and regeneration cycles.\n</p>","author":"Qingshan Xu, \nCong Li, \n Sumita, \nWeihai Pang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"601d2c98ab5c7c9141eaf228da8377fee77c58260e104f88b32292a61521cd83","category":"Environment"}
