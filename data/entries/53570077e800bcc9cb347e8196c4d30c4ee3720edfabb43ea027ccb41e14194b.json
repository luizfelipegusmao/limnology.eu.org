{"title":"Unraveling the Water Source and Formation Process of Huangshui in Solid-State Fermentation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0561/v1","date":1715234024000,"content":"Strong-aroma Baijiu is a traditional Chinese spirit distilled from grains that undergo solid-state fermentation. At the end of each fermentation cycle, a significant quantity of Huangshui accumulates at the bottom of the fermentation pit, constituting one of the primary by-products in the brewing process of strong-flavor liquor. In this report, the chemical component analysis of Huangshui obtained from a strong-flavor liquor factory revealed a diverse array of organic acids, alcohols, esters, starch, reducing sugars, amino acids, and other compounds present in Huangshui. Additionally, two specialized solid-state fermentation models were developed to investigate the formation process of Huangshui. Our findings demonstrate a positive correlation between the yield of Huangshui and the initial moisture content of fermented grains. It is concluded that Huangshui is the percolate produced during the solid-state brewing process of strong-flavor liquor, with its water content originating from the initial moisture of fermented grains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53570077e800bcc9cb347e8196c4d30c4ee3720edfabb43ea027ccb41e14194b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
