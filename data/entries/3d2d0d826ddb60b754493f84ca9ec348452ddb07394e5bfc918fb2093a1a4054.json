{"title":"Efficient oxidation attenuates porewater‐derived methane fluxes in mangrove waters","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12639?af=R","date":1723548356000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Mangroves store significant amounts of carbon in both sediment and water. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is often produced in anoxic, organic-rich sediments during carbon degradation and released to overlying waters via porewater exchange. Yet, a portion of CH<sub>4</sub> can be oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> before emission. Here, we investigate whether CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation impacts its emissions using high-temporal resolution CH<sub>4</sub> concentration and stable isotope (δ<sup>13</sup>C-CH<sub>4</sub>) observations collected over 14 tidal cycles in 2 Brazilian mangrove creeks with no river inputs. We found higher CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations (~ 150 nM) more depleted in <sup>13</sup>C (−75‰) during low tide than high tide at both creeks. Similar δ<sup>13</sup>C-CH<sub>4</sub> values between low tide surface waters and porewaters further suggest tidally driven porewater exchange as the main source of CH<sub>4</sub>. More <sup>13</sup>C-enriched CH<sub>4</sub> in surface waters and surface sediments than deep sediments indicate partial CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation prior to exchange with the atmosphere. A stable isotope mass balance revealed that 17–58% of CH<sub>4</sub> was oxidized at rates of 3–25 <i>μ</i>mol m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> in the water column of tidal creeks. A larger portion of deep porewater CH<sub>4</sub> (45–61%) was oxidized in sediments prior to porewater exchange with surface creek waters. The two mangrove creeks had average water–air CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes of 51–109 <i>μ</i>mol m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> over spring-neap tidal cycles. These aquatic CH<sub>4</sub> emissions offset only &lt; 3% of the mangroves' soil carbon sequestration. Overall, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in both surface water and sediment attenuated CH<sub>4</sub> emissions to the atmosphere.</p>","author":"Yvonne Y. Y.
