Six ruminally cannulated beef steers (BW = 520 ± 30 kg) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design and offered a steam-flaked corn-based finishing diet to ad libitum intake during three, 28-d periods. Treatments were: 1) Control (no DFM, lactose carrier only); 2) Treat-A (L. animalis, P. freudenreichii; B. subtilis; and B. licheniformis), at 1:1:1:3 ratio, respectively; totaling 6 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU (50 mg)/animal-daily minimum; and 3) Treat-B, the same DFM combination, but with doses at 1:1:3:1 ratio. Bacterial counts were approximately 30% greater than the minimum expected. Pre-dehydrated (55ºC for 72 h) diets and forage substrates were ground (2 mm) and placed into 10 × 20 cm (28 µm) nylon bags (8 and 5 g, as-is respectively). The diet-substrate included a mixture of (DM basis) steam-flaked corn (70%), alfalfa hay (10%), and wet corn gluten feed (20%). The forage-substrate was represented by ‘WW-B Dahl’ Old World bluestem (Bothriochloa bladhii). Substrate in-situ bags were placed within a nylon mesh (with weights) at the ruminal ventral sac, and reversely removed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, 48, 64, 72, and 96 h after feeding. Samples were removed, rinsed, and dehydrated for 72 h at 55<sup>o</sup>C. Residues were composited within period, steer, incubation-time, corrected for residual moisture and were used to fit a first-order kinetics model using the NLIN procedure of SAS (animal = experimental unit). Steers offered Treat-A tended to show an increase on the rate of degradation of NDF (P = 0.15) and ADF (P = 0.10) fractions; increased (P &lt; 0.01) hemicellulose potentially degradable fraction (B); and increased (P = 0.02) the effective degradable fraction of NDF (tendency for ADF, P = 0.08) at pre-established rate of passages of 4, 5, and 6% of the diet-substrate compared with Control, while tending to have a reduced rate of degradation for the overall DM (P = 0.06) and OM (P = 0.08) fractions. When the in-situ bags containing the forage-substrate were incubated, steers offered Treat-A showed an increased (P &lt; 0.01) lag time (T0) for hemicellulose compared with Control, while those offered Treat-B had a decreased (P = 0.02) hemicellulose potentially degradable fraction (B) compared with Control. The effective degradable fraction for hemicellulose at pre-established rate of passages of 4, 5, and 6% tended (P = 0.09) to numerically increase for steers offered Treat-A compared with Control. The combination of bacteria in Treat-A enhanced the ruminal degradation of high-quality fiber components, as indicated by the improvements observed within the more degradable fractions from ingredients used in the diet and the forage substrates. Further assessment is warranted to investigate post-ruminal nutrient disappearance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"a91292fa489fc0b1e7bb465bc2143add75cdc202f105f94cc4359e4ec7e3baf6","category":"Environment"}
