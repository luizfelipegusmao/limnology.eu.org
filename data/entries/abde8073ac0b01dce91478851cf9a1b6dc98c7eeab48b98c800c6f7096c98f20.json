{"title":"Single Center Based Real-World Experience on ANTI-IL 1 Biological Response Modifiers: A Case Series and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2016/v1","date":1721884789000,"content":"This communication is to summarize our single center experience on applications of anti-IL-1 biologic response modifiers on autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions in children. We present our rationale for off-label utilization of Anakinra and discuss evolving treatment paradigms that warrants further research and validation. Based on our observations and successful treatment outcomes, we advocate future multilateral efforts to liberate access to anti-IL-1 medications to control inordinate and detrimental inflammation in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abde8073ac0b01dce91478851cf9a1b6dc98c7eeab48b98c800c6f7096c98f20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
