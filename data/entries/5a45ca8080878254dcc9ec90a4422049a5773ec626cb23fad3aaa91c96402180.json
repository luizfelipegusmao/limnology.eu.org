{"title":"Impact of Non-Antibiotic Antibacterial Substances against Multidrug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2261/v1","date":1727680000000,"content":"Conventionally, antibiotics have been regularly practiced as a cure of specific infections caused by specific bacteria. The rational use of antibiotics has always been challenging. Antibiotic residual time period is different for different antibiotics. The overuse and under-use of antimicrobials provokes the development of resistance, through which MDR strains have emerged. In this research, we intend to use Non-Antibiotic Antibacterial Agents (NAAB) that have no side effect and no residual time, in order to treat these MDR strains. Microorganisms do not develop resistance against NAAB. This study revolves around the use of Lactic Acid (LA) and Acetic Acid (AA) as NAAB against MDR strains of Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella. Through broth dilution method, we identified the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). For LA, MIC for Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella is 0.78µl, 0.39µl and 0.39µl respectively and OD600 values at MIC is 0.041 for all microorganisms. Similarly, for AA the MIC was recorded at 0.78µl for Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella, with OD600 value 0.041.Through Disc Diffusion Method, we got zone of inhibition (ZOI) 25mm ±1 to 18mm±1 at NAAB concentrations above MIC, indicating concentrations sufficient enough to kill bacteria while we got ZOI below 10mm at concentrations below MIC indicating that bacteria are resistant at these concentrations. We concluded that NAAB agents possess strong potential as disinfectants and antiseptics and can be ployed for the treatment of mastitis as their MIC concentrations are totally harmless for living tissue even if we inject directly into it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a45ca8080878254dcc9ec90a4422049a5773ec626cb23fad3aaa91c96402180","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
