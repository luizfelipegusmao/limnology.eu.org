{"title":"FATTY ACID DESATURASE4 enhances plant RNA virus replication and undergoes host vacuolar ATPase-mediated degradation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1502/7700338?rss=1","date":1719446400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Emerging evidence indicates that fatty acid (FA) metabolic pathways regulate host immunity to vertebrate viruses. However, information on FA signaling in plant virus infection remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of fatty acid desaturase (FAD), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of saturated FAs into unsaturated FAs, during infection by a plant RNA virus. We previously found that the rare Kua-ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Kua-UEV1) fusion protein FAD4 from <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> (NbFAD4) was downregulated upon turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection. We now demonstrate that NbFAD4 is unstable and is degraded as TuMV infection progresses. NbFAD4 is required for TuMV replication, as it interacts with TuMV replication protein 6K2 and colocalizes with viral replication complexes. Moreover, NbFAD4 overexpression dampened the accumulation of immunity-related phytohormones and FA metabolites, and its catalytic activity appears to be crucial for TuMV infection. Finally, a yeast 2-hybrid library screen identified the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase component ATP6V0C as involved in NbFAD4 degradation and further suppression of TuMV infection. This study reveals the intricate role of FAD4 in plant virus infection, and sheds light on a new mechanism by which a V-ATPase is involved in plant antiviral defense.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"361cd7bfdfd6fbdf687453b60819ec634666e8f76e2b16c9000ff94f9d56a545","category":"Environment"}
