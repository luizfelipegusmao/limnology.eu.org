Despite the lack of successful Ras signaling inhibitors, recent research has identified PDEδ, a KRAS transporter, as a potential target for inhibiting the oncogenic KRAS signaling pathway. This study aims to investigate the interactions between eight K-Ras inhibitors (deltarazine, deltaflexin 1 and 2, and its analogues) and PDEδ to understand their binding modes. The research will utilize computational techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular electrostatic surface potential (MESP), molecular docking, binding site analyses, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, electronic structure computations, and predictions of the binding free energy. Molecular dynamic simulations (MD) will be used to predict the binding conformations and pharmacophoric features in the active site of PDEδ for the examined structures. The binding free energies determined using the MMPB(GB)SA method will be compared with the observed potency values of the tested compounds. This computational approach aims to enhance understanding of the PDEδ selective mechanism, which could contribute to the development of novel selective inhibitors for K-Ras signaling.","author":"Taghreed A.
