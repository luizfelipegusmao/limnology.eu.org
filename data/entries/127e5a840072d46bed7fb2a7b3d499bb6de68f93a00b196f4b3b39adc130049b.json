{"title":"Repurposing Castanea sativa By-Product Extract as a Potent Anti-inflammatory Agent","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1600/v1","date":1711454021000,"content":"The “circular bioeconomy” offers numerous opportunities for the health, cosmetic, and nutrition sectors through the potential reuse of Castanea sativa by-products. This abundant and sustainable resource provides valuable bioactive secondary metabolites with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. The transformation of these by-products into high-value products for human health can contribute to sustainable economic growth and reduce the environmental impact of traditional waste disposal practices, thus creating added value from previously underutilized resources. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant capacity, phytochemical composition and in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of C. sativa burrs (CSB) aqueous extract. The spectrophotometric study yielded optimal total phenolic content (TPC) values, along with significant antioxidant and anti-radical properties. The utilization of UPLC-MS-MS techniques for phytochemical investigation resulted in the identification of a total of 56 metabolites, providing confirmation of the presence of phenolic compounds in CSB. In addition, CSB significantly downregulated pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells without significant cell toxicity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"127e5a840072d46bed7fb2a7b3d499bb6de68f93a00b196f4b3b39adc130049b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
