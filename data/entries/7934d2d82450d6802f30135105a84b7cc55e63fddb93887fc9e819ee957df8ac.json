{"title":"Protection of Lactobacillus reuteri against Trichinella spiralis via Nrf2 Signal Pathway in Intestinal Phase","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0406/v1","date":1717739248000,"content":"Trichinellosis is a major worldwide health concern caused by T. spiralis infection without highly efficient and safe therapeutic method so far. To solve the problem of uncomplete drug treatment schemes and the rise of anthelmintic resistance, a potential protective effect of probiotic strains against zoonotic T. spiralis infection was investigated in the framework of a new therapeutic strategy aimed at using probiotics to control parasitic zoonoses. The study was focused on L. reuteri protected against T. spiralis infection in intestinal phase throughout the detection of adult worm number, inflammatory factors mRNA expression, antioxidant enzyme expression and Nrf2 signal pathway protein expression. Mice were divided randomly into 3 groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) Ts group: T. spiralis infection; 3ï¼‰LAB group: T. spiralis infected after orally administered L. reuteri for 7 days. Probiotics bacteria were administered daily in a dose of 109 CFU/mL, and mice were infected with 400 T. spiralis larvae in the experimental groups. The number of adult worms was also significantly increased after administration of probiotics. Meanwhile, L. reuteri alleviate the inflammatory response caused by T. spiralis infection in intestinal has been confirmed. In addition, the promotion of antioxidant enzyme expression can be inferred that L. reuteri regulate Nrf2 signal pathways against T. spiralis infection. Our study demonstrates that L. reuteri provide protection against T. spiralis infection in intestinal. Therapeutic approaches with probiotic strains admission could help to reduce the risks of trichinellosis or complement classical anti-parasite treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7934d2d82450d6802f30135105a84b7cc55e63fddb93887fc9e819ee957df8ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
