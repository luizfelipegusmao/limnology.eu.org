{"title":"Benzathine penicillin G stockouts and other barriers to documented syphilis treatment in pregnancy in Zambia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304576","date":1717423200000,"content":"<p>by Anna V.

Dionne</p>\r\nObjective <p>The prevalence of syphilis in Zambia remains high and is a critical public health concern. The Zambian Ministry of Health recommends universal screening and same-day treatment for syphilis in pregnancy, yet the syphilis screening rate is low, and treatment is poorly documented. The goal of this study was to document syphilis treatment rates and associated factors among pregnant women in care in Zambia.</p> Methods <p>This retrospective cohort study included pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis according to rapid plasma reagin (RPR) screening during routine antenatal care (ANC) in Lusaka, Zambia in 2018–2019. The main outcome of interest was lack of documented BPG treatment during pregnancy. Additional information about pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, partner referral for therapy, and facility level stockout data were included. Patient characteristics were compared by treatment status using Pearson Chi-Square Test and logistic regression models were created to estimate the association between individual level-factors, facility type, and lack of BPG treatment. A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to evaluate facility-level data with significance set at p&lt;0.05.</p> Results <p>Among 1,231 pregnant women who screened positive for syphilis at clinic, 643 (52%) lacked documented antibiotic treatment at the facility. BPG was the only antibiotic used to treat syphilis in the cohort and 8% of sex partners had evidence of referral for therapy. Preterm delivery rates were higher in women without documented BPG (43% vs 32%; p = 0.003). In adjusted models, only calendar year and hospital facility type were associated with lack of treatment. At the facility level, annual syphilis screening rates ranged from 37–65% and most (7/10) clinics reported at least one stockout of BPG.</p> Conclusion <p>Treatment rates for syphilis in pregnancy in Zambia were low and BPG medication stockouts at the facility level were common. A consistent supply of BPG at all ANC facilities is needed to facilitate timely treatment and improve birth outcomes.</p>","author":"Anna V.
