{"title":"Dynamic Convergence: Exploring AI's Impact on Social Science in Malaysia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1633/v1","date":1713969644000,"content":"The vibrant landscape of Malaysia serves as a dynamic backdrop for the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and social science, reshaping knowledge and inquiry amidst tradition and modernity. With Malaysia leading a technological renaissance driven by digital transformation and innovation, the ethical implications of AI-driven decision-making in public policy and governance emerge as pressing research problems. Addressing concerns such as algorithmic bias and discrimination requires interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness. Exploring questions regarding the distribution of welfare benefits and strategies for enhancing transparency and accountability in urban planning underscores the need for contextually relevant frameworks and stakeholder engagement. Through comprehensive research objectives, including investigating algorithmic biases and analyzing their social implications, scholars aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between AI technology, social dynamics, and public policy. As Malaysia navigates the challenges and opportunities presented by AI deployment, prioritizing interdisciplinary collaborations, longitudinal studies, and capacity-building efforts will be essential for shaping a future that upholds principles of social justice and collective well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"219b8ea6725a87f1049ca3c1ef6237af7e6373d3620deeb20dcf4042b9db6263","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
