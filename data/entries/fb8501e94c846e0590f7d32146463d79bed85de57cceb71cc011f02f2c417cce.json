{"title":"Decentralized Finance: US Federal Reserve Assets Tokenization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1707/v1","date":1721667445000,"content":"Digitalization has fundamentally changed the global economy and will continue to do so. This study investigates how the US Federal Reserve and US Treasury may work together to use decentralized finance (DeFi) systems to promote economic growth in local communities. The study looks into the potential for transformation and the difficulties in incorporating DeFi into conventional financial institutions. Research shows that the use of cash as a means of payment is widely expected to decline in the future. As a result, the publicâ€™s ability to make transactions using central bank money may decline rapidly. This study's goals are to solve economic issues, promote innovation, and increase financial efficiency. The use of in-depth interviews, theme analysis, case studies, stakeholder perspectives, comparative analysis, and document analysis is suggested as part of a qualitative research methodology. The goal of these approaches is to offer a sophisticated comprehension of the dynamics of collaboration and the consequences of DeFi integration in the context of the Federal Reserve-Treasury relationship. Important data sources that are necessary to answer the research question are indicated, such as US Treasury statistics, Federal Reserve publications, DeFi platforms, and International Monetary Fund economic indicators. Informed decision-making and policy formation may pave the way for a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem, which will eventually drive regional economic growth in the United States and promote monetary sovereignty for the aforementioned monetary entities. This can be achieved by investigating creative collaboration tactics between the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb8501e94c846e0590f7d32146463d79bed85de57cceb71cc011f02f2c417cce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
