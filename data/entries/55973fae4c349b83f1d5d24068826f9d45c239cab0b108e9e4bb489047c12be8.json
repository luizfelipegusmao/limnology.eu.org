{"title":"Role of Mycorrhizal Fungi in Maintaining Sustainable Agroecosystem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1820/v1","date":1729695569000,"content":"Plant-microbe interactions are pivotal in a plant's growth and development. Mycor-rhizal fungi, in particular, play a crucial role in maintaining sustainable agroecosys-tems through symbiotic relationships with plant roots, improving soil health, facili-tating nutrient uptake, and enhancing plant stress resilience. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi enhance plant growth by increasing the absorption of essential nutrients, particularly phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, zinc, and copper. The mutualistic rela-tionship between AM fungi and plants promotes a balanced microbial community and improves soil structure by forming stable soil aggregates. Additionally, mycorrhizal fungi increase plant tolerance to abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, and heavy metal toxicity, by regulating osmotic balance, producing antioxidants, and altering exudatemorphology. It also negate harmful effects of high soil phosphorus levels and bolster plant resilience to environmental stresses. Beneficial microorganisms, such as potassium-solubilizing microbes and nitrogen-transforming bacteria, further enhance the functionality of mycorrhizal associations. Furthermore, mycorrhizal fungi con-tribute to plant health by reducing the incidence of root pathogens and soilborne dis-eases. However, the sustainability of mycorrhizal fungi is threatened by intensive agricultural practices, including heavy tillage, continuous monoculture, and excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These practices disrupt hyphal networks and reduce microbial diversity, compromising mycorrhizal functionality. Alternatively, sustainable farming practices such as reduced tillage, crop rotation, and organic amendments are recommended to support healthy mycorrhizal populations. By adopting these practices, we can achieve long-term agricultural productivity while maintaining a healthy soil environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55973fae4c349b83f1d5d24068826f9d45c239cab0b108e9e4bb489047c12be8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
