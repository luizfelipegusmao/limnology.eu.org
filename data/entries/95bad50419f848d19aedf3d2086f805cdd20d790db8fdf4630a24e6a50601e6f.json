{"title":"Fractal Geometric Pyramidal &ndash; Spiral- Hexagonal Complexes Generated by Ancestral Geology Collision Events Is Expressed in Cancer Tissues","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0209/v1","date":1725341127000,"content":"Fractal Geometric Pyramidal - Spiral- Hexagonal complexes ( GPS-H ) are the hereditary product of chaos and is its molecular solution.. Cancer is like a time machine to allowed us as pathologists to discover and document geometric structures that otherwise, we would not know existed. We have been documenting about cancer, geometric ordering complexes that are absolutely perfect made by an elastic geometry that we have called GPS-H complex: P for pyramid, S for spiral and H for hexagonal these structures have their genesis in the intercellular collisions of tumor cells or in extreme cellular damage by collision which generate DNA breakage. The DNA helices breaking generates the pyramidal and spiral component and in the same way, the amplification of the nitrogenous bases generates the hexagonal component. We are documenting, from different geology and biology scenarios, the existence of fractal invariant geometry of ancestral expansion, that generates order and connects these two systems as of the perspective of collision events at molecular , microscopic or macroscopic scales with the identification of geometric pattern that is modulated by the interaction between the electromagnetic field and material systems. The Geology and Biology converge into a single entity mediated by these geometric complexes to generate life platforms From collision and chaos events emerge at the interface of solid- liquids the GPS-H complexes that facilities water Fluid Interaction with basic geometries into a composite geometry leading in all systems and scales to deformation of the solid states . The deformed solid structures, in turn, acts as a moving wall boundary for the fluid and changes the water flow field in this way the balance and order of the system is restored. GPS-H are the hereditary product of chaos and its molecular solution. Based on the data obtained and analyzed, we verified that these GPS-H complexes are not native to the earth, representing a metastatic seeding that originally comes from the outer space and probably was incorporated into the ancestral DNA of the first multicellular organisms in the interphase of geology collsion events so we can trace it to the first multicellular organisms of the edicarian biota As ancient geometry, the pyramids of Egypt represent the most enigmatic and majestic structures built on earth but until know, it is unknown how they built, it us an unresolved mystery. Like enigmatic are the patterns in biology documented and published about cancer and represented by these fractal GPS-H complexes which have a unique particularity, remain invariable, they do not change from a microscopic to a macroscopic or megascopic scale and even over time they remain unchanged, as here it is documented. They have the quantum property of multiples expansions; thus, it is possible to trace them over time and in different dimensional scales. Based on the properties of this unique complex, it is possible to identify an active morphologic fractal connection between the microscopical level of pyramidal complexes seen in cancer and the megastructures of Egypt pyramids by clearly documenting complexes GPS-H from an ancestral universal geometry in these two different pictures The complexes GPS-H are part of a universal functional quantum geometry that generates a precursor order of life platforms They are the replaceable mobile pieces of a geological- biological puzzle that is assembled in time collectively and spatially to give rise to the multicellular platform that generates life on our planet, which shows an existing evident connection between these geometric complexes that jumps systems and dimensions to transfer and encode information between them. Bioengineering and manipulation of these ancestral GPS-H complexes can be used in alternative therapies in cancer , regenerative and rejuvenation medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95bad50419f848d19aedf3d2086f805cdd20d790db8fdf4630a24e6a50601e6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
