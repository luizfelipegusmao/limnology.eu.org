{"title":"Action Recognition in Videos Through a Transfer Learning Based Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1670/v1","date":1719302761000,"content":"In computer vision, human action recognition is a hot topic, popularized by the development of deep learning. Current models have achieved high accuracy results on public datasets. Despite this success, they require significant computational resources for training. Given that transfer learning based techniques allow reusing what other models have already learned and training models with less computational resources, in this work we propose using a transfer learning based approach for action recognition in videos. We describe a methodology for human action recognition using transfer learning techniques in a custom dataset. The proposed method consists of four stages: 1) human detection and tracking, 2) video preprocessing, 3) feature extraction (using pretrained models with ImageNet), and 4) action recognition using a two-stream model consisting of TCNs, LSTMs, and CNNs layers. The custom dataset is imbalanced with 189, 390, 490, 854, and 890 videos per class, respectively. For feature extraction, we analyzed the performance of seven pretrained models: Inception-v3, MobileNet-v2, MobileNet-v3-L, VGG-16, VGG-19, Xception, and ConvNeXt-L. We show that the best results were obtained with the last one. Finally, using pretrained models for feature extraction allowed training in a PC with a single GPU with an accuracy of 94.9%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"759b90caf14c30e6d86d55a9c0cf9d147c33f1ee15736915b61a5ec618f2aa06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
