My research in marine systems couples field studies of the physical habitats, life history strategies, and ecological interactions of organisms with laboratory analyses of their biomechanics. Here, I review how we pursued answers to three questions about marine organisms: (<span>a</span>) how benthic organisms withstand and utilize the water moving around them, (<span>b</span>) how the interaction between swimming and turbulent ambient water flow affects where small organisms go, and (<span>c</span>) how hairy appendages catch food and odors. I also discuss the importance of different types of mentors, the roadblocks for women in science when I started my career, the challenges and delights of interdisciplinary research, and my quest to understand how I see the world as a dyslexic.</p></div>","author":"M.A.R.
