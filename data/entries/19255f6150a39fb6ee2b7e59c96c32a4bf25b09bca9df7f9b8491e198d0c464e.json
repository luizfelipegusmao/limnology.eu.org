{"title":"Rationale and Protocol of ETERNITY-ITA Study: Use of Etelcalcetide for Preserving Vitamin K-Dependent Protein Activity Italian Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0995/v1","date":1723612465000,"content":"Background and objectives:Â Chronic Kidney Disease and Mineral Bone Disorders (CKD-MBD) are frequently associated with an increased risk of both Vascular Calcifications (VCs) and bone fractures (BFs). The complex pathogenesis of VCs and BFs involves various factors such as calcium overload, phosphate imbalance, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Key players, such as the vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteocalcin (BGP), have pivotal roles both for VCs and BFs. The Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) dialysis study, highlighted that hemodialysis patients treated with calcimimetics had higher levels of total BGP and MGP as compared to those untreated, suggesting a potential protective effect of these drugs on BFs and VCs, beyond the beneficial effect to reduce PTH levels. Methods: ETERNITY-ITA is a multi-center, comparative effectiveness, observational, longitudinal study that will enroll 160 hemodialysis patients (80 patients treated with Etelcalcetide and 80 age and sex-matched patients treated with Calcitriol or vitamin D analogs). Nephrologists will tailor the target dose of Etelcalcetide on individual level to achieve the KDIGO PTH target. In the Etelcalcetide-treated group, the addition of calcitriol will be allowed when required by clinical practice (for correction of hypocalcemia). Conclusion: The study will evaluate the real-world effect of Etelcalcetide on VKDP levels, such as BGP and MGP, at 3, 9, and 18 months from baseline. The resulting preservation of vascular and bone health will be assessed for the first time by examining aortic and iliac artery calcifications and vertebral fractures, respectively.
