{"title":"Population Size in Evolutionary Biology Is More Than the Effective Size","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70029?af=R","date":1729658340000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>In population genetics idealized Wright-Fisher (WF) populations are generally considered equivalent to real populations with regard to the major evolutionary processes that influence genotype and allele frequencies. As a result we often model the response of populations by focusing on the effective size <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>e</i>\n</sub>. The Diversity Partitioning Theorem (DPT) shows that you cannot model the behavior of a system solely on the basis of a diversity (accounting for unevenness among items) without taking richness into account. I show that the census population size (the number of adults, <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>c</i>\n</sub>) is equivalent to a richness, and that the effective size <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>e</i>\n</sub> is equivalent to a true diversity. It follows logically from the DPT that we require both <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>e</i>\n</sub> and <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>c</i>\n</sub> to understand how drift, selection, mutation, and gene flow interact to shape the course of evolution of populations. Here I review evidence that both <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>c</i>\n</sub> and <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>e</i>\n</sub> affect evolutionary trajectories of populations for neutral and adaptive processes. This also influences how we should consider evolutionary potential and genetic criteria for conservation of populations. The effective size of a population is of huge importance in evolutionary biology, but it should not be the sole focus when population size is concerned. Applied evolutionary studies need to integrate <i>N</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>c</i>\n</sub> in the equation more consistently when modeling the response to selection, mutation, migration, and drift.</p>","author":"Joachim Mergeay","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"6ba70a9360dacb3efbc309e94d655b26fe232a6a68b19ef6838a753796604c4d","category":"Environment"}
