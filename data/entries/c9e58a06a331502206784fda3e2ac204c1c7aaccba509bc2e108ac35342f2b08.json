{"title":"Metal Analysis of Leachate from the Organic Fraction of Urban Solid Waste (MSW) from the Municipality of Belém/PA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0847/v1","date":1723499471000,"content":"In this study, the analysis of metals in the solubilized extract of the organic fraction of Urban Solid Waste (MSW) from the municipality of Belém do Pará was carried out. The waste used in this research was collected in residential areas, through door-to-door collection, with the points and neighbor-hoods served in the municipality of Belém determined by the sectorization of these locations, with family income as the main parameter. The MSW was collected and transported to the segregation area. Gravimetric analysis of MSW was carried out and the selected organic and paper fractions were subjected to drying, crushing and sieving pre-treatment. Next, the solubilized extract of the organic fraction of MSW was obtained, following the method set out in NBR nº 10.006/2004 of the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards. The values obtained were compared with CONAMA Resolutions nº 357/2005, 396/2008 and 430/2011, in addition to being compared with results of bibliographical research. The results indicated that these wastes do not comply with environmental and health regulations. Although a highly significant association was found between chromium and boron through Pearson's correlation, the remaining strong correlations between other elements did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, a similarity was observed in the solubilization conditions of these wastes with those found in landfill leachate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9e58a06a331502206784fda3e2ac204c1c7aaccba509bc2e108ac35342f2b08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
