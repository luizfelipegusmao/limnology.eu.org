{"title":"Association of Hyperechoic Fetal Bowel with COVID-19 Infection in Pregnancy: A Prospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1873/v1","date":1721904710000,"content":"The goal of the study is to assess the potential correlation between maternal Sars-cov-2 infection , detected three months before the second trimester anomaly scan, and fetal iperecogenicity in order to determine whether or not this could be considered a predictive factor for maternal-fetal complications . The study included 48 pregnant women who did not have any clear maternal or fetal problems. These individuals had an anomaly scan in the second trimester, as well as amniocentesis and fetal cariotyping, and then RT-PCR testing on their placental tissue after birth to rule out transplacental transmission. There have been no reports of fetal abnormalities via amniocentesis or fetal cariotyping. The patients experienced a high rate of spontaneous births (83%). Fetal development problems (2%) and premature delivery (4%) were uncommon, although placental swabs revealed a possibility of viral transmission across the placenta itself. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observational study to show that detecting isolated intestinal hyperechogenicity during an abnormality scan in fetuses of women infected with Sars-Cov-2 in the previous three months does not appear to be a predictor of poor maternal-fetal outcomes, but may be linked to transplacental virus transmission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51f6838292cec3166d3325f4eda5686633d2f3ac4ce2aed9c9584fbea1ff6112","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
