{"title":"Model Strengthening of Combined Wood and Concrete Pillar Foundations on Swamp Soil to Improve Stability and Durability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1604/v1","date":1724307942000,"content":"Swamp soil presents significant challenges for infrastructure development due to its soft and deformable nature, which compromises the stability of structures. Traditional wood pillars, while cost-effective and locally available, suffer from degradation caused by moisture and biological organisms. This study investigates various methods to strengthen wood pillars, focusing on the combination of wood and concrete pillars to enhance durability and load-bearing capacity in swamp soil environments. Laboratory experiments and field tests demonstrate that encasing wood pillars in concrete or using composite materials significantly improves their mechanical strength and resistance to deformation. The results highlight the potential of these techniques to provide sustainable and economical solutions for construction in swamp areas, ensuring greater stability and longevity of the infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92ce94868e04db6c168e2104c5de9af38cf476cf494a2e268c10c1c95437a9aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
