As a result, many tools have been developed and improved to reduce this decline. However, there is still a need for the identification and evaluation of precise restoration measures to improve habitats and preserve sentinel freshwater species, such as brown trout. This paper provides an up-to-date viewpoint about the life history, habitat characteristics, suitability conditions, and metapopulation dynamic modelling of brown trout, aiming to identify and discuss gaps and propose possible improvements based on collating and reinterpreting literature data. Results suggest that habitat suitability curves for environmental and hydraulic variables possess some degree of universality, for spawning habitat, fry, juvenile and adult trout. Further, an improved method to estimate the amount of suitable area by including the role of stream obstacles (i.e., macro-roughness with characteristic size in the order of the mean water depth) is proposed and discussed. This approach can be integrated into advanced metapopulation models and will allow experts to evaluate the best measures towards restoring and preserving freshwater riverine environments.</p>","author":"Francesca Padoan, \nGiulio Calvani, \nGiovanni De Cesare, \nJakob Brodersen, \nChristopher T.
