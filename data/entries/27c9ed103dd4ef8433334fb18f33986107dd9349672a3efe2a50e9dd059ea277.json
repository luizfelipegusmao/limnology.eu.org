However, the formation of atomic- to micro-scale irradiation damage like vacancies, solute clusters, dislocations are still unavoidable. These can cause solute redistribution and volume expansion, undermining mechanical properties and causing serious safety issues. Therefore, understanding how the metallic matrix reacts to neutron irradiation and how to improve the structural stability is vital for continued development of nuclear energy. Atom probe tomography (APT) is very suitable to characterise these defects at near atomic-scale spatial resolution with ppm-level chemical sensitivity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"27c9ed103dd4ef8433334fb18f33986107dd9349672a3efe2a50e9dd059ea277","category":"Environment"}
