{"title":"Sensory characterization of the perceived quality of East African highland cooking bananas (matooke)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.12606?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>It has recently become increasingly evident that banana projects in Uganda need to consider consumer preferences as part of the breeding process to increase the acceptability of new cultivars. A trained panel used quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) as a tool to assess the sensory characteristics of 32 cooking bananas (<i>matooke</i>). The aim was to investigate which sensory characteristics best describe matooke.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Fourteen descriptors were generated. The preferred attributes of <i>matooke</i> were high-intensity yellow color, homogeneous distribution of yellow color, good <i>matooke</i> aroma, highly moldable by touch, moist and smooth in the mouth. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in the yellowness, homogeneity of color, firmness, moistness, smoothness, <i>matooke</i> aroma, hardness, and moldability across the genotypes (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed strong positive correlations between yellowness and homogeneity of the color (<i>R</i> = 0.92). Smoothness in the mouth and moldability by touch were strongly and positively correlated (<i>R</i> = 0.88). Firmness in the mouth was well predicted by hardness to touch (<i>R</i>\n<sup>\n   <i>2</i>\n</sup> = 0.85). The <i>matooke</i> samples were ranked into two sensory clusters by agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study showed attribute terms that could be used to describe <i>matooke</i> and also revealed that QDA may be used as a tool during the assessment and selection of new cooking banana hybrids to identify relevant sensory attributes because of its ability to discriminate among the banana hybrids. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Elizabeth Khakasa, \nCharles Muyanja, \nRobert Mugabi, \nChristophe Bugaud, \nNelly Forestier‐Chiron, \nBrigitte Uwimana, \nIvan Kabiita Arinaitwe, \nKephas Nowakunda","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"abae99c6f15f4e0772f71c7d9cbd17a81a397dcfa14d38f0cfd4c8898ea61269","category":"Environment"}
