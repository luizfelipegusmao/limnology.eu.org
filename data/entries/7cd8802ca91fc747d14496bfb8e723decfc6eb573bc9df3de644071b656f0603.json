{"title":"Molecular Detection and Antibiotic Resistance of Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus from Shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and Shrimp Environments in Bangladesh","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/5436552?af=R","date":1676707200000,"content":"<p>Some <i>Vibrio</i> species can cause food-borne diseases in humans, including cholera, vomiting, septicemia, and gastroenteritis, which are associated with the consumption of contaminated seafood products. The study was conducted to detect antimicrobial-resistant <i>Vibrio</i> species in shrimp and shrimp environments in Bangladesh. Samples of shrimp (<i>n</i> = 50), water (<i>n</i> = 50), and mud (<i>n</i> = 50) were collected aseptically from 50 different shrimp culture ponds in the Khulna region of Bangladesh. Identification of <i>Vibrio</i> species was based on cultural and staining characteristics, biochemical tests, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined using a disk diffusion assay. By PCR, <i>Vibrio</i> isolates were found in 34% (95% CI: 26.9%–41.9%) of the samples, of which the detection rate was significantly higher in shrimp (54%), compared to mud (26%) and water (22%). Moreover, <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i>, <i>V</i>. <i>parahaemolyticus</i>, and <i>V</i>. <i>alginolyticus</i> were detected in 24.7%, 15.3%, and 4% of the samples, respectively. Among them, the detection rate of <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> and <i>V</i>. <i>alginolyticus</i> was significantly higher in shrimp samples than in other samples. <i>V</i>. <i>parahaemolyticus</i> was also higher in the shrimp samples, but the difference was not statistically significant. <i>Vibrio</i> isolates showed high to moderate resistance (92.2%–15.7%) to ampicillin, amikacin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, ceftazidime, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, and low resistance (3.9%) to imipenem, meropenem, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Interestingly, 52.9% of the isolates were multidrug resistant, and the multiple antibiotic resistance index was up to 1.0. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Bangladesh detecting these three <i>Vibrio</i> species (<i>V</i>. <i>parahaemolyticus</i>, <i>V</i>. <i>alginolyticus</i>, and <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i>) from shrimp and shrimp environments by molecular approach in the same study. These findings reveal the alarmingly high occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant <i>Vibrio</i> species in shrimp and shrimp environments, which should be of concern to both the shrimp industry and public health management.</p>","author":"Zobayda Farzana Haque, \nMd.
