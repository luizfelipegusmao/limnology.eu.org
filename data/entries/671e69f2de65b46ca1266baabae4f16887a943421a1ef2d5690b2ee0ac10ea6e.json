{"title":"The genome assembly of Carex breviculmis provides evidence for its phylogenetic localization and environmental adaptation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/134/3/467/7686403?rss=1","date":1717200000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background and Aims</div><span>Carex breviculmis</span> is a perennial herb with good resistance and is widely used for forage production and turf management. It is important in ecology, environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, but faces several challenges due to human activities. However, the absence of genome sequences has limited basic research and the improvement of wild plants.<div>Methods</div>We annotated the genome of <span>C. breviculmis</span> and conducted a systematic analysis to explore its resistance to harsh environments. We also conducted a comparative analysis of <span>Achnatherum splendens</span>, which is similarly tolerant to harsh environments.<div>Key Results</div>The assembled the genome comprises 469.01 Mb, revealing 37â€…372 genes with a BUSCO completeness score of 99.0 %. The genome has 52.03 % repetitive sequences, primarily influenced by recent LTR insertions that have contributed to its expansion. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that <span>C. breviculmis</span> diverged from <span>C. littledalei</span> ~6.61 million years ago. Investigation of repetitive sequences and expanded gene families highlighted a rapid expansion of tandem duplicate genes, particularly in areas related to sugar metabolism, synthesis of various amino acids, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Additionally, our analysis identified crucial genes involved in secondary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism, which have undergone positive selection. We reconstructed the sucrose metabolic pathway and identified significant gene expansions, including 16 invertase, 9 sucrose phosphate synthase and 12 sucrose synthase genes associated with sucrose metabolism, which showed varying levels of expansion.<div>Conclusions</div>The expansion of these genes, coupled with subsequent positive selection, contributed to the ability of <span>C. breviculmis</span> to adapt to environmental stressors. This study lays the foundation for future research on the evolution of <span>Carex</span> plants, their environmental adaptations, and potential genetic breeding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"671e69f2de65b46ca1266baabae4f16887a943421a1ef2d5690b2ee0ac10ea6e","category":"Environment"}
