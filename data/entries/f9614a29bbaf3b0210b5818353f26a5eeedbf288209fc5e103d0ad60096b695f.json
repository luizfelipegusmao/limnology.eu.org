{"title":"Machine Learning-Based Structural Health Monitoring Technique for Crack Detection and Localisation Using Bluetooth Strain Gauge Sensor Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1639/v1","date":1726892014000,"content":"Conventional approaches in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) tend to be complex, destructive, and time-intensive. Additionally, they often require a large number of sensors to thoroughly assess structural integrity. In this study, we present a novel, non-destructive SHM framework based on machine learning (ML) for the accurate detection and localization of structural cracks. This approach leverages a minimal number of strain gauge sensors linked via Bluetooth communication. The framework is validated through empirical data collected from 3D carbon fiber-reinforced composites, including three distinct specimens, ranging from crack-free samples to specimens with up to ten cracks of varying lengths and depths. Strain data from five sensors were analyzed using a combination of Shewhart charts, Grubbs Test (GT), and a hierarchical clustering algorithm, specifically designed to evaluate and classify fractures. Our ML-based framework offers a streamlined and efficient alternative to traditional laboratory procedures, delivering precise crack detection with significant potential for applications in the composites industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9614a29bbaf3b0210b5818353f26a5eeedbf288209fc5e103d0ad60096b695f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
