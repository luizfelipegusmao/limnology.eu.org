{"title":"ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 promotes de novo root organogenesis after wounding in Arabidopsis leaf explants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2359/7623046?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants have an astonishing ability to regenerate new organs after wounding. Here, we report that the wound-inducible transcription factor ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1) has a dual mode of action in activating <span>ANTHRANILATE SYNTHASE ALPHA SUBUNIT1</span> (<span>ASA1</span>) expression to ensure auxin-dependent de novo root organogenesis locally at wound sites of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) leaf explants. In the first mode, ESR1 interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE6 (HDA6), and the ESR1â€“HDA6 complex directly binds to the <span>JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN5</span> (<span>JAZ5</span>) locus, inhibiting <span>JAZ5</span> expression through histone H3 deacetylation. As JAZ5 interferes with the action of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR109 (ERF109), the transcriptional repression of <span>JAZ5</span> at the wound site allows ERF109 to activate <span>ASA1</span> expression. In the second mode, the ESR1 transcriptional activator directly binds to the <span>ASA1</span> promoter to enhance its expression. Overall, our findings indicate that the dual biochemical function of ESR1, which specifically occurs near wound sites of leaf explants, maximizes local auxin biosynthesis and de novo root organogenesis in Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"892f15f939b77eaf1a7f45aca945c2890119828ffc1e7586b9420d5f48f64f7a","category":"Environment"}
