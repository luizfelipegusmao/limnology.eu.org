{"title":"Wetland vegetation composition and ecology of Lake Abaya in southern Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301795","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Dikaso Unbushe Gojamme</p>\r\n\r\nWetland vegetation and ecology of Lake Abaya in the southern Ethiopia was studied to determine floristic composition, plant community type and vegetation ecology. A total of 102 plots were laid along transects that were set up preferentially across areas where there were rapid changes in vegetation or marked environmental gradients to collect data on estimate of percentage aerial cover of plant species and environmental variables. Vegetation data was analyzed by agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis using similarity ratio as a resemblance index and Wardâ€™s linkage method. Multivariate data analysis was performed using appropriate packages in R version 2.14.0. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to explore the relationship between the species composition and environmental variables. The environmental data included in the CCA were determined using stepwise backward and forward selection of variables by ANOVA test. Statistical measurement regarding species diversity, richness and evenness of the plant community types was carried out by using Shannon-Wiener diversity indices. A total of 92 plant species belonging to 66 genera and 34 families were identified. Families Poaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Cyperaceae, Solanaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Amaranthaceae account for about 56.99% of the total proportion. Based on the cluster analysis, five plant community types were identified. The most important factors influencing the plant species composition and pattern of wetland plant communities were water drainage, water depth, land use, slope, altitude, and hydrogeomorphology. Therefore, these factors should be considered in future management and protection under the circumstance of climate change and human activities.","author":"Dikaso Unbushe Gojamme","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9d1b1e66d48f43e907926a0b7207433a817a87d9f447fb9e9bd6bbb83b5c9140","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
