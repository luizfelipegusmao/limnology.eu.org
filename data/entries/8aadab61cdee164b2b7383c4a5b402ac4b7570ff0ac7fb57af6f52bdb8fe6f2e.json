{"title":"The Association between Dietary Vitamin C and Sleep Disorders: A Cohort Study Based on UK Biobank","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0894/v1","date":1726060848000,"content":"There are few longitudinal studies on the association between dietary vitamin C and sleep disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary vitamin C intake and various types of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and insomnia, as well as recommended dietary intakes. A total of 68,221 participants from the UK Biobank were enrolled in the study. Dietary vitamin C intake was calculated by a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. We used Cox regression model to assess the association between dietary vitamin C and sleep disorders and restricted cubic spline models to explore potential nonlinear relationships. Stratified analyses and sensitivity analyses were also performed to further test the results. The results showed that vitamin C intake at the Q4 level (132.88-191.51 mg/d) was significantly protective against sleep disorders with an HR (95% CI) of 0.78 (0.65-0.94), and against sleep apnea with an HR (95% CI) of 0.75 (0.62-0.92). The protective effect remained significant in stratified analyses of men and age â‰¤60 years, and the results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Adequate dietary vitamin C intake may have a protective effect in preventing sleep disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8aadab61cdee164b2b7383c4a5b402ac4b7570ff0ac7fb57af6f52bdb8fe6f2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
