Do separate populations of a species living in different cities show similar adaptations to the selection pressures imposed by urban environments? Diamant and Yeh (2024) address this question by comparing the morphological characteristics of dark-eyed juncos in 3 California cities to non-urban junco morphologies. They find that wing size is consistently smaller in more urbanized environments regardless of the population, but bill size tends to vary between urban populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"5e6d5be525b996e685d19a9ce09823be896ef5f1326d78349528ea3733bc209f","category":"Environment"}
