{"title":"Retrospective Correlation of the Circulation Time of Test Bolus Injections in MR Angiography and Cardiac Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1609/v1","date":1711459406000,"content":"This retrospective study examines 248 test-bolus examinations preceding contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) to extract clinically relevant data for critical limb ischemia (CLI) management. Methods involved a retrospective review of test-bolus exams, analysing 60 graphs for time-to-peak (TTP), full-width half-maximum (FWHM) time, and time to continual rise in signal intensity. These values were correlated with heart function parameters (ejection fraction, ASA-Classification, Lee-Index, and MET-Score). Results indicate a mean TTP of 31.2 Â± 7.3s, showing a correlation between ejection fraction and ASA classification. Patients with atrial fibrillation exhibited prolonged TTP compared to those without. Despite population heterogeneity, findings facilitate risk stratification for limb-saving interventions in CLI. TTP emerges as a potential clinical cardiovascular parameter and a risk factor for vascular interventions. Given the variation in injection protocols across centres, this study underscores the importance of precise bolus arrival time documentation for future multicentre studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aec84970ecdca11a42e98eb38e3699c31e74904fd210c63d7e78384bf27e6c2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
