Structural evolution of the oxides acts as a fundamental process in their device operation. In this presentation, we will focus on the structural manipulation of functional metal oxides inside transmission electron microscope (TEM), where the real-time imaging of electrically and/or mechanically driven structural evolution at atomic scale was carried out by homemade in-situ TEM probe setup. In addition, the structural manipulation and in-situ observation were also realized by surface/interface confined nucleation and growth inside TEM.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4bcb4ef307b65e51ad73a7a3134b61ea6273fffa09b355118cfc82207b22e0b7","category":"Environment"}
