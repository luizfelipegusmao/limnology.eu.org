In Ischia, Italy, two species of Mediterranean scleractinian corals–the symbiotic <i>Cladocora caespitosa</i> and the asymbiotic <i>Astroides calycularis</i>–were collected from ambient pH sites (average pH<sub>T</sub> = 8.05) and adjacent CO<sub>2</sub> vent sites (average pH<sub>T</sub> = 7.8) to evaluate their response to ocean acidification. Coral colonies from both sites were reared in a laboratory setting for six months at present day pH (pH<sub>T</sub> ~ 8.08) or low pH (pH<sub>T</sub> ~7.72). Previous work showed that these corals were tolerant of low pH and maintained positive calcification rates throughout the experiment. We hypothesized that these corals cope with low pH by increasing their heterotrophic capacity (i.e., feeding and/or proportion of heterotrophically derived compounds incorporated in their tissues), irrespective of site of origin, which was quantified indirectly by measuring δ<sup>13</sup>C, δ<sup>15</sup>N, and sterols. To further characterize coral health, we quantified energy reserves by measuring biomass, total lipids, and lipid classes. Additional analysis for <i>C</i>. <i>caespitosa</i> included carbohydrates (an energy reserve) and chlorophyll <i>a</i> (an indicator of photosynthetic capacity). Isotopic evidence shows that ambient-sourced Mediterranean corals, of both species, decreased heterotrophy in response to six months of low pH. Despite maintaining energy reserves, lower net photosynthesis (<i>C</i>. <i>caespitosa)</i> and a trend of declining calcification (<i>A</i>. <i>calycularis</i>) suggest a long-term cost to low heterotrophy under ocean acidification conditions. Conversely, vent-sourced corals maintained moderate (<i>C</i>. <i>caespitosa</i>) or high (<i>A</i>. <i>calycularis</i>) heterotrophic capacity and increased photosynthesis rates (<i>C</i>. <i>caespitosa</i>) in response to six months at low pH, allowing them to sustain themselves physiologically. Provided there is sufficient zooplankton and/or organic matter to meet their heterotrophic needs, vent-sourced corals are more likely to persist this century and potentially be a source for new corals in the Mediterranean.","author":"Ann Marie Hulver","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a3b10f08796fd2b8e2a24c122ea836dc518d19321d904a92fee0b8341190ba3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
