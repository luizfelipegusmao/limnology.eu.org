{"title":"Establishment of a System Dynamics Model for Sustainable Development of Ecotourism in Oceanic Island National Parks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1166/v1","date":1728974539000,"content":"The establishment of protected areas and the practice of ecotourism are generally considered to be one of the crucial means for achieving sustainable development. This study focused on the development of ecotourism in oceanic island national parks, applying System Dynamics theory to explore the core mechanisms, system behaviors, and promotion strategies of sustainable development. We adopted the driving force–state–response (DSR) indicator framework and combined it with System Dynamics theory to construct a sustainable development model for ecotourism in oceanic island national parks. Through this model, we discovered that the intricate causal relationships between indicator factors form three dominant causal feedback loops that drive system behavior. The three causal feedback loops comprise one reinforcing loop and two balancing loops. Through the interaction and mutual regulation between these three loops, preliminary estimates can be made regarding the specific behavioral trends that promote ecotourism in oceanic island national parks. In addition, we further investigated whether the implementation of fee-based policies in oceanic island national parks contributes to these parks’ sustainability goals. Subsequently, this model could be developed into a numerical simulation program based on System Dynamics theory, thereby enabling the computer simulation of system behavior under various scenarios and conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23b27a9e1fdb87682bc1ca19c2bd7a24a3d9a11957844b90262a33c167ff89b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
