As being able to accurately quantify the MSG dietary intake would help clarify the open issues, we constructed a predictive formula to estimate the daily intake of MSG in a rat model based on the urinary metabolic profile. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into groups receiving different daily amounts of MSG in drinking water (0.5, 1.5, and 3.0 g%), no MSG, and MSG withdrawal after 3.0% MSG treatment for 4 weeks. We then analyzed 24-hour urine samples for chemistries and metabolites using <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrometry and observed a strong correlation between urine pH, sodium, bicarbonate, alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate, fumarate, glutamate, methylamine, N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, succinate, and taurine and the daily MSG intake. Following the multiple linear regression analysis a simple formula model based on urinary Na<sup>+</sup>, citrate, and glutamate was most accurate and could be validated for estimating daily MSG intake. In conclusion, we propose that the daily MSG intake correlates with urinary metabolites in a rat model and that this new tool for monitoring the impact of MSG on health measures.","author":"Manatsaphon Sukmak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a6ef45a1e4ec2210a87442d115bddfd3bb2aa15ae2f643978868e50d11d84cd0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
