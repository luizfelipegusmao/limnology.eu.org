{"title":"Colony identity clues for Syntermes grandis (Blattodea: Termitidae) individuals using near-infrared spectroscopy and PLS-DA approach","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/561/7664590?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Termites are social insects with high species diversity in tropical ecosystems. Multivariate analysis with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and data interpretation can separate social insects belonging to different colonies of the same species. The objective of this study was to propose the use of discriminant analysis by partial least squares (PLS-DA) combined with NIRS to identify the colonial origin of the <span>Syntermes grandis</span> (Rambur, 1842) (Blattodea: Termitidae) in 2 castes. Six ground <span>S. grandis</span> colonies were identified and mapped; 30 workers and 30 soldier termites in each colony were submitted to spectral measurement with NIRS. PLS-DA applied to the termitesâ€™ spectral absorbance was used to detect a spectral pattern per <span>S. grandis</span> colony by caste. PLS-DA regression with NIRS proved to be an approach with 99.9% accuracy for identifying the colonial origin of <span>S. grandis</span> workers and 98.3% for soldiers. The methodology showed the importance of qualitatively characterizing the colonial phenotypic response of this species. NIRS is a high-precision approach to identifying the colony origin of <span>S. grandis</span> workers and soldiers. The PLS-DA can be used to design ecological field studies to identify colony territorial competition and foraging behavior of subterranean termite species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"617680399156b08f4cda812d3da376917979b1e2324cc51c8986eba121710f2a","category":"Environment"}
