{"title":"Deciphering the underlying core microorganisms and the marker compounds of Liupao tea during the pile‐fermentation process","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13177?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Pile fermentation is one of the key steps in developing the Liupao tea (LBT) quality and unique characteristics. The complex biochemical profile of LBT results from microorganisms present during the pile-fermentation process. However, the critical underlying microorganisms and the marker compounds still need to be determined.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p><i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Brevibacterium</i>, <i>Kocuria</i>, <i>Aspergillus</i>, and <i>Blastobotrys</i> were the common dominant microorganisms at the end of the pile fermentation of LBT. <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Aspergillus</i>, <i>Blastobotrys</i>, and nine other genera carried by raw tea are the core microorganisms in the LBT during pile fermentation. A total of 29 critical compounds contributed to the metabolic changes caused by the processing of LBT. Of these, gallic acid, adenine, hypoxanthine, uridine, betaine, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and <i>α</i>-linolenic acid could be characterized as potential marker compounds. Correlation analysis showed that the core microorganisms, including <i>Sphingomonas</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Kocuria</i>, <i>Aureobasidium</i>, <i>Blastobotrys</i>, <i>Debaryomyce</i>, and <i>Trichomonascus</i>, were closely related to major chemical components and differential compounds. Moreover, the mutually promoting <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Kocuria</i>, <i>Blastobotrys</i>, and <i>Trichomonascus</i> were correlated with the enrichment of marker compounds. Integrated molecular networking and metabolic pathways revealed relevant compounds and enzymes that possibly affect the enrichment of marker compounds.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study analyzed the LBT fermentation samples by omics analysis to reveal the stable microbial community structure, critical microorganisms, and markers compounds affecting the quality of LBT, which contributes to a better understanding of pile fermentation of LBT and the fermentation theory of dark tea. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jincen Pan, \nJie Wang, \nJianwen Teng, \nLi Huang, \nBaoyao Wei, \nNing Xia, \nPingchuan Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5cc1e9580ad56b7e129f0b3b6d1af5192d98fd6a9b53ef8fc89c2aa58bd4cf36","category":"Environment"}
