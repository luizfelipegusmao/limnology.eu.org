Measuring the motion of braided rivers, which have multiple channel threads, is particularly challenging, limiting predictions for landscape evolution and fluvial architecture. To address this challenge, we extended the capabilities of image-based particle image velocimetry (PIV)—a technique for tracking channel threads in images of the surface—by adapting it to analyze topographic change. We applied this method in a laboratory experiment where a straight channel set in non-cohesive sediment evolved into a braided channel under constant water and sediment fluxes. Topography-based PIV successfully tracked the motion of channel threads if displacements between observations were less than the channel-thread width, consistent with earlier results from image-based PIV. We filtered spurious migration vectors with magnitudes less than the elevation grid spacing, or with high uncertainties in magnitude and/or direction. During braided channel initiation, migration rates varied with the channel planform development, showing an increase as incipient meanders developed, a decrease during the transitional braiding phase, and consistently low values during the established braiding phase. In this experimental setup, migration rates varied quasi-periodically along stream at the half scale of initial meander bends. Lateral migration with respect to the mean flow direction was much more pronounced than streamwise migration, accounting for approximately 80% of all detected motion. Results demonstrate that topography-based PIV has the potential to advance predictions for bank erosion and landscape evolution in natural braided rivers as well as bar preservation and stratigraphic architecture in geological records.</p>","author":"Youwei Wang, \nAjay B.
