The sixth beta comes three weeks after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-5/\">released the fifth macOS Monterey beta</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/macOS-Monterey-on-MBP-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRegistered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices, plus there's a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> to Mac feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari has been redesigned with a new tab bar (with a toggle <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">for two different designs</a> as of the third beta) and support for Tab Groups, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> has gained spatial audio, a Portrait Mode on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs, and Voice Isolation for cutting out background noise. There's also a new SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature that lets Apple users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, a separate feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and collaboration is easier with mentions and an Activity View.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Shortcuts app from iOS is now available on the Mac, and Focus helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions. There's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features, and with Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected.
