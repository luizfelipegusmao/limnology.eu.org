{"title":"Dirac’s Large Number Hypothesis: An Ongoing Quest for Correlations Between the Infinitesimal and the Infinite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1773/v1","date":1724682569000,"content":"Dirac's Large Number Hypothesis (LNH), proposed in 1937, has captivated the scientific community with its exploration of profound correlations between cosmic and atomic scales. This hypothesis delves into the intricate interplay between the infinitesimally small and the vastly large, offering potential insights into the fundamental nature of the universe. As we continue to uncover the mysteries of the cosmos, the LNH oscillates on the precipice of scientific acceptance—neither fully validated nor entirely dismissed. In this review paper, we embark on a comprehensive journey through Dirac's LNH, shedding light on its theoretical underpinnings, its implications for universe models, and its resonance with the Anthropic Principle. We delve into the possibilities of variable gravitational constants and continuous mass creation, inviting further exploration into the intricacies of our cosmic symphony. By embracing the ongoing quest for understanding, we endeavor to unravel the profound harmonies that connect the infinitesimal with the infinite, contributing to the symphony of knowledge in theoretical physics and cosmology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e16c6da272364260af0806c3bbd99fcc0c3ef4259f2487a59e8a7ddedacc00e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
