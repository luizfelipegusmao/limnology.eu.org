{"title":"Evidence for a single population expansion event across 24,000 km: the case of the deep-sea scavenging amphipod Abyssorchomene distinctus","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05447-5","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Anthropogenic activities such as mining pose a putative threat to deep-sea ecosystems and baseline studies of key indicator species are required to assess future loss of biodiversity. We examined population genetic structure, connectivity, cryptic diversity and phylogeography of the deep-sea scavenging amphipod, <em>Abyssorchomene distinctus</em>, using DNA sequence data (mitochondrial COI and nuclear 28S genes) from 373 specimens collected from six abyssal basins. We observed a striking absence of cryptic diversity, suggesting a single, widely distributed species in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. A single event of population expansion across distances up to 24,000 km is further supported by a main ancestral haplotype in the star-like shaped COI haplotype network, a skewed nucleotide mismatch distribution and deviations from evolutionary neutrality tests. In the Pacific, <em>A. distinctus</em> showed weak genetic population structure and low differentiation between the basins of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone and the DISCOL Experimental Area, suggesting a possible higher chance of recovery from deep-sea mining impacts. However, since our data indicate a single recent historic population expansion event, <em>A. distinctus</em> populations will likely be affected to unknown extents, as the exact drivers shaping distribution and dispersion of <em>A. distinctus</em> are still unclear.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"be97b8d4d8758a16dfb297a65e14a77d60e3697e9b07f9b39e74866af8f6f22f","category":"Environment"}
