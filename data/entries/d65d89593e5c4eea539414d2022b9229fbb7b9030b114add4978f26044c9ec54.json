{"title":"Tuberculosis treatment outcomes and associated factors at Alemgena Health Center, Sebeta, Oromia, Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303797","date":1716300000000,"content":"<p>by Kedija Hayre, Mihiretu Kumie Takele, Dagim Jirata Birri</p>\r\nBackground <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health problem. Evaluation of TB treatment outcome enables health institutions to measure and improve the effectiveness of TB control programs. This study aimed to assess treatment outcomes of tuberculosis and identify associated factors among TB patients registered at Alemgena Health Center, Oromia, Ethiopia.</p> Method <p>A retrospective study was conducted; Secondary data were collected from medical records of 1010 TB patients treated at Alemgena Health Center between September 2012 and August 2018, inclusively. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with TB treatment outcomes. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p> Results <p>The proportion of males and females was almost equal. Among the patients 64.7% were in the age group 15–34, 98% were new cases, 31.2% were smear positive, 13% were HIV positive and 40.3% had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. 94.2% of the patients had successful treatment outcome, with 26.9% cured and 67.3% treatment completed, whereas 5.8% had unsuccessful treatment outcomes, of whom 4.2% died and 1.5% defaulted. Death rate was higher among patients older than 44 years (10.4%) than among children (0%). In bivariate logistic regression analysis, treatment success rate was 3.582 (95% CI 1.958–6.554, p-value = .000) times higher in the age group 44 and below compared to the age group 45 and above.</p> Conclusion <p>Treatment success rate exceeded the one targeted by WHO. Age was found to be associated with treatment outcome. Success rate has to be improved for TB patients in the age group greater than 45 years of age.</p>","author":"Kedija Hayre","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d65d89593e5c4eea539414d2022b9229fbb7b9030b114add4978f26044c9ec54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
