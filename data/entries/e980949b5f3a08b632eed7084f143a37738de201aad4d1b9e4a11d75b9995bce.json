{"title":"Seasonal Succession of Bacterial Communities in the Land‐Based Container with Recycling Water Aquaculture System","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/4537061?af=R","date":1698735600000,"content":"<p>The land-based container with recycling water aquaculture system (C-RAS) has gained popularity in China due to its water conservation and pollution reduction capabilities. However, there is a dearth of theoretical research on this subject. In this study, water from Koi-cultured container and three-stage eco-ponds was sampled over three seasons and then the bacterial communities were analyzed. The findings of this study indicate that the implementation of three-stage eco-ponds significantly enhances water quality. Specifically, during the summer season, eco-ponds exhibit the highest removal efficiencies of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in comparison to other seasons. During winter, the bacterial communities’ operational taxonomic units, diversity, and richness experience a substantial decline. The system was dominated by <i>Proteobacteria</i>, <i>Bacteroidota</i>, and <i>Actinobacteriota</i> phyla. The lower relative abundance of <i>Actinobacteriota</i> and <i>Cyanobacteria</i> elucidated the reason for the lower off-flavor compounds in container-cultured fish compared to pond-cultured fish. The bacterial community was significantly influenced by water temperature and pH, as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis. These findings establish a fundamental basis for the development of a healthy and sustainable C-RAS technology.</p>","author":"Na Gao, \nYize Wang, \nTing Fang, \nYangyang Liang, \nKai Cui, \nJinliang Chen, \nWenxuan Lu, \nZhitao Qi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"e980949b5f3a08b632eed7084f143a37738de201aad4d1b9e4a11d75b9995bce","category":"Environment"}
