{"title":"Semilicoisoflavone B induces oral cancer cell apoptosis by targeting claspin and ATR‐Chk1 signaling pathways","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24107?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The prevalence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is increasing worldwide mainly due to poor oral hygiene and unrestricted lifestyle. Advanced-stage OSCC is associated with poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of only 30%–50%. The present study was designed to investigate the anticancer effect and mode of action of <i>Glycyrrhiza</i>-derived semilicoisoflavone B (SFB) in 5-fluorourasil (5FU)-resistant human OSCC cell lines. The study findings revealed that SFB significantly reduces OSCC cell viability and colony formation ability by arresting cell cycle at the G2/M and S phases and reducing the expressions of key cell cycle regulators including cyclin A, cyclin B, CDC2, and CDK2. The compound caused a significant induction in the percentage of nuclear condensation and apoptotic cells in OSCC. Regarding pro-apoptotic mode of action, SFB was found to increase Fas-associated death domain and death receptor 5 expressions and reduce decoy receptor 2 expression, indicating involvement of extrinsic pathway. Moreover, SFB was found to increase pro-apoptotic Bim expression and reduce anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expressions, indicating involvement of intrinsic pathway. Moreover, SFB-mediated induction in cleaved caspases 3, 8, and 9 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase confirmed the induction of caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways. Regarding upstream signaling pathway, SFB was found to reduce extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) phosphorylation to execute its pro-apoptotic activity. The Human Apoptotic Array findings revealed that SFB suppresses claspin expression, which in turn caused reduced phosphorylation of ATR, checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), Wee1, and CDC25C, indicating disruption of ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway by SFB. Taken together, these findings indicate that SFB acts as a potent anticancer compound against 5FU-resistant OSCC by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ATR-Chk1 signaling pathways.</p>","author":"Ming‐Ju Hsieh, \nChia‐Chieh Lin, \nYu‐Sheng Lo, \nYi‐Ching Chuang, \nHsin‐Yu Ho, \nMu‐Kuan Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"834d5b96cdc7676d3c7e0d756083ead6885b1e1b5b6e57ab6bbbd073a0e13c9c","category":"Environment"}
