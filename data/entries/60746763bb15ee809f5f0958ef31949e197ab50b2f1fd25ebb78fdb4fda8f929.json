{"title":"From Electron Microscopy to Sustainable Energy – A fitting tribute Dr. Terrence E. Mitchell","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.516/7720109?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The 21st century brings with it staggering challenges for more advanced energy technologies that are abundant, clean, and sustainable. Transforming the ways we generate, supply, transmit, store, and use energy are the paramount opportunities for the world in the coming decades. To convert sunlight to fuel, store energy efficiently or enable a new generation of energy production and utilization technologies requires the development of new materials and processes with unprecedented functionality and performance. This talk will provide an overview of DOE’s Office of Science programs with an emphasis on the support of a new paradigm of innovations aimed at laying the foundation for major breakthroughs in science and technology. At the core of this new era of science is the ability to decipher the relationships between structure and function down to the atomic level – as reflected in Dr. Terry Mitchell’s life-long passion in and contributions to electron microscopy. Dr. Mitchell left indelible marks on the training and development of a generation of leading researchers while transforming the materials research at Los Alamos National Laboratory to advance the Department of Energy’s mission in science, energy, and national security.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"60746763bb15ee809f5f0958ef31949e197ab50b2f1fd25ebb78fdb4fda8f929","category":"Environment"}
