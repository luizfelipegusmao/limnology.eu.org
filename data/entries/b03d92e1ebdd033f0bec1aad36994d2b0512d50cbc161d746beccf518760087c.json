{"title":"Widespread regulation of the maternal transcriptome by Nanos in <i>Drosophila</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002840","date":1728914400000,"content":"<p>by Mohammad Marhabaie, Tammy H. Wharton, Sung Yun Kim, Robin P. Wharton</p>\r\n\r\nThe translational repressor Nanos (Nos) regulates a single target, maternal <i>hunchback</i> (<i>hb)</i> mRNA, to govern abdominal segmentation in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. Nos is recruited to sites in the 3′ UTR of <i>hb</i> mRNA in collaboration with the sequence-specific RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum); on its own, Nos has no binding specificity. Nos is expressed at other stages of development, but very few mRNA targets that might mediate its action at these stages have been described. Nor has it been clear whether Nos is targeted to other mRNAs in concert with Pum or via other mechanisms. In this report, we identify mRNAs targeted by Nos via 2 approaches. First, we identify mRNAs depleted upon expression of a chimera bearing Nos fused to the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) factor Upf1. We find that, in addition to <i>hb</i>, Upf1-Nos depletes approximately 2,600 mRNAs from the maternal transcriptome in early embryos. Virtually all of these appear to be targeted in a canonical, <i>hb</i>-like manner in concert with Pum. In a second, more conventional approach, we identify mRNAs that are stabilized during the maternal zygotic transition (MZT) in embryos from <i>nos</i><sup>-</sup> females. Most (86%) of the 1,185 mRNAs regulated by Nos are also targeted by Upf1-Nos, validating use of the chimera. Previous work has shown that 60% of the maternal transcriptome is degraded in early embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs targeted by Upf1-Nos are hypoadenylated and inefficiently translated at the ovary–embryo transition; they are subsequently degraded in the early embryo, accounting for 59% of all destabilized maternal mRNAs. We suggest that the late ovarian burst of Nos represses a large fraction of the maternal transcriptome, priming it for later degradation by other factors in the embryo.","author":"Mohammad Marhabaie","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"b03d92e1ebdd033f0bec1aad36994d2b0512d50cbc161d746beccf518760087c","category":"Environment"}
