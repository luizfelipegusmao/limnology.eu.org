{"title":"Reviving the Practices of Transhumance in a Forgotten Settlement in Mainland Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0002/v1","date":1725275456000,"content":"The object of this research project is the investigation of the forgotten landscape of transhumance in mainland Greece, focusing on areas abandoned by modern society and their historical passage. The objective is to revive these lands by restoring their cultural heritage and creating a sustainable community that balances the needs of people, livestock, and the environment. The investigation employs a dual approach: studying transhumance as a cultural and natural practice and analyzing anonymous architecture to preserve collective memory. This involves extensive historical research and a simultaneous analysis of spatial, social, symbolic, and architectural elements. The study identifies convergence points between cultural practices and architectural heritage, applying these insights to modern redevelopment scenarios. Findings reveal a significant interplay between transhumance practices and the regionâ€™s anonymous architecture. Key characteristics of the landscape and its spatial identity are documented, providing insights into effective preservation and redevelopment strategies. Specific case studies validate these strategies, demonstrating their relevance to current and future efforts. The study concludes that understanding the historical context and spatial identity of transhumance landscapes is crucial for sustainable redevelopment. By preserving cultural practices and architectural heritage, this project offers a framework for revitalizing these forgotten landscapes, ensuring balanced coexistence of people, livestock, and the environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9973a11533d456a15728ee23ea13156897e29ebb29d1e08045146cc7b40ee581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
