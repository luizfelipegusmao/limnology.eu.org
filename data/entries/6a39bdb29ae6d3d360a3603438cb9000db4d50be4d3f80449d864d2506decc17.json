{"title":"Research on the Application of Conjoint Analysis Method in Carbon Tax Pricing for the Sustainable Development Process of China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2104/v1","date":1724924202000,"content":"Carbon tax policies (CTP) are globally acknowledged for curbing energy consumption and emissions. Despite global adoption, China's reluctance to embrace a carbon tax, possibly due to effectiveness and public acceptance concerns, is notable. This study employs Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis to gauge Shanghai residents' preferences on four CTP attributes. Among Shanghai's populace, the annual cost of the carbon tax policy ranks highest (48.87%), followed by implementation transparency (24.72%), revenue utilization (16.68%), and policy implementers (9.73%). Notably, Shanghai residents exhibit an average annual willingness to pay of 1435.28 CNY, indicating increased acceptance. Enhanced public awareness of carbon tax policies significantly boosts willingness to pay, augmenting carbon tax revenues and fostering low-carbon technology development. Additionally, transparency improvements in carbon tax policy yield notable increases in willingness to pay, underscoring the link between understanding CTP and its perceived importance. These findings highlight the potential of carbon tax policies in advancing sustainability and transitioning to low-carbon economies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a39bdb29ae6d3d360a3603438cb9000db4d50be4d3f80449d864d2506decc17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
