{"title":"The Role of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Environmental Stewardship: Beyond Poverty and Necessity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1838/v1","date":1719393112000,"content":"The persistence of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) among Indigenous and local communities is often associated with socio-economic constraints, poverty, and lack of choices. Such a perspective argues against underpinning profound environmental consciousness and sustainable practices that underlie TEK. The paper challenges reductionism—viewing TEK solely as a creation of necessity—and tries to argue that it entails a sophisticated understanding of ecological balance and conservation ethics. Through various examples, the paper exemplifies how TEK contributes to environmental sustainability for biodiversity conservation, management and use of natural resources, and the enhancement of resilience to climatic change—the same elements crucial for culture, tradition, and community living.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a17817d07ce0df1134552f966444370a5fac670c9f69866ea3bfad0b76623b56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
