{"title":"Whole Genome Sequencing of Human and Porcine Escherichia coli Isolates on a Commercial Pig Farm in South Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0998/v1","date":1715740347000,"content":"Escherichia coli is an indicator microorganism in One Health antibiotic resistance surveillance programmes. The purpose of the study was to describe and compare E. coli isolates obtained from pigs and human contacts from a commercial farm in South Africa using conventional methods and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Porcine E. coli isolates were proportionally more resistant phenotypically and harboured a richer diversity of antibiotic resistance genes, as compared to human E. coli isolates. Different pathovars, namely ExPEC (12.43%, 21/169), ETEC (4.14%; 7/169), EPEC (2.96%, 5/169), EAEC (2.96%, 5/169) and STEC (1.18%, 2/169) were detected at low frequencies. Sequence type complex (STc) 10 were the most prevalent (85.51%, 59/169) among human and porcine isolates. Six STcs (STc10, STc86, STc168, STc206, STc278 and STc469) were shared at the human-livestock interface according to multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Core genome MLST and hierarchical clustering (HC) showed that human and porcine isolates were overall genetically diverse, but some clustering at HC2 to HC200 were observed. In conclusion, even though the isolates shared a spatio-temporal relationship, there were still differences in the virulence potential, antibiotic resistance profiles, and cgMLST and HC according to the source of isolation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f296268e0b4386a8cf825f1ed6a78b500afb616805340f22d01eb1487b3c4ac3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
