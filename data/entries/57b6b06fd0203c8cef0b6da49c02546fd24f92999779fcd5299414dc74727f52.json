{"title":"Basophils as a Predictive Hematological Biomarker of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis in the Treatment with Miltefosina","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0561/v1","date":1720422638000,"content":"Basophils are initiators of the Th2 response related to the progression of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CanL). Miltefosine has been presented as an alternative in treatment due to its leishmanicide and immunomodulatory effects. Many blood cells have been used as predictive biomarkers, but none of them focused on the immunomodulatory action of miltefosine in the different stages of the disease. Identifying the predictive hematological biomarkers in dogs with visceral leishmaniasis treated with miltefosine. The animals were divided into three groups: sick dogs; infected dogs, dogs exposed. The animals were submitted to differential blood cell count and CanL diagnosis, through DPP, ELISA and qPCR. The groups were monitored from the time zero (T0) before treatment, and the times twenty (T20) and thirty (T30) days after the beginning of treatment using miltefosine at a dose of 1mL/10kg per day for 28 days. Basophils showed an exponential increase in the infected and sick group with an increase of IgG, suggesting a Th2 response. In the exposed group there was reduction of basophils with increase in monocytes and IgG reduction, suggesting a Th1 response. We suggest basophils as a predictive biomarker of immunomodulation in the treatment of CanL with miltefosine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57b6b06fd0203c8cef0b6da49c02546fd24f92999779fcd5299414dc74727f52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
