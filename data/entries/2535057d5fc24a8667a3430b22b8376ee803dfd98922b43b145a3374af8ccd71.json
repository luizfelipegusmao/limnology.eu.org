Classical nucleation theory (CNT) describes the formation of crystalline nanoparticle seeds from highly insoluble metal atoms generated by chemical reduction of metal ions. After nucleation ceases, diffusion and attachment of monomers to the seeds is thought to be responsible for growth. However, a growing body of evidence has indicated that metal nanoparticles do not form by classical nucleation and monomer growth, but instead <span>via</span> aggregation of small metal clusters. Direct evidence from <span>in situ</span> x-ray scattering and liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) have substantiated this mechanism [<a href=\"#ozae044.1040-B1\">1-3</a>]. Prior work has suggested that magic sized clusters could contribute to nanoparticle growth [<a href=\"#ozae044.1040-B4\">4</a>]. However, these thermodynamically preferred clusters likely do not explain nanoparticle formation reactions using strong reductants, where reaction kinetics dominate the chemical formation pathways. Discover of the total chemical conversion pathways of ionic precursors to metallic nanoparticles would enable rationally designing synthesis reactions to achieve ultimate control over the nanoparticle properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2535057d5fc24a8667a3430b22b8376ee803dfd98922b43b145a3374af8ccd71","category":"Environment"}
