{"title":"Assessing marginal effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across Africa: a hybrid modeling study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article/41/3/225/7724873?rss=1","date":1722384000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Since 2019, a new strain of coronavirus has challenged global health systems. Due its fragile healthcare systems, Africa was predicted to be the most affected continent. However, past experiences of African countries with epidemics and other factors, including actions taken by governments, have contributed to reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to assess the marginal impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in fifteen African countries during the pre-vaccination period. To describe the transmission dynamics and control of SARS-CoV-2 spread, an extended time-dependent SEIR model was used. The transmission rate of each infectious stage was obtained using a logistic model with NPI intensity as a covariate. The results revealed that the effects of NPIs varied between countries. Overall, restrictive measures related to assembly had, in most countries, the largest reducing effects on the pre-symptomatic and mild transmission, while the transmission by severe individuals is influenced by privacy measures (more than $10\\%$). Countries should develop efficient alternatives to assembly restrictions to preserve the economic sector. This involves e.g. training in digital tools and strengthening digital infrastructures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"4ea32283a96a10e1f4575fa3f53b53b0712f6c97164f9ce42b874d616914ca06","category":"Environment"}
