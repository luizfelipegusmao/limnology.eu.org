In Germany, DNA-based assays are currently used to screen for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and sickle cell disease (SCD).</p> Methods <p>This study analysed the impact of pre-analytic DNA carry-over in sample preparation on the outcome of DNA-based newborn screening for SCID and SMA and compared the efficacy of rapid extraction versus automated protocols. Additionally, the distribution of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) on DBS cards, commonly used for routine newborn screening, was determined.</p> Results <p>Contaminations from the punching procedure were detected in the SCID and SMA assays in all experimental setups tested. However, a careful evaluation of a cut-off allowed for a clear separation of true positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications. Our rapid in-house extraction protocol produced similar amounts compared to automated commercial systems. Therefore, it can be used for reliable DNA-based screening. Additionally, the amount of extracted DNA significantly differs depending on the location of punching within a DBS.</p> Conclusions <p>Newborn screening for SMA and SCID can be performed reliably. It is crucial to ensure that affected newborns are not overlooked. Therefore a carefully consideration of potential contaminating factors and the definition of appropriate cut-offs to minimise the risk of false results are of special concern. It is also important to note that the location of punching plays a pivotal role, and therefore an exact quantification of TREC numbers per μl may not be reliable and should therefore be avoided.</p>","author":"Jessica Bzdok","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a83fd9e50b36c7be3628b07343e915723975cdf73e300985c2d8f6240ddd4992","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
