{"title":"Acute Effect of Three Aerobic Exercise Intensities on Glomerular Filtration Rate in Healthy Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1031/v1","date":1726210603000,"content":"No consensus exists on whether acute aerobic exercise alters the glomerular filtration rate in older adults. Objective: To assess the immediate effects of three aerobic exercise intensities on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in healthy, sedentary older adults. Methods: Eighteen healthy, sedentary older adults (12 men and eight women) voluntarily participated in the study. The participants underwent three standardized aerobic exercise tests (100%, 80%, and 60% of the maximal heart rate) on a bicycle ergometer. Blood samples were collected to determine cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, serum creatinine (Cr), Cystatin C (CysC) concentrations, and eGFR. Results: eGFR and serum concentrations of Cr and CysC were not modified at any exercise intensity. There was a negative correlation between blood total cholesterol vs. eGFR (R= -0.512, R= -0.582, R= -0.531; p &amp;lt;0.05) at rest, 60%, and 100% of the maximal heart rate, respectively. Besides, a negative correlation existed between age vs. eGFR at 60% of the maximal heart rate (R= -0.516; p &amp;lt;0.05). Conclusion: Short-time aerobic exercise of low, moderate, and vigorous intensity did not significantly affect eGFR and is considered safe for kidney function in healthy, sedentary older adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64e53422be1f332c1debef2adfa96aff370bb40b90ab02162cbf9eab29baef21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
