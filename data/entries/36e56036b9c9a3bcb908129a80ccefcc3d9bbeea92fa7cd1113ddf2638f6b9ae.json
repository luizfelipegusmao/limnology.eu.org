{"title":"Recent Advances in Non-Linear Imaging Techniques for Cancer Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1569/v1","date":1721379197000,"content":"The World Health Organization (WHO) cancer agency predicts that more than 35 mil-lion cases of will be experienced in 2050, a 77 % increase over the 2022 estimate. Cur-rently, the leading cancer diagnosed cancer are breast, lung and colorectal. There is no standardized tool for cancer diagnosis; initially clinical procedures are guided by the patientÂ´s symptoms and generally involve biochemical blood tests, imaging and biopsy. Label-free nonlinear optical approaches are promising tool for tumor imaging, due to their inherent non-invasive biosafe contrast mechanisms and the ability to monitor collagen-related disorders and metabolic changes during cancer progression. Last ad-vances in nonlinear modalities for tumor imaging are reviewed here. In addition, an application of a blind deconvolution procedure to improve the quality of two-photon images of breast tumor tissues is shown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36e56036b9c9a3bcb908129a80ccefcc3d9bbeea92fa7cd1113ddf2638f6b9ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
