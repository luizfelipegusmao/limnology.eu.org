{"title":"TRPM4 and PLCβ3 contribute to normal behavioral responses to an array of sweeteners and carbohydrates but PLCβ3 is not needed for taste-driven licking for glucose","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae001/7512495?rss=1","date":1704499200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The peripheral taste system is more complex than previously thought. The novel taste-signaling proteins TRPM4 and PLCβ3 appear to function in normal taste responding as part of Type II taste cell signaling or as part of a broadly responsive (BR) taste cell that can respond to some or all classes of tastants. This work begins to disentangle the roles of intracellular components found in Type II taste cells (TRPM5, TRPM4, and IP<sub>3</sub>R3) or the BR taste cells (PLCβ3 and TRPM4) in driving behavioral responses to various saccharides and other sweeteners in brief-access taste tests. We found that TRPM4, TRPM5, TRPM4/5, and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 knockout (KO) mice show blunted or abolished responding to all stimuli compared with wild-type. IP<sub>3</sub>R3 KO mice did, however, lick more for glucose than fructose following extensive experience with the 2 sugars. PLCβ3 KO mice were largely unresponsive to all stimuli except they showed normal concentration-dependent responding to glucose. The results show that key intracellular signaling proteins associated with Type II and BR taste cells are mutually required for taste-driven responses to a wide range of sweet and carbohydrate stimuli, except glucose. This confirms and extends a previous finding demonstrating that Type II and BR cells are both necessary for taste-driven licking to sucrose. Glucose appears to engage unique intracellular taste-signaling mechanisms, which remain to be fully elucidated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"f48963445b01063f87b649f6b57d670580f98f9842c21851fbcef90ad1f402ec","category":"Environment"}
