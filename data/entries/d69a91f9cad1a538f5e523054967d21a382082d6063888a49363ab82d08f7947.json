{"title":"Biosensor-Integrated Virtual Reality (VR) System Assisted CBT and the Alteration of Delusional Perceptions in Psychosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1956/v1","date":1714454713000,"content":"Introduction: The aim is to investigate the possibility of altering the delusional perceptions of psychotic patients by exposing them to a cognitively flexible virtual environment. A flexible vir-tual reality (VR) environment could challenge and enhance the ability to adapt to changing situa-tions and generate novel solutions to core psychotic symptoms. Materials and methods: A systematic review was conducted using different combinations of keywords in different databases. This study was conducted using the PRISMA statement. Results: There is a growing literature on the use of VR to manipulate and normalise perceptual distortions in psychosis. Over the last decade, the number of published studies on VR in mental health has increased 14-fold. Conclusions: A cognitive flexibility virtual environment can alter delusional perception by ex-posing the person to different scenarios that require them to question their assumptions, test their hypotheses, and revise their beliefs. Commonly used biosensors measure heart rate, skin con-ductance and body temperature in relation to different emotional states. Recently, there has been a major shift towards the use of neuroimaging techniques to better understand the pathophysiology of mental disorders. This is where the new wave of biosensor-integrated virtual reality (VR) sys-tems comes in.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d69a91f9cad1a538f5e523054967d21a382082d6063888a49363ab82d08f7947","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
