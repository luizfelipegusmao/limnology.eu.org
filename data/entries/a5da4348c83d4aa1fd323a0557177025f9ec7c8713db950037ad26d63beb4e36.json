Elderly individuals with diabetes are at higher risk of developing hypoglycemia compared with younger diabetes patients. Hypoglycemia in elderly patients can result in serious consequences such as cognitive changes, increased risk of falls, heart and other vascular problems, and even high mortality rate.</p> Objective <p>To assess prevalence, and factors associated with hypoglycemia events among geriatric outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p> Methods <p>The study was conducted at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) at the outpatient diabetes clinic from October 1st, 2022 to August 1st, 2023. Variables such as socio-demographics, medication history, and comorbidities were obtained using electronic medical records. The prevalence of hypoglycemia was determined through patient interviews during their clinic visit. Patients were prospectively monitored for hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality using electronic medical records over a three-month follow-up period. Logistic regression models were conducted to identify factors associated with hypoglycemia and hospital admissions/ emergency visits. Ethical Approval (Reference # 53/151/2022) was obtained on 19/9/2022.</p> Results <p>Electronic medical charts of 640 patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and age ≥ 60 years were evaluated. The mean age ± SD was 67.19 (± 5.69) years. Hypoglycemia incidents with different severity levels were prevalent in 21.7% (n = 139) of the patients. Insulin administration was significantly associated with more hypoglycemic events compared to other antidiabetic medication. Patients with liver diseases had a significantly higher risk of hypoglycemia, with odds 7.43 times higher than patients without liver diseases. Patients with dyslipidemia also had a higher risk of hypoglycemia (odd ratio = 1.87). Regression analysis revealed that hypoglycemia and educational level were significant predictors for hospital admission and emergency department (ER) visits. Hypoglycemia was a positive predictor, meaning it increased the odds of these outcomes, while having a college degree or higher was associated with reduced odds of hospital admission and ER visits.</p> Conclusion <p>Current study identified a considerable prevalence of hypoglycemia among older patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly, among those with concurrent liver diseases and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, hypoglycemia was associated with an increased rate of emergency department visits and hospital admissions by 2 folds in this population.</p>","author":"Ahmad Al-Azayzih","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a5da4348c83d4aa1fd323a0557177025f9ec7c8713db950037ad26d63beb4e36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
