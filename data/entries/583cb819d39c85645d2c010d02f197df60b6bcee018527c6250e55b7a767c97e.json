{"title":"Prognostic Value of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1217/v1","date":1718702294000,"content":"Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) have become the focus of antitumor immunity. However, the prognostic significance of TLSs in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) treated with primary debulking surgery (PDS) or interval debulking surgery (IDS) remains unelucidated. This retrospective study examined the prognostic value of TLSs in tumor tissues obtained during PDS and IDS. Pathological specimens were collected from patients with EOC who underwent PDS or IDS between 2017 and 2020 at the National Cancer Center Hospital East. The correlation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte frequency, TLS presence, and PD-L1 expression with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and the correlation between TLS and PD-L1 expression were analyzed. Overall, 25 specimens (15 from PDS and 10 from IDS) were analyzed. The presence of TLS was associated with a significantly longer OS in patients who underwent PDS but not in patients who underwent IDS. No correlation was identified between TLS and PFS in patients with PDS or with IDS. However, TLS was positively correlated with PD-L1 positivity. The prognostic impact of TLS, specifically in pre-chemotherapy specimens, and a positive correlation between TLS and PD-L1 indicate the potential of TLS as a meaningful biomarker for understanding antitumor immunity and developing immunotherapy for EOC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"583cb819d39c85645d2c010d02f197df60b6bcee018527c6250e55b7a767c97e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
