{"title":"Tractography Insights into Anticipatory Postural Adjustment and Freezing of Gait in Parkinson&#039;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1766/v1","date":1721720678000,"content":"Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a disabling motor complication in Parkinson’s disease (PD), affecting approximately 50% of advanced PD patients. It is characterized by sudden and transient inability to initiate or maintain walking, leading to falls and reduced quality of life. This study investigates the relationship between white matter integrity and step initiation impairments in FoG. Forty-three PD patients (26 with FoG) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging to assess white matter DTI metrics and kinematic analysis during step initiation tasks. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore the connection between white matter tract integrity and step initiation behavior. The multiple regression analysis shows that (1) Right Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus RD explained 31% of APA duration’s variance; (2) Corpus Callosum Forceps Major explained 25% of the step length's variance. There was a positive correlation between the Right Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus RD and APA duration and a negative correlation between Corpus Callosum Forceps Major RD and step length. The findings suggest that compromised white matter integrity in RILF and CC contributes to impaired motor control during step initiation in FoG. These regions are critical for inhibitory control and interhemispheric coordination, crucial for APA execution and step length regulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2151bcfda29111a2bf6276625e4ea78eaee310ba77c63d52b929c4173f7fff82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
