{"title":"Analytical methods for stable isotope labeling to elucidate rapid auxin kinetics in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303992","date":1716386400000,"content":"<p>by Qian Tang, Molly Tillmann, Jerry D. Cohen</p>\r\n\r\nThe phytohormone auxin plays a critical role in plant growth and development. Despite significant progress in elucidating metabolic pathways of the primary bioactive auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), over the past few decades, key components such as intermediates and enzymes have not been fully characterized, and the dynamic regulation of IAA metabolism in response to environmental signals has not been completely revealed. In this study, we established a protocol employing a highly sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instrumentation and a rapid stable isotope labeling approach. We treated <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings with two stable isotope labeled precursors ([<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]anthranilate and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>8</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>]indole) and monitored the label incorporation into proposed indolic compounds involved in IAA biosynthetic pathways. This Stable Isotope Labeled Kinetics (SILK) method allowed us to trace the turnover rates of IAA pathway precursors and product concurrently with a time scale of seconds to minutes. By measuring the entire pathways over time and using different isotopic tracer techniques, we demonstrated that these methods offer more detailed information about this complex interacting network of IAA biosynthesis, and should prove to be useful for studying auxin metabolic network in vivo in a variety of plant tissues and under different environmental conditions.","author":"Qian Tang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3eaf343731329099c7d2268a29cb136f32c9de9fb29d8a83efd0f948115f0ab9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
