{"title":"Water velocity shapes fish movement behavior","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15669?af=R","date":1706245170000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Stream and river ecosystems present fluvial fishes with a dynamic energy landscape because moving water generates heterogeneous flow fields that are rarely static in space and time. Fish movement behavior should be consistent with conserving energy in these dynamic flowing environments, but little evidence supporting this hypothesis exists. Here, we tested experimentally whether three general movement behaviors—against the current, with the current, or holding position (i.e., staying in one position and location)—were performed in a way consistent with minimizing the cost of swimming in a heterogeneous flow field. We tested the effects of water velocity on movement behavior across three age classes (0, 1, and 5 years) of two different fluvial specialist fishes, the pallid sturgeon (<i>Scaphirhynchus albus</i>) and shovelnose sturgeon (<i>Scaphirhynchus platorynchus</i>). Individuals from the three age classes were exposed to a continuous and dynamic velocity field ranging from 0.02 to 0.53 m s<sup>−1</sup>, which represented natural benthic flow regimes occupied by these species in rivers. Both sturgeon species exhibited the same pattern with regard to their tendency to hold position, move upstream, or move downstream. Moving downstream was positively associated with velocity for all age groups. Moving upstream was inversely related to velocity for young fish, but as the fish aged, moving upstream was not related to water velocity. The oldest fish (age 5) moved upstream more frequently compared to the younger age classes. Holding position within a water current was the most frequent behavior and occurred with similar probability across the range of experimental velocity for youngest fish (age 0), but was inversely related to velocity in older fish. Our experiment across age classes suggests that the suite of swimming behaviors exhibited by fluvial specialists might have evolved to mitigate the energetic costs of complex energy landscapes generated by moving water to ultimately maximize net energy gain.</p>","author":"William D.
