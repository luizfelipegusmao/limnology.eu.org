{"title":"Overturn Dynamics of a Small Moon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1698/v1","date":1719247175000,"content":"The paper considers the possibility of rotating a small moon by 180 degrees from a dynamic point of view using two rocket engines mounted on the surface of the moon. A thrust control law for the engines which allows to turn the moon over and then stabilize it relative to a new equilibrium position by parrying a gravity gradient torque is proposed. The dynamic aspects of such an experiment are discussed using the example of the Mars satellite Deimos.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9375caca7b73cb179ff1ba9981a51af3c88e17c8abacc0a9ec48141bf34144c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
