{"title":"Digest: Resource limitation as a mechanism for constraining the evolution of virulence in malaria parasites","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/8/1513/7695441?rss=1","date":1718668800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The virulence of parasites is expected to reflect an evolutionary tradeoff between increasing proliferation rates that enhance transmission and host mortality which curtails transmission. However, host resource availability may also limit parasites’ proliferation rate. To understand the role of resource limitation as a driver of virulence evolution, <a href=\"#CIT0006\">Pak et al. (2024)</a> use a within-host model of red blood cell (RBC) invasion by <span>Plasmodium chabaudi</span>. They find that within-host resource consumption limits the evolution of the parasite’s proliferation rate, as the depletion of RBCs during infection results in intermediate optimal virulence. These results suggest that resource limitation, rather than host mortality, may drive the evolution of virulence.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"8ac4c4850ecac2acf6d2a0512af56f89cce0ec2ae5a924af0bd5551b20d0c822","category":"Environment"}
