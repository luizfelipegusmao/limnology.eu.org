{"title":"On Mittag-Leffler Function and Consequent Fractional Integral Operator Inequalities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0619/v1","date":1718089019000,"content":"The unified Mittag-Leffler (ML) function is important factor in formulation of compact form of fractional integrals. In this paper estimations of integral operators, with the unified ML function as kernel are given. The Hadamard inequality in the form of fractional integrals is proved by considering refinement of convexities. These estimations provide various inequalities as refinements of recently published results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fadf7de90e7f5660ccd20e1d9d9ed604cd9d6c87a359e000181fc87cbc29797","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
