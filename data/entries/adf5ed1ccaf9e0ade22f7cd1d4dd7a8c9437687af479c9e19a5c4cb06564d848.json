The ratio of sample signal against the background is a significant factor for resolution. Depth-sectioning scanning TEM (STEM) is a promising technique that enhances the signal for a sample embedded in a matrix. It can increase the resolution to the atomic level, thereby enabling EC-STEM applications in important areas. This review introduces depth-sectioning STEM and its applications to high-resolution EC-STEM imaging of samples in gases and in liquids.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"adf5ed1ccaf9e0ade22f7cd1d4dd7a8c9437687af479c9e19a5c4cb06564d848","category":"Environment"}
