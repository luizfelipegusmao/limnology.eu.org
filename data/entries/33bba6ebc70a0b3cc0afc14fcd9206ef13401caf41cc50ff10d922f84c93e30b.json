However, drivers of <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> for SOM fractions including particulate and mineral-associated organic matter (POM and MAOM) are still unclear. Based on large-scale field sampling and laboratory incubation, we found that linkages between <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> and microbial communities were fraction-dependent. <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> for POM was associated with bacterial community composition, while <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> for MAOM was correlated to the relative abundance of bacterial keystone taxa. Moreover, bacterial alpha diversity negatively and positively affected <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> for POM and MAOM, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of considering SOM fraction-dependent microbial linkages with <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> to accurately predict terrestrial carbon-climate feedback.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The magnitude of terrestrial carbon (C)-climate feedback largely depends on the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition (<i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub>). However, our understanding of determinants of <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> for SOM fractions such as particulate and mineral-associated organic matter (POM and MAOM, respectively) is still inadequate. Particularly, it remains unclear whether microbial effects on <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> are fraction-dependent, which induces large uncertainties in projecting soil C dynamics. Here, we conducted large-scale topsoil sampling on the Tibetan Plateau, in combination with SOM fractionation and 300-day laboratory incubation to assess SOM fraction-dependent linkages between <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> and microbial properties. We found that compared with MAOM, POM had larger <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> and greater microbial diversity, and also structured distinct microbial communities as well as their co-occurrence patterns. Furthermore, associations of <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> with microbial properties differed between the two SOM fractions. Bacterial community composition and relative abundance of bacterial keystone taxa affected <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> for POM and MAOM respectively, while bacterial alpha diversity showed opposite relationships with <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> for POM and MAOM. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating SOM fraction-dependent microbial properties and their linkages with <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> into Earth system models to accurately predict terrestrial C-climate feedback.</p>","author":"Shuqi Qin, \nKai Fang, \nYutong Song, \nLuyao Kang, \nSiyu Wang, \nYuanhe Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"33bba6ebc70a0b3cc0afc14fcd9206ef13401caf41cc50ff10d922f84c93e30b","category":"Environment"}
