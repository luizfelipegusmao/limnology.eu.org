{"title":"Intracoronary Imaging for Changing Therapeutic Decision in Patients with Multivascular Coronary Artery Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0045/v1","date":1719818187000,"content":"Introduction\nAtherosclerotic disease is a major contributor to heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction, significantly lowering the quality of life and life expectancy, with a significant burden on healthcare. Not all lesions deemed non-significant are benign, and conversely, not all significant lesions are causative of ischemia. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) provides a functional assessment of coronary lesions, while optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers detailed imaging of plaque morphology, aiding in therapeutic decision-making.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of OCT and FFR as adjunctive tools in the catheterization laboratory for guiding therapeutic decisions in patients with multivessel disease for non-culprit vessels. Specifically, we aimed to assess how OCT and FFR influence therapeutic decision-making in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease.\nMethods\n36 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and multivessel disease were randomized 1:1 into two groups: one guided by FFR alone, and the other by a combination of FFR and OCT. For the FFR group, revascularization decisions for non culprit lesions were based solely on FFR measurements. If the FFR was &gt;0.8, the procedure concluded, and the patient received maximal medical treatment. If the FFR was ≤0.8, a stent was placed. For the FFR + OCT group, if the FFR was &gt;0.8, the revascularization decision was based on OCT findings. If there were no vulnerable plaques (VP), the procedure concluded, and the patient received maximal medical treatment. If OCT imaging indicated VP, then the patient underwent revascularization. If the FFR was ≤0.8, the patient underwent revascularization regardless of OCT findings.\nResults\nOCT imaging altered the therapeutic decision in 11 cases where FFR measurements were above 0.8, but the lesions were characterized as VP. Analyzing the total change in the decision to stent, 4 cases in the FFR group and 15 cases in the FFR and OCT group (4 based on FFR and 11 on OCT) revealed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0006; Relative Risk = 0.2556; 95% CI: 0.1013 to 0.5603). When analyzing the change in the total decision both to stent and not to stent, we observed a statistically significant difference, with Group 1 having 7 cases and Group 2 having 15 cases (p = 0.0153; Relative Risk = 0.4050; 95% CI: 0.2004 to 0.7698) \nConclusion\nBased on the findings of this study, OCT significantly increases the percentage of stenting procedures by identifying vulnerable lesions. The use of intracoronary imaging facilitates the timely identification and treatment of these vulnerable lesions. This underscores the crucial role of OCT in enhancing the precision of coronary interventions by ensuring timely intervention for vulnerable lesions, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes\nAcknowledgment funding\n„This work was supported by the University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology ,, George Emil Palade’’ of Targu Mures Research Grant number 510/14/17.01.2022”","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8fcd7c608a6a4bf92f3b1c5640783a45a2feb8ae9c96dbc483ac4021cdfec33b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
