{"title":"A Knowledge Graph Based Implicit Requirements Mining Method in Personalized Products Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1040/v1","date":1720778827000,"content":"In the context of crowds innovation and the generative design driven by big language models, the personalized requirements has become the best engine for innovative design. The exploration of personalized requirements has become a key in significantly improving product innovation, concepts feasibility, and design interaction efficiency. To mine a large number of vague and unexpressed implicit requirements of personalized products, a domain knowledge graph-based method is proposed in this research. First, based on the classical theory of design science, the characteristics and categories of personalized implicit requirements are analyzed. Next, in order to improve the practicability and construction efficiency of the domain knowledge graph, a more informative ontology is constructed, and better performing NLP models are proposed. Then, a series of mining methods based on knowledge graph are proposed for the personalized implicit requirements of different categories. Finally, A platform was developed based on the technical solution proposed in this study, and an example verification was conducted in the field of electromechanical engineering. The efficiency improvement of the training model proposed in the research was analyzed, and the practicality of implicit requirement mining methods were discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a00adb3a3484edcc84fd15e5ee6b75b5a4a3ee67f5ddeca39a42dc31cd89fe3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
