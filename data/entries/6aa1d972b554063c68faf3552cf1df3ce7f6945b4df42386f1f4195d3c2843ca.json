{"title":"Zebrafish as a Model for Studying Age-Dependent Sarcopenia and Frailty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1073/v1","date":1715853304000,"content":"Currently, there is an increase in the aging of the population, which represents a risk factor for many diseases, including sarcopenia. Sarcopenia involves progressive loss of mass, strength, and function of the skeletal muscle. Some mechanisms include alterations in muscle structure, reduced regenerative capacity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. The zebrafish has emerged as a new model for studying skeletal muscle aging because of its numerous advantages, including histological and molecular similarity to human skeletal muscle. In this study, we used fish of 2, 10, 30, and 60 months of age. The older fish showed a higher frailty index because of reduced locomotor activity and alterations in biometric measurements. We observed changes in muscle structure with a decreased number of myocytes and an increase in collagen with aging, corresponding to alterations in the synthesis, degradation, and differentiation pathways. These changes were accompanied by mitochondrial alterations, such as a decrease in intermyofibrillar mitochondria, increased mitochondrial damage, and reduced mitochondrial dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated a similarity in the aging processes of muscle aging between zebrafish and mammals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6aa1d972b554063c68faf3552cf1df3ce7f6945b4df42386f1f4195d3c2843ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
