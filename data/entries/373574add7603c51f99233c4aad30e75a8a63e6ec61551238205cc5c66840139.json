{"title":"Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Stored Product Insects in a Feed Mill in Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1779/v1","date":1729676856000,"content":"Floor traps were placed in a feed mill in Greece, for a period of approx. 13 months to illustrate the relative abundance and the distribution of the stored product insects found. More than 20 taxa were found, with most of them belonging in Coleoptera. The most abundant species found were the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) and the granary weevil, Sitophilus granarius (L.) which are common primary colonizers of grains, and the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), which are secondary colonizers that usually occur in processed amylaceous commodities. Interestingly, the highest population densities of all four species were recorded during the same period, with the secondary colonizers slightly preceding those of the primary ones. Although competition among these species has been recorded in previous studies, we found that these four species could coexist during the entire trapping period in the same sampling units, that indicates possible spatial segregation and different colonization patters in space and time. Our results demonstrate that trapping in storage and processing facilities is an essential component in making decisions for stored product pest management strategies in localized applications, and can drastically reduce the need for treating the entire facility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"373574add7603c51f99233c4aad30e75a8a63e6ec61551238205cc5c66840139","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
