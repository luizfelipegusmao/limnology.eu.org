Rating and sizing estimations are time-consuming and difficult to get since sun radiation is diffuse and imprecise; as a result, a theoretical technique is used to gather the necessary data. The generator is assumed to be fully loaded for the sake of the computations. Considerations including chimney height, collector radius, and storage thickness are made in order to get the appropriate generator rating and daily energy output. The optimum sizing assessment has also been obtained based on the input criteria. To get the required results, weather information for Mumbai, India has been taken into account. Based on the findings, the technical feasibility was researched and presented.</p>","author":"Biren K. Behera, \nKaushal K. Sharma, \nSudhansu S.
