{"title":"Thermal Stress in Outdoor Spaces during Mediterranean Heatwaves: A PET and UTCI Analysis of Different Demographics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0104/v1","date":1727854769000,"content":"Urban public space comfort is vital for enhancing the quality of life and perceptions of livability, especially as climate change increasingly impacts outdoor thermal environments. This study investigates the use of ENVI-met, a 3D microclimate simulation tool, to assess thermal comfort concerning demographic factors like age and gender. While ENVI-met is often used to analyze urban microclimates, there is limited research on its application for simulating heat emission variations across different demographic groups. The findings highlight significant disparities in thermal stress vulnerability: elderly individuals are at higher risk due to elevated maximum PET values, while children experience broader ranges of thermal stress and higher baseline values. Despite cooling effects in the evening, children continue to face greater stress. The study emphasizes the need for tailored management strategies, as morning PET values are consistent but afternoon data reveals childrenâ€™s ongoing vulnerability. Overall, the research calls for further investigation to enhance urban planning, thermal comfort strategies, and public health interventions amid rising temperatures. It advocates for expanding ENVI-met's capabilities to include diverse demographic factors, promoting a more comprehensive approach to urban resilience and well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec0df9f0bf3ca0b473e8b4a1bc0c4d6af04253b46c519f100886f0abe783e78f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
