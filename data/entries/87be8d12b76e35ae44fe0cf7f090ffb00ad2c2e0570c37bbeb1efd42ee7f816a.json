{"title":"An assessment of HgII to preserve carbonate system parameters in organic‐rich estuarine waters","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10593?af=R","date":1708082732000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This work assesses the effectiveness of sample preservation techniques for measurements of pH<sub>T</sub> (total scale), total dissolved inorganic carbon (C<sub>T</sub>), and total alkalinity (A<sub>T</sub>) in organic-rich estuarine waters as well as the internal consistency of measurements and calculations (e.g., A<sub>T</sub>, pH<sub>T</sub>, and C<sub>T</sub>) in these waters. Using mercuric chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>)-treated and untreated water samples, measurements of these carbonate system parameters were examined over a period of 3 months. Respiration of dissolved organic matter in untreated samples created large discrepancies in C<sub>T</sub> concentrations (~37 <i>μ</i>mol kg<sup>−1</sup> increase, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), while C<sub>T</sub> was effectively constant in treated samples (3095.0 ± 1.14 <i>μ</i>mol kg<sup>−1</sup>). A<sub>T</sub> changes were observed for both treated and untreated samples, with HgCl<sub>2</sub>-treated samples showing the greatest variation (~ 26 <i>μ</i>mol kg<sup>−1</sup> decrease, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In response to changing A<sub>T</sub>/C<sub>T</sub> ratios, pH<sub>T</sub> changes occurred in both treated and untreated samples but were relatively small in treated samples. Results in organic-rich estuarine waters that reflect the in situ carbonate system characteristics of the samples at the time of collection can be improved when samples obtained for C<sub>T</sub> and A<sub>T</sub> analysis are collected and stored separately. Accurate analyses of C<sub>T</sub> can be obtained by filtration and preservation with HgCl<sub>2</sub>. Accuracy of A<sub>T</sub> analyses can be improved by filtration and storage without adding HgCl<sub>2</sub>. The quality of pH<sub>T</sub> measurements can be improved by prompt analysis in the field and, if this cannot be accomplished, then samples can be preserved with HgCl<sub>2</sub> and measured in the laboratory within 1 week.</p>","author":"Christopher S.
