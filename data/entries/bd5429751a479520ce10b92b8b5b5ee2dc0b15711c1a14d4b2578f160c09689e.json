{"title":"The Dynamic Assimilation Technique measures photosynthetic CO2 response curves with similar fidelity to steady-state approaches in half the time","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2819/7608858?rss=1","date":1707955200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (<span>A</span>) response to intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (<span>C</span><sub>i</sub>) is a fundamental measurement in photosynthesis and plant physiology research. The conventional <span>A</span>/<span>C</span><sub>i</sub> protocols rely on steady-state measurements and take 15â€“40 min per measurement, limiting data resolution or biological replication. Additionally, there are several CO<sub>2</sub> protocols employed across the literature, without clear consensus as to the optimal protocol or systematic biases in their estimations. We compared the non-steady-state Dynamic Assimilation Technique (DAT) protocol and the three most used CO<sub>2</sub> protocols in steady-state measurements, and tested whether different CO<sub>2</sub> protocols lead to systematic differences in estimations of the biochemical limitations to photosynthesis. The DAT protocol reduced the measurement time by almost half without compromising estimation accuracy or precision. The monotonic protocol was the fastest steady-state method. Estimations of biochemical limitations to photosynthesis were very consistent across all CO<sub>2</sub> protocols, with slight differences in Rubisco carboxylation limitation. The <span>A</span>/<span>C</span><sub>i</sub> curves were not affected by the direction of the change of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration but rather the time spent under triose phosphate utilization (TPU)-limited conditions. Our results suggest that the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (<span>V</span><sub><span>c</span>max</sub>), linear electron flow for NADPH supply (<span>J</span>), and TPU measured using different protocols within the literature are comparable, or at least not systematically different based on the measurement protocol used.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"bd5429751a479520ce10b92b8b5b5ee2dc0b15711c1a14d4b2578f160c09689e","category":"Environment"}
