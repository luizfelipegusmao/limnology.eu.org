{"title":"Advanced Micro/Nanocapsules for Self-Healing Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0330/v1","date":1722939767000,"content":"The concept of intelligence has many applications, such as coatings and cyber security. Smart coatings have the ability to sense and/or response to external stimuli and generally interact with their environment. Self-healing coatings represent a significant advance in improving material durability and performance using microcapsules and nanocontainers loaded with self-healing agents, catalysts, corrosion inhibitors, and water-repellents. These smart coatings can repair damage on their own and restore mechanical properties without external intervention and are inspired by biological systems. Properties that are affected by either momentary or continuous external stimuli in smart coatings can be related to corrosion, fouling, fungal, self-healing, pie-zoelectric, microbiological, etc. These coating properties can be obtained via combinations of either organic or inorganic polymer phases, additives and pigments. In this article, a review on the advancements of micro/nanocapsules for self-healing coatings is reported from the aspect of ex-trinsic self-healing ability. The concept of extrinsic self-healing coatings is based on the use of capsules or multichannel vascular systems loaded with healing agents/inhibitors. The outcome is that self-healing coatings exhibit improved properties compared to traditional coatings. It is mentioned that self-healing anticorrosive coating not only has enhanced passive barrier function, but also realizes active defense. As a result, there is a significant improvement of the service life and overall performance of the coating. Future research should be devoted to refining self-healing mechanisms and developing cost-effective solutions for a wide range of industrial applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45c3a046ff4ae201a37e7b94f3e8745583ae2c328db3bef25f10fc317ed06bbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
