{"title":"Comparative genomics of dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus, Sciaenidae) conspecifics: Evidence for speciation and the genetic mechanisms underlying traits","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15844?af=R","date":1718666679000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Dusky kob (<i>Argyrosomus japonicus</i>) is a commercially important finfish, indigenous to South Africa, Australia, and China. Previous studies highlighted differences in genetic composition, life history, and morphology of the species across geographic regions. A draft genome sequence of 0.742 Gb (N50 = 5.49 Mb; BUSCO completeness = 97.8%) and 22,438 predicted protein-coding genes was generated for the South African (SA) conspecific. A comparison with the Chinese (CN) conspecific revealed a core set of 32,068 orthologous protein clusters across both genomes. The SA genome exhibited 440 unique clusters compared to 1928 unique clusters in the CN genome. Transportation and immune response processes were overrepresented among the SA accessory genome, whereas the CN accessory genome was enriched for immune response, DNA transposition, and sensory detection (FDR-adjusted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). These unique clusters may represent an adaptive component of the species' pangenome that could explain population divergence due to differential environmental specialisation. Furthermore, 700 single-copy orthologues (SCOs) displayed evidence of positive selection between the SA and CN genomes, and globally these genomes shared only 92% similarity, suggesting they might be distinct species. These genes primarily play roles in metabolism and digestion, illustrating the evolutionary pathways that differentiate the species. Understanding these genomic mechanisms underlying adaptation and evolution within and between species provides valuable insights into growth and maturation of kob, traits that are particularly relevant to commercial aquaculture.</p>","author":"Tassin Kim Jackson, \nClint Rhode","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"c5eb49f8dcb332e8b4cb582451ac0c5c4c5dba2b0492570766b10c27f1d691c7","category":"Environment"}
