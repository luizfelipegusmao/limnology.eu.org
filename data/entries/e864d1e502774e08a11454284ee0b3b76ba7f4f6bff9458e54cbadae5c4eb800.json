{"title":"Creep Phenomena, Mechanisms and Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1166/v1","date":1715938938000,"content":"Metal creep has been a subject of extensive study for more than 110 years, because it affects the useful life of engineering components operating at high temperatures. It is even more so with ever-increasing operating temperatures of propulsion/power-generation systems by the environmental regulations to reduce greenhouse emissions.  This review summaries the recent development in creep modeling with regards to creep strain evolution, creep rate, creep ductility, creep life and fracture mode, attempting to provide a comprehensive mechanism-based framework to address all the important creep phenomena and the long-standing issue of long-term creep life prediction with microstructural evolution and environmental effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e864d1e502774e08a11454284ee0b3b76ba7f4f6bff9458e54cbadae5c4eb800","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
