{"title":"Relating soil moisture and Sentinel-2 vegetation index patterns to spruce bark beetle infestations prior to outbreak","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/97/5/728/7609832?rss=1","date":1708128000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Central Europe experienced severe droughts from 2018 to 2020, which led to bark beetle infestations in Norway spruce (<span>Picea abies</span> L.). While recent studies have identified these droughts as a major factor in the dieback of spruces, the exact mechanism through which drought stress influences spruce vitality and increases vulnerability to infestations is not well understood. To gain insights into the spatial and temporal relations between infestations and drought stress, this study compared soil moisture index (SMI) data for the entire soil layer from the German Drought Monitor and Sentinel-2 satellite time series for healthy and bark beetle infested spruce stands preceding the infestation. The study used t-tests to compare pre-infestation monthly sums of SMI and vegetation indices (VIs) for healthy and infested stands. Yearly trajectories of six VIs were used to compare the separability between infested and healthy plots. The results showed that the monthly sum values of SMI for healthy spruce plots were statistically significantly higher than the infested plots from May 2017 to January 2018, while the monthly sum values of Inverted Red Edge Chlorophyll Index of healthy spruce plots were significantly higher than infested plots during growing seasons. With these findings, the study provides useful information for the understanding of the relation of soil moisture and remote sensing VIs patterns in relation to bark beetle infestations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research Current Issue","siteHash":"674daa49a10aca976a546578a4b89e6a296c5e7ca75e6f3ff66a7154daf5b0cb","entryHash":"b12cd260aa8701c2ddd07a5eca665f505b1dd73fbc87d217cb724b7a7355edd2","category":"Environment"}
