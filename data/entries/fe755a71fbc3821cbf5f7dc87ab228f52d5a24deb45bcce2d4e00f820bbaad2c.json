{"title":"New Policy Framework for Effective Managing Microplastic in Circular System Form Plastic Product Manufacturing to Waste Treatment Facility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1048/v1","date":1728982620000,"content":"In recent years, concerns regarding the environmental impact of microplastics (MPs) have led to increased international attention on these pollutants. Although initial focus was largely directed toward marine environments, land-based pollution sources, including MP release, has been recognized to directly affect marine ecosystems. Therefore, soil-, atmosphere-, groundwater-, and river-based research is ongoing. However, when considering sources of MP, it is necessary to examine the circular system of plastic in terms of raw materials, production, consumption, discharge, and disposal (recycling). Accordingly, the present study proposes a strategy to effectively manage MPs using this circular system. First, the factors influencing MPs in the circular system were identified, and MPs at the systemâ€™s final stage, i.e., at the waste treatment facility, were subsequently investigated. Using the concept of MP waste (MPW), strategies were then developed for effective MP management within the circular system. Applying the proposed theoretical strategy to the Korean waste management system revealed that the new policy framework improves the current MP management system. Overall, this study provides fundamental data for establishing new or improved MP management schemes from a waste sector perspective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe755a71fbc3821cbf5f7dc87ab228f52d5a24deb45bcce2d4e00f820bbaad2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
