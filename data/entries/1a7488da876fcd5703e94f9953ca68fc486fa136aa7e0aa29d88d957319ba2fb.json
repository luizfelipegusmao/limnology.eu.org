{"title":"Pectin Remodeling and Involvement of AtPME3 in the Parasitic Plant-Plant Interaction Arabidospis thaliana &ndash; Phelipanche ramosa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1259/v1","date":1721095818000,"content":"Phelipanche ramosa is a root parasitic plant fully dependent on host plants for nutrition and development. Once germinated, the parasitic seedling develops inside of the infected roots a specific organ, the haustorium, thanks to notably cell wall degrading enzymes of haustorial intrusive cells and induced modifications in host’s cell walls. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is susceptible to P. ramosa, thus mutants in cell wall metabolism, notably in pectin remodeling like Atpme3-1, are of interest in studying the involvement of cell wall degrading host’s enzymes in establishment of the plant-plant interaction. Host-parasite co-cultures in mini-rhizotrons systems revealed that parasite attachments are twice more numerous and tubercle growth is quicker on Atpme3-1 roots than on WT roots. When compared to the WT, increase in susceptibility in the mutant is associated to reduction in PME activity in roots and to lowering in the degree of pectin methylation at the host-parasite interface, as detected immunohistochemically in infected roots. In addition, both WT and Atpme3-1 responded to infestation by modulations in expression of PAE and PME encoding genes and in global related enzymes activities in roots, before and after parasite attachment. However, modulations differ in WT and Atpme3-1 and this may contribute to different pectin remodeling in roots and contrasted susceptibility to P. ramosa. By this integrative study, we could define a model of the cell wall response to this particular biotic stress and indicate for the first time the role of PME3 in this parasitic plant-plant interaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a7488da876fcd5703e94f9953ca68fc486fa136aa7e0aa29d88d957319ba2fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
