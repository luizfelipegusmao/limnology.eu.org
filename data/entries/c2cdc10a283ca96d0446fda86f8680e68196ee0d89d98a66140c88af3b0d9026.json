{"title":"Investigation and identification of the causes for the unprecedented accident at the &quot;Chaira&quot; Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage Plant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1935/v1","date":1729782906000,"content":"The present study deals with an accident analysis of the “Chaira”- Bulgaria high pressure Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage (PHES), especially the failures of the Francis large scale Hydraulic Unit No. 4 (HU4). The causes of overloading and cracking of the stay vanes and their functionality are investigated. Despite many studies on the behavior of the runner and its safe operation the complete destruction of the system because of the stay vanes failure has not been sufficiently studied and published in the scientific literature. The aim is to assess the reasons that have led to this unprecedented accident of the “Chaira” PHES of total destructions of the stay vanes. Based on the historical data and the operating modes, as well as of the identification of the critical elements an objective assessment of the risks of damage of the stay vanes and of entire unit is proposed. A virtual prototype is built for simulation of the system behavior in working and emergency conditions. The loads, stresses and deformations are precisely calculated. The critical elements of the highly loaded blocks are evaluated. Low cycle material fatigue is with a high degree of confidence the dominated reason for the stay vane complete destruction. The results of the research are used to propose measures for possible rehabilitation and/or replacement of the unit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2cdc10a283ca96d0446fda86f8680e68196ee0d89d98a66140c88af3b0d9026","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
