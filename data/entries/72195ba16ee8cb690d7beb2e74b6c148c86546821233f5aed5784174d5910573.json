Various approaches applicable in scanning electron microscopy of bulk and (scanning) transmission electron microscopy of thin film samples are outlined. Applications to semiconductor quantum well systems, mainly based on indium gallium arsenide and silicon germanium studied in the author's laboratory, are provided as examples.</p>","author":"Thomas Walther","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"72195ba16ee8cb690d7beb2e74b6c148c86546821233f5aed5784174d5910573","category":"Environment"}
