{"title":"Plant-Based Diets and Supplements Reduced COVID-19 Severity and Achieved Zero Mortality in Elderly Patients with Multiple Comorbidities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0100/v1","date":1712020096000,"content":"Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of plant-based diets and supplement interventions in mitigating the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. Observational research suggests that a diet high in plant-based foods may decrease the likelihood and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, several studies have faced criticism regarding the accuracy of obtaining dietary questionnaires and the insufficient intake of essential vitamins and minerals in such diets. To address these issues, this study employed a prospective interventional design that strictly controlled the quality, quantity, and processing of plant-based foods provided. Furthermore, the study incorporated supplementation, which enhanced the anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antithrombotic, and immunomodulatory properties of a plant-based diet against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Of the 3,470 COVID-19 elderly patients, half already followed a plant-based diet, and the other half new patients, both with various comorbidities, were intervened with a plant-based diet and supplementation. The results showed that the participants in the non-plant-based diet group were twice as likely to have experienced moderate disease (with 95% confidence limit: 1.42-3.12) and 2.4 times more likely to have experienced severe disease (with 95% confidence limit: 1.2-5.0) with a significant p-value of less than 0.0005 and 0.016 respectively, compared to those in the PBD group. During the interventions, none of the participants experienced disease progression or hospitalization, and there were no reported deaths by the end of the study. The outcome was highly favorable and aligned with the researchers' expectations, as COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates in Indonesia were among the highest in Asia. This research may provide significant insights into the prevention and management of COVID-19 and aid in better preparation for future pandemics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de153845f8722c7dca985ca0c82f535f303bb568b4d06981b3c83001ad3d249b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
