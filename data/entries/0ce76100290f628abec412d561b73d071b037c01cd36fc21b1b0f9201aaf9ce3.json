Previous research has predominantly focused on substrate-limited rather than recruitment-limited systems, yet given increased use of aquaculture-produced stock to restore marine bivalves, there is a need to understand differences in the survival of hatchery-produced and translocated wild stock. We conducted a systematic review and synthesis of studies that quantified the survival of outplanted marine bivalves.\n\nThe systematic review identified 893 unique stocking events across 111 studies for 29 species across 10 families. Most research has occurred in temperate regions (73%), across four bivalve families (Ostreidae 37%, Pectinidae 20%, Veneridae 16% and Mytilidae 11%). More stockings have outplanted hatchery-produced (66%) than translocated stock (34%).\n\nWe conducted quantitative analyses for five species to determine how stock origin, size at outplant, outplant density, substrate co-deployment, predator exclusion and time since outplant influences survival. Survival consistently decreased through time across all species. Substrate co-deployment, stock origin and size at outplant did not influence survival, while predator exclusion and outplant density affected some species.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Our analyses broadly demonstrate variability in the survival of outplanted bivalves through time, however predicted survival was poor after 2 years (&lt;3%). Generally low survival highlights difficulties associated with conducting scalable restoration in recruitment-limited systems. Based on our findings, using hatchery-produced stock, mitigating predation and outplanting epifaunal bivalves at high densities may increase survival probabilities when outplanting stock for restoration. Further exploration is needed to understand whether use of aquaculture-produced stock results in similar ecosystem structure, function, and service provisioning to natural and restored shellfish reefs in recruitment-limited systems.\n</p>","author":"Kathy Overton, \nTim Dempster, \nStephen E.
