{"title":"Inflammaging: Expanding the Molecular Palette of Cellular Immunophenotype","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0644/v1","date":1712656165000,"content":"Cellular aging is considered as one of the main factors leading to female infertility. The process called “inflammaging”, which was proposed by C. Franceschi in 2014 is characterized by chronic asymptomatic inflammation state resulting to whole body aging and age-associated diseases. In this work the inflammaging model was developed; markers expression associated with SASP (senescence associated secretory phenotype) and cell aging were verified in endometrial cells; the correlation analysis with the known inflammaging markers was done; as well as the age dynamic of markers expression in the groups of young reproductive age and late reproductive age was evaluated. For the first time, the comparative study of the expression of the key signalling molecules involved in the mechanisms of the aging was carried out: IL-6, IL-8, IL-1a, MMP3, SIRT1,6, TERF-1, CALR in endometrial cells in the age aspect and under the influence of the genotoxic stress. The SASP phenotype characterizing the phenomenon of inflammaging can be significantly expanded by the including of the studied molecules - SIRT-1, SIRT-6, TERF, CALR, that we demonstrated for the first time. These signalling molecules may be new therapeutic targets for the age-associated female reproductive system diseases treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2246bff943d06734a16512c2dc79fe538b90d81fbdcdcd6cec9574efb94dd4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
