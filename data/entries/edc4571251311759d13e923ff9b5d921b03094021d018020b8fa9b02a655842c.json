{"title":"AI/ML Technology for Water Treatment in Oil and Gas Industry: A Review Paper","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0248/v1","date":1712153638000,"content":"The opportunities and advantages of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to optimize the process control of wastewater treatment in the Oil and Gas industry are discussed in this work. Discussion is centered around five major points: 1) Various types of Oil and Gas wastewater (Sour, Oily, Produced) and industry standards/methods for treatment, including specific case studies and challenges when treating certain wastewater. This section aims at the common types of wastewater in the Oil and Gas industry and how they are generally treated. 2) How AI/ML has been implemented in wastewater treatment in various industries; summary of which AI/ML languages were used along with a brief overview of how they work. This article focused on an understanding of the specific case studies and AI explanations to understand the effectiveness of wastewater treatment using AI/ML. 3) AI that is currently implemented in Oil and Gas such as personal protective equipment (PPE), smartwatches radiofrequency identification etc. This showed that AI/ML already plays a successful role in the Oil and Gas industry and has proven to help optimize many processes and components. Many of these AI/ML implementations are now industry standards and have greatly benefitted the industry. This section demonstrates that the implementation and the use of AI/ML have been proven to be a successful endeavor and that expanding the role of AI/ML would be beneficial. 5) Using the established points from the previous sections the paper outlines why AI/ML is ideal for Oil and Gas wastewater treatment; this argument centers around fit-for-purpose treatment, and the possible uses of the treated water. A determination of the best-suited AI languages, possible implementation scenarios, and how this would shift the way Oil and Gas industries treat and approach wastewater is presented to the reader.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edc4571251311759d13e923ff9b5d921b03094021d018020b8fa9b02a655842c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
