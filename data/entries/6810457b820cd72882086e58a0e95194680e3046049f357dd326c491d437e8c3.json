{"title":"High Throughput Imaging and Analysis of Intracellular Dynamics with Correlative Label-Free and Fluorescence Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.174/7719545?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Dynamic correlative imaging is needed to understand the interactions among cells, organelles, and molecules which determine their functional state in health and disease. Common trade-offs in microscopy constrain the spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and number of channels that can be acquired from live biological samples before they degrade or change states. Correlative label-free and fluorescence microscopy relaxes some of these constraints as label-free imaging can report on the cell architecture and several landmark organelles, whereas fluorescence imaging can report on finer organelles and molecules. I will discuss two correlative imaging methods for high-content profiling of cells and molecules. miPolScope implements a broadband instant polarization-resolved detector for label-free imaging of the phase and orientation of biomolecules multiplexed with fluorescence imaging of protein localization and anisotropy [<a href=\"#ozae044.174-B1\">1</a>]. Mantis combines remote-refocus label-free microscopy and oblique light-sheet fluorescence microscopy for fast and gentle imaging of multiple samples or biological perturbations [<a href=\"#ozae044.174-B2\">2</a>]. We have developed open-source software for instrument calibration and real-time alignment, automated data acquisition, and distributed data reconstruction [<a href=\"#ozae044.174-B3\">3</a>]. We have further optimized a deep-learning virtual staining pipeline for the prediction of cellular landmarks (e.g. nuclei and cell membrane) from label-free images to enable segmentation and single-cell analysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.174-B4\">4</a>]. Overall, these tools enable scalable image-based longitudinal screens and dissection of specific biological responses to perturbation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6810457b820cd72882086e58a0e95194680e3046049f357dd326c491d437e8c3","category":"Environment"}
