{"title":"Integrating Lean Management and Circular Economy for Sustainable Dentistry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0248/v1","date":1727961680000,"content":"The increasing focus on environmental sustainability has prompted the healthcare sector, including dentistry, to reconsider waste management practices. Dental offices generate various waste streams from outdated technologies, including single-use plastics, hazardous materials, and digital waste. This scoping review explores how integrating circular economy principles with lean management practices can enhance sustainability and operational efficiency in dental clinics. Using the PRISMA methodology, the review identifies 30 articles that passed 1) the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and b) the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist from 2000. Circular economy principles focus on reducing waste and maximizing resource reuse, while lean management seeks to improve efficiency and minimize process waste. Together, these approaches can significantly reduce resource consumption and enhance recycling efforts in dental practices. However, barriers include high costs of sustainable technologies, regulatory challenges, and limited recycling infrastructure. The study also highlights case studies of healthcare and dental clinics successfully implementing these strategies, showing how they can overcome challenges and improve environmental and operational outcomes. Collaboration between dental professionals, policymakers, and industry leaders is essential for promoting the adoption of these sustainable practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05696d956f33b0b2d6691c1e3c059db288af9684827896e26c0c9c45045139af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
