{"title":"Fats influencing flowering: Pistil-derived lipids affect pollen tube growth and fertility in Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/670/7693640?rss=1","date":1718323200000,"content":"<span>In flowering plants, pollen germination and subsequent pollen tube growth is crucial for efficiently transporting nonmotile sperm cells to the egg and facilitating reproduction. These activities are carried out via specific remodeling of membrane systems and lipid metabolism. Successful pollen germination requires substantial quantities of phospholipid to rapidly synthesize and modify membranes during pollen growth and tube elongation. Disturbance of membrane lipids often results in reduced pollen transmission and male fertility (<a href=\"#kiae341-B1\">Ischebeck 2016</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d40f8c1b5b2fdd49be7bb54f374dd97e4c972142c5a7a264e8316f3b5bc01686","category":"Environment"}
