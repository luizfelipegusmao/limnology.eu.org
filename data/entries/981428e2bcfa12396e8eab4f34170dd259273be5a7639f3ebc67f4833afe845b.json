{"title":"Silver Fir (Abies alba Mill.): Review of Ecological Insights, Forest Management Strategies, and Climate Change Impact on European Forests","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1584/v1","date":1713936644000,"content":"The silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is among the most valuable conifers in Europe for ecological and economic reasons. In the course of history, primarily in the 20th century, its share in stands has been declining due to ill-suited management practices, especially clear-cut management, air pollution, and wildlife-induced damage. Based on recent knowledge of fir ecology and population dynamics, small-scale shelterwood and selection management have been introduced in fir stands, which have also stabilized them. Fir is an essential species for maintaining high stability and biodiversity, especially on planosols and in waterlogged habitats. Due to its shade tolerance and environmental flexibility, particularly at higher altitudes, it can coexist very well with many tree species in mixtures, which can increase the productive potential of stands. It can form stands of heterogeneous structure, ranging from single to multi-layer to selection. For its successful natural regeneration, it is essential to reduce cloven-hoofed game and thus prevent bud browsing damage. On the other hand, fir is a species relatively resistant to bark stripping and the spread of secondary rot compared to Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.). During global climate change, fir is expected to shift to higher elevations with sufficient precipitation, while in the southern part of its natural range or at lower elevations, outside water-influenced habitats, it is likely to decline. This paper essentially reviews the description and distribution of the species, its ecological requirements, threats and diseases, habitat and stand conditions, and close-to-nature forest management practices with emphasis on ongoing climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"981428e2bcfa12396e8eab4f34170dd259273be5a7639f3ebc67f4833afe845b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
