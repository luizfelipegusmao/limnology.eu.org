{"title":"Evaluation of growth, antioxidant status, hepatic enzymes and immunity of Nanoselenium-Fed <i>Cirrhinus mrigala</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308761","date":1723471200000,"content":"<p>by Sobia Nisa, Mahroze Fatima, Syed Zakir Hussain Shah, Noor Khan, Beenish Aftab, Wazir Ali, Maryam, Saba Sana, Amber Fatima</p>\r\n\r\nThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of selenium nanoparticle (Se-NP) supplementation on the growth performance, carcass composition, antioxidant status, hepatic enzyme activities, and immunity of <i>Cirrhinus mrigala</i>. For this purpose, fish with an average initial weight of 7.44 ± 0.04 g were fed five experimental diets containing 0 (control), 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Se-NPs diets for 90 days. The analysed selenium (Se) contents of the diets were 0.35, 0.64, 0.92, 1.43, and 2.39 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Twenty five fish were randomly distributed in each of 5 aquarium (36 × 23.7 × 24.3 inches) in triplicate. The results showed that supplementation with Se up to 0.92 mg/kg significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) weight gain, weight gain% (WG%), and specific growth rate (SGR) by 34%, 33%, and 16%, respectively, compared to the control diet. Dietary Se concentrations up to 0.92 mg/kg significantly increased the crude protein and crude fat and reduced (p&lt;0.05) the moisture content as compared to the control group. Fish fed 0.92 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Se had significantly lower malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and higher activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in liver and serum as compared to other experimental diets. Moreover, a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in the level of serum immunoglobulin and lysozyme (LYZ) activity was recorded in fish fed 0.92 mg/kg Se diet. Moreover, the highest (p&lt;0.05) values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were recorded in fish fed 2.39 mg/kg Se level. However, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity remained unaffected by dietary treatment. Broken-line regression analysis indicated that 0.83 mg/kg Se is required for the optimum growth performance of <i>C</i>. <i>mrigala</i>.","author":"Sobia Nisa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5202a9e0624ac0cb1b71699c9768c239144d6691fe14934aa227f4b2908c814e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
