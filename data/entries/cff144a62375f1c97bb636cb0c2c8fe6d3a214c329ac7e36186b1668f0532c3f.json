{"title":"Thermally-induced Moisture Flow in a Silty Sand Under 1D Thermal Gradient","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1996/v1","date":1719569577000,"content":"Thermally-induced moisture flow in unsaturated soils is a complex coupled thermal-hydro process involving moisture flow both in vapor and liquid phases. Thermally-induced moisture flow in unsaturated sands is usually less pronounced than fine soils due to their low field capacity. It is affected by many factors, including soil density, particle size, moisture content, and gravity-induced flow. Besides, soil moisture sensors need to be highly accurate and calibrated for temperature effects in order to monitor the thermally induced moisture flow accurately. A silty sand with 35% non-plastic fines was selected to study the coupled thermo-hydro processes in a closed heat cell. The heat cell consists of two temperature-controlled heat exchanger plates at the top and bottom, heat flux sensors, moisture sensors, thermocouples, and heat conductivity sensors. The soil was prepared at various initial moisture content and tested under a constant 1-D temperature gradient. The soil moisture sensors were first calibrated in the test soil at room temperature and then at elevated temperatures. The soil moisture redistribution, temperature and thermal conductivity profiles were determined. The critical moisture content, corresponding to maximum moisture movement, was also determined. The results offer new insights into coupled moisture-heat flow in unsaturated sands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cff144a62375f1c97bb636cb0c2c8fe6d3a214c329ac7e36186b1668f0532c3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
