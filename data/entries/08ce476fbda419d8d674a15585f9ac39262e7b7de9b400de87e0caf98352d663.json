However, the experimental observations are mostly limited to static rather than dynamic in materials. For further understanding of materials properties, it is inevitable to perform <span>in-situ</span> atomic-resolution observation under controlled conditions such as gas/liquid atmosphere and low/high temperature. Since a STEM image is formed by a raster fashion, the temporal resolution is limited to a few seconds [<a href=\"#ozae044.686-B1\">1</a>]. To significantly improve the temporal resolution in STEM, we developed a high-speed scanning probe system with a frame rate of 25 frames per second (fps) for 512Ã—512 pixels, corresponding to 40 ms per frame [<a href=\"#ozae044.686-B2\">2</a>]. In this study, we will present recent progress and applications using high spatiotemporal resolution STEM imaging at high temperature [<a href=\"#ozae044.686-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.686-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"08ce476fbda419d8d674a15585f9ac39262e7b7de9b400de87e0caf98352d663","category":"Environment"}
