SHG can visualize and structurally interrogate collagen and myosin in tissues. Both collagenous and muscle tissues consist of multilevel hierarchical structures and researchers have focused on using SHG to understand their structure at the tissue level. However, it is beneficial to study both collagen and muscle at their fundamental structural form, individual fibrils, to understand how changes in the ultrastructure of fibrils can affect the arrangement of tissues. Here we investigate collagen and myosin fibrils using the polarization-resolved SHG technique, polarization-in, polarization-out (PIPO) SHG, while using a high numerical aperture (NA) objective in hopes of better understanding the SHG signals observed from collagenous and muscle tissues.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f6f044cedd5f40a2c508f4eed1a9af505fa28937fa67e193a7496e6e1b755171","category":"Environment"}
