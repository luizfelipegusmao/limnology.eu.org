{"title":"Fungal Diversity in the Inhovde Area, East Antarctica","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1884/v1","date":1721813702000,"content":"Antarctica is one of the harshest environments on the planet. Despite this, fungi have been reported in the area for over 150 years. However, no fungi had been reported from the Inhovde area in East Antarctica until now. In this study, we investigated the fungal diversity in the Inhovde area and examined the growth of these fungi at -3°C. We isolated 148 fungal strains from ice and snow samples from the Inhovde area, of which 132 were successfully extracted and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 26S rDNA D1/D2 domain sequence similarity, these strains were classified into 6 genera and 10 species of basidiomycetes and 4 genera and 4 species of ascomycetes. A representative strain from each species was selected and evaluated for its ability to grow at -3°C in amino acid-free and vitamin-free media. All strains investigated in this study were able to grow at -3°C in both amino acid-free and vita-min-free media. These results indicate that the fungi in the Inhovde area are well adapted to the oligotrophic environment of Antarctica and play an important role in nutrient cycling at near-freezing temperatures in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19ebab0cb98ec60ca5030ca1cdb8b474932ea3fc66be786c87b9000854bb430d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
