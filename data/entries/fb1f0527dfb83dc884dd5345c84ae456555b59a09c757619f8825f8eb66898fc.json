{"title":"HIV, HCV and HIV-HCV Coinfections in General Population versus Inmates from Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0725/v1","date":1720591409000,"content":"The objective of this study was to analyze the epidemiological links of HIV, HCV and HIV-HCV coinfections to less studied types of transmission in certain populations. We performed an observational, prospective study on 903 patients aged between 15-87 years who took part in the Open Test Project. They were divided into two subgroups: general population and individuals from prisons, and questioned about multiple risk factors. Chi-Square Independence Test was used to establish correlations between the risk factors and the results of the screening tests. Logistic regression was used to calculate the probability of a reactive screening test based on each independent risk factor and age. HIV was very strongly associated with unprotected sexual intercourse with HIV-positive partners (the strongest association), unprotected sexual intercourse with sex workers, newly diagnosed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), intravenous drug use (IDUs) and sharing injecting materials. In the case of HCV reactive tests, very strong associations have been established with injecting drug use (the strongest association), unprotected sexual intercourse with IDUs and sharing injecting materials. Our study indicates the need for implementing targeted public health programs, tailored to the local epidemiology that can ultimately lead to micro-elimination of hepatitis and HIV infections in this area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb1f0527dfb83dc884dd5345c84ae456555b59a09c757619f8825f8eb66898fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
