{"title":"Coopetition Networks for SMEs: A Lifecycle Model Grounded in Service-Dominant Logic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0349/v1","date":1728067781000,"content":"Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in the European economy, yet their ability to sustain coopetition networks—collaborative arrangements between competitors—remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by developing a reference model and an instantiation methodology for coopetition networks explicitly tailored to the needs of SMEs, grounded in the Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic framework. The reference model provides a structured approach for SMEs to coopetition throughout their entire lifecycle, from initiation to dissolution, focusing on value co-creation and resource exchange. To validate the model, a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) was conducted in the Portuguese ornamental stone sector, demonstrating significant improvements in manufacturing effectiveness and confirming the model’s practical applicability. The findings highlight the potential of coopetition networks to enhance the competitiveness and performance of SMEs. While the reference model successfully addresses key challenges SMEs face, the study acknowledges certain limitations. It suggests areas for further research, particularly regarding the long-term sustainability of these networks and the role of interpersonal dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7aa46a7f8afa53181919456dcaf8563873bfdd2160b02c818b688927a8e7437","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
