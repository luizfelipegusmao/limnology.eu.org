The working conditions and reaction mechanism of the ozone-catalyzed oxidation by Ni-Mn@KL were systematically studied. Then, a comprehensive CRITIC weighting–coupling coordination evaluation model was established. Ni-Mn@KL was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, BET, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectrometry, and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and found to have large specific surface area and homogeneous surface dispersion of striped particles. Under the optimum working conditions with an initial pH of 7.9 (raw water), a reaction height-to-diameter ratio of 10:1, an ozone-aeration intensity of 0.3 L/min, and a catalyst filling rate of 10%, the maximum COD removal rate was 60.5%. Free-radical quenching experiments showed that OH oxidation played a dominant role in the Ni-Mn@KL-catalyzed ozone-oxidation system, and the reaction system conformed to the second-order reaction kinetics law. Ni-Mn@KL catalysts were further confirmed to have good catalytic performance and mechanical performance after repeated utilization.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nNi-Mn@KL catalyst can achieve effective treatment of RO film concentrated liquid.\nHigh COD removal rate of RO membrane concentrated liquid was obtained at low cost.\nNi-Mn@KL catalyst promotes ozone decomposition to produce ·OH and O<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>· oxidized organic matter.\nThe Ni-Mn@KL catalyst can maintain good stability after repeated use.\nA CRITIC weight–coupling coordination model was established to evaluate the catalytic ozonation.\n</p>","author":"Wenquan Sun, \nYueqian Cheng, \nZhiqiang Xiao, \nJun Zhou, \nKinjal J.
