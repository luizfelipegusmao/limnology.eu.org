{"title":"Impact of Heat and Pressure Processing Treatments on Digestibility of Peanut, Hazelnut, Pistachio and Cashew Allergens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1270/v1","date":1729068356000,"content":"Food processing can modify protein biochemical properties altering its immunoreactivity and allergenicity. Resistance to enzymatic digestion is one of the main characteristics of food allergens, specially to pepsin and trypsin. In this work, the aim is to compare the digestomes of raw and heat and /or pressured treated peanuts, hazelnut, pistachio and cashew resulting from the INFOGEST harmonized digestion protocol, as well as the different behaviour regarding IgE-binding capacity, by means of in vitro analysis. Protein patterns, resolved by SDS-PAGE, were assayed with sera from allergic patients and confirmed by competitive ELISA in hazelnut and peanut. The results of our study reveal that different processing methods affect differently gastrointestinal (GI) digestion of peanut, hazelnut, pistachio and cashew allergens. Simulated GI digestion led to extensive de-struction of the protein structure, reducing but not abolishing the IgE reactivity of peanut, ha-zelnut, pistachio and cashew allergenic proteins. Boiling for 60 minutes did not affect the protein profile of these nuts, although enzymatic activity was stimulated, decreasing the IgE binding capacity. When heat and pressure was applied to these nuts, simulated digestion promoted an almost complete inhibition of the allergenic potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcbc1f22f281d7b14d69bdf0f2c4f0856b44d4a7e1579a65c9ff6ae4f830b60d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
