{"title":"Ecology of Nepenthes on Mount Talang, West Sumatra, Indonesia","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42965-024-00333-0","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Gunung (Mount) Talang is an active volcano in West Sumatra that has a number of <em>Nepenthes</em> species, including the endemic <em>N. talangensis</em>, but their ecology has been little been studied. This study found five species of <em>Nepenthes</em> growing in the protected forest area of Gunung Talang, namely <em>N. bongso</em>, <em>N. inermis</em>, <em>N. pectinata</em>, <em>N. spathulata</em> and <em>N. talangensis</em>. The population of <em>N. talangensis</em> is very small (23 individuals) and it grows sympatrically with <em>N. bongso</em> and <em>N. inermis</em> forming natural hybrids. <em>Lithocarpus conocarpus</em>, <em>Camellia lanceolata</em>, <em>Syzygium acuminatissimum</em>, <em>Adinandra dumosa</em> and <em>Dehaasia</em> sp. are the five most dominant tree species found in the <em>Nepenthes</em> habitat, while <em>L. conocarpus</em> and <em>Podocarpus neriifolius</em> had strong positive associations with <em>N. talangensis</em>. Growth rates of the five <em>Nepenthes</em> species were not significantly different, neither were foliar nitrogen (mean = 1.14%) or phosphorus concentrations (mean = 0.11%). We suggest that <em>N. talangensis</em> should be considered as Critically Endangered and outline some possible conservation actions.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"0ddbf4442e3205974b29ca6a305b6dfae7ec31085e2a8358eb5cf187cedf007f","category":"Environment"}
