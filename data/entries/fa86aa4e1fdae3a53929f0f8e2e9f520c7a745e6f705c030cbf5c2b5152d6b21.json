{"title":"Innovation in Skills and Sustainable Development in Italian Upper Secondary Technical Education and the Professional Role of Construction, Environment, and Territory Technicians","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2316/v1","date":1722291298000,"content":"This study explores innovation and sustainability within the Construction, Environment, and Territory (CAT) curriculum in Italian Upper Secondary Schools. It begins with an overview of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and its integration at various educational levels, focusing on technical/vocational curricula in Upper Secondary Education. The study examines the evolution of the technician's role, the CAT pathway in the Italian educational system, and comparisons with other European contexts. It analyzes the alignment between skills developed during the CAT course and the professional competencies required by the community and job market. A survey conducted among recent graduates and companies involved in the Pathways for Transversal Skills and Orientation (PCTO) at a CAT-focused school reveals significant training and professional needs related to Sustainable Development. To address these needs, the study proposes integrating ministerial programs in professional disciplines such as Topography, Building and Technological Systems Design, and Geopedology, Economics, and Appraisal, with new modules dedicated to Sustainable Development. These modules are to be integrated into the last three years of the course, utilizing the autonomy and flexibility in curricular planning per-mitted by current regulations. Additionally, the proposal includes actions to redistribute existing educational modules within ministerial programs without increasing teaching hours. An initial step in updating professional discipline programs involves implementing a cross-disciplinary educational path within Civic Education, focusing on Sustainable Mobility. The investigation, evaluation, and educational design process presented in this study aims to serve as a model for swiftly implementing structured curriculum reforms, emphasizing educational innovation and comprehensive student preparation to meet emerging social and professional needs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa86aa4e1fdae3a53929f0f8e2e9f520c7a745e6f705c030cbf5c2b5152d6b21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
