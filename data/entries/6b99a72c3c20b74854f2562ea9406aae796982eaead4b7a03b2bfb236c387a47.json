Although each use case has its own relative performance criteria there is an overall need to increase charge and power density, cell cycle lifetime and safety while continuing to decrease cost per cell. For NMC cathodes particle size and material consistency has a large impact on final cell performance. Material inconsistencies decrease lifetime and can even result in catastrophic failure. Rapidly determining consistency while performing detailed characterisation of identified irregularities enables significant improvements in the next generation of materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6b99a72c3c20b74854f2562ea9406aae796982eaead4b7a03b2bfb236c387a47","category":"Environment"}
