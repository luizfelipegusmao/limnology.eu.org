We trialled 19 plant species and collected observational data on plant-insect visitors, plant survival in the orchard environment and potential risks to crops and the environment. We used this framework to identify plants suitable to incorporate into blueberry cropping systems.\n\n<i>Practical implication</i>: Our framework ensured plant choice based on informed decisions and allowed the selection of two plant species that aligned well with industry needs. Different plants may be optimal for different conservation aims, hence plants selected need ideally to be evaluated for their use by the flower-visiting taxa, as well as align with industry growing practices and needs.\n</p>","author":"Ulrika Samnegård, \nJeremy Jones, \nKaren C.
