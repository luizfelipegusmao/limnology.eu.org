Salinity fluctuates substantially in coastal marine environments due to natural and anthropogenic factors, yet there is limited research on how salinity affects DOC release by ecologically important macroalgae. Here we determined the effect of short-term salinity changes on rates of DOC release by the habitat-forming fucalean seaweed <i>Sargassum fallax</i> (Ochrophyta). Lateral branches (~4 g) cut at the axes of mature individuals were incubated across a salinity gradient (4–46) for 24 h under a 12:12 light:dark cycle, and seawater was sampled for DOC at 0, 12, and 24 h. Physiological assays (tissue water content, net photosynthesis, respiration, tissue carbon, and nitrogen content) were undertaken at the end of the 24-h experiment. Dissolved organic carbon release increased with decreasing salinity while net photosynthesis decreased. Dissolved organic carbon release rates at the lowest salinity tested (4) were ~3.3 times greater in the light than in the dark, indicating two potential DOC release mechanisms: light-mediated active exudation and passive release linked to osmotic stress. Tissue water content decreased with increasing salinity. These results demonstrate that hyposalinity stress alters the osmotic status of <i>S. fallax</i>, reducing photosynthesis and increasing DOC release. This has important implications for understanding how salinity conditions encountered by macroalgae may affect their contribution to the coastal ocean carbon cycle.</p>","author":"Eloise Bennett, \nEllie R.
