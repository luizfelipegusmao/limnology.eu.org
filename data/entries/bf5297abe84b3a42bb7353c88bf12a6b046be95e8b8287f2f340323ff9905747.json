{"title":"PSVI-25 The benefits of probiotics (L. plantarum and L. acidophilus) supplement in growth, nutrient absorption, gas emission, and gut microbiome diversity in weaning pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/709/7757641?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Antibiotics are widely used as growth promoters (AGPs) in livestock production to improve animal performance and health. However, pig producers today face the prohibition of in-feed antimicrobials and have to find safe and effective alternatives. <span>Lactobacillus</span> species are active microorganisms that convey multiple beneficial effects to the host and are one of the most promising AGPs replacements. Herein, we aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of <span>Lactobacillus spp.</span> (<span>L. plantarum</span> and <span>L. acidophilus</span>) supplementation on growth, nutrient absorption, gas emission, and gut microbiota diversity in weaning pigs. Weaning pigs (n = 160) were randomly allocated into four groups and allowed to be fed four different diets. The test treatments were basal diet (TRT1), basal + 0.25% antibiotic (TRT2), basal + 0.1% probiotics (TRT3), and basal + 0.2% probiotics (TRT4). Our results demonstrated that the inclusion of 0.2% <span>Lactobacillus spp.</span> supplementation significantly improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the growth performance and blood lymphocytes and reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) fecal ammonia and hydrogen sulfide emission. In microbiome analysis, Shannon index, Simpson index, and Bray-Curtis showed that probiotics enhanced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) microbial richness and diversity, indicating a unique microbial profile induced by probiotic supplementation. In conclusion, our findings provide concrete evidence of the growth-promoting effects of <span>Lactobacillus spp.</span> supplementation in piglets and a better understanding of the potential of <span>Lactobacillus</span>-based probiotics as AGPs alternatives in pig production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"bf5297abe84b3a42bb7353c88bf12a6b046be95e8b8287f2f340323ff9905747","category":"Environment"}
