{"title":"Patient Outcomes at 5 and 10 Years After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage II and III Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0810/v1","date":1718267867000,"content":"Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer offers the possibility to facilitate breast and axillary surgery, it is a test of chemosensibility in vivo with significant prognostic value and may tailor adjuvant treatment according to response. Material and Methods: a retrospective single institution of 482 stage II and III breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on anthracycline and taxans plus antiHEr2 in those Her2 positive cases. Survival was calculated at 5 and 10 years. Kaplan Meier with log rank test were calculated for difference according to TNM, pathological and molecular surrogated subtype, TILs cut-off 20%, response to chemotherapy and the presence of vascular invasion. Results: In the univariate those factors that influenced long-term patient outcome were TNM (p=0.000); pathologic subtype (p=0.003); Tils cut off 20%; achieving pCR (p=0.000), RCB (p=0.000) and vascular invasion (p=0.000). After a mean follow up of 126 months, Luminal tumors presented a substantial difference of survival rates calculated at 5 or 10 years (81.2% compared to 74.7%) whereas for TNBC was 75.3 and 73.5, respectively. The greatest difference was seen according to response those patients with pCR presented a 10yDDFS of 95.5 vs 72.4% for those patients without pCR. This difference was especially meaningful in TNBC were 10y DDFS according to the RCB 0 to 3 was 100%, 80.6%, 69% and 49.2% respectively. Patients with a special bad prognosis in our series were lobular carcinomas with 10y DDFS of 42.9% vs 79.7%, p= 0.001 for ductal carcinomas; and those patients with vascular invasion at the surgical specimen with a 10yDDFS of 59.2% vs 83.6, p=0.,000 for those patients without vascular invasion. Conclusion:  long-term outcomes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can help patient and clinician make well-informed decisions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"133e3544b5f2006f3b27dcb967972db5e81d98ca4b566371d13f842fd00c2996","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
