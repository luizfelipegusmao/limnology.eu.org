{"title":"Recent Advances of 5G Technology Based on Patch Antenna: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0701/v1","date":1715343375000,"content":"For their speed in data processing, low heights and cheapness, patch antennas are important to 5G networks. While there have been improvements in the area of bandwidth and size reduction; however, there are still problems that need to be fixed with regards achieving high data rates as well as wideband operation and compact sizes for 5G applications. In the coming years researchers should concentrate on materials optimization and feeding methods so that they can work efficiently at shorter wavelengths for next-generation systems while still covering all necessary bands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37a0274cef12de1b65b700222917898e1ab50b20f6d0cf0f4eeb79bce02cd34c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
