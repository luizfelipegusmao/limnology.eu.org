{"title":"Comparison of Chest Ct Findings and Pulmonary Function Tests in Non-symptomatic Children with Rheumatic Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1591/v1","date":1724248851000,"content":"Lung involvement in rheumatic diseases is a major determinant of patient morbidity and mortality; however, its diagnosis depends on the detection methods used. We compared the incidence of pulmonary involvement in newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients with rheumatic diseases, as assessed by pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). This retrospective study reviewed the symptoms, spirometry results, and HRCT scans of 22 newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients and age-matched controls from the University General Hospital “Attikon”, Athens, Greece, between January 2021 and December 2023. Correlations between clinical findings and spirometry parameters were tested. HRCT scans revealed lung abnormalities in all patients, including peribronchial wall thickening (61.5%), ground glass opacities (59.1%), parenchymal bands (54.5%), air-trapping (50%), reticular patterns (45.5%), bronchiectatic changes (40.9%), and parenchymal opacities (31.8%). PFTs, performed in 17/22 (77.3%) patients, revealed definite pathology in 5 patients (restrictive: N=4; obstructive: N=1). No association was found between spirometric indices and clinical parameters. The results indicate a higher prevalence of abnormal chest CT than of PFT abnormalities, suggesting that HRCT is more sensitive in detecting early lung involvement in pediatric patients with rheumatic disease and should be considered in the routine evaluation of these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a018386e0e22d2d7b85b4c2fdcb4b719f76b9b84b14e83f82dab3d59ef70be9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
