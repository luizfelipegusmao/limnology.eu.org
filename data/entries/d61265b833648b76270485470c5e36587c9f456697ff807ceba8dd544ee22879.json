{"title":"Transcatheter Mitral Valve Intervention: Current and Future Role of Multimodality Imaging for Device Selection and Periprocedural Guidance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0726/v1","date":1718106759000,"content":"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a broadly diffuse valvular heart disease (VHD) with a significant impact on healthcare system and patient’s prognosis. Transcatheter mitral valve interventions (TMVI) are now well-established techniques included in the therapeutic armamentarium for managing patients with mitral regurgitation, either primary or functional MR. Even if guidelines give indications regarding the correct management of this VHD, the wide heterogeneity of patient’s clinical background, valvular and heart’s anatomy make each patient a unique case, in which the appropriate device’s selection requires a multimodality imaging evaluation and a multidisciplinary discussion. Proper pre-procedural evaluation plays a pivotal role to judge the feasibility of TMVI, as well as a cooperative works between imagers and interventionalist is crucial for procedural success. This manuscript aims to provide an exhaustive overview of the main parameters that need to be evaluated for appropriate device selection, pre-procedural planning, intraprocedural guidance and post-operative assessment in the setting of TMVI. In addition, it tries to give some insights about next perspective of structural cardiovascular imaging.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d61265b833648b76270485470c5e36587c9f456697ff807ceba8dd544ee22879","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
