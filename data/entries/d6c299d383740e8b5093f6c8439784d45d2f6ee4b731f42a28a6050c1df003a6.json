Emerging evidence link excessive accumulation of bioactive lipids such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide (Cer), with impairment of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. Until recently, little has been known about the involvement of long-chain acyl-CoAs synthetases in the above mechanism. To examine possible role of long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 1 (Acsl1) (a major muscular ACSL isoform) in mediating HFD-induced IR we locally silenced Acsl1 in gastrocnemius of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice through electroporation-delivered shRNA and compared it to non-silenced tissue within the same animal. Acsl1 down-regulation decreased the content of muscular long-chain acyl-CoA (LCACoA) and both the Cer (C18:1-Cer and C24:1-Cer) and DAG (C16:0/18:0-DAG, C16:0/18:2-DAG, C18:0/18:0-DAG) and simultaneously improved insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake as compared with non-silenced tissue. Acsl1 down-regulation decreased expression of mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes, and the content of both the short-chain acylcarnitine (SCA-Car) and short-chain acyl-CoA (SCACoA) in muscle, pointing towards reduction of mitochondrial FA oxidation. The results indicate, that beneficial effects of Acsl1 partial ablation on muscular insulin sensitivity are connected with inhibition of Cer and DAG accumulation, and outweigh detrimental impact of decreased mitochondrial fatty acids metabolism in skeletal muscle of obese HFD-fed mice.","author":"Kamila Roszczyc-Owsiejczuk","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d6c299d383740e8b5093f6c8439784d45d2f6ee4b731f42a28a6050c1df003a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
