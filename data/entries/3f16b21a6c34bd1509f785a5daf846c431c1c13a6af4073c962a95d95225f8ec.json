Visualizing individual defect sites using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) could provide great insight into the structure-property relationships of quantum materials, particularly at vdW heterointerfaces. However, while STEM enables sub-Ã…ngstrom resolution imaging in two dimensions, it remains a major challenge to determine the three-dimensional locations of point defects at the buried interfaces of twisted 2D heterostructures. Firstly, the light-element composition of many vdW heterostructures is limited by poor imaging sensitivity of existing techniques such as annular dark-field (ADF-) STEM. Furthermore, probing these vertical interfaces requires high resolution parallel to the electron beam, which is currently limited by poor axial depth resolution limits (5-10 nm) and strict alignment requirements of electron tomography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3f16b21a6c34bd1509f785a5daf846c431c1c13a6af4073c962a95d95225f8ec","category":"Environment"}
