{"title":"Stem-cell-expressed DEVIL-like small peptides maintain root growth under abiotic stress via abscisic acid signaling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2372/7473178?rss=1","date":1702512000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Stem cells are essential to plant growth and development. Through data mining, we identified five <span>DEVIL-like</span> (<span>DVL</span>) small peptide genes that are preferentially expressed in the quiescent center of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) root but whose functions are unknown. When overexpressed, these genes caused a dramatic decrease in root length and pleiotropic phenotypes in the shoot. No root-growth defect was observed in the single-gene mutants, but the quintuple mutant exhibited slightly longer roots than the wild type (WT). Through transcriptome analysis with <span>DVL20</span>-overexpressing plants, we found that many genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling were regulated by these peptides. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrated that, relative to the WT, <span>DVL20</span>-overexpressing plants were more tolerant whereas the quintuple mutant was more sensitive to ABA. Using RT-qPCR, we showed that ABA signaling-associated genes were affected in an opposite manner when the plants were grown in normal or ABA-containing medium. Strikingly, ectopic expression of ABA signaling genes such as <span>PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1-LIKE</span> (<span>PYL</span>) <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, or <span>6</span> or suppression of <span>HIGHLY ABA-INDUCED 2</span> (<span>HAI2</span>) and <span>MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE KINASE</span> 18 (<span>MAPKKK18</span>) not only largely rescued the root growth defects in <span>DVL20</span>-overexpressing plants in normal growth condition but also conferred tolerance to ABA. Based on these results, we propose that <span>DVL1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>8</span> and <span>20</span> function redundantly in root stem-cell maintenance under abiotic stress, and this role is achieved via ABA signaling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0facf86c4a01a049feeb316b7f316772d27fa8a3bec448e87855e1a8d8738e54","category":"Environment"}
