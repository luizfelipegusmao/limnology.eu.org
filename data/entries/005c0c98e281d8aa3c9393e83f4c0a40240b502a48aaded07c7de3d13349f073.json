{"title":"Long-term dynamics, population structure and connectivity of the helmet jellyfish Periphylla periphylla in a Norwegian fjord and adjacent waters","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/1/59/7455231?rss=1","date":1701216000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mass occurrences of <span>Periphylla periphylla</span> in Norwegian fjords cause major concerns related to potential regime shifts that could affect ecosystem stability. 15 years of trawl data (2006–2015), complemented with comprehensive sampling in different areas and seasons (2018–2021) allowed new insights on the dynamics, structure and connectivity of <span>P. periphylla</span> populations within and beyond Trondheimsfjorden. Despite assumed population bursts, no clear trend on <span>P. periphylla</span> population size in Trondheimsfjorden were identified. Sampling frequency and population size suggest a local reproduction of <span>P. periphylla</span>, especially in the inner part of the fjord where young-of-the-year (YOY) individuals occur. Size variations occurred in relation to sampling month, thus pointing at seasonal patterns in growth and reproduction. No distinct population structure of <span>P. periphylla</span> populations within Trondheimsfjorden and over larger spatial scales (&gt; 100 km) along the Norwegian coast was observed. Such poor geographic population structure provides evidence for a strong dispersal of <span>P. periphylla,</span> potentially triggered by frequent deep-water renewals of the fjords’ basins that enable a high gene flow. Data on <span>P. periphylla</span> long-term dynamics, population structure and connectivity provide valuable information for ecosystem state assessments and enable the advancement of ecosystem management approaches, thus accounting for both stakeholder and ecosystem demands.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"005c0c98e281d8aa3c9393e83f4c0a40240b502a48aaded07c7de3d13349f073","category":"Environment"}
