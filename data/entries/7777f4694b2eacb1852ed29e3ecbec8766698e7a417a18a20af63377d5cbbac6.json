{"title":"Strategic Healthcare Workforce Planning in Light of Healthcare Inequalities: A Comparative Analysis of Workforce Planning Policy in Israel and Comparable OECD Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0066/v1","date":1717405335000,"content":"There is a need for strategic healthcare workforce planning to address shortages and ensure universal health coverage, aiming to optimize work-force per population ratio, distribution, and competencies. Amidst rising demands exacerbated by aging populations and events like the COVID-19 pandemic, strategic workforce planning becomes crucial for addressing healthcare inequalities by forecasting needs, bridging skill gaps, and adapting to changing demographics and care models. Israel has invested in strategic planning to tackle healthcare workforce challenges; however, globally there is insufficient planning informed by health labor market analysis, which hinders efforts to address healthcare inequalities. The paper reviews national policies in Israel, Australia, Germany, and Norway, ex-amining statistics and government publications to highlight strategic plan-ning considerations and address challenges in healthcare workforce plan-ning. This paper focuses both on the critical role of physicians in healthcare systems, and on the changing borders between healthcare professions and different national contexts which demand more context dependent strategic workforce planning. We highlight common themes among national policies, including the need for data collection, increasing the capacity of domestic training programs, and the need to address geographic maldistribution of physicians. Ultimately, we aim to guide policy in the development of a re-silient and sustainable healthcare workforce capable of meeting diverse community needs and promoting equity in healthcare services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7777f4694b2eacb1852ed29e3ecbec8766698e7a417a18a20af63377d5cbbac6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
