Escapee plants were observed along the Orange River between Komsberg and Sendelingsdrift in southern Namibia and have insidiously invaded the riparian habitat without notice. It is viewed as a native–alien population and may detrimentally affect the local riparian ecology, therefore recommended that eradication be implemented immediately.</p>","author":"Peter Low Cunningham Sr, \nPeter Low Cunningham Jr","siteTitle":"Wiley: African Journal of Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0a8ec0da97c05188d45f40eaa6dd19ed9528e14fad92d29cce59e67ce4030364","entryHash":"78dda0e07dc619e551d1ec5341187885d9b2159a7749bea132a99da5ad5721ff","category":"Environment"}
