{"title":"Dosage sensitivity shapes balanced expression and gene longevity of homoeologs after whole-genome duplications in angiosperms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4323/7731081?rss=1","date":1723161600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Following whole-genome duplication (WGD), duplicate gene pairs (homoeologs) can evolve varying degrees of expression divergence. However, the determinants influencing these relative expression level differences (<span>R</span><sub>FPKM</sub>) between homoeologs remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed the <span>R</span><sub>FPKM</sub> between homoeologs in 3 angiosperms, <span>Nymphaea colorata</span>, <span>Nelumbo nucifera</span>, and <span>Acorus tatarinowii</span>, all having undergone a single WGD since the origin of angiosperms. Our results show significant positive correlations in <span>R</span><sub>FPKM</sub> of homoeologs among tissues within the same species, and among orthologs across these 3 species, indicating convergent expression balance/bias between homoeologous gene copies following independent WGDs. We linked <span>R</span><sub>FPKM</sub> between homoeologs to gene attributes associated with dosage-balance constraints, such as proteinâ€“protein interactions, lethal-phenotype scores in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) orthologs, domain numbers, and expression breadth. Notably, homoeologs with lower <span>R</span><sub>FPKM</sub> often had more interactions and higher lethal-phenotype scores, indicating selective pressures favoring balanced expression. Also, homoeologs with lower <span>R</span><sub>FPKM</sub> were more likely to be retained after WGDs in angiosperms. Within <span>Nelumbo</span>, greater <span>R</span><sub>FPKM</sub> between homoeologs correlated with increased <span>cis</span>- and <span>trans</span>-regulatory differentiation between species, highlighting the ongoing escalation of gene expression divergence. We further found that expression degeneration in 1 copy of homoeologs is inclined toward nonfunctionalization. Our research highlights the importance of balanced expression, shaped by dosage-balance constraints, in the evolutionary retention of homoeologs in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"941885dbb3af5aa44eed2975527a8ed6548b05ac96a497d91c6b37bb06f6882b","category":"Environment"}
