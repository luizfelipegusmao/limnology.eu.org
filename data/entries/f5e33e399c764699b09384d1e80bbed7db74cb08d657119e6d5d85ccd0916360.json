We found that the interest in molecular applications increased over time more rapidly than other approaches in aquatic macrophyte studies. The Neotropics, Indo-Malaysian, Australasia, and Afrotropical regions have a low publication rate on macrophytes' studied by molecular methods compared to the Palearctic and Nearctic regions. The gene regions of cpDNA and nrDNA were the most prominent, with the ITS being the most used. However, unusual markers for plants, such as mtDNA, were also detected. We found that 636 species of macrophytes received some study employing molecular techniques, representing 18% of the known aquatic macrophyte species on the planet. Therefore, there is still much to be explored about the genetic diversity of the world's aquatic flora, especially in the Neotropics, which has the highest diversity of macrophytes, and whose molecular techniques can help identify more species and elucidate the evolutionary history of this taxonomic group.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"f5e33e399c764699b09384d1e80bbed7db74cb08d657119e6d5d85ccd0916360","category":"Environment"}
