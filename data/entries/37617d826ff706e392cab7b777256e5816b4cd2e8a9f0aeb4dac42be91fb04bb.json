{"title":"Impact of COVID-19 vaccination on liver transplant recipients. Experience in a reference center in Mexico","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301198","date":1711634400000,"content":"<p>by Daniel Azamar-Llamas, Josealberto Sebastiano Arenas-Martinez, Antonio Olivas-Martinez, Jose Victor Jimenez, Eric Kauffman-Ortega, Cristian J García-Carrera, Bruno Papacristofilou-Riebeling, Fabián E Rivera-López, Ignacio García-Juárez</p>\r\nBackground and aims <p>COVID-19 vaccination has proved to be effective to prevent symptomatic infection and severe disease even in immunocompromised patients including liver transplant patients. We aim to assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the mortality and development of severe and critical disease in our center.</p> Methods <p>A retrospective cohort study of LT patients in a reference center between March 2020 and February 2022. Demographic data, cirrhosis etiology, time on liver transplantation, immunosuppressive therapies, and vaccination status were recorded at the time of diagnosis. Primary outcome was death due to COVID-19, and secondary outcomes included the development of severe COVID-19 and intensive care unit (ICU) requirement.</p> Results <p>153 of 324 LT recipients developed COVID-19, in whom the main causes of cirrhosis were HCV infection and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease. The vaccines used were BNT162b2 (48.6%), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (21.6%), mRNA-1273 vaccine (1.4%), Sputnik V (14.9%), Ad5-nCoV-S (4.1%) and CoronaVac (9.5%). Case fatality and ICU requirement risk were similar among vaccinated and unvaccinated LT patients (adjusted relative case fatality for vaccinated versus unvaccinated of 0.68, 95% CI 0.14–3.24, p = 0.62; adjusted relative risk [aRR] for ICU requirement of 0.45, 95% CI 0.11–1.88, p = 0.27). Nonetheless, vaccination was associated with a lower risk of severe disease (aRR for severe disease of 0.32, 95% CI 0.14–0.71, p = 0.005).</p> Conclusions <p>Vaccination reduces the risk of severe COVID-19 in LT patients, regardless of the scheme used. Vaccination should be encouraged for all.</p>","author":"Daniel Azamar-Llamas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"37617d826ff706e392cab7b777256e5816b4cd2e8a9f0aeb4dac42be91fb04bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
