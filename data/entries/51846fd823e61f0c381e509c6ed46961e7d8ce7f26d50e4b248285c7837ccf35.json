{"title":"Evaluating User Satisfaction in an Academic Events Bot Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1922/v1","date":1721806266000,"content":"This study investigates the implementation and evaluation of a university bot designed to improve communication and management of academic events in educational environments. With the rapid evolution of digital technology, bots have emerged as powerful tools with applications in various sectors such as e-commerce, education, and healthcare. In particular, the use of bots in customer service and event management has demonstrated significant benefits by handling frequent inquiries, providing real-time information and assisting with administrative tasks, freeing up human resources for more strategic functions.  This project adopted a mixed methodological approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods to assess usability and user satisfaction with the bot. The Usability Scale System (SUS) and the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) were used as standard tools to collect data on user perception. The results highlighted a high acceptance of the bot, with an acceptance rate of 90\\%, indicating high user interest in using the application. This high acceptance underscores the bot's ability to effectively present the information users are looking for. The bot provides a list of academic events categorized by type, making it easy to find and manage information about grants, conferences, courses and other events. Its design focuses on a friendly and accessible interface that allows direct consultation without the need for conversational interaction.  This project contributes to operational optimization in educational environments by providing a practical solution for the management of academic events and offers valuable insights on how to efficiently present information in similar applications. These findings are fundamental for future research and development in the creation of information systems in the educational environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51846fd823e61f0c381e509c6ed46961e7d8ce7f26d50e4b248285c7837ccf35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
