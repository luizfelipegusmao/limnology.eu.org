{"title":"Bacteriocins, Underestimated Antimicrobials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2018/v1","date":1717050659000,"content":"Bacteriocins is a term given to products of the secondary metabolism of many bacterial genera described today with antimicrobial activity. Although there are several biomolecules with such activity, even today it has not been possible to reach a consensus on the method of classification for these biomolecules. In addition, many of them are not authorized for therapeutic use against multi-drug resistant microorganisms due to possible toxic effects. However, recent research has achieved significant progress in their understanding, classification, and elucidation of the mechanisms of action against microorganisms of medical and biotechnological interest. Therefore, in more recent times, protocols are already being carried out for their optimal use and applications to use them on the hopes of solving multiple health and food conservation problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3343d11563e254168d38a33b29ed8b5e98a7a861175fec3f15e1cc4a834cc45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
