{"title":"Co‐pyrolysis of cypress sawdust and green algae over Ni/ZrO2 catalyst: Syngas yield and carbon emission","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14441?af=R","date":1717945996000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In order to promote syngas yield and reduce carbon emission, Ni loaded ZrO<sub>2</sub> (Ni/ZrO<sub>2</sub>) catalysts were prepared for the co-pyrolysis of cypress sawdust and green algae in a two stage fixed bed reactor. The syngas yield, syngas component, and carbon emission were investigated. The results showed that Ni/ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst could obviously increase the combustible gas component in syngas. H<sub>2</sub> content was increased from 7.5% (single component) and 8.12% (co-pyrolysis) to 16.56% (catalytic pyrolysis). CO content was also increased from 19.62% (single component) and 19.46% (co-pyrolysis) to 25.94% (catalytic pyrolysis). However the catalyst had a little effect on the syngas yield compared with single component pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis. The pyrolysis temperature could make great influence on the carbon emission. The carbon emission reduction was increased from 33.32 to 234.25 g CO<sub>2</sub> and from 105.94 to 369.23 g CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively for green algae and cypress sawdust.</p>","author":"Ziliang Wan, \nWei Sun, \nLongjin Tian, \nGuozhi Fan, \nCheng Pan, \nQunpeng Cheng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"e401ed4f361ea3b1458f75b02902b43a93cf28a223f32759284ae0c5a7ca8a8e","category":"Environment"}
