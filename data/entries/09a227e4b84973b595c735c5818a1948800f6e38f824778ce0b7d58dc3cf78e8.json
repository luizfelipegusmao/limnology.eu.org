{"title":"The Use of Academic Library and Information Seeking Behavior of Students at Lusaka Apex Medical University","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1190/v1","date":1723794206000,"content":"The study surveyed the use of academic libraries and information seeking behaviour of students at Lusaka Apex Medical University. The objectives of the study were to determine how often LAMU students used the libraries, to ascertain the purpose for which students used the library and to determine the challenges faced in accessing library services. Using a survey research design, 230 students selected using simple random sampling participated. Findings revealed that there were more male (51.1%) students who participated. The study also found that the majority of students (54.7%) were occasionally using the library. Results on the purpose for using the library showed that the majority (39.6%) were using it to read in order to improve personal competence. In relation to the challenges, majority students (42.6%) stressed the inadequacy of relevant materials. The need for librarians to make themselves available to aid students that seek information for different purposes was recommended. This was seen as a way through which many would have access to the available information in their field. There is a need for proper orientation and sensitization to students on how to access both physical and online materials. This would increase the library use as well as improve the performance of students. Lastly, it was recommended that a study on the digital literacy of students be done in order to ascertain their competence and search skills in sourcing for information.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09a227e4b84973b595c735c5818a1948800f6e38f824778ce0b7d58dc3cf78e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
