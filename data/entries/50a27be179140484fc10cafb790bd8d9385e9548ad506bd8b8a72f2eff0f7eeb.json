{"title":"Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow Characteristics in a Micro Heat Exchanger Employing Warm Nanofluids for Cooling of Electronic Components","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1396/v1","date":1713776111000,"content":"Heat transfer enhancement and hydrodynamic characteristics of nanofluid use in a micro heat exchanger is investigated for cooling electronic components working in hot climatic conditions. The cooling fluid employed was water and TiO2 nanoparticles at concentrations of 1% and 5%, Reynolds numbers ranged from 400 to 2000, and inlet temperatures ranged between 35ºC and 65ºC.\nAt a nanofluid inlet temperature of 55ºC and a nanoparticle concentration of 1%, the Nusselt number increased by 23% up to 54% as the Reynolds number varied between 400 and 2000. At a nanoparticle concentration of 5%, the percentages which correspondingly enhanced the Nusselt number were 32% and 63%. The temperature of the electronic heating component decreased by 4.6-5.2ºC when the nanofluid concentration was increased from 0 to 5% at a Reynolds number of 400 and a nanofluid inlet temperature of 35ºC. Small increments in pressure drop of about 6% and 13% were observed at nanofluid concentrations of 1% and 5%, respectively. With nanoparticle concentrations of 1% and 5%, a Reynolds number of 2000 and a nanofluid inlet temperature of 35ºC, performance evaluation criterion (PEC) values of 1.36 and 1.45 were obtained. When the nanofluid inlet temperature was increased to 65ºC, the PEC parameter decreased to 1.02-1.10 for both concentrations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50a27be179140484fc10cafb790bd8d9385e9548ad506bd8b8a72f2eff0f7eeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
