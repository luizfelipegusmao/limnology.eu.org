{"title":"Study on decarbonization trajectories and policy implications for China: A comparative analysis of carbon peak nations","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308394","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Su Xu, Jun Wang</p>\r\n\r\nAmidst escalating global concerns over climate change and the pressing need for sustainable development, this study conducts a comparative analysis across 24 nations that have successfully achieved carbon peaking, evaluating their socioeconomic characteristics and carbon reduction strategies. Simultaneously, it examines China’s policy evolution and strategic responses within the context of its economic and urban development. The analysis reveals that countries with successful carbon peak outcomes typically exhibit high GDP per capita and advanced urbanization rates. Critical to their success are comprehensive adjustments in energy consumption structures and industrial transformation, which are supported by robust environmental policies and technological innovation. The study categorizes global carbon reduction policies into three primary categories and seven sub-categories, reflecting the dynamic evolution of policy approaches driven by global climate agendas and varying stages of national development. Strategies including legal frameworks, carbon pricing mechanisms, international cooperation, and technological innovation are critically assessed for their potential to refine China’s carbon policies. Significant challenges in policy implementation are identified, particularly in aligning ambitious environmental strategies with economic objectives and managing transition costs in critical sectors such as energy and transportation. The study emphasizes the necessity of a phased policy implementation approach, which begins with enhancing public and corporate environmental awareness, advances through the promotion of low-carbon technologies, and concludes with the establishment of stringent legal and regulatory frameworks.","author":"Su Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"41ae2e5b0ba3efc7d112f5ece7bad9f7840c02b884446af0092215fe1c7f2181","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
