{"title":"Hypertriglyceridemia- from Innocent Bystander to Independent Cardiovascular Risk Factor in Younger Prehypertensives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0451/v1","date":1717741474000,"content":"Background: Population studies have shown that prehypertension is associated with adverse cardiometabolic risk profile even among apparently healthy populations. Although associations between serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have been reported, there are lack of data on the association of hypertriglyceridemia with cardiovascular risk (CVR) in a low risk prehypertensive population. Aim: Our aim was to analyze the cardiorenometabolic characteristics of prehypertensives (PHT) compared to normotensives (NT) and untreated hypertensives (HT) and its associations with CVR. Materials and methods: In our cross-sectional study we included 323 apparently healthy untreated subjects 18-45 years who underwent basic anthropometric and standardized blood pressure measurement, fasting blood sampling, spot urine collection and transthoracic echocardiogram. Results: Higher BMI, waist circumference, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, TG, uric acid and LVMI contribute to higher CVR in PHT compared to true NT (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4268f9409084b75072dbd7748cbf930d2f3310e4aa1035d9640f7123ddb4cc4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
