{"title":"Comprehensive Insight on Regular Damped Oscillatory Structures from Effective Electromagnetic Form Factors Data of Some Mesons and Nucleons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0383/v1","date":1717721350000,"content":"We investigate regular damped oscillatory structures appearing in the \"effective\" form factor of various hadrons. The behavior of this form factor can be extracted from the experimental information on total cross sections, the processes $\\sigma_{tot}(e^+e^- \\to h \\bar h)$, $h=\\pi^{\\pm}, K^{\\pm}, K^0, p, n $ are examined. The apparent oscillations have been observed for the first time for the proton and we show, taking also other hadrons into the consideration, that they are an arbitrary artifact resulting from a very simplistic theoretical description based on an elementary three-parametric model. If the data are described by a more appropriate and well physically funded U\\&amp;A model, then the oscillations disappear. In addition, if the simple model is used to describe the data, one observes that the oscillations are opposite for particles which form an isospin dublet. We show, by using the U\\&amp;A model, that this feature is explained by the transformation properties of the corresponding states in the isotopic space.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"107b3f507140d93015ceb5a1cd1b995a9e53d8f7dc086cf07381a89aa25182f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
