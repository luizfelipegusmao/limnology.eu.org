{"title":"An In-depth Evaluation of Educational Burst Games - in Relation to Learner Proficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2425/v1","date":1722323287000,"content":"Game-based learning assessments lean on educational data mining approaches such as stealth assessments and quasi mixed-methods that help gather student learning proficiency. Rarely do we see approaches where student proficiency in learning is woven into the game's design. Educational Burst Games (EBGs) is a new approach to improving learning proficiency by designing fast-paced, short, repetitive, and skill-based games. They have the potential to be effective learning interventions both during instruction in the classroom and during after-school activities such as assignments and homework. Over five years we have developed two EBGs aimed at improving linear algebra concepts of undergraduate students. In this study, we provide results of an in-depth evaluation of the two EBGs developed with 45 participants that represent our target population. We discuss the role of EBGs and their design constructs such as pace and repetition, the effect of the format (2D vs. 3D), the complexity of the levels and the influence of prior knowledge on the learning outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0d7877e636a750b365dc091ac8b6f6cc3f3ab9cc805ed7ade38e082cafa825b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
