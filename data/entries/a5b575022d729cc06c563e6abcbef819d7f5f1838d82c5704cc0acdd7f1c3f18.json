{"title":"Clarifying the Dominant Role of Crystallinity and Molecular Orientation in Differently Processed Thin Films Regioregular poly(3-Hexylthiophene)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1914/v1","date":1714379687000,"content":"Conjugated polymers (CPs) offer potentials for sustainable semiconductor devices due to their low cost, and inherent molecular self-assembly. Enhanced crystallinity and molecular orientation in thin films of solution-processable CPs have significantly improved organic electronic device per-formance. In this work, three methods namely spin-coating, dip-coating, and unidirectional float-ing-film transfer method (UFTM) were utilized with their parametric optimization for fabricating RR-P3HT films. These films were then utilized for their characterization via optical and micro-structural analysis to elucidate dominant roles of molecular orientation, and crystallinity in con-trolling charge transport in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). OFETs fabricated by RR-P3HT thin films using spin-coating and dip-coating displayed field-effect mobility (μ) of 8.0 × 10-4 cm2V-1s-1 and 1.3 × 10-3 cm2V-1s-1, respectively. This two-time enhancement in (µ for dip-coated films was attributed to its enhanced crystallinity. Interestingly, UFTM films based OFETs demon-strated μ of 7.0 × 10-2 cm2V-1s-1, &gt;100 times increment as compared to its spin-coated counterpart This superior device performance is attributed to synergistic influence of higher crystallinity and molecular orientation. Since the crystallinity of dip-coated and UFTM-thin films are similar ~50 times improved µ of UFTM thin films suggest a dominant role of molecular orientation as com-pared to crystallinity in controlling the charge transport.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5b575022d729cc06c563e6abcbef819d7f5f1838d82c5704cc0acdd7f1c3f18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
