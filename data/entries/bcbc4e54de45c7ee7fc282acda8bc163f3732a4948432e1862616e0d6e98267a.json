One key modification is the splicing of introns. Within a cell or an organism, variation in pre-mRNA splicing such as the skipping of one or more exons, the use of alternative splicing sites, or the retention of an intron may occur. This process, known as alternative splicing (AS), increases gene expression diversity by allowing a single pre-mRNA to generate several distinct mRNA transcripts, each potentially encoding different proteins. AS is crucial throughout the plant life cycle and contributes to resistance against various stresses. In rice more than 50% of intron-containing genes undergo AS (<a href=\"#koae214-B1\">Dong et al. 2018</a>). AS requires a versatile and complex regulatory mechanism that enables the controlled production of different isoforms from unique pre-mRNAs depending on factors such as the tissue type or the exposure to a stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"bcbc4e54de45c7ee7fc282acda8bc163f3732a4948432e1862616e0d6e98267a","category":"Environment"}
