{"title":"Machine Unlearning Application for CNN, DNN and GNN","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2026/v1","date":1727264314000,"content":"Machine unlearning, the process of removing the influence of specific data points from trained machine learning models, has become increasingly important in light of modern data privacy regulations, such as the GDPR and the \"right to be forgotten.\" This paper explores the challenges and solutions associated with implementing machine unlearning in three widely used neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Each of these networks presents unique challenges due to their distinct architectures and learning processes. Techniques such as selective retraining, influence functions, and knowledge distillation have been proposed to address these challenges. The paper also introduces the concept of full parameter unlearning, which adjusts all trainable parameters using two key techniques: gradient ascent based on first-order information and Fisher information based on second-order information. These methods ensure comprehensive unlearning, but also introduce computational complexity. We discuss examples, potential solutions, and future research directions to make full parameter unlearning more scalable and efficient, thus providing a framework for balancing data privacy with model performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b3dc04a91b6d97a0c804bd48c105b09a0a7bfae85c4a56aed17b788e3f37db8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
