{"title":"“Nobody does checkups back there”: A qualitative study of refugees’ healthcare needs in the United States from stakeholders’ perspectives","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303907","date":1717509600000,"content":"<p>by Sarah Yeo, Hannah L.

As a result, they may arrive in host communities with numerous health issues, including communicable diseases and chronic and mental health conditions. Navigating the healthcare system in a host country proves to be a significant challenge for them, leading to delayed care. This qualitative study explored the convolute healthcare needs of refugees in the United States by soliciting insights from stakeholders involved in refugee resettlement and healthcare. In-depth interviews were conducted with fifteen stakeholders who work closely with refugees, including healthcare providers, cultural/clinical health navigators supporting refugees, staff from refugee resettlement agencies and governmental entities, and researchers studying refugee health. Following informed consent, interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and imported into MAXQDA 2022 (VERBI Software) for thematic analysis. The results revealed key themes, including the heterogeneity of refugee populations, limited awareness of preventive healthcare, high prevalence and suboptimal management of chronic conditions, complexity of the healthcare system, lack of follow-up, and language barriers. Further research is warranted concerning the long-term health of refugee populations in the United States. Additionally, more tailored programs involving peer educators are recommended to support refugee communities in navigating the complex healthcare system in the host country.","author":"Sarah Yeo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"00fa727bde87857a7a003790f9356dc12924550eec88e0d6bf7a11508a278517","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
