{"title":"Ovarian Fibrothecoma in a Mare-Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0752/v1","date":1710311070000,"content":"Ovarian tumors in mares are not common in comparison to other neoplasms and are divided into three categories: gonadal stromal tumors, coelomic epithelium surface tumors, and germinative cell tumors [12]. Some ovarian neo-plasms histologically show a mixture of multiple cell types in the same tumor, such as fibrothecoma, therefore the dif-ferentiation between fibroma and thecoma is often difficult [1]. According to World Health Organization, fibrothecoma is classified as sex cords stromal tumor (pure stromal tumor) [13]. Neoplasms, such as fibrothecoma have a very scarce morphology, clinical signs, ultrasonographic view and endocrine profile. To diagnose this type of tumor, a broad clini-cal examination is needed, but histopathology remains the most accurate. Herein, we report a case of incidentally found ovarian fibrothecoma during diagnostic laparotomy in 6-year-old KWPN mare which was presented to the clinic with colic symptoms. After unilateral ovariectomy, the altered right ovary, based on histopathological features was diag-nosed as fibrothecoma.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8ab919c040d68dde5fd66462a8ca688f3cebdb1cc3cdf752e8f36584bcd998d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
