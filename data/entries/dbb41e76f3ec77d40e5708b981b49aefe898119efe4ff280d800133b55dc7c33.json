However, the pathological mechanisms and therapeutic approaches are not achieved. In addition to the established roles of oxidative stress, inflammation and immune response, changes of gut microbiota are also closely related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Gut microbiota is the central player of the gut–brain axis, the dynamic bidirectional communication pathway between gut microbiota and central nervous system, and emerging insights have confirmed its indispensability in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the complex relationship between gut microbiota and the central nervous system from the perspective of the gut–brain axis; review the mechanism of microbiota for the modulation different neurodegenerative diseases and discuss how different dietary patterns affect neurodegenerative diseases via gut microbiota; and prospect the employment of gut microbiota in the therapeutic approach to those diseases. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Sen Li, \nYuwei Cai, \nShuo Wang, \nLei Luo, \nYu Zhang, \nKai Huang, \nXiao Guan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"dbb41e76f3ec77d40e5708b981b49aefe898119efe4ff280d800133b55dc7c33","category":"Environment"}
