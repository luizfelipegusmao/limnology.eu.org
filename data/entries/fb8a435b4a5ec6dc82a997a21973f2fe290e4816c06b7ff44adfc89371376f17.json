{"title":"ST-D3DDARN: Urban traffic flow prediction based on spatio-temporal decoupled 3D DenseNet with attention ResNet","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305424","date":1718200800000,"content":"<p>by Jing Chen, Guowei Yang, Zhaochong Zhang, Wei Wang</p>\r\n\r\nUrban traffic flow prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can enhance traffic efficiency and ensure public safety. However, predicting urban traffic flow faces numerous challenges, such as intricate temporal dependencies, spatial correlations, and the influence of external factors. Existing research methods cannot fully capture the complex spatio-temporal dependence of traffic flow. Inspired by video analysis in computer vision, we represent traffic flow as traffic frames and propose an end-to-end urban traffic flow prediction model named Spatio-temporal Decoupled 3D DenseNet with Attention ResNet (ST-D3DDARN). Specifically, this model extracts multi-source traffic flow features through closeness, period, trend, and external factor branches. Subsequently, it dynamically establishes global spatio-temporal correlations by integrating spatial self-attention and coordinate attention in a residual network, accurately predicting the inflow and outflow of traffic throughout the city. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the ST-D3DDARN model, experiments are carried out on two publicly available real-world datasets. The results indicate that ST-D3DDARN outperforms existing models in terms of single-step prediction, multi-step prediction, and efficiency.","author":"Jing Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fb8a435b4a5ec6dc82a997a21973f2fe290e4816c06b7ff44adfc89371376f17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
