{"title":"Genomic Typing, Antimicrobial Resistance Gene and Virulence Factor Dataset for the Important Pathogenic Bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1714/v1","date":1727143548000,"content":"The infections of bacterial origin represent a significant problem to public healthcare worldwide both in clinical and community settings. Recent decade was marked by limiting treatment options for bacterial infections due to growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) acquired and transferred by various bacterial species, especially the ones causing healthcare-associated infections, which has become a dangerous issue noticed by the World Health Organization. Numerous reports shown that the spread of AMR is often driven by several species-specific lineages usually called the ‘global clones of high risk’. Thus, it is essential to track the isolates belonging to such clones and investigate the mechanisms of their pathogenicity and AMR acquisition. Currently, the whole genome-based analysis is increasingly used for these purposes, including epidemiological surveillance and analysis of mobile elements involved in resistance transfer. However, in spite of the exponential growth of available bacterial genomes, their representation usually lack uniformity and availability of supporting metadata, which creates a bottleneck for such investigations. In this dataset, we provide the results of a comprehensive genomic epidemiology analysis of 61,857 genomes of a dangerous bacterial pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. Important typing information including multilocus sequence typing (MLST)-based sequence types (STs), assignment of the isolates to known global clones, capsular (KL) and lipooligosaccharide (O) types, presence of CRISPR-Cas systems, and cgMLST profiles are given, and the presence of AMR and virulence genes within the genomes is also reported. This dataset will be useful for researchers in the field of K. pneumoniae genomic epidemiology, resistance analysis and prevention measure development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15e1ff469c00ffc70da3c304a09bd73d2f9d3c8a1b776f16e1bdc30513888230","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
