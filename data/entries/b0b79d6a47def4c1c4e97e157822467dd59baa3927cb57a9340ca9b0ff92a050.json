{"title":"The State of UAS Operations at Airports, A Perspective from Airport Managers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1046/v1","date":1723647011000,"content":"As the number of Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) operating in our National Airspace System (NAS) increases, so do UAS operations near or at an airport. The accelerating technology in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) along with the related business opportunities will only further increase UAS operations at airports. This continued growth in new UAS technologies and applications introduces new hazards and risks to the airport environment. This proliferation of UAS highlights the importance of airports developing a robust Safety Management System (SMS) that includes specific UAS risk mitigations. To date, there is currently little empirical data regarding UAS traffic around airports. Nor is there a system to collect this data at a national level. This study attempted to gain insight into the commercial UAS operations across a broader airport population by surveying the airport manager population here in the United States. Research results found that 62% of airports are experiencing an increase in UAS operations in their surrounding airspace. This increase applies to all airspace classifications, with 67% of airports located in controlled airspace experiencing an increase in UAS operations. However, only 27% of airports have some type of UAS safety plan. Similarly, the increase in adverse UAS events near airports suggests that UAS operators may also lack robust safety plans or an understanding of the risks and regulations associated with operating near airports.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0b79d6a47def4c1c4e97e157822467dd59baa3927cb57a9340ca9b0ff92a050","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
