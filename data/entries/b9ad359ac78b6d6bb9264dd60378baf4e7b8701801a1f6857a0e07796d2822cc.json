By adapting the learning objectives and structure of GNNs, this research bridges the gap between traditional optimization approaches and modern machine learning techniques. The proposed method demonstrates improved decision-making capabilities, providing promising results for facility location optimization. Additionally, potential future research directions are outlined, highlighting areas where GNNs can further enhance decision-making processes in complex supply chain networks. Hybrid GNN and Mixed Integer Programming solutions have been proposed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9ad359ac78b6d6bb9264dd60378baf4e7b8701801a1f6857a0e07796d2822cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
