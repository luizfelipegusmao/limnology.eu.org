{"title":"Regulation of RIPK1 Phosphorylation: Implications for Inflammation, Cell Death, and Therapeutic Interventions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0639/v1","date":1712659755000,"content":"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) plays a crucial role in controlling inflammation and cell death. Its function is tightly controlled through post-translational modifications, enabling its dynamic switch between promoting cell survival and triggering cell death. Phosphorylation of RIPK1 at various sites serves as a critical mechanism for regulating its activity, exerting either activating or inhibitory effects. Perturbations in RIPK1 phosphorylation status have profound implications for the development of severe inflammatory diseases in humans. This review explores the intricate regulation of RIPK1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and highlights the potential of targeting RIPK1 phosphorylation as a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating human diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"930b94a1df20dfc7aea203fc2b7a698c9a9288d62f777e90f4166984c67c156b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
