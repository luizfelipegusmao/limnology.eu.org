{"title":"A Low-Cost Structurally Simple Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Fullerene Carbon Soot Doped Polydimethylsiloxane Composite Film","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0695/v1","date":1712739744000,"content":"Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as viable micro power sources for an array of applications. Since their inception in 2012, TENGs have witnessed significant advancements in terms of structural design and the development of friction materials. Despite these advancements, the complexity of their structural designs and the use of costly friction materials hinder their practical application. This study introduces a simplified TENG model utilizing an economical composite film of fullerene soot (FS) doped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (FS-TENG). It demonstrates the capability of FS-TENG to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy via experimental validation. The FS-TENG achieves a maximum instantaneous voltage (Voc) of 18.49 V and current (Isc) of 2.2 µA, with a peak power density of 145 µW/m² under a load resistance of 63 MΩ. The electricity produced by the FS-TENG can power 72 LEDs, underscoring its efficiency. This work contributes to advancing TENGs with low-cost, simplified structures for sustainable and self-sustaining energy sensing applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b454ec0b6e40fdd81a6eb829b7055f58256fd7f768cf2020f0b32c831c8ae23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
