Artificial Intelligence (AI) based devices may be able to assist non-specialist physicians in NCCT interpretation, thereby enabling faster interventions for acute stroke patients in these settings. We evaluated the impact of an AI device by comparing the time to intervention (TTI) from NCCT imaging to significant intervention before (baseline) and after the deployment of AI, in patients diagnosed with stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) through a retrospective interrupted time series analysis at a rural hospital managed by non-specialists in India. Significant intervention was defined as thrombolysis or antiplatelet therapy in ischemic strokes, and mannitol for hemorrhagic strokes or mass effect. We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the software using the teleradiologists’ reports as ground truth. Impact analysis in a total of 174 stroke patients (72 in baseline and 102 after deployment) demonstrated a significant reduction of median TTI from 80 minutes (IQR: 56·8–139·5) during baseline to 58·50 (IQR: 30·3–118.2) minutes after AI deployment (Wilcoxon rank sum test—location shift: -21·0, 95% CI: -38·0, -7·0). Diagnostic accuracy evaluation in a total of 864 NCCT scans demonstrated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) in detecting intracranial hemorrhage to be 0·89 (95% CI: 0·83–0·93), 0·99 (0·98–1·00), 0·96 (0·91–0·98) and 0·97 (0·96–0·98) respectively, and for infarct these were 0·84 (0·79–0·89), 0·81 (0·77–0·84), 0·58 (0·52–0·63), and 0·94 (0·92–0·96), respectively. AI-based NCCT interpretation supported faster abnormality detection with high accuracy, resulting in persons with acute stroke receiving significantly earlier treatment. Our results suggest that AI-based NCCT interpretation can potentially improve uptake of lifesaving interventions for acute stroke in resource-limited settings.","author":"Justy Antony Chiramal","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"67cfae82ec02713081afd7b5ef8466eabfa1dac4546e476093410dafb0e086bb","category":"Environment"}
