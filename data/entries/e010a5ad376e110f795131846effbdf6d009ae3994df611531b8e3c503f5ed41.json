{"title":"Verification of Criterion-Related Validity for Developing a Marker-Less Hand Tracking Device","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2036/v1","date":1717067593000,"content":"Abstract: Physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists have traditionally assessed hand motor function in hemiplegic patients but often struggle to evaluate complex hand move-ments. To address this issue, in 2019, we developed Fahrenheit, a device and algorithm that uses infrared camera image processing to estimate hand paralysis. However, due to Fahrenheit's de-pendency on specialized equipment, we conceived a simpler solution: developing a smartphone app that integrates MediaPipe. The objective of this study was to measure hand movements in stroke patients using both MediaPipe and Fahrenheit and to assess their criterion-related validity. The analysis revealed moderate-to-high correlations between the two methods. Consistent results were also observed in the peak angle and velocity comparisons across severity stages. Because Fahrenheit determines finger recovery status based on these measures, it has the potential to transfer this function to MediaPipe. This study highlighted the potential use of MediaPipe in pa-ralysis estimation applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e010a5ad376e110f795131846effbdf6d009ae3994df611531b8e3c503f5ed41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
