{"title":"Genomic Investigation for Potential Therapeutic Use of Abiraterone in the Amazonian Indigenous Population","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0043/v1","date":1714534443000,"content":"Prostate cancer, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), ranks as the fourth most prevalent type in the population, even though it is highly frequent when detected early and promptly treated, resulting in a low mortality rate. However, in some cases, despite adherence to proper clinical protocols, there is a progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In these cases, as outlined in clinical guidelines such as those developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), one approach involves the utilization of the pharmaceutical agent abiraterone to implement androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), aimed at suppressing the production of hormones directly implicated in disease progression. Another noteworthy aspect is the limited literature on clinical protocols and their efficacy concerning the Amazonian indigenous population, which often exhibits unique genomic profiles, with descriptions of variants not yet documented in the literature. Building upon these considerations, this study aims to survey the variants identified in genes associated with the abiraterone signaling pathway, their frequencies in the Amazonian indigenous population, and the correlation of these frequencies with those observed in other global populations. The objective is to contribute to the refinement of clinical practices in the treatment of prostate cancer within this population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43fb9486c7d365a928a9fdc4d3179dfecebcaa392f052436ef0094469371e50e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
