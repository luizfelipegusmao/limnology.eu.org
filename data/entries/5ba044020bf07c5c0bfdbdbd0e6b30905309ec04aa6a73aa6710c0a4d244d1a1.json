{"title":"Metabolomic analysis revealed the inflammatory and oxidative stress regulation in response to Vibrio infection in Plectropomus leopardus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15905?af=R","date":1724480742000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases in aquaculture have led to significant economic losses. The leopard coral grouper (<i>Plectropomus leopardus</i>) often suffers from vibriosis. Improving host immunity presents a superior strategy for disease control, with minimal side effects compared to the use of antibiotics, highlighting the necessity of exploring the mechanisms underlying the fish's response to pathogen infections. Here, we conducted a comparative metabolomic analysis on the livers of the <i>P. leopardus</i> infected with <i>Vibrio harveyi</i>. A total of 1124 differential metabolites (DMs) were identified, with 190, 218, 359, and 353 DMs being identified at 6, 12, 24, and 48â€‰h post-infection (hpi), respectively. Then, based on the time series analysis, we found that the lipid metabolism pathways were modulated in response to the <i>Vibrio</i> infection, with an increase in the quantity of eicosanoids and gycerophospholipids (GPLs), as well as a decrease in the quantity of bile acids (BAs), vitamin D, and sex hormones. Furthermore, 13 enriched pathways involving 31 DMs were identified through KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analyses. We identified histamine, 15(S)-HpETE, and anandamide in the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels pathway, as well as (7S,8S)-DiHODE, 5S,8R-DiHODE, and 13(S)-HpODE in the linoleic acid (LA) metabolism pathway. The DM levels increased, which may be attributed to inflammation. The DMs in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway were identified, and the contents of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione (GSH) decreased, which may be crucial in antioxidants. Our findings highlighted the dynamic adjustments in lipid metabolism and the response to inflammation and oxidative stress during the infection of <i>V. harveyi</i> in <i>P. leopardus</i>. This study not only deepens our understanding of the metabolic underpinnings of fish immune responses but also lays the groundwork for research into functional metabolomics and mechanisms of disease resistance.</p>","author":"Jie Wang, \nJunwei Zhang, \nMeng Shi, \nXinran Ma, \nSonglin Chen, \nQian Zhou, \nChunhua Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"5ba044020bf07c5c0bfdbdbd0e6b30905309ec04aa6a73aa6710c0a4d244d1a1","category":"Environment"}
