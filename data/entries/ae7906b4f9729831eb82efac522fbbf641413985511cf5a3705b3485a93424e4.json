{"title":"Does duckweed (Lemna minor) feed inclusion play a role on growth, feed conversion ratio and reproductive performance (fertilization, hatchability and survivability rates) in omnivorous fish? Evidence in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus‐Linnaeus, 1758)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aff2.70000?af=R","date":1724485207000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Fish feed production is fraught with high costs due to the inclusion of expensive fishmeal and animal proteins that can be sourced from aquatic macrophytes. Limited attempts have been made on use of the latter for fish feed production. Further, the quality of feed given to fish is known to affect its growth and reproductive performance. Role of feeds containing duckweed <i>(Lemna minor)</i> at 0%-control feed, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% inclusion levels on growth and reproductive performance of <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> of size 18 ± 1 g were evaluated for 12 weeks. The fish were fed twice daily at 10% body weight at 9.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. Length–weight measurements were done fortnightly using a measuring board and a weighing balance, respectively. Female mouth-brooding fish were used to evaluate reproductive performance indicators, namely %: fertilization, hatchability and survivability. Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc and polynomial orthogonal analysis to identify <i>L. minor</i> diets with significant differences (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Fish fed on a diet containing 10% <i>L. minor</i> inclusion showed significantly better growth performance and feed conversion ratio than those fed on the control diet. All <i>L. minor</i> diets gave good fish condition factors above 1.0. Fish fed on a diet containing 10% <i>L. minor</i> and those fed on the control gave reasonably high survival rates of 85.55% and 83.33%, respectively, whereas those fed on 20% <i>L. minor</i> produced the same growth performance as control. Orthogonal polynomial analysis for the final weights across the <i>L. minor</i> diets – 0%–25% – showed a cubic polynomial model (<i>p </i>= 0.000), whereas final lengths portrayed a linear inverse significant relationship (<i>p </i>&lt; 0.05). Inclusion of <i>L. minor</i> in the diets resulted to slightly better fertilization, hatchability and survivability rates at 10%, 20% and 15%, respectively. In conclusion, inclusion of <i>L. minor</i> from 10% to 20% in fish feeds is recommended for enhancing growth and reproductive performance of <i>O. niloticus</i>.</p>","author":"Judith Kemunto Achoki, \nCatherine Kaluwa Kaingu, \nJemimah Achieng’ Oduma, \nPaul Sagwe Orina, \nRobert Nyakwama Ondiba, \nRobert Nyamao Nyabwanga, \nAlbert Mochache Getabu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture, Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be1e788988f9ff9949a6f7f759773ae166678ee7c383b954a977541fbea3ff","entryHash":"ae7906b4f9729831eb82efac522fbbf641413985511cf5a3705b3485a93424e4","category":"Environment"}
