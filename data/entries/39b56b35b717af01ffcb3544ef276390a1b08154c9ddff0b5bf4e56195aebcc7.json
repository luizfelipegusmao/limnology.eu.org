{"title":"The Evolving Landscape of Computational Neuroscience: A Shift Towards Data-Driven and Integrative Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1203/v1","date":1718702445000,"content":"Computational neuroscience has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, driven by the exponential growth of neural data and advancements in data science and machine learning. While traditional theoretical models remain valuable, there is a growing emphasis on integrating data-driven approaches to develop more accurate, biologically plausible, and predictive models of neural function. This shift has led to a new equilibrium in the field, where data-driven model development, machine learning techniques, and hybrid approaches that combine data and theory are increasingly prevalent. In this article, we discuss the evolving landscape of computational neuroscience, highlighting the importance of data-driven methods and the emergence of a more integrative approach that leverages both data and theory to unlock the mysteries of the brain. We also explore the implications of this shift for future research and clinical applications, emphasizing the potential for data-driven computational neuroscience to revolutionize our understanding of neural function and pave the way for new treatments for neurological disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39b56b35b717af01ffcb3544ef276390a1b08154c9ddff0b5bf4e56195aebcc7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
