{"title":"Invasive Ponto‐Caspian amphipods are less carnivorous outside their native range","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12638?af=R","date":1722672902000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A species' expansion beyond the native range is often assumed to be associated with an increased dietary niche breadth. However, empirical evidence remains limited due to a scarcity of studies comparing both the parental and invaded ranges. Here, we test the trophic niche expansion hypothesis by examining stable isotopes and functional morphology across native (NW Black Sea) and invaded (SE Baltic Sea) ranges of two amphipods, <i>Dikerogammarus villosus</i> and <i>Pontogammarus robustoides</i>, originating from the Ponto-Caspian region—a major source of species invading Holarctic inland waters. Stable isotopes revealed that both species underwent a marked dietary niche contraction by becoming less carnivorous in the invaded range. This dietary shift was morphologically mirrored by an overall reduction of functional traits related to predation. The magnitude of dietary and morphological change was greater in <i>D. villosus</i>. Our findings indicate that previous experimental reports of aggressive predation in <i>D. villosus</i> reflect opportunistic foraging and align with local stable isotope studies which generally indicate a low trophic position. We conclude that Ponto-Caspian species can undergo rapid dietary changes outside the native range, and that dietary niche expansion is not a prerequisite for successful non-native establishment.</p>","author":"Denis Copilaș‐Ciocianu, \nAndrius Garbaras, \nEglė Šidagytė‐Copilas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"f7fef5c1161a5c8c4a49e5852620bc4ebafad6c713d246f6b6866684e722106c","category":"Environment"}
