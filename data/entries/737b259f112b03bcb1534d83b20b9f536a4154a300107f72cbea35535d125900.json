{"title":"Genetic analysis of popping quality traits and development of superior quality popcorn hybrids for a sustainable popcorn breeding program in India","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13748?af=R","date":1721464036000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Popcorn is the most popular specialty maize and it makes a significant contribution to the Indian and global economies. Despite perfect exploration of heterosis in field corn, progress in popcorn breeding remains constrained due to its narrow genetic base, leading to a significant dependence on imports. In this study, 15 landrace- and population-derived inbreds from temperate and tropical germplasm were crossed with five testers, which are the parents of superior popcorn hybrids, in a line × tester mating design.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Significant variation was observed in popping quality and agronomic traits among crosses evaluated across three locations representing diverse maize-based agro-climatic zones in India. Additive genetic variance governed the traits related to popping quality, whereas dominance variance was responsible for the agronomic traits. In addition to significant heterosis specific to certain traits, we identified promising crosses that exhibited superior performance in both popping quality and grain yield (GY). The genotype + genotype × environment (GGE) biplot methodology identified PMI-PC-104 and PMI-PC-101 as the best discriminating testers for popping quality traits and Dpcl-15-90 for GY. Lines PMI-PC-205, PMI-PC-207, and PMI-PC-209 were the best general combiners for popping quality traits and GY. The heterotic groups identified based on GGE-biplots and the magnitude, direction and stability of combining ability effects would serve in the development of competitive popcorn hybrids for a sustainable popcorn market.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Using the additive nature of popping quality traits and the dominant nature of GY, recurrent intrapopulation selection can be employed to derive desirable popping quality inbreds with high GY for genetic enhancement. Desirable popping quality alleles from novel germplasm can thus be combined with high-yielding domestic elite inbreds to establish a sustainable popcorn breeding program. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ikkurti Gopinath, \nFiroz Hossain, \nRajkumar U Zunjare, \nSelvakumar Thambiyannan, \nSantosh Kumar, \nVinay Bhatt, \nGulab Chand, \nSathya Sheela KR Veluchamy, \nBhupender Kumar, \nJavaji C.
