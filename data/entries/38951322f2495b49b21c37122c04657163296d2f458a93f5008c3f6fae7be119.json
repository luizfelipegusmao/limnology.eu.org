{"title":"Causes of Past African Temperature Change in PMIP Simulations of the Mid‐Holocene","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023PA004706?af=R","date":1715415869000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Current-generation climate models project that Africa will warm by up to 5°C in the coming century, severely stressing African populations. Past and ongoing work indicates, however, that the models used to create these projections do not match proxy records of past temperature in Africa during the mid-Holocene (MH), raising concerns that their future projections may house large uncertainties. Rather than reproducing proxy-based reconstructions of MH warming relative to the Pre-Industrial (PI), models instead simulate MH temperatures very similar to or slightly colder than the PI. This data-model mismatch could be due to a variety of factors, including biases in model surface energy budgets or inaccurate representation of the feedbacks between temperature and hydrologic change during the “Green Sahara.” We focus on the differences among model simulations in the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phases 3 and 4 (PMIP3 and PMIP4), examining surface temperature and energy budgets to investigate controls on temperature and the potential model sources of this paleoclimate data-model mismatch. Our results suggest that colder conditions simulated by PMIP3 and PMIP4 models during the MH are in large part due to the joint impacts of feedback uncertainties in response to increased precipitation, a strengthened West African Monsoon (WAM) in the Sahel, and the Green Sahara. We extend these insights into suggestions for model physics and boundary condition changes, and discuss implications for the accuracy of future climate model projections over Africa.</p>","author":"Charlie Marshall, \nCarrie Morrill, \nSylvia Dee, \nFrancesco S.
