{"title":"Novel Copper Alginate Microspheres as Ecological Fungicides","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1344/v1","date":1716261320000,"content":"Phytopathogenic fungi are living organisms that cause plant diseases and great damage to agri-cultural products. Despite the wide range of commercial fungicide products in use, there is a clear need for new and environmentally friendly fungicides. Here we propose a new ecological fun-gicide, copper alginate microspheres prepared by ionic gelation. The microspheres were charac-terized (morphology and topography, encapsulation efficiency, load capacity, swelling behavior, rheology, kinetics and mechanism of copper ions release) and their in vitro antifungal potential against selected genera of phytopathogenic fungi was evaluated. Novel copper alginate micro-spheres inhibited spore germination of Botrytis cinerea and mycelial growth of Cercospora beticola and Phytophthora ramorum. They offer effective disease control while minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb5844548d945b253437c9a444b63b83bf6ecc8d9eab956ddb697cc01685155d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
