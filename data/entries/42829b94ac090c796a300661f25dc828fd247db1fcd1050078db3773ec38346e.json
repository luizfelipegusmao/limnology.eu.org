{"title":"Inflammatory responses in Atlantic lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus L.) after intraperitoneal injection of a vaccine against Aeromonas salmonicida and Vibrio salmonicida at different water temperatures","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14001?af=R","date":1728927761000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Studying inflammatory responses induced by vaccination can contribute to a more detailed understanding of underlying immune mechanisms in lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>). Tissue samples from lumpfish intraperitoneally immunized with a divalent oil-adjuvanted vaccine (<i>Aeromonas salmonicida</i> and <i>Vibrio salmonicida</i>) at water temperatures of 5, 10, and 15°C were collected at 630 day degrees and 18 weeks post injection. The relative amount of secretory and membrane-bound immunoglobulin M (IgM) gene transcripts in the head kidney was determined by qPCR. Vaccine-induced inflammatory lesions were assessed on histological sections of abdominal pancreatic/intestinal tissue from vaccinated fish in all three temperature groups. Inflammatory cells forming dense aggregations in lesions showed proliferative activity, many of which were identified as eosinophilic-granulocyte-like cells. IgM+ cells were scattered in inflammatory tissue dominated by connective tissue, showing no difference in numbers between lesions from fish vaccinated at 5, 10, and 15°C. Relative gene expression analysis of secretory and membrane-bound IgM revealed low overall expression in the head kidney of vaccinated fish at both 630 day-degrees and 18 weeks post injection. The results of this study indicate that the vaccine stimulated prolonged local inflammatory responses at the injection site, which were not influenced by temperature.</p>","author":"Ingrid Svihus Knutsen, \nToni Erkinharju, \nJarl Bøgwald, \nRoy A.
