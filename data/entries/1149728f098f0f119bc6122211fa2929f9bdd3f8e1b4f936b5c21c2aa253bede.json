{"title":"Unsupervised Deep Video Denoiser: A Potential Key to Extracting Information from Monochromated EELS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1031/7720324?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>With developments in electron optics, monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) makes characterizing materials properties, e.g., phonon [<a href=\"#ozae044.1031-B1\">1</a>], with both high energy (∼10meV) and spatial (&lt;1Å) resolution feasible. One of the disadvantages of this method is the low signal, especially for some special techniques, e.g., off-axis EELS [<a href=\"#ozae044.1031-B2\">2</a>]. The most common way to compensate for the low signal is to acquire the data with longer exposure time. However, this can amplify some problems: instability of the electron optics, radiation damage, sample drifting, etc. Is there a way to further reduce the time for acquiring the data while still being able to extract the same information? The development of the detector technology, i.e., the direct electron detectors, has limited the readout noise thus making high-quality high-speed (or low-dose) readout possible [<a href=\"#ozae044.1031-B3\">3</a>]. With the help of convolutional neural network, an unsupervised deep video denoiser (UDVD) has been applied successfully in denoising low-dose TEM images [<a href=\"#ozae044.1031-B4\">4</a>]. In this work, we are demonstrating that the UDVD can also be applied to EELS with low signal acquired using direct electron detectors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1149728f098f0f119bc6122211fa2929f9bdd3f8e1b4f936b5c21c2aa253bede","category":"Environment"}
