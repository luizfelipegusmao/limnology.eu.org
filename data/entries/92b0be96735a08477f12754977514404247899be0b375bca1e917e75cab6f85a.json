{"title":"Optimizing the Scheduling of Teaching Activities in a Faculty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0732/v1","date":1725955467000,"content":"To maximize resource usage, minimize disputes, and improve academic experience, professors must schedule teaching activities efficiently. This study provides an optimized automated schedule creation technique. The system generates conflict-free, efficient schedules using evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization. Resource usage, scheduling prob-lems, and faculty/student satisfaction are the goals of the research. The system optimizes scheduling based on room limitations, instructor availability, and student preferences. The project uses system design, model creation, algorithm implementation, and performance analysis to solve the difficult timetable-generating problem. \nThis research should save administrators time, improve academic operations, and improve staff and student academic experiences. Scalability and flexibility allow the system to be used in multiple faculties and incorporate new limits and requirements. This paper presents a complete approach to faculty scheduling, including insights and recommendations for future study and application in educational institutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92b0be96735a08477f12754977514404247899be0b375bca1e917e75cab6f85a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
