{"title":"High Mechanical Property and Texture Degree of Hot-Extruded Bi0.905Sb0.095","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1613/v1","date":1716532880000,"content":"Bi1-xSbx crystal is one of the best n-type thermoelectric materials below 200 K, but its weak mechanical strength hinders practical applications for deep refrigeration. Herein, we adopted the mechanical enhancement method of hot extrusion to investigate the comprehensive mechanical and thermoelectric properties of Bi0.905Sb0.095. It revealed that reducing the grain size of the matrix and increasing the extrusion ratio can improve the gain size uniformity and mechanical properties. While the thermoelectric performance depends on the texture, grain size, and local composition. The extruded sample prepared by ingot with the high extrusion ratio of 9:1 generated a high texture degree of (001) plane and small grain sizes between ~4-40 mm, which resulted in the high bending strength of Bi1-xSbx ~130 Mpa and a high-power factor of ~ 68 μW·cm-1·K-2@173 K, as well as the relative high figure of merit of 0.25@173K. This work highlights the importance of the uniform distribution of the grain size and the compositions for Bi1-xSbx, as well as the required universal key parameter for the hot-extrusion method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9612dcf82479dbce3a78567ba1029318b6d7ffb1865e1c28b3cc5d17df578a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
