{"title":"Sanitation Service Provision in the Face of the Pandemic &ndash; Opportunities for Circular Economy to Build Resilience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1929/v1","date":1721814236000,"content":"The focus of most interventions in COVID-19 responses across the world has been on healthcare systems, developing vaccines and treatments and the safety of healthcare workers with very little or no attention to sanitation service providers. This study assesses the operational and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sanitation service providers in Ghana. It identifies the coping mechanisms and measures put in place to ensure continuous service delivery, identifies promising circular economy solutions for water and fecal sludge reuse beneficial to water, waste, and food systems. The study uses cross-sectional data from 56 vacuum track operators from the Accra Metro using a semi-structured questionnaire between January â€“ March 2021. Descriptive statistics such as means and frequencies have been used to analyze and present them using tables and graphs. Furthermore, narrative reviews are used to support findings of the survey. The number of clients served by vacuum truck operators during COVID-19 decreased on average by 20%, 24% and 29% for households, public toilet, and institutions respectively. Fees charged for services rendered were reduced on average by 19% across all clients. The use of PPEs by vacuum truck operators have increased during the pandemic. Most vacuum truck operators did not receive any public support during the pandemic, only a few received some form of training pertaining to safe and effective service delivery. It is recommended that training on how to provide quality customer service while ensuring safety be provided by waste management experts. Circular economy approaches in wastewater and fecal sludge management that have potential for building resilience against the pandemic include water reuse for irrigation, water reuse for aquaculture, nutrient, and energy recovery from fecal sludge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"264252d5cddcd5f013c59623bd25ce827545ca982d57a6cc4f20703c8e46aaee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
