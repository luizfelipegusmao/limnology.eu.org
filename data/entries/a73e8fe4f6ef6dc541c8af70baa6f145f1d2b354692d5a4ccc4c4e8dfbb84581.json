The Al-Cu-Fe alloy was prepared by melting pure aluminum, copper, and iron with an arc melter. The obtained ingot was mechanically crushed to expose the porous interior structure and the fragments were mounted to an SEM stub with carbon tape for examination. A TESCAN Vega-3 XMU SEM equipped with Oxford Aztec Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) was used to perform compositional analysis and crystallographic analysis, respectively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a73e8fe4f6ef6dc541c8af70baa6f145f1d2b354692d5a4ccc4c4e8dfbb84581","category":"Environment"}
