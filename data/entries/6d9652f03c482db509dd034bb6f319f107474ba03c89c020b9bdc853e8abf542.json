{"title":"Toward Automated Controlled Vibration Characteristics Structural Design through Topology Optimization and Computer Vision for Space Mission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1599/v1","date":1721382677000,"content":"This study explores the integration of computer vision with topology optimization for additive manufacturing, with a focus on maximizing eigenfrequency in a design domain. Utilizing cus-tom-developed photogrammetry software, high-resolution images are processed to generate de-tailed 3D models, subsequently converted to STL files with precision. Adaptive meshing in COMSOL Multiphysics, controlled through a MATLAB API, ensures optimal mesh resolution. Prioritizing resource conservation in extraterrestrial environments, the original volume is reduced by 50% while preserving structural integrity. The design domain undergoes rigorous topology optimization in MATLAB, supported by COMSOL's advanced FEM simulation. The optimized design exhibits a 57% performance improvement and a 50% weight reduction, maintaining desired vibration characteristics, validating the efficacy of the modifications. Moreover, the case with an eccentric mass shows a significant 64% increase in eigenfrequency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d9652f03c482db509dd034bb6f319f107474ba03c89c020b9bdc853e8abf542","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
