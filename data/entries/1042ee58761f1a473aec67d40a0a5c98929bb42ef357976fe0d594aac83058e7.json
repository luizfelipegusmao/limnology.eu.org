The pipe makes as an obstacle for ultrasonic waves. In order to resolve this task, we need to determine the thickness of the pipe and choose the appropriate resonant ultrasonic wave. Determination of the thickness of the industrial steel pipes was carried out using the resonant frequency of reflected ultrasound waves and the relationship coefficients. The thicknesses of the industrial pipes measured by the resonant ultrasound wave method are in good agreement with those measured using an electronic caliper. Measurements of the cavern geometry with presence of the operation pipe using the resonant frequency of ultrasonic wave were well verified in a physical model and will be able in application to determine the real salt caverns.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"1042ee58761f1a473aec67d40a0a5c98929bb42ef357976fe0d594aac83058e7","category":"Environment"}
