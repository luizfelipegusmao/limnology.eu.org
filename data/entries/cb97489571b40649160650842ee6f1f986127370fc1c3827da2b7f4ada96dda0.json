{"title":"A microRNA396b-growth regulating factor module controls castor seed size by mediating auxin synthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/916/7733399?rss=1","date":1723593600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Castor (<span>Ricinus communis</span> L.) is an importance crop cultivated for its oil and economic value. Seed size is a crucial factor that determines crop yield. Gaining insight into the molecular regulatory processes of seed development is essential for the genetic enhancement and molecular breeding of castor. Here, we successfully fine-mapped a major QTL related to seed size, <span>qSS3</span>, to a 180 kb interval on chromosome 03 using F<sub>2</sub> populations (DL01×WH11). A 17.6-kb structural variation (SV) was detected through genomic comparison between DL01 and WH11. Analysis of haplotypes showed that the existence of the complete 17.6 kb structural variant may lead to the small seed characteristic in castor. In addition, we found that <span>qSS3</span> contains the microRNA396b (miR396b) sequence, which is situated within the 17.6 kb SV. The results of our experiment offer additional evidence that miR396-<span>Growth Regulating Factor 4</span> (<span>GRF4</span>) controls seed size by impacting the growth and multiplication of seed coat and endosperm cells. Furthermore, we found that RcGRF4 activates the expression of <span>YUCCA6</span> (<span>YUC6</span>), facilitating the production of IAA in seeds and thereby impacting the growth of castor seeds. Our research has discovered a crucial functional module that controls seed size, offering a fresh understanding of the mechanism underlying seed size regulation in castor.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"cb97489571b40649160650842ee6f1f986127370fc1c3827da2b7f4ada96dda0","category":"Environment"}
