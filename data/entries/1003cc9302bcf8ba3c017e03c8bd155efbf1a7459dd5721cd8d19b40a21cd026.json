This study aimed to establish a novel approach for assessing pulmonary microcirculation in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). We used a guidewire embedded with temperature and pressure sensors to measure the following pulmonary microcirculatory function indicators: pulmonary flow reserve, pulmonary index of microcirculatory resistance (PIMR), and pulmonary resistive reserve ratio. Adenosine was administered to patients to induce hyperemia in the pulmonary artery for assessment. The correlation between these indicators and various parameters, including serum biomarkers, hemodynamic and respiratory functions, and exercise capacity, were examined. The procedure was performed in 19 patients with moderate PH, without major complications. The minimum effective adenosine dosage for maximal hyperemia, without severe side effects, was 150 μg∙kg<sup>−1</sup>∙min<sup>−1</sup>. Multivariate stepwise analysis revealed a positive correlation between the hyperemic PIMR and serum uric acid (p &lt; 0.001) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide levels (p = 0.014). Therefore, this catheter-based method offers an effective means to assess pulmonary microcirculatory function in patients with PH, and the optimal dose of adenosine for this evaluation was 150 μg∙kg<sup>−1</sup>∙min<sup>−1</sup>.","author":"Kazunori Yamaji","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1003cc9302bcf8ba3c017e03c8bd155efbf1a7459dd5721cd8d19b40a21cd026","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
