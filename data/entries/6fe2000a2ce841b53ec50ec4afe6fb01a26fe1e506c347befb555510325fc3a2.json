{"title":"Development of underground detection system using a metal detector and aluminum tag for, Copris ochus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae067/7697944?rss=1","date":1719187200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Tracking of soil-dwelling insects poses greater challenges compared to aboveground-dwelling animals in terrestrial systems. A metal detector system consisting of a commercially available detector and aluminum tags was developed for detecting dung beetle, <span>Copris ochus</span> Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). First, detection efficacy of the system was evaluated by varying volumes of aluminum tags attached on a plastic model of the insect and also by varying angles. Then, detection efficacy was evaluated by varying depths of aluminum-tagged models under soil in 2 vegetation types. Finally, the effects of tag attachment on <span>C. ochus</span> adults were assessed for survivorship, burrowing depth, and horizontal movement. Generally, an increase in tag volume resulted in greater detection distance in semi-field conditions. Maximum detection distance of aluminum tag increased up to 17 cm below soil surface as the tag size (0.5 × 1.0 cm [width × length]) and thickness (16 layers) were maximized, resulting in a tag weight of 31.4 mg, comprising ca. 9% of average weight of <span>C. ochus</span> adult. Furthermore, the detection efficacy did not vary among angles except for 90°. In the field, metal detectors successfully detected 5 aluminum-tagged models in 20 × 10 m (W × L) arena within 10 min with detection rates ≥85% for up to depth of 10 cm and 45%–60% at depth of 20 cm. Finally, aluminum tagging did not significantly affect survivorship and behaviors of <span>C. ochus</span>. Our study indicates the potential of metal detector system for tracking <span>C. ochus</span> under soil.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"6fe2000a2ce841b53ec50ec4afe6fb01a26fe1e506c347befb555510325fc3a2","category":"Environment"}
