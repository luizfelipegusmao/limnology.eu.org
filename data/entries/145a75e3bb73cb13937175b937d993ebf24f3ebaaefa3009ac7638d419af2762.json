{"title":"Synthesis of New Complex Ferrite Li0.5MnFe1.5O4, Chemical &ndash; Physical and Electrophysical Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0834/v1","date":1718207681000,"content":"In this article, the sol-gel method was used as a synthesis method, which shows the physico –chemical nature of the synthesis of a new complex material ferrit Li0.5MnFe1.5O4. The synthesized structure and structure were determined by the method of X-ray phase analysis. According to the analysis indicators, it was found that our compound is single-phase, spinel-structured, and syngony - cubic type. The microstructure of the compound and the quantitative composition of the elements contained were analyzed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Through a scanning electron microscope, Microsystems were taken from different parts of l Li0.5MnFe1.5O4-type crystallite, the elemental composition of crystals was analyzed, and the general type of surface layer of complex ferrite was shown. As a result, the fact that the compound consists of a single phase, the clarity of its construction was determined by the topography and chemical composition of the compound. As a result, it was found that the newly synthesized complex ferrites correspond to the Formula Li0.5MnFe1.5O4. The particles of the formed compounds have a large size (between 50.0 μm, 20.0 μm and 10.0 μm). Electro physical measurements were carried out on the LCR - 800 unit at intervals of 293-483 K and at frequencies of 1.5 and 10 kHz. The increase in frequency to 10 kHz led to a decrease in the value ε in the range of the studied temperature (293-483 K).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"145a75e3bb73cb13937175b937d993ebf24f3ebaaefa3009ac7638d419af2762","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
