{"title":"Emergence of Two Different Genotypes of Bagaza Virus (BAGV) Affecting Red-Legged Partridges in Spain, in 2019 and 2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2212/v1","date":1722229967000,"content":"Bagaza virus (BAGV) is a flavivirus that affects avian species. In Europe, it was detected for the first time in Spain in 2010, exhibiting high genetic relatedness to Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus (ITMV) isolates from Israel. After a period of epidemiological silence, BAGV re-emerged causing important outbreaks in 2019 and 2021. This study aims to characterize the newly detected strains and to elucidate if these recent outbreaks were caused by single or different virus introductions into the country. Hence, Spanish BAGV isolates from 2019 (n=3) and 2021 (n=1) outbreaks, obtained from red-legged partridges in CÃ¡diz, were sequenced and further characterized. The phylogenetic analyses showed that they belong to two different genotypes: BAGV Genotype 1 and 2. Isolates from 2019 belong to BAGV-Genotype 1, closely related to isolates from Senegal, where BAGV has been circulating since decades. In turn, the 2021 isolate belong to BAGV-Genotype 2, closely related to those detected in Spain in 2010. Additionally, the comparison of the viral polyproteins of several BAGV isolates from both genotypes support and confirm the phylogenetic findings. To conclude, BAGV has been introduced into Spain in at least three independent occasions, with alternating genetic clades, thus confirming that BAGV is able to occasionally reach southern Europe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2ff7907589585f1ec70de60c18bd0a9fd768b9208a5cffd393809b8ab6eafb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
