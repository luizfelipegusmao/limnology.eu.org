{"title":"GeoQuickView: Simplifying LiDAR-Derived Raster Visualization for Everyone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2336/v1","date":1722291207000,"content":"GeoQuickView is a software application designed to bridge the gap between advanced Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and users with no prior experience in GIS. This paper explores the development, functionality, and user-centric design of GeoQuickView, highlighting its capabilities in loading, visualizing, and analyzing geographic data. Emphasis is placed on its use with LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), user-friendly interface, and robust tools for measurement and digitization. The applicationâ€™s role in democratizing access to complex geospatial data is discussed, alongside potential applications and future developments. The software was designed to work seamlessly with data from Romania and can display various types of raster elevation data. While the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) may present challenges for data extraction outside of Romania, the data can still be visualized effectively within the app. The application is available upon request.
