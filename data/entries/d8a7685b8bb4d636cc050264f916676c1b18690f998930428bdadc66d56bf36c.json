{"title":"Quantitative approach to quality review of prenatal ultrasound examinations: Fetal biometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1746/v1","date":1719297973000,"content":"Conclusions: The quantitative method provides a large-scale overview of the biometry measurements of an entire practice. Image audits can then be focused on sonographers whose measurements are outliers, avoiding the time, complexity, and expense of auditing those whose measurements fall within the expected range. We encourage commercial software developers to include tools in their ultrasound reporting software to facilitate such quantitative review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8a7685b8bb4d636cc050264f916676c1b18690f998930428bdadc66d56bf36c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
