{"title":"Screening and Network Pharmacological Analysis of Korean National Insurance‐Covered Herbal Prescriptions with Therapeutic Potential for Mitigating Inflammation in Respiratory Tracts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0306/v1","date":1722869348000,"content":"Long COVID is a persistent symptom that appears in many COVID-19 patients, regardless of whether they are asymptomatic, mild, or severe. At least 10% worldwide are suffering from long COVID. The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells using six Korean national insurance-covered herbal prescriptions with therapeutic potential for mitigating inflammation in the respiratory tract, and additional network pharmacology analysis was performed. Soshihotang (SST) significantly downregulated iNOS and COX2 expression, reduced the production of NO (nitric oxide) and inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, and inhibited IκBα phosphorylation and reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. Network pharmacological analysis showed that SST was closely related to the NF-κB signaling pathway. Further study on the potential of herbal prescriptions will be needed before they can be used clinically by long COVID patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61025d1191c47addbe3ace717ee2097f8ba2677d72dd211f41f0539308815d9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
