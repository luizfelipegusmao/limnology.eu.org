{"title":"Cyclotron Resonance in YFe5O12 Single Crystals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1777/v1","date":1716814427000,"content":"Cyclotron resonance is found in nanosized local regions single crystal samples of yttrium-iron garnet. This resonance was observed in 8 mm microwave range at room temperature. This resonance manifests itself as in the form of free- electrons subsystem excitations, or in the form of mixed spin-electron modes. The existence of cyclotron resonance convincingly indicates the presence phenomenon of Phase Separation in yttrium-iron garnet single crystals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc9147b5c03291738ef9efdc0e2905e028901ddfc9e1f1c31aa245bd5114df40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
