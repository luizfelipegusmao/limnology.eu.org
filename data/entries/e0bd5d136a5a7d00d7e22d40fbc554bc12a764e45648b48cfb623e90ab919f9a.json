{"title":"Influence of the Opening Time Interval of Gate Signals on Suppression of Horizontally-Polarized Signal of an Infrared Pulsed Laser","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0075/v1","date":1725267618000,"content":"Since the beginning of the 21th century, infrared Nd:YVO4 pulsed lasers have been widely applied especially in some actual industrial processes. In the working process of a laser-aided etching device, the “match-head” effect must be effectively controlled by suppressing the first giant pulse for a solid-state Q-switched laser. In the process of optimizing the infrared Nd:YVO4 pulsed laser by adjusting the slope parameters of the radio frequency (RF) modulation to suppress the first giant pulse, it has been come across that some abnormal horizontally polarized emission with a very short time appears before the formal vertically polarized emission when the gate signal is artificially started. Actually, abnormal horizontally polarized emission will bring some unexpected machining traces during the production process and even greater dangers. The experimental results show that with the increase of the slope duration of a RF signal, the existence time of abnormal output horizontal polarized light will be shortened, and the horizontal giant pulse and vertical giant pulse are well suppressed. When the slope duration is greater than 0.18 ms both horizontal and vertical giant pulses will disappear. The horizontal polarized light can be thoroughly suppressed when the slope duration is greater than 13.7 ms. Compared with the method of adding polarizer to eliminate abnormal output horizontal polarized light, this method does not add elements in the laser, ensuring that the laser volume is relatively small, and does not affect the quality of the normal output laser. The research conclusion is thought to be of great practical significance especially for processing transparent materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0bd5d136a5a7d00d7e22d40fbc554bc12a764e45648b48cfb623e90ab919f9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
