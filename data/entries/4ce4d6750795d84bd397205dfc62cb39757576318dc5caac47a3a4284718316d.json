{"title":"A Tri-mode of Mock-Walker Cells","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-023-3032-7","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This work uses cloud-resolving simulations to study mock-Walker cells driven by a specified sea surface temperature (SST). The associated precipitation in the mock-Walker cells exhibits three different modes, including a single peak of precipitation over the SST maximum (mode 1), symmetric double peaks of precipitation straddling the SST maximum (mode 2), and a single peak of precipitation on one side of the SST maximum (mode 3). The three modes are caused by three distinct convective activity center migration traits. Analyses indicate that the virtual effect of water vapor plays an important role in differentiating the three modes. When the SST gradient is large, the virtual effect may be strong enough to overcome the temperature effect, generating a low-level low-pressure anomaly below the ascending branch of the Walker cell off the center. The results here highlight the importance of the virtual effect of water vapor and its interaction with convection and large-scale circulation in the Walker circulation.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"4ce4d6750795d84bd397205dfc62cb39757576318dc5caac47a3a4284718316d","category":"Environment"}
