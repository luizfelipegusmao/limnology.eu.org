{"title":"Haematology and plasma biochemistry reference intervals of Espa침ola, San Cristobal and Eastern Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoise species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae055/7733852?rss=1","date":1723680000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Normal reference intervals (RI) of hematologic and biochemical parameters are important for assessing and monitoring the health status of captive and free-living chelonians; however, such information is not available for most wildlife species. Giant Galapagos tortoises are one of the most iconic animals on earth and health information can make an important contribution to their conservation and management. This study provides formal RI of haematology and plasma biochemistry parameters and describes cell morphology along with morphometrics of free-living Eastern Santa Cruz (<span>Chelonoidis donfaustoi</span>), Espa침ola (<span>Chelonoidis hoodensis</span>) and San Crist칩bal tortoises (<span>Chelonoidis chathamensis</span>). We explored differences in blood parameters between sexes, across the tortoise species in this study and with previously published RI of the Western Santa Cruz tortoise (<span>Chelonoidis porteri</span>). Biochemistry parameters of both Santa Cruz species were overall more similar to each other than to Espa침ola and San Cristobal tortoises. This research constitutes the first RI for these three Galapagos tortoise species and may be of value for advising captive-breeding and conservation plans. We recommend further research to establish RI in additional tortoise species so we may better understand and interpret haematology and biochemistry parameters as a valuable conservation tool for species of this critically endangered taxon.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"3228dbacf2ad7419ffa2fc98d658e55ab2610e9c18d0ddb3d80b1d386d046535","category":"Environment"}
