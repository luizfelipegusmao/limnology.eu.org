{"title":"On Feature Selection Techniques for Detecting DoS Attacks with a Multi-class Classifier","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1635/v1","date":1711494975000,"content":"In a hyperconnected society, computer networks play a pivotal role in all activities that permeate our daily lives. In the context of smart cities, theses networks play a pivotal role in enhancing urban efficiency and sustainability. The continuous flow of packets in these networks poses security challenges, from personal data leakage to service unavailability. Anomaly-based methods are commonly used to detect network attacks. In this context, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) emerges as a solution for anomaly detection in network traffic, facilitating comprehensive, real-time analyses and dynamic adaptation to changes. This study aims to present a systematic review of feature selection techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of attribute selection with a multi-class classifier in network anomaly detection. The objective of this paper is to inspire future research and identify trade-offs among these techniques for detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Based on the findings, the analysis of the entire dataset yields superior results in terms of precision (99%), but using the output of OneR, although resulting in a slight loss of precision compared to the complete dataset, presents the highest precision among other studied techniques, indicating a trade-off between precision and processing time efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f435686137bd6a566ddaa1c98cc798fd2a4585734cf03940d06383d3bf354e03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
