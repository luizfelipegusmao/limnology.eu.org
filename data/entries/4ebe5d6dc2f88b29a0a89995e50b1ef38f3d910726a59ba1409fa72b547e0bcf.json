The performance of these devices strongly depends on the ultrafast carrier dynamics, referring to the generation, relaxation, and recombination processes of charged carriers. Therefore, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of carrier dynamics with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolutions is vital to providing optimization strategies for the design of wide bandgap devices with enhanced performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4ebe5d6dc2f88b29a0a89995e50b1ef38f3d910726a59ba1409fa72b547e0bcf","category":"Environment"}
