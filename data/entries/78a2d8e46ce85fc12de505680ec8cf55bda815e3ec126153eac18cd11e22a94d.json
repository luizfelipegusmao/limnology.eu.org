In the laboratory, an X-ray microbeam can be created by using X-ray focusing optics such as polycapillary X-ray lens. Micro-XRF analysis measures the elemental distributions by scanning the sample. A confocal micro-XRF (CM-XRF) is one of special configurations of micro-XRF, and it is a unique elemental analytical technique which enables depth elemental imaging inside the sample [<a href=\"#ozae044.124-B1\">1</a>]. This technique enables 3 dimensional XRF analysis by scanning the sample, as shown in Fig. 1. In my presentations, fundamentals of X-ray focusing optics, Micro-XRF, CM-XRF, and their applications to forensic samples, industrial samples, etc. will be shown [<a href=\"#ozae044.124-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"78a2d8e46ce85fc12de505680ec8cf55bda815e3ec126153eac18cd11e22a94d","category":"Environment"}
