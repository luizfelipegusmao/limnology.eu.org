Learning and memory involve cognitive processes with associated costs, and it is expected that different levels of learning will occur in taxa from different environments. Greater memory loads linked to increased environmental complexity require greater learning and memory capacities. We investigated the variation in learning and memory in sister taxa of striped mice (genus <i>Rhabdomys</i>). We studied two populations each of the mesic grassland-occurring <i>R. d. chakae</i> and the mostly arid-occurring <i>R. pumilio.</i> We conducted two sets of experiments. (1) In a novel object recognition (NOR) test, we assessed memory by recording the duration of exploration of similar and novel objects by test mice. (2) In an associative learning task, we assessed whether mice could associate specific scents with or without a food incentive or with different quantities of the food incentive in previous training phases. We measured the latency of mice to contact scents in a two-sample choice in the test phase. In the NOR test, <i>R. pumilio</i> spent less time investigating similar objects in a training trial than <i>R. d. chakae</i> but increased absolute exploration of the novel object when presented with a novel and a familiar object in the retention trial, suggesting a sensitization to the novel object by <i>R. pumilio</i>. In the associative learning experiments, <i>R. pumilio</i> approached the stimuli faster than <i>R. d. chakae</i>, whereas mice from both taxa preferred scents associated with a seed versus no seed and scents associated with 5 seeds versus 1 seed. The data provide evidence of taxon-level differences in learning and memory, likely related to environmentally modulated personality differences between the taxa.</p>","author":"Candice N.
