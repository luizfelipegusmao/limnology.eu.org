{"title":"Improving the Estimation of Lake Ice Thickness with High Resolution Radar Altimetry Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1961/v1","date":1716977368000,"content":"Lake ice thickness (LIT) is a sensitive indicator of climate change identified as a thematic variable of Lakes as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Here, we present a novel and efficient analytically based retracking approach for estimating LIT from high-resolution Ku-band (13.6 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimetry data. The retracker method is based on the analytical modeling of the SAR radar echoes over ice-covered lakes that show a characteristic double-peak feature attributed to the reflection of the Ku-band radar waves at the snow-ice and ice-water interfaces. The method is applied to Sentinel-6 Unfocused SAR (UFSAR) and Fully Focused SAR (FFSAR) data, with their corresponding tailored waveform model, referred to as the SAR_LITand FFSAR_LITretracker, respectively. LIT retrievals from Sentinel-6 SAR data at different posting rates are evaluated against those obtained from thermodynamic lake ice model simulations and Low Resolution Mode (LRM) Sentinel-6 and Jason-3 data over two ice seasons during the tandem phase of the two satellites, allowing precise assessment of the continuity between LRM and SAR LIT retrievals. Consistency checks of the Sentinel-6 SAR LIT estimates are also performed using optical/radar images that provide information on the snow/ice conditions on the same dates. The analysis is performed on Great Slave Lake and Baker Lake (Canada) that differ in terms of lake size, bathymetry, snow/ice properties, and seasonal evolution of LIT. The accuracy of the LIT estimates with the SAR LIT retrackers is on the order of 5 cm once the ice is well established on the lakes, meeting the GCOS requirements of LIT measurement uncertainty, which is a factor of 2 to 3 times better than that of LIT obtained with LRM data, bringing a further improvement compared to previous analyses and methods. The SAR LIT retrackers presented are promising tools for monitoring the inter-annual variability and trends in LIT from current and future SAR altimetry missions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a2b2e7e5f34649a81b019403dd75a2365f51b53eb4f145ff6d5a85d2588beb1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
