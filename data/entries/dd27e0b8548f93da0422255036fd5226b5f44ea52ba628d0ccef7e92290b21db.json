These disinfectant solutions are unavailable to many communities worldwide due to resource limitations, among other constraints. Safe and effective chlorine-based disinfectants can be produced via simple electrolysis of salt water, providing a low-cost and reliable option for on-site, local production of disinfectant solutions to improve sanitation and hygiene. This study reports on a system (herein called “Electro-Clean”) that can produce concentrated solutions of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) using readily available, low-cost materials. With just table salt, water, graphite welding rods, and a DC power supply, the Electro-Clean system can safely produce HOCl solutions (~1.5 liters) of up to 0.1% free chlorine (i.e.,1000 ppm) in less than two hours at low potential (5 V DC) and modest current (~5 A). Rigorous testing of free chlorine production and durability of the Electro-Clean system components, described here, has been verified to work in multiple locations around the world, including microbiological tests conducted in India and Mexico to confirm the biocidal efficacy of the Electro-Clean solution as a surface disinfectant. Cost estimates are provided for making HOCl locally with this method in the USA, India, and Mexico. Findings indicate that Electro-Clean is an affordable alternative to off-the-shelf commercial chlorinator systems in terms of first costs (or capital costs), and cost-competitive relative to the unit cost of the disinfectant produced. By minimizing dependence on supply chains and allowing for local production, the Electro-Clean system has the potential to improve public health by addressing the need for disinfectant solutions in resource-constrained communities.","author":"Andrea Naranjo-Soledad","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"dd27e0b8548f93da0422255036fd5226b5f44ea52ba628d0ccef7e92290b21db","category":"Environment"}
