{"title":"India Environmental Policy: A Systematic Literature Review impact of Air Pollution toward Taj Mahal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0693/v1","date":1715363816000,"content":"This paper focuses on environmental policies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on the Taj Mahal, an iconic structure built on the banks of the Yamuna River from 1632 to 1653 with a blend of Persian and Indian architectural styles. The Taj Mahal is threatened by damage caused by climate change, including air pollution resulting in acid rain and floods that lead to erosion and discoloration of the main marble material of the Taj Mahal. This study employs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of peer-reviewed journal articles with a primary focus on environmental policy, the impacts of climate change, and the preventive measures undertaken by the Indian government. Based on the analysis of 270 papers, it is concluded that out of the total, 30 papers specifically address objectives relevant to this research. The study period spans from 2014 to 2024. The research findings reveal that air pollution has a significantly adverse impact on the Taj Mahal. Furthermore, nine policies are generally identified from the journal literature review aimed at preserving and protecting the Taj Mahal from the negative effects caused by air pollution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c7ae65c457810306f38d2ee544b7ebe00088444e9f9ad12b0b056aa7300be07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
