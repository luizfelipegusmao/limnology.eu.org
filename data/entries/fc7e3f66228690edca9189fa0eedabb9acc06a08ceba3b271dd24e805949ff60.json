Using a combination of genomic and phenotypic data, we present evidence of the early stages of a radiation in prickly pear cactus (<span>Opuntia</span>), a lineage widespread across the archipelago. We show that despite extensive ecophenotypic variation, there is limited genomic differentiation, consistent with the hypothesis that <span>Opuntia</span> is in the early stages of the diversification process. Phylogenomic and population genomic analyses show that notwithstanding low genetic differentiation across islands, there is marked geographical structure that is broadly consistent with the palaeogeography of the Galápagos. Because low genetic differentiation stands in stark contrast to the exceptional eco-phenotypic diversity displayed by cacti, it is plausible that the genetic architecture of phenotypic divergence mismatches our genomic sequencing, that phenotypic plasticity precedes genetic divergence and is the source of adaptive evolution, or that introgression influences local adaptation. Models of population relationships including admixture indicate that gene flow is common, probably facilitated by dispersal via animals known to feed on <span>Opuntia</span> flowers, fruits, and seeds. Because the prickly pear cacti of the Galápagos are a radiation in the making, they provide an exciting opportunity to investigate the interplay between ecological and genomic mechanisms promoting diversification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"3a6bf3189332aa8d860b0369d5aa2ac065f7385b7c3f4543469ad2a55950d26a","entryHash":"fc7e3f66228690edca9189fa0eedabb9acc06a08ceba3b271dd24e805949ff60","category":"Environment"}
