{"title":"Sustainable Supply Chains and Green Marketing: A Qualitative Examination of Consumer Responses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1701/v1","date":1719232415000,"content":"This qualitative study explores consumer responses to sustainable supply chains and green marketing strategies, aiming to uncover insights into consumer behavior, perceptions, and attitudes towards sustainability in the marketplace. Through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with 30 participants, the study examines key factors influencing consumer trust in green marketing claims, barriers to adopting sustainable products, generational differences in attitudes towards sustainability, and the impact of social media on consumer perceptions. Findings reveal that consumers value transparency and credibility in green claims, preferring products certified by trusted third parties and companies that demonstrate transparent supply chain practices. Higher pricing, concerns about product effectiveness, and limited availability emerged as significant barriers to consumer adoption of sustainable products, highlighting the need for cost competitiveness and increased market accessibility. Generational cohorts, particularly Millennials and Generation Z, exhibit strong inclinations towards sustainability-driven behaviors, shaping market trends towards ethical consumption practices. Social media plays a pivotal role in influencing consumer perceptions, disseminating information about sustainability, and fostering engagement with environmental issues. The study underscores the importance of clear communication, consumer education, and supportive regulatory frameworks in promoting sustainable consumption behaviors. Practical implications include recommendations for businesses to enhance transparency, innovate sustainable products, align with consumer values, leverage social media platforms, and advocate for regulatory measures that uphold environmental standards. By addressing these insights, businesses and policymakers can effectively meet consumer expectations and contribute to sustainable development goals in the global marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d9c2064086c35de6234de36f2ed9db7d362ea8c54e69cf04a7b1ab4f6ad0d06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
