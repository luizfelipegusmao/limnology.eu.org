Both single- and dual-phase RHEAs demonstrated the ability to deliver sufficient mechanical properties at temperatures exceeding superalloy applications. However, RHEAs are currently limited by insufficient oxidation resistance leading to fast structural degradation from their surface. Partially, it is caused by the low structure and phase stability of multicomponent alloys, especially in the presence of oxygen. Exploration of large refractory compositional space with a limited amount of elements offers a bottom-up approach to establishing fundamental guidelines for the design of stable refractory high entropy alloys. One of the ways to accelerate alloy design is combinatorial material libraries screening obtained by thin-film magnetron sputtering [<a href=\"#ozae044.647-B5\">5</a>]. A large number of compositional variants combined with high-throughput materials characterization allows for the identification of relationships and patterns significantly faster than conventional alloy design.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6c8569db098b9b208a9a2b52dc8b35c75184cd051ecdcba9769d58e7a9d4b3c1","category":"Environment"}
