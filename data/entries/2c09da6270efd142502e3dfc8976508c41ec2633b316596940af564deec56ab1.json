{"title":"A Review on the Versatile Applications of Plant-Based Essential Oils in Food Flavoring, Culinary Uses and Health Benefits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2073/v1","date":1719597777000,"content":"Plant-based essential oils are important natural products rich in volatile compounds, and they have various applications in medicine, food, perfumery and cosmetics. These substances can be produced using various methods, such as steam distillation and solvent extraction. Their chemical composition is influenced by geographical and climatic conditions, production methods, and intrinsic factors. Published articles and literature were scanned to gather the required information. Previous studies have shown that essential oils possess chief health benefits, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and psychological effects. Consequently, they have wide applications in the food industry as preservatives in food systems and in active packaging, edible coating, probiotic foods, and flavoring. Essential oils can be successfully utilized in flavoring foods and beverages such as cheese, ice cream, and soft drinks. Despite their great antimicrobial and flavoring roles, it is important to further investigate their possible interactions with food components and the physiochemical characteristics of foods flavored with essential oils.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c09da6270efd142502e3dfc8976508c41ec2633b316596940af564deec56ab1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
