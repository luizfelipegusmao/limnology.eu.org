{"title":"E-Zakat: Management Information System of Zakat (Maal and al-Fitr)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0088/v1","date":1719832524000,"content":"The distribution of zakat, which is still carried out directly through mosques or zakat amil bodies, can hinder the payment process due to inaccurate calculations and difficulties in finding zakat amil institutions. In the digital era, information technology is very important in the management of zakat, alms, and infaq. Therefore, a zakat information management system was created. The e-Zakat program, developed using the waterfall method, plays an important role in five main aspects of zakat management: muzaki and mustahiq data collection, zakat collection, zakat distribution, mustahiq development, and reporting. The use of information technology in this program is expected to increase efficiency, accountability, transparency, as well as the reach of zakat and muzaki involvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3df96079010217644b67be1e11d996e4b9b651ece33861c184fe606712115473","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
