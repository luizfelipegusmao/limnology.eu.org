{"title":"CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY OF Yb2+ DOPED CsI SINGLE CRYSTAL","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0797/v1","date":1715579297000,"content":"Solving the problem of searching for new scintillators based on available materials, we were the first to obtain and study a single crystal of CsI doped with divalent ytterbium ions. This work was directed to study of luminescence mechanism of Yb2+ ions and excitation transfer from crystalline matrix of CsI to dopant ions under VUV excitation. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, spin-allowed and spin-forbidden radiative transitions of ytterbium ions at room temperature were discovered. At 10 degrees, the emission of self-trapped excitons was detected. UV and VUV excitation spectra were obtained in the emission bands of ytterbium and self-trapped excitons. It was found that Yb2+ luminescence is excited in the excitonic region in the range of 10-45 eV. The mechanism of charge compensation of Yb2+ ions in a CsI crystal was also studied, the spectrum of the thermally stimulated depolarization current was measured, and the activation energies of the two observed peaks were calculated. These peaks belong to impurity-vacancy complexes in two different positions.It is concluded that Yb2+ ions are promising dopants for CsI scintillators and X-ray phosphors in combination with SiPM photodetectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57621db1ea657972cf8b18aee9a2819d6453ab3ec03fcaad7f0982c4d9110c58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
