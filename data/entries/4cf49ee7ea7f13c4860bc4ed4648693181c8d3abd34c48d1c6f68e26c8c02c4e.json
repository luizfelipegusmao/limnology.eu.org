{"title":"French Polynesian Scytosiphonaceae (Ectocarpales, Phaeophyceae): A combined molecular and morphological approach to their diversity and systematics","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13432?af=R","date":1712751025000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study revisited the taxonomy and diversity of brown macroalgae within the Scytosiphonaceae family in French Polynesia, which had previously been recognized as encompassing only six species. Using the chloroplast and mitochondrial genes <i>rbc</i>L, <i>psb</i>A, and <i>cox</i>3 as molecular markers in conjunction with morpho-anatomical observations, we unveiled the presence of 11 species spanning six genera: <i>Chnoospora minima</i>, <i>Colpomenia claytoniae</i>, <i>Co. sinuosa</i> [groups IIIa and IIIb], <i>Hydroclathrus rapanuii</i>, <i>H. tenuis</i>, <i>H. tilesii</i>, <i>Manzaea minuta</i>, <i>Pseudochnoospora implexa</i>, <i>Rosenvingea australis</i>, and the newly described species <i>R. polynesiensis</i> sp. nov. and <i>R. tahitiensis</i> sp. nov. This encompasses the recognition of two previously unreported genera in this region: <i>Manzaea</i> and <i>Pseudochnoospora</i>. Sequences were successfully acquired for four taxa that had been documented previously, while the absence of sequences for <i>H. clathratus</i> and <i>H. tumulis</i> in French Polynesia raises queries about their presence in this region. With these additions, the total species count now stands at 13 (including <i>H. clathratus</i> and <i>H. tumulis</i>), one being an endemic species. The molecular-assisted alpha taxonomic approach used here allowed for a critical revision of the Scytosiphonaceae species checklist for French Polynesia. The diversity revealed in this region accounts for a substantial 20% of the family's global diversity. Additionally, our study presents an updated species-level phylogeny for the Scytosiphonaceae.</p>","author":"Christophe Vieira, \nMyung Sook Kim, \nMayalen Zubia","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"4cf49ee7ea7f13c4860bc4ed4648693181c8d3abd34c48d1c6f68e26c8c02c4e","category":"Environment"}
