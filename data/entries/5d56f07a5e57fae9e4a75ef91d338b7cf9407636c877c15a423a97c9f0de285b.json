{"title":"Assessment and optimization of a single flash geothermal system recovered by a trans‐critical CO2 cycle using different scenarios","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14371?af=R","date":1706770429000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In the evolving landscape of sustainable energy, optimizing geothermal power systems presents a critical challenge. This study explores the energy and exergy efficiencies of a power production system utilizing a single-flash geothermal cycle integrated with a trans-critical CO<sub>2</sub> cycle. The study's methodology involves a detailed examination of key performance parameters—separator pressure, CO<sub>2</sub> turbine intake pressure, and steam turbine output pressure. Utilizing the EES software environment, the study innovatively employs a combination of Genetic Algorithm (GA), Nelder–Mead Simplex (NMS) method, and Direct algorithm (DA). When using GA, NMS and DA, the system's exergy efficiency increases from 32.46% in the default operating mode to 39.21%, 36.16%, and 38.82%, respectively. One of the notable outcomes is the identification of optimal separator pressure for maximum energy efficiency. Furthermore, the study reveals that increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> turbine's inlet pressure adversely impacts the system's efficiency. The study's results contribute significantly to the field of renewable energy, offering practical guidelines for enhancing the performance of geothermal power systems.</p>","author":"Yashar Aryanfar, \nHumberto Garcia Castellanos, \nFarshad Akhgarzarandy, \nAli Keçebaş, \nSalem Algarni, \nTalal Alqahtani, \nKashif Irshad, \nElsayed M.
