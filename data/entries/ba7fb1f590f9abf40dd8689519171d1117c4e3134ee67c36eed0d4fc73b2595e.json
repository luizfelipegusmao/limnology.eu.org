{"title":"Could future ocean acidification be affecting the energy budgets of marine fish?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae069/7815630?rss=1","date":1728345600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>With the unprecedented environmental changes caused by climate change including ocean acidification, it has become crucial to understand the responses and adaptive capacity of fish to better predict directional changes in the ecological landscape of the future. We conducted a systematic literature review to examine if simulated ocean acidification (sOA) could influence growth and reproduction in fish within the dynamic energy budget theory framework. As such, we chose to examine metabolic rate, locomotion, food assimilation and growth in early life stages (i.e. larvae and juvenile) and adults. Our goal was to evaluate if acclimatization to sOA has any directional changes in these traits and to explore potential implications for energetic trade-offs in these for growth and reproduction. We found that sOA had negligible effects on energetic expenditure for maintenance and aerobic metabolism due to the robust physiological capacity regulating acidâ€“base and ion perturbations but substantive effects on locomotion, food assimilation and growth. We demonstrated evidence that sOA significantly reduced growth performance of fish in early life stages, which may have resulted from reduced food intake and digestion efficiency. Also, our results showed that sOA may enhance reproduction with increased numbers of offspring although this may come at the cost of altered reproductive behaviours or offspring fitness. While these results indicate evidence for changes in energy budgets because of physiological acclimatization to sOA, the heterogeneity of results in the literature suggests that physiological and neural mechanisms need to be clearly elucidated in future studies. Lastly, most studies on sOA have been conducted on early life stages, which necessitates that more studies should be conducted on adults to understand reproductive success and thus better predict cohort and population dynamics under ongoing climate change.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"ba7fb1f590f9abf40dd8689519171d1117c4e3134ee67c36eed0d4fc73b2595e","category":"Environment"}
