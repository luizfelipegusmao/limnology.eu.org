{"title":"Double-Needle Meniscal Suture Technique: Technical Description and Clinical Application in Dogs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1832/v1","date":1724670704000,"content":"Current treatments for medial meniscus lesions in association with CCL ruptures [1–5] have shown disappointing long-term outcomes [6]. Meniscal suturing may improve the outcome, but their clinical application remains limited [7–9]. This study aims to assess the practicability of a minimally invasive DNT to facilitate meniscal suturing in dogs. \nTen stifles of eight client-owned dogs with arthroscopically confirmed CCL disease and medial meniscal tears in the abaxial third of the meniscus were included. The described suture technique was applied under joint distraction using the Titan joint distractor.[8] Surgical stabilization of all stifles was then accomplished through a X-Porous TTA procedure [10]. \nThe DNT allowed for the precise placement of meniscal sutures. Minor intraoperative complications included reduced arthroscopic visibility (n=2) and suture breakage during its passage through the meniscus (n=3). No complications related to the meniscal sutures were noted throughout the six-month follow-up.\nThe described DNT proved to be a viable and effective method for suturing lesions of the caudal horn of the medial meniscus, provided there is adequate visualization during the procedure. Appropriate stifle stabilization postoperatively is mandatory for protecting the suture and avoiding concomitant meniscal lesions due to joint instability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d14eeda191ccd34b0370c741d7a2c1425b250301f4626e261693f6c1d64cd5b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
