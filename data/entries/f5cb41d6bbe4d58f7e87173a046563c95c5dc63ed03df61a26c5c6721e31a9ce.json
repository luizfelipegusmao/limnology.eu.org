{"title":"Identification of Some Potential Host Cellular Receptors and Enzymes that Potentially Refine the Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) Tissue Tropism, Replication, and Pathogenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0626/v1","date":1725860066000,"content":"The information about the BCoV receptors, co/receptors that might be involved in the BCoV entry to the host cells is inconceivable. In addition to that, the roles of other host cell proteases, such as Furin and TMPRSS2, have not yet been well studied during BCoV replication. The current studyâ€™s main objectives are to identify some novel BCoV receptors and host cell proteases that might fine-tune the BCoV replication, tissue tropism, and molecular pathogenesis. We used a combination of some in silico prediction, molecular docking, and gene expression profile tools to predict some new BCoV receptors out of some known other coronavirus receptors and some host cell enzymes that are potentially involved in BCoV replication. To achieve these goals, we applied the in-silico prediction tools to check the potential interactions between eh BCoV/S glycoprotein and some known coronaviruses receptors (ACE2, APN1, NPR1, CECAM-1, AXL, and DPP4). We also established some potential models for the interaction between the BCoV/S and some common host cell proteases proved to play important roles in other coronavirus replication cycle (Furin, TMPRRS2, and Cathepsin-L). To confirm our prediction models, we assessed the gene expression profiles of these potential receptors and proteases in some bovine cell lines infected with BCoV using the next generation sequencing and the qRT-PCR assay. Our results show that the NPR1, AXL1 and the ACE2 have the strongest and firm binding affinities to the BCoV-S protein. Our prediction models and gene expression profiles show the potential bindings of the Furin and TMPRSS2 to the BCoV-S polybasic cleavage site (RRSRR|A). Notably, high expression of the host cell Furin was observed in response to both BCoV/Ent and BCoV/Resp infection, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was upregulated in the case of the BCoV/Ent infection, positioning Furin as a common receptor for different BCoV isolates. Further research is needed to study the roles of these top-ranked receptors and host cell proteases in molecular pathogenesis, and tissue tropism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5cb41d6bbe4d58f7e87173a046563c95c5dc63ed03df61a26c5c6721e31a9ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
