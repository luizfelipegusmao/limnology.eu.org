{"title":"Maternal supplementation with konjac glucomannan improves maternal microbiota for healthier offspring during lactation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13258?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The maternal diet during gestation and lactation affects the health of the offspring. Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is a significantly functional polysaccharide in food research, possessing both antioxidant and prebiotic properties. However, the mechanisms of how KGM regulates maternal nutrition remain insufficient and limited. This study aimed to investigate maternal supplementation with KGM during late gestation and lactation to benefit both maternal and offspring generations.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Our findings indicate that KGM improves serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, the KGM group displayed a significant increase in the feed intake-related hormones neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), Ghrelin, and adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) levels. KGM modified the relative abundance of <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Candidatus Saccharimonas</i>, unclassified <i>Firmicutes</i>, and unclassified <i>Christensenellaceae</i> in sow feces. Acetate, valerate, and isobutyrate were also improved in the feces of sows in the KGM group. These are potential target bacterial genera that may modulate the host's health. Furthermore, Spearman's correlation analysis unveiled significant correlations between the altered bacteria genus and feed intake-related hormones. More importantly, KGM reduced interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in milk, further improved IL-10 levels, and reduced zonulin levels in the serum of offspring.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, maternal dietary supplementation with KGM during late gestation and lactation improves maternal nutritional status by modifying maternal microbial and increasing lactation feed intake, which benefits the anti-inflammatory capacity of the offspring serum. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Feng Gao, \nWentao Zhang, \nMingming Cao, \nXinyu Liu, \nTingting Han, \nWei He, \nBaoming Shi, \nZhigang Gu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"60fb469cc7bfdf8a2ee263ae3be268e815a4d01cd80112121f856a92e8c64801","category":"Environment"}
