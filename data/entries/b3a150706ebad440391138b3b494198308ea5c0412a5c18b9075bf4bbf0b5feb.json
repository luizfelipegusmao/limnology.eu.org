This study sought to predict fundamental biological attributes of calcareous soils using spectral reflectance data in the Vis-NIR range through the application of partial least square regression (PLSR) and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) techniques. The objective was to derive spectrotransfer functions (STFs) to predict selected soil biological attributes. A total of 97 composite samples were collected from three distinct agricultural land uses, i.e., sugarcane, wheat, and date palm, in the Khuzestan Province, Iran. The samples were analyzed using both standard laboratory analysis and proximal sensing approach within the Vis-NIR range (400â€“2500 nm). Biological status was evaluated by determining soil enzyme activities linked to nutrient cycling including acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), dehydrogenase (DEH), soil microbial respiration (SMR), microbial biomass phosphorus (P<sub>mic</sub>), and microbial biomass carbon (C<sub>mic</sub>). The results indicated that the developed PLSR models exhibited superior predictive performance in most biological parameters compared to the STFs, although the differences were not significant. Specifically, the STFs acceptably accurately predicted ACP, ALP, DEH, SMR, P<sub>mic</sub>, and C<sub>mic</sub> with R<sup>2</sup><sub>val</sub> (val = validation dataset) values of 0.68, 0.67, 0.65, 0.65, 0.76, and 0.72, respectively. These findings confirm the potential of Vis-NIR spectroscopy and the effectiveness of the associated STFs as a rapid and reliable technique for assessing biological soil quality. Overall, in the context of predicting soil properties using spectroscopy-based approaches, emphasis must be placed on developing straightforward, easily deployable, and pragmatic STFs.","author":"Elias Hosseini","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b3a150706ebad440391138b3b494198308ea5c0412a5c18b9075bf4bbf0b5feb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
