{"title":"Analysis of Key Environmental Variables Affecting Fish Communities and Species Distribution in Asian Lotic Ecosystems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1863/v1","date":1729739989000,"content":"In 2011, Korea installed artificial structures on four rivers to secure water resources and reduce flood damage; however, these structures have altered ecosystems and aquatic communities. This study analyzed fish communities and environmental variables at 72 sites in the Geumgang River. Fish communities and environmental variables before weir installation were examined using site data from 2008–2009. The results showed that Cyprinidae dominated the 70 observed species. A self-organizing map categorized the 72 sites into 4 groups based on fish communities. Sensitive and insectivorous species decreased, whereas tolerant and omnivorous species increased from Groups I to IV. Twenty-one indicator species were identified, with fewer and less distinct distribution patterns in Groups II and III than in Groups I and IV. The fish assessment index (FAI) showed a decline in grades A and B and an increase in grades C and D from Groups I to IV. Correlation analysis between FAI and environmental variables indicated that fish communities in the Geumgang River were mainly influenced by water quality, reflecting altitude gradients and pollution levels. This study’s findings are anticipated to significantly inform water management strategies for the Geumgang, Yeongsangang, Nakdonggang, and Hangang Rivers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"094e4920c6ec81ecdb5f8162721263120f2c9c1e20a8116e01ca4510c15cbd15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
