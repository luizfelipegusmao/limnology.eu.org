{"title":"On Proving Ramanujan&rsquo;s Inequality using a Sharper Bound for the Prime Counting Function &pi;(x)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0451/v1","date":1723110834000,"content":"This article provides a proof that the Ramanujan's Inequality given by,               $$\\pi(x)^2 &lt; \\frac{e x}{\\log x} \\pi\\Big(\\frac{x}{e}\\Big)$$              holds unconditionally for every $x\\geq \\exp(59)$. In case for an alternate proof of the result stated above, we shall exploit certain estimates involving the Chebyshev Theta Function, $\\vartheta(x)$ in order to derive appropriate bounds for $\\pi(x)$, which'll lead us to a much improved condition for the inequality proposed by Ramanujan to satisfy unconditionally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae9ff3144a5bbac41fd58f3d80e1c1f2277629ea583a238026964a9de8e965c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
