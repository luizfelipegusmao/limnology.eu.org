{"title":"Epithelial-mesenchymal interaction protects normal colonocytes from 4-HNE-induced phenotypic transformation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302932","date":1714140000000,"content":"<p>by Jacques Dupuy, Emma Cogo, Edwin Fouché, Françoise Guéraud, Fabrice Pierre, Pascale Plaisancié</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Recent studies have shown that epithelial-stromal interactions could play a role in the development of colorectal cancer. Here, we investigated the role of fibroblasts in the transformation of normal colonocytes induced by 4-HNE.</p> Methods <p>Normal Co colonocytes and nF fibroblasts from the same mouse colon were exposed, in monoculture (m) or coculture (c), to 4-HNE (5 μM) twice weekly for 3 weeks. Gene expression was then analysed and the ability of Co colonocytes to grow in anchorage-independent conditions was tested in soft agar. Fibroblasts previously treated or not with 4-HNE were also seeded in culture inserts positioned above the agar layers to allow paracrine exchanges with colonocytes.</p> Results <p>First, 60% of the genes studied were modulated by coculture in Co colonocytes, with notably increased expression of BMP receptors. Furthermore, while 4-HNE increased the ability of monoculture-treated Co colonocytes to form colonies, this effect was not observed in coculture-treated Co colonocytes. Adding a selective BMPR1 inhibitor during the treatment phase abolished the protective effect of coculture. Conversely, addition of a BMP4 agonist to the medium of monoculture-treated Co colonocytes prevented phenotypic transformation by 4-HNE. Second, the presence of nF(m)-HNE fibroblasts during the soft agar assay increased the number and size of Co(m) colonocyte colonies, regardless of whether these cells had been previously treated with 4-HNE in monoculture. For soft agar assays performed with nF(c) and Co(c) cells initially treated in coculture, only the reassociation between Co(c)-HNE and nF(c)-HNE resulted in a small increase in the number of colonies.</p> Conclusions <p>During the exposure phase, the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction protected colonocytes from 4-HNE-induced phenotypic transformation via activation of the BMP pathway. This intercellular dialogue also limited the ability of fibroblasts to subsequently promote colonocyte-anchorage-independent growth. In contrast, fibroblasts pre-exposed to 4-HNE in monoculture strongly increased the ability of Co(m) colonocytes to form colonies.</p>","author":"Jacques Dupuy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"49b4795720ace6c7c94ffbebcbcfde3981546f4839349004c27732ff2da07105","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
