{"title":"Process Synthesis, Design and Techno-Economic Assessment of Bio-Succinic Acid Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0364/v1","date":1715071439000,"content":"This paper investigates the potential of different fermentation feedstocks towards succinic acid production. Three alternative flowsheets were constructed and modelled in SuperPro Designerâ„¢, utilizing different fermentation substrates: crude glycerol (a by-product of the biodiesel industry), a commercial 95% glucose syrup and pure glycerol. Techno-economic analysis of the modelled plants showed that all three potential investments can be economically profitable, with the crude glycerol case as the most promising one. The succinic acid production cost for the crude glycerol scenario is estimated at 3.59 $/kg, while a thorough study of the capacity effect to the economics showed that it could drop as low as $2.6 $/kg. Parametric analysis and optimization performed on a flowsheet level, indicated opportunities for lowering the production cost down to 3 $/kg, a value that could pave the framework for a further potential decrease in the selling price of the product.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd87df17c5c87eff58d5f6b49ee2bbab4c9fa7e8199a245fd7f1a169fbfed425","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
