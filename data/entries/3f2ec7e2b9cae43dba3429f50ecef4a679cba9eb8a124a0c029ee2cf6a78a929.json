{"title":"Carbonâ€“neutral hydrogen production by catalytic methane decomposition: a review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-024-01732-4","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The global hydrogen demand is projected to increase from 70 million tons in 2019 to more than 200 million tons in 2030. Methane decomposition is a promising reaction for H<sub>2</sub> production, coupled with the synthesis of valuable carbon nanomaterials applicable in fuel cell technology, transportation fuels, and chemical synthesis. Here, we review catalytic methane decomposition, with focus on catalyst development, deactivation, reactivation, regeneration, and on economics. Catalysts include mono-, bi-, and trimetallic compounds and carbon-based compounds. Catalyst deactivation is induced by coke deposition. Despite remarkable strides in research, industrialization remains at an early stage.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"3f2ec7e2b9cae43dba3429f50ecef4a679cba9eb8a124a0c029ee2cf6a78a929","category":"Environment"}
