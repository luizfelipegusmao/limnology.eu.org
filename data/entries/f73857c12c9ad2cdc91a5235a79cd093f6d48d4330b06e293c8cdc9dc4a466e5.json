{"title":"Discovery in leaf litter: uncovering the systematics of Porcelloderes (Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Phimophorinae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/doi/10.1093/isd/ixae017/7748268?rss=1","date":1725321600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The subfamily Phimophorinae includes ~113 species of cryptic assassin bugs found in the Neotropics and Paleotropics. Presumably due to its small size, cryptic coloration, and occurrence in the remote Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM), <span>Porcelloderes impenetrabilis</span> RÃ©dei, 2012 (Heteroptera: Reduviidae: Phimophorinae), was only recently described as the first representative of this subfamily from mainland Africa. Previous morphology-based phylogenetic research on Phimophorinae (then known as Physoderinae or Epiroderinae) recovered <span>Porcelloderes</span> as sister taxon to the remaining epiroderine-lineage of Phimophorinae. Recent fieldwork in Tanzania has resulted in 241 additional specimens of <span>Porcelloderes</span> from 3 EAM) ranges. We used molecular and morphological analyses for these 241 specimens to (i) determine their species identity, (ii) test the phylogenetic position of <span>Porcelloderes</span> within Phimophorinae, and (iii) determine if divergence within <span>Porcelloderes</span> coincides with periods of climate-driven forest fragmentation in the EAM. Specimens from the Kimboza and Nguru Mountains likely represent <span>P. impenetrabilis</span>, but we here describe <span>Porcelloderes harles</span>, n. sp., from the Udzungwa Mountains. Our molecular phylogeny shows <span>Porcelloderes</span> nested within the epiroderine-lineage of Phimophorinae and as sister taxon to a Madagascar clade. We estimate that the epiroderine-lineage diverged from other Phimophorinae ~44 MYA. The divergence estimates for the 2 <span>Porcelloderes</span> species is ~15 MYA, consistent with proposed dates for other EAM assassin bugs and a period of forest fragmentation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Insect Systematics and Diversity Current Issue","siteHash":"d4d59e2090793e303021830a9c164d689828dc5448b6052be7ec32e87f45cab0","entryHash":"f73857c12c9ad2cdc91a5235a79cd093f6d48d4330b06e293c8cdc9dc4a466e5","category":"Environment"}
