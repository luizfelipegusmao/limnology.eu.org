However, the general pattern of nutrient-induced changes in the temperature response of soil carbon decomposition is unknown. Yet, understanding this pattern is crucial in terms of its effect on soil carbonâ€“climate feedback. Here, we report that N and P additions significantly increase the temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition (<i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub>) by sampling soils from 36 sites across China's forests. We found that N, P, and their co-addition (NP) significantly increased the <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> by 11.3%, 11.5%, and 23.9%, respectively. The enhancement effect of nutrient addition on <i>Q</i>\n<sub>10</sub> was more evident in soils from warm regions than in those from cold regions. Moreover, we found that nutrient-induced changes in substrate availability and initial substrate and nutrient availability mainly regulated nutrient addition effects. Our findings highlight that N and P deposition enhances the temperature response of soil carbon decomposition, suggesting that N and P deposition should be incorporated into Earth system models to improve the projections of soil carbon feedback to climate change.</p>","author":"Chen Chen, \nJunmin Pei, \nBo Li, \nChangming Fang, \nMing Nie, \nJinquan Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"b98c883c0af75809555c84b245106bc28ac1ba8ff3c216644a68b68e1ab2b744","category":"Environment"}
