{"title":"Emotional Intelligence and Burnout Among Adolescent Basketball Players: The Mediating Effect of Emotional Labor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0393/v1","date":1725532457000,"content":"Burnout, characterized by emotional and physical exhaustion, poses a significant challenge to adolescent athletes, particularly in high-intensity sports like basketball. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage emotions, which is negatively associated with burnout. Emotional labor, including strategies of surface acting (SA), deep acting (DA), and genuine expression (GE), is a potential key role in emotion management between EI and burnout for athletes. This study aims to investigate the relationship between EI and burnout, as well as the mediating role of emotional labor strategies among adolescent basketball players. Our cross-sectional study, conducted in youth sports schools in four different places of China, involved 260 basketball players. Our study found EI to be negatively associated with burnout. SA and GE were identified as significant mediators in this relationship, with SA positively associated with burnout and GE negatively associated. These findings suggest that enhancing EI and optimizing emotional labor strategies could be key in mitigating burnout among young athletes, thereby improving their well-being and performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aceb79c6dce9d26d0cff5dbb31ba5ebda0d76406ced6bf4c35738832f1388000","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
