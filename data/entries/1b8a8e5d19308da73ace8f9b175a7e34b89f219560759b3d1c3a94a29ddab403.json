{"title":"Full Coverage Path Planning for Torpedo-type AUVs’ Marine Survey Confined in Convex Polygon Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1964/v1","date":1721835617000,"content":"In this paper, we present a full coverage path planning (CPP) algorithm for the marine surveys conducted in the convex polygon shaped search area. The survey is supposed to carry out by torpedo-type AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles). Due to their nonholonomic mechanical characteristics, these vehicles have nonzero minimum turning radius. For any given polygon shaped search area, it can always be partitioned into one or more convex polygons. With this in mind, this paper proposes a novel search algorithm called CbSPSA (Calculation based Shortest Path Search Algorithm) for full coverage of any given convex polygon shaped search area. By aligning the search inter-tracks alongside the edge with the minimum height, we can guarantee the minimum number of the vehicle’s turns. In addition, the proposed method can guarantee the planned path is strictly located inside the polygon area without overlapped or crossed path lines, and also has the total path length as short as possible. Considering the vehicle’s nonzero minimum turning radius, we also propose a sort of smoothing algorithm to smooth the waypoint path searched by CbSPSA so as for the vehicle to exactly follow it. The smoothed path is also guaranteed to be strictly located inside the polygon. Numerical simulation analyses are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b8a8e5d19308da73ace8f9b175a7e34b89f219560759b3d1c3a94a29ddab403","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
