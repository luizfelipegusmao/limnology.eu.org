{"title":"Verification and Validation of Advanced Control Systems for A Spinal Joint Wear Simulator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1158/v1","date":1718623959000,"content":"Wear simulation aims to assess wear rates and their dependence on factors like load, kinematics, temperature, and implant orientation. Despite its significance, there's a notable gap in research concerning advancements in simulator control systems and the testing of clinically relevant waveforms. This study addresses this gap by focusing on enhancing the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller used in joint simulators through the development of a fuzzy logic-based controller. Leveraging a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) fuzzy logic control system, the study aimed to improve displacement control, augmenting the traditional Proportional-Integral (PI) tuning approach. Implementation and evaluation of a novel Fuzzy-PI control algorithm were conducted on the Leeds spine wear simulator. The study also included testing of daily-living (DL) profiles, particularly from the hip joint, to broaden the scope of simulation scenarios. While both the conventional PI controller and the Fuzzy-PI controller met ISO tolerance criteria for the spine flexion-extension (FE) profile at 1Hz, the Fuzzy-PI controller demonstrated superior performance at higher frequencies and with DL profiles due to its real-time adaptive tuning capability. The Fuzzy-PI controller represents a significant advancement in joint wear simulation, offering improved control functionalities and a more accurate emulation of real-world physiological dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91a9461de87197b26be187fb8421ee6d8899f46d5612f47f3fbe9337ed1e5f44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
