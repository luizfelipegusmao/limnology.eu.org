{"title":"The Androgen Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate Shows a Greater Relationship with Impulsivity than Testosterone in a Male Healthy Sample","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0658/v1","date":1715334912000,"content":"This study was designed to examine the relationships among the impulsivity construct as a personality trait, the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and testosterone in a sample of 120 healthy middle-aged males. (Mage = 44.39; SD = 12.88). The sum of the three BIS-11 scales, the SR and the five UPPS-P scales correlated with DHEA-S .23 (p &lt; .006) and testosterone .19 (p &lt; .04), controlling for age. Partial correlations showed that DHEA-S is significantly related to Motor impulsivity (.24; p &lt; .008), Sensitivity to Reward (.29; p &lt; .002) and Lack of premeditation (.26; p &lt; .05) and, to a lesser extent, Sensation Seeking (.19; p &lt; .04) and Positive Urgency (.19; p &lt; .04). Testosterone correlated with Attention impulsivity (.18; p &lt; .04), Sensation Seeking (.18; p &lt; .04), and Positive Urgency (.22; p &lt; .01). Sensitivity to Reward, Negative Urgency and Positive Urgency were significant predictors of DHEA-S (R2 = .28), and Positive Urgency for testosterone (R2 = .09). Non-parametric LOESS graphical analysis for local regression allowed us to visualize the non-linear relationships between the impulsivity scales with the two androgens, including non-significant trends. We discuss the implications of these results for biological impulsive personality traits, the limitations of our analyses, and the possible development of future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d87cd3cc841e29e000b627a803767d1e4433ecc0e545c27bb815182f85b6ff42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
