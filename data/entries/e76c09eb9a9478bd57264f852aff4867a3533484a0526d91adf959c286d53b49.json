{"title":"Mechanical Behavior of Dental Restorations Implant-Supported vs MultiUnit-Supported Restorations, a Finite Element Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0984/v1","date":1710750163000,"content":"Implant-supported-screw-retained prostheses are really popular. Some of the most frequent complications have been mechanical complications. These include abutment screw loosening or even screw fracture. Using an intermediate abutment can offer several advantages. However, little literature has been found regarding how this affects the mechanical behavior of dental restorations. This study focuses on understanding the mechanical behavior of implant-supported restorations with a transepithelial component compared to those with a direct implant-supported restoration. It was carried out by using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and was experi-mentally validated. The results showed that in the case of transepithelial-supported restoration, the prosthetic screw mounted over the transepithelial component suffers higher stress than the one screwed directly to the implant. After applying a cyclic fatigue load, it is experimentally proven that, in the transepithelial-supported restorations, the fuse changes from being the screw that goes to the implant, to being the upper one. As a conclusion we can say that the use of an intermediate abutment in dental restoration not only provides better protection to the rest of the dental restoration but also allows easier repair in the event of a fracture. This can potentially lead to more efficient procedures and improved patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e76c09eb9a9478bd57264f852aff4867a3533484a0526d91adf959c286d53b49","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
