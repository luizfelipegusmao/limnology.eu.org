{"title":"Anomaly Detection in Individual Specific Networks through Explainable Generative Adversarial Attributed Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1565/v1","date":1727091568000,"content":"Recently, the availability of many omics data source has given the rise of modelling biological networks for each individual or patient. Such networks are able to represent individual-specific characteristics, providing insights into the condition of each person. Given a set of networks of individuals, a network representing a particular condition (e.g., an individual with a specific disease) may be seen as an anomaly network. Consequently, the use of Graph Anomaly Detection techniques may support such analysis. Among the others, Generative Adversarial Networks present optimal per- formances in anomaly detection. This paper presents ADIN (Anomaly Detection in Individual Networks), a framework based on Generative Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs) for anomaly detection in convergence/divergence patients at- tributed networks. Preliminary results on networks generated from computational biology gene expression data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting and explaining bladder cancer patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72cdf1b73022ba22909d0e2fd6e4c3968e127bd2bf3d45b6aef8c68bfe7d084f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
