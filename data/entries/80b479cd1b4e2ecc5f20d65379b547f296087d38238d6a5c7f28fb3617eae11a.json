{"title":"Analysis of Wind Speed Extrapolation and Wind Power Density Assessment in Tetuan City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1620/v1","date":1719211475000,"content":"Vertical wind speed extrapolation is a commonly used method that involves estimating wind speeds at various heights based on measurements taken at a specific height. In this study, we compared the short-and long-term extrapolation methods of wind parameters using data collected on site by anemometers at two different heights. We assessed the accuracy of these methods by calculating the statistical indicators for performance evaluation, and then determined the most appropriate model for the two types of vertical extrapolation. Additionally, we evaluated energy potential characteristics, as well as the statistical analysis of wind speed distribution and wind power density based on the Weibull and Rayleigh distribution. Our results indicated that the power law is the most suitable model for the short-term method, while the modified Mikhail model is the most appropriate for long-term extrapolation. We also found that the wind potential of this area is favorable for wind turbine integration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80b479cd1b4e2ecc5f20d65379b547f296087d38238d6a5c7f28fb3617eae11a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
