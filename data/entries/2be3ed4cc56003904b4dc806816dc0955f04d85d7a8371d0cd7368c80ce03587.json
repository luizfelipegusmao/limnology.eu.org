{"title":"Place, displacement, and health-seeking behaviour among the Ugandan Batwa: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003321","date":1718200800000,"content":"<p>by Laura Jane Brubacher, Lea Berrang-Ford, Sierra Nicole Clark, Kaitlin Patterson, Shuaib Lwasa, Didacus Namanya, Sabastian Twesigomwe, IHACC Research Team , Sherilee L. Harper</p>\r\n\r\nFor many Indigenous Peoples, relationships to the land are inherent in identity and culture, and to all facets of health and wellbeing, physically, emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually. The Batwa are Indigenous Peoples of rural, southwest Uganda who have experienced tremendous social and economic upheaval, due to relatively recent forced displacement and land dispossession. This loss of physical connection to their ancestral lands has significantly impacted Batwa health, and also affected available healthcare options for Batwa. This exploratory study (1) identified and characterized factors that influence Batwa health-seeking behaviour, using acute gastrointestinal illness, a critical public health issue, as a focal point for analysis; and (2) explored possible intersections between the Batwa’s connection to place–and displacement–and their health-seeking behaviour for acute gastrointestinal illness. Twenty focus group discussions, stratified by gender, were conducted in ten Batwa settlements in Kanungu District, Uganda and eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary healthcare workers, community health coordinators, clinical officers, and development program coordinators. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed using a constant comparative method. Batwa identified several significant motivators to engage with Indigenous and/or biomedical forms of healthcare, including transition to life outside the forest and their reflections on health in the forest; ‘intellectual access’ to care and generational knowledge-sharing on the use of Indigenous medicines; and Batwa identity and way of life. These nuanced explanations for health-seeking behaviour underscore the significance of place–and displacement–to Batwa health and wellbeing, and its relationship to their health-seeking behaviour for acute gastrointestinal illness. As such, the results of this study can be used to inform healthcare practice and policy and support the development of a culturally- and contextually-appropriate healthcare system, as well as to reduce the burden of acute gastrointestinal illness among Batwa.","author":"Laura Jane Brubacher","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"2be3ed4cc56003904b4dc806816dc0955f04d85d7a8371d0cd7368c80ce03587","category":"Environment"}
