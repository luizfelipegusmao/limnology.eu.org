{"title":"Radiofrequency Enhancer to Recover Signal Dropouts in 7 Tesla Diffusion MRI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1914/v1","date":1721800687000,"content":"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an imaging technique that provides information on the microstructural organization of biological tissue. dMRI allows for non-invasive visualization and quantitative assessment of white matter architecture in the brain by characterizing restrictions on the random motion of water molecules. Ultra-high field MRI scanners, such as those operating at 7 Tesla (7T) or higher, can boost signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to improve dMRI compared with what is attainable at conventional field strengths such as 3T or 1.5T. However, at 7T wavelength effects cause lower transmit magnetic field efficiency in the human brain, mainly in the posterior fossa region, manifesting as signal dropouts in this region. Recently, we reported a simple approach of using a wireless radiofrequency (RF) surface array to improve transmit efficiency and signal sensitivity at 7T. Here we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using this RF enhancer for in-vivo dMRI at 7T. The use of the RF enhancer can effectively recover signal dropouts in the regions with intrinsically lower SNR such as cerebellum, leading to a better depiction of principal fiber orientations and enhanced visualization of extended tracts to the brainstem and pons enabling more comprehensive delineation of the full white matter architecture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"249ab1c6c55937430efed0d985357bc8449335387059aa9b30545ccd1e199de9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
