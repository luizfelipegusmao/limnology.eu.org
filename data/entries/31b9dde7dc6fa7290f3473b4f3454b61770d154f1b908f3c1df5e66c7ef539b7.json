Much of this communication is facilitated by plasmodesmata (PD), consisting of membranes and cytoplasm, that connect adjacent cells to each other. PD have long been viewed as passive conduits for the movement of a variety of metabolites and molecular cargoes, but this perception has been changing over the last two decades or so. Research from the last few years has revealed the importance of PD as signaling hubs and as crucial players in hormone signaling. The adoption of advanced biochemical approaches, molecular tools, and high-resolution imaging modalities has led to several recent breakthroughs in our understanding of the roles of PD, revealing the structural and regulatory complexity of these ‘protoplasmic connecting threads’. We highlight several of these findings that we think well illustrate the current understanding of PD as functioning at the nexus of plant physiology, development, and acclimation to the environment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"31b9dde7dc6fa7290f3473b4f3454b61770d154f1b908f3c1df5e66c7ef539b7","category":"Environment"}
