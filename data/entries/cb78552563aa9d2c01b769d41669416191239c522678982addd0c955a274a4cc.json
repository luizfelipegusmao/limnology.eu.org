{"title":"A Novel Approach for Enhancement of Security through Defining Spatial Secrecy Outage Probability in Industrial Internet of Things","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0789/v1","date":1715590805000,"content":"The rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has brought enormous opportunities to the industrial environment but has also posed significant challenges to network security, especially the physical layer security challenges,which is crucial for the reliable transmission of messages interconnected devices and sensors. Focus on the enhancing the physical layer security in the IIoT communication, this paper proposed a mechanism of Spatial Secrecy Outage Probability (SSOP) to ensure the secure transmission of data. The SSOP algorithm assumes that the location of legitimate device is known, while eavesdropper on the random distribution of device locations, forming the SSOP model related to device locations from the perspective of insecure regions (ISR) and secure regions (SR), and deduce the closed-form expression for its upper bound. Subsequently under the constraint of SSOP  conditions, establish an optimization model with the objective of system throughput maximization based on Spatial Secrecy Outage Probability(SRM-SSOP). By optimizing the transmission rate of legitimate channels or controlling the transmission power, the maximization of system throughput can be achieved, thus reducing the consumption of communication resources. Through sophisticated modeling and simulation in the MATLAB, we verified the accuracy of the definition and derived upper bound of SSOP. The experimental results also show that SSOP algorithm gradually converges to a specific value as the number of antenna elements increases. In addition, we observed that when the receiver device is aligned with the normal direction of the transmit antenna array, the SSOP reaches a minimum value. These performance are crucial for understanding and optimizing the security performance of IIoT communication systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb78552563aa9d2c01b769d41669416191239c522678982addd0c955a274a4cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
