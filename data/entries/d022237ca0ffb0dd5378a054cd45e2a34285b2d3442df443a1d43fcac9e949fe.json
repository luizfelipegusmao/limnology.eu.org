{"title":"Stable GANs via Fermi-Dirac Statistics and Ruppeiner Geometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2114/v1","date":1721967893000,"content":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful models for generative tasks but face significant challenges such as instability, mode collapse, and inefficient convergence. This paper introduces a theoretical framework leveraging Fermi-Dirac statistics, Ruppeiner geometry, phase transition dynamics, and graph theory to address these issues. The proposed theorems provide a robust mathematical foundation for enhancing GAN stability, diversity, and convergence. Experimental validation on the MNIST dataset demonstrates that the application of these theorems results in improved Inception Scores, reduced FrÂ´echet Inception Distances, and stable training dynamics, as indicated by Ruppeiner curvature analysis. The findings suggest that these theoretical insights offer a comprehensive solution to the persistent challenges in GAN training, paving the way for more reliable and effective generative models","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d022237ca0ffb0dd5378a054cd45e2a34285b2d3442df443a1d43fcac9e949fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
