{"title":"Circular Pear Production Using Compost Fertilization: Influence on Tree Growth and Nitrogen Leaf Content","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1822/v1","date":1729694735000,"content":"The circular economy with compost fertilization is included in the sustainable orchard paradigm, creating a holistic production ecosystem. Modern orchards are mostly intensive and super-intensive, requiring different rootstocks. This research presents the response to compost fertilization of two specific pear rootstocks (quince ‘CTS 212’ and ‘Farold® 40’) and own-rooted trees, analyzing six resistant cultivars in a circular production system. The dynamic of nitrogen and carbon content in leaves, soil respiration coefficient, the evolution of the fruit maturity stage in the field, and some biometric parameters such as trunk cross-section area, the annual vegetative growth, and fruiting shoots annual number were analyzed. The results highlighted the effect of compost fertilization on plants: almost all variants presented higher nitrogen amounts in leaves in the first and second years. Carbon content in leaves had a lower dynamic over time. Rootstock and compost fertilization influenced the fruit maturity dynamic, but a single pattern was not identified. Quince as pear rootstock expressed a higher sensitivity to compost application, the biometric parameters as trunk cross-section area, and almost all cultivars' annual vegetative growth were higher than the control's. Positive output can lead to future model upscaling in the farms and households.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee30ace2285e46ef6277e4a4eff76e3eed4dc3df0c15ee671feb043fc620b217","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
