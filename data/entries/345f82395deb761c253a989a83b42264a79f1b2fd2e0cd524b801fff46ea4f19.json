{"title":"Assessment of Ghana&rsquo;s Municipal Solid Waste for Valorization &ndash; a Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1493/v1","date":1726738223000,"content":"Ghana spends over $4000 (US dollars) annually managing municipal solid waste (MSW) with little improvement in regional sanitation. Energy demand in the country is also on the rise. Therefore, addressing waste problems via the waste-to-energy valorization approach is necessary for dual benefits. This paper thus seeks to comprehensively review Ghana's MSW's proximate and ultimate compositions for biological and thermochemical conversions. Studies between 2011 and 2024 were analyzed. The findings revealed that the organic fraction of Ghana’s MSW is currently about 10.47Kt per day. The proximate analysis reveals a moisture content from 13.55 – 61.9 %, volatile matter ranges from 6.24 - 80.25%, and the calorific value ranges from 14.96-21.46MJ/Kg. The ultimate analysis revealed that the carbon-to-nitrogen ratios range from 24.3-32.2, and the hydrogen content ranges from 5.53-22.8%. The sulphur and nitrogen contents were below 0.6 and 1.7% respectively. Approximately 2,534.65 GWh of electricity is estimated from the organic fraction. Ghana’s MSW is more suited for biochemical conversions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"345f82395deb761c253a989a83b42264a79f1b2fd2e0cd524b801fff46ea4f19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
