Armstrong</p>\r\nBackground <p>Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common degenerative dementias, but research on end-of-life experiences for people with DLB and their caregivers is limited.</p> Method <p>Dyads of individuals with moderate-advanced DLB and their primary informal caregivers were recruited from specialty clinics, advocacy organizations, and research registries and followed prospectively every 6 months. The current study examines results of caregiver study visits 3 months after the death of the person with DLB. These visits included the Last Month of Life survey, study-specific questions, and a semi-structured interview querying end-of-life experiences.</p> Results <p>Individuals with DLB (n = 50) died 3.24 Â± 1.81 years after diagnosis, typically of disease-related complications. Only 44% of caregivers reported a helpful conversation with clinicians regarding what to expect at the end of life in DLB. Symptoms commonly worsening prior to death included: cognition and motor function, ADL dependence, behavioral features, daytime sleepiness, communication, appetite, and weight loss. Almost 90% of participants received hospice care, but 20% used hospice for &lt;1 week. Most caregivers reported overall positive experiences in the last month of life, but this was not universal. Having information about DLB and what to expect, access to support, and hospice care were healthcare factors associated with positive and negative end of life experiences. Hospice experiences were driven by communication, care coordination, quality care, and caregiver education.</p> Conclusion <p>Most caregivers of individuals who died with DLB reported positive end-of-life experiences. However, the study identified multiple opportunities for improvement relating to clinician counseling of patients/families, support/hospice referrals, and monitoring individuals with DLB to identify approaching end of life. Future research should quantitatively identify changes that herald end of life in DLB and develop tools that can assist clinicians in evaluating disease stage to better inform counseling and timely hospice referrals.</p> Trial registration <p>Trial registration information: NCT04829656.</p>","author":"Easton Wollney","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ffb92f22ef92851245aeab4b802c35a071b2357f79697b59861e799be0e80088","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
