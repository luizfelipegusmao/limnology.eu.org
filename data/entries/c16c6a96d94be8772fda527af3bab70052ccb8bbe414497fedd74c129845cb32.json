{"title":"Effects of low and high maternal protein intake on fetal skeletal muscle miRNAome in sheep","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1208/v1","date":1710937755000,"content":"Prenatal maternal feeding plays an important role in fetal development and has potential to cause long-lasting epigenetic modifications. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that serve as one epigenetic mechanism. Though miRNAs have crucial roles in fetal programming, growth, and development, there are limited data regarding maternal diet and sheep miRNA expression. Therefore, weanalyzed high and low maternal dietary protein for miRNA expression in sheep fetal longissimus dorsi. Pregnant ewes were fed an isoenergetic high-protein (HP, 160–270 g/day), low-protein (LP, 73–112 g/day), or standard protein diet (SP, 119–198 g/day) during pregnancy. miRNA expression profiles were evaluated using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 Array. Twelve up-regulated, differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were identified targeting 65 genes. The oar-3957-5p miRNA was highly up-regulated in LP and SP compared to HP. Previous transcriptome analysis identified integrin and non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase genes targeted by miRNAs detected in the current experiment. A total of 28 GO terms and 10 pathway-based gene sets were significantly (padj &amp;lt; 0.05) enriched in target genes. Most genes targeted by identified miRNAs are involved in immune and muscle disease pathways. Our study shows dietary protein intake during pregnancy affects fetal skeletal muscle epigenetics via miRNA expression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c16c6a96d94be8772fda527af3bab70052ccb8bbe414497fedd74c129845cb32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
