{"title":"Disparities and factors affecting hypertension diagnosis from qualified doctors in Bangladesh and its impact on receiving hypertension control advice: Analysis of demographic & health survey 2017–18","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003496","date":1721743200000,"content":"<p>by Gulam Muhammed Al Kibria, Md Shajedur Rahman Shawon, Mohammad Rashidul Hashan, Maryam Hameed Khan, Dustin G. Gibson</p>\r\n\r\nThe burden of hypertension is increasing in many low- and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, and a large proportion of Bangladeshi people seek healthcare from unqualified medical practitioners, such as paramedics, village doctors, and drug store salesmen; however, there has been limited investigation regarding diagnosis and care provided by qualified doctors. This study investigated the factors associated with hypertension diagnosis by qualified doctors (i.e., registered medically trained doctors or medical doctors with at least an MBBS degree) and how this diagnosis is related to hypertension-controlling advice and treatment among Bangladeshi adults. This cross-sectional study used data from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017–18. After describing sample characteristics, we conducted simple and multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate the associated factors and associations. Among 1710 participants (68.3% females, mean age: 50.1 (standard error: 0.43) years) with self-reported hypertension diagnosis, about 54.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.8–58.0) had a diagnosis by qualified doctors. The following variables had significant associations with hypertension diagnoses from qualified doctors: 40-54- or 55-year-olds/above (ref: 18-29-year-olds), overweight/obesity (ref: not overweight/obese), college/above education (ref: no formal education), richest wealth quintile (ref: poorest), urban residence (ref: rural), and residence in Chittagong, Barisal, and Sylhet divisions (ref: Dhaka division). Lastly, compared to people who had not been diagnosed by qualified doctors, those with the diagnosis from qualified doctors had higher odds of receiving any hypertension-controlling advice and treatment, including drugs (1.73 (95% CI: 1.27–2.36), salt intake reduction (AOR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.80–3.10), weight reduction (AOR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.97–3.37), smoking cessation (AOR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.66–2.96),), and exercise promotion (AOR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.77–3.09). This study showed significant socioeconomic and rural-urban disparities regarding hypertension diagnosis from qualified doctors. Diagnosis by qualified doctors was also positively associated with receiving hypertension-controlling advice and treatment. Reducing these inequalities would be crucial to reducing the country’s hypertension burden.","author":"Gulam Muhammed Al Kibria","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"82232d4a11fcf8be55e6e3045ba0b4870f4c16ffe01acb08e1d3cafd0f842fd2","category":"Environment"}
