{"title":"Impaired Peripheral Vascular Function Following Ischemic Stroke: Implications for Blood Pressure Variations in the Post-stroke Patient","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1792/v1","date":1719371662000,"content":"High systolic blood pressure and increased blood pressure variability after the onset of ischemic stroke are associated with poor clinical outcomes. One of the key determinants of blood pressure is arteriolar size, determined by vascular smooth muscle tone and vasodilatory and vasoconstrictor substances that are released by the endothelium. The aim of this study is to outline alterations in vasomotor function in isolated peripheral arteries following ischemic stroke. The reactivity of thoracic aortic segments from male C57BL/6 mice to dilators and constrictors was quantified using wire myography. Acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation was impaired after ischemic stroke (LogIC50 Sham=-7.499, LogIC50 Stroke=-7.350, P=0.0132, n= 19, 31 respectively). Vasodilatory responses to SNP were identical in isolated aortas in sham and stroke groups. Phenylephrine induced vasoconstriction was impaired in aortas isolated from stroke animals in comparison to sham counterparts (Sham LogEC50= -6.652 vs Stroke LogEC50=-6.475, P&lt; 0.001). Our study demonstrates that 24 hours post-ischemic stroke, peripheral vascular responses are impaired in remote arteries. Aortas from stroke animals exhibited reduced vasoconstrictor and endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses, while endothelium-independent vasodilatory responses were preserved. Since both vasodilatory and vasoconstrictor responses of peripheral arteries are impaired following ischemic stroke, our findings might explain increased blood pressure variability following ischemic stroke.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbf06552087e982c92721a58bd61166318d128eefe0e0a44f858d3801348289e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
