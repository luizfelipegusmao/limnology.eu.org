{"title":"Formulation and Characterization of DES and Potential Application in Recycling Packaging Laminates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1717/v1","date":1724401886000,"content":"Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) show promising abilities for the delamination of multilayer packaging films that are used in food packaging and in pharmaceutical blister packs. Due to the complexity of their structure, the recycling of these materials is a challenging task, leading to the easiest or cheapest option, landfilling. Towards the development of ‘green’ solvents for the efficient waste management and recycling, the conducted research focuses on the preparation of a range of hydrophobic and hydrophilic DES based on carboxylic acids. Also, their chemical and physical characterization, such as DSC, rheometer and density measurements, was followed for the determination of their properties. The laminate packaging waste products that were tested were Al/PE, PE/Al/PET, Al/PE/paper and PVC/PE/Al. Different batches of solvent systems were tested based on various naturally derived aliphatic and aromatic organic compounds as well as amino acids. The separated films were collected and studied further for the examination of the delamination extend. Results showed full or partial delamination of some materials as well as challenges of solvent systems. Variables such as temperature, agitation rate, mixing time and solvents ratios were monitored and collected during the design of experimental process. The results showed that the used DESs can offer an efficient, low-energy, affordable and green option for the delamination tested packaging materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf5110e495a55d36c26c7f3ded1f44407f40b8f720315e7ee2d8ba5f261e987b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
