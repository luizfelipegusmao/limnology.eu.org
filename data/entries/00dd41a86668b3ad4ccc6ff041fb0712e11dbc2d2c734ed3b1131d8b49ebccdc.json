{"title":"Hooked-End Steel Fibers Affecting Damping Ratio of Modified Self-Compacting Concrete with Rubber and Marble/Granite Additions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1143/v1","date":1715912993000,"content":"The aim of this investigation is focused on the effects of hooked-end steel fibers on both fresh and hardened properties of modified self-compacting concretes (SCC). For this purpose, the steel fibers are associated with other residues contents (i.e. marble, granite and rubber). This concatenated materials contents constitutes a novelty since no investigations are reported. It is found that the increase of rubber content, a better ability to absorb energy is observed. This indicates that a good alternative of structural material is provided. Fresh properties are evaluated by using flow, T500 time, V-funnel, J-ring methods. The mechanical behavior is evaluated in terms of compressive strength, tensile strength, static and dynamic modulus of elasticity, and damping ratio. Experimental results of the water absorption, porosity and density are also attained. It is also found that a SCC mixture containing steel fiber, marble/granite residue and rubber content is a potential mixture to be considered when in SCC designing associated with improved damping ratio. Although the rubber content decreases the mechanical behavior and slump flow, the concatenated utilization of MGR and steel fiber contents provide a slight improve in the damping result. An environmental benefit can also be associated since the cement consumption is decreased with marble additions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00dd41a86668b3ad4ccc6ff041fb0712e11dbc2d2c734ed3b1131d8b49ebccdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
