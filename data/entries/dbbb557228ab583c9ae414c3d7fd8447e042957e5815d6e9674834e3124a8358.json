This study aimed to reveal the shaping force of the establishment of the ecosystem of Beijing rice vinegar, the core function microbiota, and their correlation with critical environmental factors.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The experimental findings revealed the changes in environmental factors, major metabolites, and microbial patterns during Beijing rice vinegar fermentation were obtained. The major metabolites accumulated at the middle and late acetic acid fermentation (AAF) periods. Principal coordinates and t-test analyses revealed the specific bacterial and fungal species at corresponding stages. <i>Kosakonia</i>, <i>Methlobacterium</i>, <i>Sphingomonas</i>, unidentified <i>Rhizobiaceae, Pseudozyma</i> and <i>Saccharomycopsis</i> dorminated during saccharification and alcohol fermentation and early AAF, while <i>Lactococcus</i>, <i>Acetobacter, Rhodotorula,</i> and <i>Kazachstania</i> dominated the later AAF stages. Canonical correspondence analysis of environmental factors with core microbiota. Temperature and total acid were the most significant factors correlated with the SAF bacterial profile (<i>Pediococcus, Weissella, Enterococcus</i>, and <i>Kosakonia</i>). Ethanol was the most significant factor between AAF1 and AAF3, and mainly affected <i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>. Conversely, ethanol was the most significant factor in the SAF, AAF1, and AAF3 fungi communities; typical microorganisms were Saccharomyces and Malassezia. Furthermore, the predicted phenotypes of bacteria and their response to environmental factors were evaluated<i>.</i></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, this study provided insights into the process regulation of spontaneous fermentation and distinguished the key driving forces in the microbiota of Beijing rice vinegar fermentation.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
