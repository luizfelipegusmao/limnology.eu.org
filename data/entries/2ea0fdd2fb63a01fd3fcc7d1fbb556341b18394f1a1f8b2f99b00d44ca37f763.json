{"title":"Potential Innovations in Modern-Day Human and Animal Vaccine Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2158/v1","date":1721993557000,"content":"The vaccine industry has undoubtedly contributed massively in the medical world, with hundreds of millions of lives saved as a result of the successful development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against various infectious and oncological diseases. Simultaneously, there has been an ongoing evolutionary battle between polymorphic microbes and the human immune system, and various microbes have developed counter-responses against the human host immune system, by creating diverse “holes” of vulnerability in the innate immune system. Such mechanisms may have resulted due to the lower prophylactic and therapeutic focus upon sharpening the innate immune lines as directly as necessary. The overall objective of vaccine-development should be the sharpening of all immune departments that are targeted by various microbial agents for the purpose of transient innate immune suppression and the distribution of the microbial count/load at a systemic level. Likewise, it could be viable for the clinical research community to start focusing upon filling in the “gaps” of vulnerability that are now present in the pathways responsible for the proper natural immune activation and proportionate signalling toward the adaptive immune system. Perhaps, through such a process, the “road” toward the adaptive immune system, which is “old” and filled with “holes”, could be gradually transformed into a perfectly uniform “highway”, with all the required signals transmitted robustly from the innate to the adaptive immune system, before microbes manage to translate the various pathogenic proteins that transiently prevent such transmission altogether, until it becomes too late for the immune response to possibly develop in a proportionate and non-harmful manner to the organism. Such a scenario would be possible, given that it is almost impossible for human evolutionary growth to eventually stall and not risk experiencing a decrease as a result. Simultaneously, it is important for human society to bind by the principles of maintaining a healthy and nature-friendly lifestyle, given the philosophical quote of “We are what we eat.” The overall objective should be the facilitation of human and animal immune evolution over viral and bacterial molecular self-camouflaging from all possible directions, as a sharper human and animal evolutionary growth resulting from such actions could “cost” the sharper evolutionary growth of microbes as such, given that evolutionary patterns are based upon the models observed in Physics, in Newton’s Third Law of Motion, as well as in the First Law of Thermodynamics, which concerns the Conservation of Energy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ea0fdd2fb63a01fd3fcc7d1fbb556341b18394f1a1f8b2f99b00d44ca37f763","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
