One of these was to use electron microscopy to image atomic scale structure across a single antiparallel ferroelectric domain wall in lithium niobate. These were challenging samples to prepare and the distortions at the walls we were looking for were eventually difficult to resolve at that time. Electron microscopy has made significant advances in resolution, modalities, and modeling in the past several decades. In this talk, I will summarize our eventual success since that time, in measuring atomic scale polar entropy in LiNbO<sub>3</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.527-B1\">1</a>], in imaging polar states in Ruddlesden-Popper Sr<sub>n+1</sub>Ti<sub>n</sub> O<sub>3n+1</sub> with information on 5-10 pm scale [<a href=\"#ozae044.527-B2\">2</a>], and imaging domain walls in polar metal, Ca<sub>3</sub>Ru<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.527-B3\">3</a>]. Terryâ€™s brilliance and kindness remain the guiding light for Gopalan to this day.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"226857604d61bbf6410f71b381cb6e6504b60e9760f89d2c8a660136f18f4f43","category":"Environment"}
