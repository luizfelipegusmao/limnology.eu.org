{"title":"Unveiling the Role of Schwann Cell Plasticity in the Pathogenesis of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1297/v1","date":1724053765000,"content":"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a prevalent complication of type 2 diabetes that affects a significant proportion of diabetic patients worldwide. Although the pathogenesis of DPN involves axonal atrophy and demyelination, the exact mechanisms remain elusive. Current research has predominantly focused on neuronal damage, overlooking the potential contributions of Schwann cells, which are the predominant glial cells in the peripheral nervous system. Schwann cells play a critical role in neurodevelopment, neurophysiology, and nerve regeneration. This review highlights the emerging understanding of the involvement of Schwann cells in DPN pathogenesis. This review explores the potential role of Schwann cell plasticity as an underlying cellular and molecular mechanism in the development of DPN. Understanding the interplay between Schwann cell plasticity and diabetes could reveal novel strategies for the treatment and management of DPN.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46668a5681924e16b551c4b6a63699aa4cc8cb39d285da95d3cdd382f138cdab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
