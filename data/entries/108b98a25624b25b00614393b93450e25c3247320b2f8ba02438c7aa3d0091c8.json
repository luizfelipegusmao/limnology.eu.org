Several genes causing intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities have been identified over the last few decades. Information on these causative genes and mutations of intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities helps us answer several important evolutionary questions regarding the plausibility of classic theoretical models of intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities, the evolutionary driving forces involved, and the repeatability of molecular mechanisms across taxa. Here, we provide an updated list of the causative genes of intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities in animals and plants. Although several empirical cases are consistent with the classic two-locus Dobzhanskyâ€“Muller incompatibility model, there are many cases in which epistatic interactions are more complex. Animals and plants appear to share several molecular mechanisms of intrinsic hybrid incompatibility. In both animals and plants, many causative genes evolve under genomic conflicts. Some taxonomic differences may result from inherent physiological differences. As most studies are biased toward a limited number of model organisms, further studies on natural systems across diverse taxa are necessary for the quantitative assessment of these patterns in nature.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"3a6bf3189332aa8d860b0369d5aa2ac065f7385b7c3f4543469ad2a55950d26a","entryHash":"108b98a25624b25b00614393b93450e25c3247320b2f8ba02438c7aa3d0091c8","category":"Environment"}
