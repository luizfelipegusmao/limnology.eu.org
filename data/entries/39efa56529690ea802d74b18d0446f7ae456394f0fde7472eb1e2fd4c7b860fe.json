{"title":"PET-CT in Polymyalgia Rheumatica: When and for what&mdash;A Critical Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1405/v1","date":1718866321000,"content":"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory disease common in people aged 50 years and older. This condition is characterized by the presence of pain and stiffness involving mainly the shoulder and pelvic girdle. Besides the frequent association with giant cell arteritis (GCA), several conditions may mimic PMR or present with PMR features. Since the diagnosis is basically clinical, an adequate diagnosis of this condition is usually required. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) has proved to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of PMR. The use of 18F-FDG-PET imaging appears promising as it provides detailed information on inflammatory activity that may not be evident with traditional methods. However, since PET-CT is not strictly necessary for the diagnosis of PMR, clinicians should consider several situations in which this imaging technique can be used in patients with suspected PMR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39efa56529690ea802d74b18d0446f7ae456394f0fde7472eb1e2fd4c7b860fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
