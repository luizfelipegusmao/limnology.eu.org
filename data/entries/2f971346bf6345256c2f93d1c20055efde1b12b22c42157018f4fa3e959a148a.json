{"title":"Platelet Pathogen Reduction Technology. Should We Stay or Should We Go&hellip;?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1600/v1","date":1721379596000,"content":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) for providing blood products and for keeping blood supplies available. The possibility that similar pandemic event may occur again has induced researchers and transfusionists to investigate the adoption of new tools to prevent and reduce these risks. Similarly, increased donor travelling and globalization, with consequent donor-deferral and donor pool reduction, have contributed to raise awareness on this topic. Although recent studies have validated the use of pathogen reduction technology (PRT) for the control of Transfusion Transmitted Infections (TTI) this method is not a standard of care despite increasing adoption. We present a critical commentary on the role of PRT for platelet and on associated problems for blood transfusion services (BTS). The balance of cost effectiveness of adopting PRT is also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f971346bf6345256c2f93d1c20055efde1b12b22c42157018f4fa3e959a148a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
