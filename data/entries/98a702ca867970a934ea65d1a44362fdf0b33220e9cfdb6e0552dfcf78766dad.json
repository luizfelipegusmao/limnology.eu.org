{"title":"Modulation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> gene expression during proliferation in platelet concentrates with focus on virulence and platelet functionality","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307920","date":1721916000000,"content":"<p>by Basit Yousuf, Roya Pasha, Nicolas Pineault, Sandra Ramirez-Arcos</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is a well-documented bacterial contaminant in platelet concentrates (PCs), a blood component used to treat patients with platelet deficiencies. This bacterium can evade routine PC culture screening and cause septic transfusion reactions. Here, we investigated the gene expression modulation within the PC niche versus trypticase soy media (TSB) of <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> CBS2016-05, a strain isolated from a septic reaction, in comparison to PS/BAC/317/16/W, a strain identified during PC screening. RNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation of the capsule biosynthesis operon (<i>capA-H</i>), surface adhesion factors (<i>sasADF</i>), clumping factor A (<i>clfA</i>), protein A (<i>spa</i>), and anaerobic metabolism genes (<i>pflAB</i>, <i>nrdDG</i>) in CBS2016-05 when grown in PCs versus TSB, implying its enhanced pathogenicity in this milieu, in contrast to the PS/BAC/317/16/W strain. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> CBS2016-05 on platelet functionality in spiked PCs versus non-spiked PC units. Flow cytometry analyses revealed a significant decrease in glycoprotein (GP) IIb (CD41) and GPIbÎ± (CD42b) expression, alongside increased P-selectin (CD62P) and phosphatidylserine (annexin V) expression in spiked PCs compared to non-spiked PCs (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Moreover, spiked PCs exhibited a drastic reduction in MitoTrack Red FM and Calcein AM positive platelets (87.3% vs. 29.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.0001 and 95.4% vs. 24.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.0001) in a bacterial cell density manner. These results indicated that <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> CBS2016-05 triggers platelet activation and apoptosis, and compromises mitochondrial functionality and platelet viability, in contaminated PCs. Furthermore, this study enhanced our understanding of the effects of platelet-bacteria interactions in the unique PC niche, highlighting <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> increased pathogenicity and deleterious effect on platelet functionality in a strain specific manner. Our novel insights serve as a platform to improve PC transfusion safety.","author":"Basit Yousuf","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"98a702ca867970a934ea65d1a44362fdf0b33220e9cfdb6e0552dfcf78766dad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
