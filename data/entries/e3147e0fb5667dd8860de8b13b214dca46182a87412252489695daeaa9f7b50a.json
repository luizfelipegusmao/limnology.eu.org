{"title":"Does “form follow function” in the rotiferan genus Keratella?","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05192-9","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Most species of <em>Keratella</em> possess dome-shaped, dorsal plates comprising a network of polyhedral units (facets), delineated by slightly raised ridges. The arrangement of facets define a species’ facet pattern (FP), with the resulting structure resembling a geodesic dome. Researchers have sorted species into categories based on their FPs, but those have not been analyzed. Additionally, while a strong lorica has been suggested to protect <em>Keratella</em> from predatory attack or other actions causing blunt force trauma (BFT), we know little of how that occurs. Thus, in our study we tested two hypotheses. (1) There is support for categorizing <em>Keratella</em> species into unique groupings based on their FPs. (2) FPs provide resistance to physical stresses. To test that hypothesis we used the structural analysis software SkyCiv©. Our results indicate support for four FP categories. Additionally, the SkyCiv analysis provided preliminary ‘proof-of-concept’ that <em>Keratella</em> FPs have a functional significance: i.e., adding or subtracting facets in our model was followed by a change in predicted structural reliability. We posit that FPs are adaptations protecting <em>Keratella</em> from fractures to the lorica that may result from BFT incurred during predatory attack by copepods or while caught within the branchial chambers of daphnids.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e3147e0fb5667dd8860de8b13b214dca46182a87412252489695daeaa9f7b50a","category":"Environment"}
