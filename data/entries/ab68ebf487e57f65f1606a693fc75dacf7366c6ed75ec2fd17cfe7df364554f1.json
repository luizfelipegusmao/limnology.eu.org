{"title":"Integration of Automatic Test Generators For Maximizing the Code Coverage Level","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1767/v1","date":1721720263000,"content":"This paper explores the development of a sophisticated system for automatic test generation tailored specifically for Java web applications utilizing REST interfaces. Writing tests ensures the quality of the software solution event after the introduction of subsequent changes, because automated regression testing can detect potential bugs in the code event before the application is resealed into production. By utilizing and comparing various automatic test generators, the system described provides users with a visual representation of code structure and coverage, enhancing insights through call graph visualization. The paper describes the concepts of theoretical automatic test generators, gives an overview of generators, and details the design and implementation of the implemented solution, which integrates the system test generator and the unit test generator based on open source to achieve the maximum code coverage level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab68ebf487e57f65f1606a693fc75dacf7366c6ed75ec2fd17cfe7df364554f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
