{"title":"Long-Term Bonding Performance of One-Bottle vs. Two-Bottle Bonding Agents to Lithium Disilicate Ceramics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0737/v1","date":1720524166000,"content":"Objective: The effect of long-term performance of one-bottle or two-bottle bonding agents on the shear bond strength to lithium disilicate ceramics (LDS) were to investigate, and the long-term performance of the bond strength of two-bottle bonding agent (Tokuyama Universal Bond II) was investigated under conditions without hydrofluoric acid solution (abbreviated as HF)-pretreatment of LDS. Methods: Nine resin cements (both self-adhesive and adhesive types) were used. It was investigated 1) the adhesion strength of various resin cements to LDS from the presence or absence of HF-treatment, 2) to determine the effect of the deterioration in three times [after one-day storage (abbreviated as Base), and after 5,000 &amp;amp; 20,000 thermocycles (abbreviated as TC 5k and TC 20k)] of one- and two-component bonding agents. And the difference in degradation between one- and two-component bonding gents consist of the silane coupling agent was performed by chemical analysis (High Performance Liquid Chromatography). Results: The trends of resin cements were statistically not very different for each cement 3 times with HF-conditions. Also ESTECEM II and Super-Bond Universal showed the significant greatest values in two conditions (TC 5k and TC 20k) without HF-condition. In TC 20k, ESTECEM II &amp;amp; Super-Bond Universal showed significantly better results than others when treated with the recommended bonding agents without HF-condition. In TC 20k, there was not much statistically significant difference if pretreated with Tokuyama Universal Bond II without HF-condition. Significance: When using LDS, it was found that long-term durability could be maintained by pretreating with Tokuyama Universal Bond II without pretreating with various hazardous HFs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e26db17e36787b0428103bedcdc9993249012fbd6eace4f7cba739ab8bbf371","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
