{"title":"Pistil-derived lipids influence pollen tube growth and male fertility in Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/763/7698906?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pollen germination and pollen tube elongation require rapid phospholipid production and remodeling in membrane systems that involve both de novo synthesis and turnover. Phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAH) and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) are 2 key enzymes in membrane lipid maintenance. PAH generates diacylglycerol (DAG), a necessary precursor for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), while LPCAT reacylates lysophosphatidylcholine to PC and plays an essential role in the remodeling of membrane lipids. In this study, we investigated the synthetic defects of <span>pah</span> and <span>lpcat</span> mutations in sexual reproduction of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) and explored the prospect of pistil lipid provision to pollen tube growth. The combined deficiencies of <span>lpcat</span> and <span>pah</span> led to decreased pollen tube growth in the pistil and reduced male transmission. Interestingly, pistils of the lipid mutant <span>dgat1</span> ameliorated the male transmission deficiencies of <span>pah lpcat</span> pollen. In contrast, pollination with a nonspecific phospholipase C (NPC) mutant exacerbated the fertilization impairment of the <span>pah lpcat</span> pollen. Given the importance of DAG in lipid metabolism and its contrasting changes in the <span>dgat1</span> and <span>npc</span> mutants, we further investigated whether DAG supplement in synthetic media could influence pollen performance. DAG was incorporated into phospholipids of germinating pollen and stimulated pollen tube growth. Our study provides evidence that pistil-derived lipids contribute to membrane lipid synthesis in pollen tube growth, a hitherto unknown role in synergistic pollenâ€“pistil interactions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"16c923fa692dd577008234981b5dbd876f152b1cb7535c3e02f64e780c8d5cb6","category":"Environment"}
