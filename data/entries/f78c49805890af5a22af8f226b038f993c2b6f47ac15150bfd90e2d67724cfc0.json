{"title":"The Skill of Positive Solitude Moderates the Relationship between 24 Character-Strengths and Flourishing in the Second Half of Life","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0628/v1","date":1718088194000,"content":"Abstract \nObjectives: Aging may challenge life and even affect individuals' well-being and flourishing. This includes challenges of shrinking social relations and being by yourself in old age while using your personal strengths. The current study examines two important personal resources, i.e., the skill of positive solitude and the 24 character-strengths, that may be associated with flourishing in old age. \nMethods: A convenience sample of 1085 community-dwelling adults (M = 57.20, SD = 6.24, range = 50-87), completed an online self-report survey with demographic measures and scales measuring personal strengths, the skill of positive solitude, and flourishing.\nResults: As hypothesized, the 24 character-strengths and positive solitude, were each associated with flourishing, and positive solitude moderated the relationships between the 24 character-strengths and flourishing. The 24 character-strengths and flourishing relationship was stronger among participants with lower levels of positive solitude.\nConclusion: These findings highlight that despite the decrease in social relations which often characterizes old age, the skill of positive solitude serves as a valuable resource for flourishing in the later stages of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f78c49805890af5a22af8f226b038f993c2b6f47ac15150bfd90e2d67724cfc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
