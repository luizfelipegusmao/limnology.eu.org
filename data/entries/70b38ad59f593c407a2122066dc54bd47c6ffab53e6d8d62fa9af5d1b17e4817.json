{"title":"Multi-dimensional Ergonomic Evaluation Method for Cockpit Light Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0847/v1","date":1715596042000,"content":"To instruct interior lighting design of aviation cockpit and ensure the work efficiency and comfort of pilots, and reduce safety accidents caused by light environment and visual fatigue during flight, it is important to establish a multi-dimensional ergonomic evaluation mechanism of cockpit light environment. In this paper, by improving Jdms' mental load theory, we establish a thorough experimental scheme based on physiological workload, mental workload, work performance and physiological work performance to evaluate the cockpit ergonomic under different light environment multi-dimensionally. Firstly, 12 evaluation indexes including job accuracy, job speed, blinking, heart rate variability, average fixation time, saccadic speed, mental demand, physical demand, operational performance, time demand, degree of confusion and degree of effort are obtained through the experiment, and then the weight of each evaluation index is calculated by entropy method to construct the ergonomic evaluation model. The evaluation results of physiological workload, mental load, work performance and physiological work performance were combined to obtain the final ergonomic evaluation results. According to our experimental results, it was found that light environment for pilot to get the highest ergonomic efficiency is 1500 lx light illumination and 5000K color temperature. The results provide a reference for the ergonomic experiment of aircraft cockpit and the design of aviation cockpit lighting system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70b38ad59f593c407a2122066dc54bd47c6ffab53e6d8d62fa9af5d1b17e4817","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
