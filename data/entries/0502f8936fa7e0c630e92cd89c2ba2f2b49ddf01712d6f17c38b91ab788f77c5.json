On the other hand, it has been shown that histone acetylation regulates long-term memory formation. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two inhibitors of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), 4-phenylbutyrate (PB) and IN14 (100 mg/kg/day, ip for 2 days), on memory performance in mice exposed to a single 15-min forced swimming stress session. Plasma corticosterone levels were determined 30 minutes after acute swim stress in one group of mice. In another experimental series, independent groups of mice were trained in one of three different memory tasks: Object recognition test, Elevated T maze, and Buried food location test. Subsequently, the hippocampi were removed to perform ELISA assays for histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) expression. Acute stress induced an increase in plasma corticosterone levels, as well as hippocampal HDAC2 content, along with an impaired performance in memory tests. Moreover, PB and IN14 treatment prevented memory loss in stressed mice. These findings suggest that HDAC2 is involved in acute stress-induced cognitive impairment. None of the drugs improved memory in non-stressed animals, indicating that HDACs inhibitors are not cognitive boosters, but rather potentially useful drugs for mitigating memory deficits.","author":"Heidy Martínez-Pacheco","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0502f8936fa7e0c630e92cd89c2ba2f2b49ddf01712d6f17c38b91ab788f77c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
