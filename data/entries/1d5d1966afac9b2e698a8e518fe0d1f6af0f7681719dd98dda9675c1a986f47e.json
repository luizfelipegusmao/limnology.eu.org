{"title":"Effects of different parameters of Tai Chi on the intervention of chronic low back pain: A meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306518","date":1720533600000,"content":"<p>by Hailun Kang, Min Yang, Mengke Li, Rui Xi, Qin Sun, Qinqin Lin</p>\r\nObjective <p>To evaluate the effects of Tai Chi in the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain by Meta-analysis and to investigate its influencing factors.</p> Methods <p>The study searched eight databases (PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China Knowledge Network, Wanfang, VIP, and CBM) from inception to October 2023. Two investigators independently selected 10 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT) against inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by data extraction and study quality assessment by ROB 2. The outcomes of interest were pain intensity and disability. The studies were combined using meta-analysis when statistical pooling of data was possible. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.</p> Results <p>10 randomized controlled studies with a total sample of 886 cases were included, of which 4 (40%) were assessed as low risk of bias. The effect size of Tai Chi for chronic low back pain was [Weighted Mean Difference (<i>WMD)</i> with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = -1.09 (-1.26, -0.92), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01], all achieving large effect sizes and statistically significant; the effect size for disability was [Standard Mean Difference (<i>SMD)</i> with 95% CI = -1.75 (-2.02, -1.48), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01], and the combined effect sizes of physical health and mental health for quality of life were [<i>WMD</i> (95% CI) = 4.18 (3.41, 4.95), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; <i>WMD</i> (95% CI) = 3.23 (2.42, 4.04), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01] respectively. The incidence of adverse reactions was low. Meta regression and subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant effect on intervention measures (Tai Chi alone, Tai Chi as additional therapy, water Tai Chi), Tai Chi school (Chen and Yang) and the number of total intervention sessions (&gt; 30 and ≤ 30). The evidence quality evaluation showed that the evidence of pain, physical health of quality of life and mental health score was medium quality, while the evidence of disability and adverse reactions was low quality.</p> Conclusions <p>Tai Chi has an obvious effect of in relieving chronic low back pain. Tai Chi alone and Tai Chi as supplementary therapy have good effects. Tai Chi in water have not been verified. Chen style Tai Chi and Yang’s Tai Chi, intervention more than 30 times or less than 30 times had no significant difference in the effect of intervention on CLBP.</p>","author":"Hailun Kang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1d5d1966afac9b2e698a8e518fe0d1f6af0f7681719dd98dda9675c1a986f47e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
