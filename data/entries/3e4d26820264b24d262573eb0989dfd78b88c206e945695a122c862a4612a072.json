To identify key underlying drivers of total SOC distributions, we compiled a global dataset of soil C stocks held in three chemical forms, reflecting different mechanisms of organic C protection: free particulate organic C (fPOC), physically protected particulate organic C (oPOC), and mineral-protected soil organic C (mSOC). In our dataset, these three SOC pools were differentially sensitive to the effects of climate, soil mineralogy, and ecosystem type, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between physical and chemical C protection mechanisms. C stocks in all three pools varied among ecosystems: cropland soils stored the least amount in each pool, with forest and grassland soils both containing significantly more fPOC (40%–60% greater in each ecosystem) than croplands. oPOC stocks did not significantly differ from zero in croplands but were substantial in forest and grassland soils. Meanwhile, mSOC stocks were the greatest in grasslands and shrublands (90%–100% greater than croplands). In cropland soils, there were no major effects of tillage on C storage in any of the three pools, while manure addition enhanced mSOC stocks, especially when added with inorganic N. Thus, the human land use intensity in croplands appears to reduce SOC storage in all major pools, depending upon management; retaining native vegetation should be emphasized to maintain current global SOC stocks.</p>","author":"Samuel J.
