{"title":"Evaluation of Physical and Mental Health in Adults Who Underwent Limb-Lengthening Procedures with Circular External Fixators during Childhood or Adolescence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1449/v1","date":1724150102000,"content":"Background: Lower limb length discrepancy (LLD) in children and adolescents, often due to congenital or acquired conditions, is treated to achieve limb equality and alignment, optimizing function and minimizing cosmetic concerns for an active adulthood. This study evaluated the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and physical functioning of adults who underwent unilateral limb lengthening with circular external fixators (EFs) in childhood. Methods: Fifty patients treated at a median age of 14.9 years completed the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Stanmore Limb Reconstruction Score (SLRS) questionnaires in adulthood, with a median follow-up of 8.9 years. Results: Among the 50 patients, 38 underwent a single limb lengthening (21 tibia, 12 femur, 5 both), while 12 required multiple cycles. The median residual LLD was 0.4 cm, with 12 patients (24%) having over 2 cm. Complications occurred in 67% of procedures, mainly due to prolonged healing. Physical and mental health scores were significantly lower than normative data. The mean Physical Component Summary was 52.2 ± 7.2 (p = 0.20). The mean Mental Component Summary was 43.9 ± 8.6 (p = 0.001), notably lower in congenital LLD cases. Many SLRS items (Pain, Social, Physical Function, Work, and Emotions) strongly correlated with SF-36 items. Conclusions: The study highlights the challenges in treating LLD, emphasizing the significant mental health impact, especially in congenital cases, and the necessity for comprehensive long-term care strategies. These findings suggest that future therapeutic strategies should focus on both physical and psychological outcomes to improve overall recovery in LLD treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99ff9c227e51086a01dfee8be1aee335a2c52e79b5b9f3736432cae06bd52bd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
