Fifty-five fall born yearling Angus and Angus cross heifers were used in a 157-d experiment. Heifers were fed two consecutive diets at the Oklahoma State University Range Cow Research Center. Heifers were sorted into one of two drylot pens based on BW. Each drylot pen was equipped with individual intake monitoring system (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD) with a stocking rate of 3.3 heifers per feeder. The first intake segment (HAY) was initiated with a 21 d of adaptation followed by 70 d of data collection. Heifers were offered ad libitum access to long stem unprocessed bermudagrass hay and a salt/mineral/vitamin supplement. After the HAY period, heifers were adapted to a 50% forage, 50% concentrate diet (TMR) during a 14-d adaptation period, followed by 52-d of data collection. Means and standard deviations for phenotypic traits of DMI, ADG, RFI, and CH4 were 6.7 ± 0.7 kg, 0.44 ± 0.13kg, and 194.6 ± 17.56 g/d respectively for HAY and 14.3 ± 1.34 kg, 1.72 ± 0.20 kg, and 280 ± 24.69 g/d respectively for TMR. Pearson correlations between diets for DMI, ADG, and CH4 were 0.32, -0.16, and 0.29, respectively. Coefficient of variation for DMI was 10.8% for HAY and 9.4% for TMR. Coefficient of variation for ADG was 29.9% for HAY and 11.6% for TMR. Methane intensity was calculated as CH4, g/day divided by DMI, kg/d resulting in 29.6 ± 3.5 and 19.9 ± 2.2 g CH4/kg DMI for HAY and TMR, respectively. In summary, HAY DMI was moderately and positively correlated with TMR DMI while ADG was not correlated among the two diet types. The HAY diet generated less total daily CH4, although more CH4 per unit of feed intake.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5fc4c738bcece9e5b088f30aaf524c640787063ab6006e1fdf6b7895e9ba3df8","category":"Environment"}
