{"title":"Effect of Drone Brood Homogenate on Morphometry of In-Testine, Production of MUC-2, sIgA, Expression of Cyto-Kines, and Blood Values in Pigs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0015/v1","date":1717462405000,"content":"Abstract: In this paper we describe how the administration of drone brood homoge-nate (DBH) influenced intestinal secretion of IgA, MUC-2, morphometric parameters, peripheral blood values, and expression of cytokines. A total of 12 pigs were divided into three groups, two experimental, first fed with 100 mg DBH.kg-1 (E1), second with 200 mg DBH.kg-1 (E2) of body weight, and a control (C) group without DBH in the di-et. Animals didn't show significant changes in average weight gains and feed conver-sion among evaluated groups. Feeding a diet containing 200 mg DBH.kg-1 of body weight in the E2 group produced an increase (p &lt; 0.05) in the red cell distribution width, the percentage of metabolic activity of blood phagocytes in the peripheral blood, as well as splenic cell subpopulations CD4+ and CD21+. The villi height and their cutting surface were increased in the E2 group (p &lt; 0.01), together with a gradual decrease in the concentration of MUC-2 and sIgA (p &lt; 0.001). Upregulation of IL-8 (p &lt; 0.0001), IL-10 (p &lt; 0.05), and IL-18 (p &lt; 0.001) was found mainly in E2 group. Results suggest, that supplementation of DBH in the feed of pigs formed optimal intestinal homeostasis.drone","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1015fa5a624f6039146abdaebe1b90ff10d7ed621f7209d4c2dfe9f13b3dc75a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
