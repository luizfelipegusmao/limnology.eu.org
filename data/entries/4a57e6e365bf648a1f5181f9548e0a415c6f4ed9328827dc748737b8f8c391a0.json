{"title":"A Smart Grasp Deep Network Based on One-Way Fusion Strategy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0076/v1","date":1727849030000,"content":"Robot grasp modeling and implementation is one of essential abilities for a robot with embodied artificial intelligence. However, most existing deep learning-based grasp methods suffer a large number of parameters and heavy computation overheads. To address this issue, by fully exploiting the complementary capabilities of both CNNs and Transformers, we propose a smart grasp deep network with one-way fusion strategy via context path and spatial path (SGNet), which enjoys a lightweight structure, fast inference speed and easy deployment on devices with limited computation resources. Specifically, the context path employs lightweight depthwise separable convolution to achieve fast down-sampling while a novel DSFormer module mainly by integrating Transformer is to extract global and context-rich features. The spatial path efficiently fuses feature information from the context path in one-way manner and generate high-resolution feature maps via point-by-point convolution operations. Experimental results show the proposed model with only 1M parameters has a significantly overall performance, achieving 99.4% accuracy on Cornell dataset and 93.4% accuracy on Jacquard dataset, as well as within 12.5ms inference time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a57e6e365bf648a1f5181f9548e0a415c6f4ed9328827dc748737b8f8c391a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
