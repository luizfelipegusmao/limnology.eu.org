{"title":"Efficient and Stable Nanocomposite Catalysts of Ethanol Steam Reforming Prepared via Inexpensive Procedure with Pluronic P123 Copolymer: Characterization and Testing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1385/v1","date":1724129855000,"content":"Mesoporous MgAl2O4+ LnFe0.7Ni0.3O3 (Ln=La, Pr) nanocomposites were prepared by inexpensive one-pot procedure with Pluronic P123 copolymer, Ni+Ru active component was supported by wet impregnation. The real structure of samples was studied by XRD and TEM with EDX, surface properties by FTIRS of adsorbed CO, reactivity by H2 â€“TPR, catalytic activity was tested in ethanol steam reforming. Disordering of the real structure of nanocomposite supports due to incorporation of transition metal cations into MgAl2O4 results in developed metal-support interface and domination of single surface metal centers. This provides a high catalytic activity in reaction of ethanol steam reforming in the intermediate temperature range ~550 oC close to that of the best known catalysts, and stability to coking. A higher activity for Pr-containing catalyst is provided by a high reactivity of surface oxygen species bound with Pr cations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07a376bd9d9d3d30bb0426a7dffee22b90656b496cb4eaa88da420b8252299a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
