This material is a metastable semiconductor, nontoxic, composed of earth-abundant elements, and its band gap energy can be easily tunable in the range 1.4–1.8 eV. For this reason, it has been proposed for many applications in the solar energy conversion field. The main aim of this work is to evaluate the properties of the Cu<sub>3</sub>N thin films fabricated by reactive radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at different RF power values to determine its potential as light absorber. The Cu<sub>3</sub>N films were fabricated at room temperature from a Cu metallic target at the RF power ranged from 25 to 200 W onto different substrates (silicon and glass). The pure nitrogen flux was set to 20 sccm, and the working pressures were set to 3.5 Pa and 5 Pa. The X-ray diffraction results showed a transition from (100) to (111) preferred orientations when RF power increased; the atomic force microscopy images revealed a granular morphology, while Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectra exhibited the characteristics peaks related to Cu–N bonds, which became narrower when the RF power increased. Finally, to stablish the suitability of these films as absorber, the band gap energy was calculated from transmission spectra.</p>","author":"María Isabel Rodríguez‐Tapiador, \nJesús Merino, \nTariq Jawhari, \nAna Luz Muñoz‐Rosas, \nJoan Bertomeu, \nSusana Fernández","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"d96d3c90f0dba2d06f712ec763b66df45ea23386c098566b8b6dfed2c2a377c6","category":"Environment"}
