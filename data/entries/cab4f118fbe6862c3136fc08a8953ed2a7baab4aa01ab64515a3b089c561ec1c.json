{"title":"Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for Trajectory Tracking of Quadrotor UAV under Input Saturation and Disturbances","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1088/v1","date":1726464763000,"content":"The paper addresses the challenging issue of trajectory tracking for uncertain quadrotor UAVs, particularly under the constraints of input saturation and external disturbances. It introduces adaptive laws for managing uncertainties in mass and inertia moments without requiring prior knowledge, ensuring effective control even with varying system parameters. To counteract the effects of input saturation, the study incorporates an auxiliary system designed to compensate for these limitations. Additionally, a disturbance observer(DO) is utilized to manage and mitigate the impact of time-varying external disturbances. The proposed control strategy integrates a sliding mode adaptive control approach with an inner-outer loop structure, enhancing robustness and adaptability. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed control strategy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cab4f118fbe6862c3136fc08a8953ed2a7baab4aa01ab64515a3b089c561ec1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
