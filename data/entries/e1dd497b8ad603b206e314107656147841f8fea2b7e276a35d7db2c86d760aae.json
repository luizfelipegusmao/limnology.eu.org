Aluminum oxides have been well studied in the field of material sciences. Alumina’s crystal structure can vary based on thermal conditions of its environment making it metastable [<a href=\"#ozae044.260-B2\">2</a>]. This work focuses on creating different metastable forms of alumina from a variety of aluminum hydroxide starting material, including gibbsite, bayerite (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) , boehmite (AlOOH) and an amorphous Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, for astronomical applications to assist in our understanding of dust around AGB stars. Our process of material synthesis follows [<a href=\"#ozae044.260-B1\">1</a>], where each sample of aluminum hydroxide is annealed at 300, 500, 700, 800, 900, 1000, &amp; 1100 -<sup>°</sup>C for 2 hours. The resulting materials are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). The current findings being presented are related to the gibbsite-derived alumina. We compared the thermal evolution of these samples to results from [<a href=\"#ozae044.260-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.260-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e1dd497b8ad603b206e314107656147841f8fea2b7e276a35d7db2c86d760aae","category":"Environment"}
