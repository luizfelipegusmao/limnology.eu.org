{"title":"Importance-Performance Analysis of Factors Affecting the Sustainability and Development of Poultry Farms (Evidence from Broiler Farms in Baghlan Province, Afghanistan)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0705/v1","date":1725966247000,"content":"Ensuring adequate food supplies has become a critical issue with a rapidly growing global population and increasing demand for protein-rich foods. In Baghlan province, Afghanistan, many poultry farms have been forced to cease operations due to insufficient infrastructure and resources, leaving a significant gap in meeting the region's growing demand for poultry products. This study aims to identify the key factors affecting the sustainability and development of broiler farms in Baghlan province as perceived by farm owners. The primary research tool was a researcher-developed questionnaire, whose validity and reliability were confirmed. The study population comprised all broiler farm owners in Baghlan Province, from which a sample of 91 was selected using the Morgan table and complete enumeration sampling method. The findings revealed that approximately 54% of respondents expressed moderate satisfaction with their farms. Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) was conducted to assess the relative importance and performance of various factors affecting the development and sustainability of the farms. The results indicated that having a qualified expert, the farmer's educational level, the poultry house ventilation system, and being a local resident were considered highly important factors for farm success but were underperforming. Based on limited existing research in the region, these findings provide valuable insights for enhancing poultry farm development and food security in Baghlan province and throughout Afghanistan. The study offers specific recommendations for addressing the identified challenges and improving the sustainability of poultry farming in the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"108c147fec97a4b8b099b5e4ae22df3f499dff33654001baa4094936f56f446b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
