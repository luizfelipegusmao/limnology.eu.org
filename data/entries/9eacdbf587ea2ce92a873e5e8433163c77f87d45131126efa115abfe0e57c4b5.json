{"title":"Synthesis and Characterization of N-Nitrososydnonimine as NO. Donor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0838/v1","date":1725975805000,"content":"N-Nitroso-3-morpholinosydnonimine 3 was prepared by nitrosation of SIN-1 and characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HRMS. Its structure, confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, was found in agreement with its mesoionic and aromatic character. Unlike SIN-1, which releases both nitric oxide and superoxide radical, decomposition of this nitrosylated sydonimine could yield nitric oxide as the only decomposition product, and thus without the formation of toxic peroxynitrite.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9eacdbf587ea2ce92a873e5e8433163c77f87d45131126efa115abfe0e57c4b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
