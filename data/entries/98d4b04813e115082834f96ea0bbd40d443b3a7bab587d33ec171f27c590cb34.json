{"title":"PSLBI-25 Students’ perceptions of an artificial intelligence photo generation tool in upper-level animal science curriculum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/647/7757685?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Domesticated livestock behavior (DLB) is an advanced animal science lecture course that emphasizes behavior associated with domestication of various animal species such as livestock, equine, companion animals and exotic species. Meat Science (MS) is an introductory dual lecture and laboratory course that focuses on muscle biology, food-borne illnesses, humane livestock harvesting, and fabrication techniques. With the emerging usage of artificial intelligence (AI) generative technologies, an assignment was developed utilizing the free AI photo generation tool, Craiyon. Students in DLB and MS were tasked with completing an AI assignment, generating images relevant to either DLB or MS concepts, to expose students to AI technologies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine students’ perceptions, knowledge, concerns, and willingness to use AI generative tools and evaluate differences relative to course enrolled (DLB compared with MS). Students (n = 60) enrolled in DLB and MS completed a post-completion survey instrument that consisted of demographic and 5-point Likert-scale questions to gauge student perceptions of the AI assignment. Student survey responses were compiled online using Qualtrics and subsequent respondent data was analyzed using JMP. To give some demographic information relative to the population of students enrolled in DLB and MS, 81 and 76% of the students were female while 19 and 24% were male, respectively. Both courses contained students further along in their degree-seeking program (&gt; 80% Junior or Senior classification). Approximately, 43% of respondents were first generation college students and 66% commute over 14 km daily. When asked about their previous experience using AI generative technologies, 75% of respondents reported no previous experience using AI generative programs. Students enrolled in MS showed a greater concern (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.03) of AI technologies limiting their opportunity to interact and socialize with others as compared with DLB students. Student experience, knowledge, and willingness to use AI tools was not impacted by course enrolled (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.14). Most students reported that they had a positive experience with the AI assignment and felt the experience would be useful in their future (53 and 73%, respectively). Additionally, a majority of students reported that the AI assignment allowed them to visualize concepts and offered a unique learning experience. Participants seemed to have a solid understanding of AI technologies reporting knowledge in tool limitations and inaccurate output. Students were neutral regarding concerns in becoming over-reliant on AI tools and AI use hindering the development of transferable skills. Students felt that AI image generation tools boosted creativity and could be useful in the realm of DLB and MS. Overall, students possessed a general knowledge of AI generative technologies and saw value in using AI image generation tools as it relates to domesticated animal behavior and meat science principles.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"98d4b04813e115082834f96ea0bbd40d443b3a7bab587d33ec171f27c590cb34","category":"Environment"}
