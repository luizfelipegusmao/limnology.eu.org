Accurate and early detection of RWMA is vital for the successful treatment of MI. Current automated echocardiography analyses typically concentrate on peak values from left ventricular (LV) displacement curves, based on LV contour annotations or key frames during the heart’s systolic or diastolic phases within a single echocardiographic cycle. This approach may overlook the rich motion field features available in multi-cycle cardiac data, which could enhance RWMA detection.</p> Methods <p>In this research, we put forward an innovative approach to detect RWMA by harnessing motion information across multiple echocardiographic cycles and multi-views. Our methodology synergizes U-Net-based segmentation with optical flow algorithms for detailed cardiac structure delineation, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (ConvNet) to extract nuanced motion features. We utilize a variety of machine learning and deep learning classifiers on both A2C and A4C views echocardiograms to enhance detection accuracy. A three-phase algorithm—originating from the HMC-QU dataset—incorporates U-Net for segmentation, followed by optical flow for cardiac wall motion field features. Temporal ConvNet, inspired by the Temporal Segment Network (TSN), is then applied to interpret these motion field features, independent of traditional cardiac parameter curves or specific key phase frame inputs.</p> Results <p>Employing five-fold cross-validation, our SVM classifier demonstrated high performance, with a sensitivity of 93.13%, specificity of 83.61%, precision of 88.52%, and an F1 score of 90.39%. When compared with other studies using the HMC-QU datasets, these Fig s stand out, underlining our method’s effectiveness. The classifier also attained an overall accuracy of 89.25% and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 95%, reinforcing its potential for reliable RWMA detection in echocardiographic analysis.</p> Conclusions <p>This research not only demonstrates a novel technique but also contributes a more comprehensive and precise tool for early myocardial infarction diagnosis.</p>","author":"Sazzli Kasim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"86bcf4949345c9e57ed83643b00c99eb4b35a2bb3457ffddbe4732376e015ea6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
