{"title":"Improved Performance of the PMSM Sensorless Control System Based on DTC Strategy and SMC Using Fractional Order and Fractal Dimension Calculus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1875/v1","date":1716959226000,"content":"Starting from the fact that one of the global control strategies of the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM), namely the Direct Torque Control (DTC) type control strategy, is characterised by the fact that the inner flux and torque control loop usually uses hysteresis ON-OFF type controllers and the oscillations introduced by them have to be cancelled out by the outer speed loop controller (which is usually a PI speed controller and whose performance is good around the global operating points and for relatively small variations of the external parameters and disturbances caused in particular by the load torque variation), while retaining the advantages of the DTC strategy, this paper presents the improvement of the performance of the PMSM sensorless control system using Proportional Integrator (PI), PI Equilibrium Optimizer Algorithm (EOA), Fractional Order (FO) PI, Tilt Integral Derivative (TID) and FO Lead-Lag for constant flux, and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and FOSMC for variable flux. The performance indicators of the control system are the usual ones: response time, settling time, overshoot, steady-state error and speed ripple, plus another one given by the fractal dimension (FD) of the PMSM rotor speed signal, and the hypothesis that the FD of the controlled signal is higher when the control system provides better performance is verified. The paper also presents the basic equations of the PMSM, based on which the synthesis of integer and fractional controllers, the synthesis of an observer for estimating the PMSM rotor speed, electromagnetic torque and stator flux are presented. The comparison of the performance of the proposed control systems and the demonstration of the parametric robustness are performed by numerical simulations in Matlab/Simulink using Simscape Electrical and Fractional Order Modelling and Control (FOMCON). Real-time control based on an embedded system using a TMS320F28379D controller demonstrates the good performance of the PMSM sensorless control system based on the DTC strategy in a complete hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ea2481028aee86f863d02276d63675881a0ee211e3906bff6cc1175df7bdb5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
