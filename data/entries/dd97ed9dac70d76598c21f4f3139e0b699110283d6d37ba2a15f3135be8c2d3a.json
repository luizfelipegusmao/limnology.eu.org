{"title":"Students’ perceptions of and satisfaction with their Orthopaedic posting learning environment by using the Healthcare Education Micro-Learning Environment Measure (HEMLEM) questionnaire","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306971","date":1720706400000,"content":"<p>by Syeda Rubaba Azim, Syed Muhammad Azfar, Mukhtiar Baig</p>\r\nBackground <p>The learning environment in medical education is crucial for student development, encompassing social, psychological, and physical aspects that significantly affect learning. This study aimed to assess undergraduate medical students’ perception of the orthopaedic ward’s learning environment and examine the factors influencing their overall satisfaction during clinical rotation.</p> Methods <p>This cross sectional quantitative study was conducted in a private medical college in Pakistan. Data was collected through a pre-validated questionnaire, \"The Healthcare Education Micro-Learning Environment Measure (HEMLEM).\" Data analysis was done using SPSS version 23 software.</p> Results <p>A total of 205/300 students (response rate 68.33%) [103 (50.2%) males and 102(49.85) females] participated in this survey. Notably, 116 (56.6%) appreciated the ward’s welcoming, friendly, and open atmosphere, and 114(55.6%) of the respondents appreciated the ward culture where they felt free to ask questions or comment. Additionally, 111(54.7%) appreciated the faculty’s enthusiasm for teaching. A comparison between male and female students showed significantly higher satisfaction among males regarding staff attitudes and behaviours (p &lt; .019).</p> Conclusion <p>Undergraduate students held a predominantly positive view of the orthopaedic ward’s learning environment, with differences observed based on gender and year of study. The study highlights the importance of both staff attitude and teaching quality in shaping the educational experience. It suggests that medical institutions should focus on enhancing teaching skills among clinicians to improve learning experiences and ultimately benefit patient care and the healthcare system.</p>","author":"Syeda Rubaba Azim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dd97ed9dac70d76598c21f4f3139e0b699110283d6d37ba2a15f3135be8c2d3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
