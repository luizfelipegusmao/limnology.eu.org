{"title":"Optical Angular Momentum Beam Generation Using Coherent Beam Combination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1484/v1","date":1724289233000,"content":"(1) Background: The significant progress observed over last two decades in coherent beam combining (CBC) technology has mainly focused on its applications in high-energy physics and laser weapons. This work provides insight into the basic principles of CBC and the search for an alternative, namely optical angular momentum (OAM) generation using CBC; (2) Methods: The semi-analytical model based on the paraxial wave equation explored generating OAM-CBC beams by manipulating the tilts and phases of CBC (T&amp;amp;P-CBC) of hexagonal architecture; (3) Results: The specially arranged T&amp;amp;P-CBC shows typical properties of OAM, such as annular profiles for the zero diffraction order and 1-st order replicas in the far field and correlation coefficients of 1% between different OAM-CBC fields; (4) Conclusions: The differences between classical OAM beams and OAM-CBC are substantial due to hexagonal lattice properties. Moreover, applications in free space optical communications are feasible as T&amp;amp;P CBC fulfills the main conditions and requirements for OAM generation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7aeb4e35367f18a5092f67d21e34a0b2a077027efae90b1f16244482bb23f58c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
