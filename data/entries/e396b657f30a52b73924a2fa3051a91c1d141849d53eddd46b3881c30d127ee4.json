{"title":"Senescence Biomarkers CKAP4 and PTX3 Stratify Severe Kidney Disease Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0594/v1","date":1723099730000,"content":"Cellular senescence is the irreversible growth arrest subsequent to oncogenic mutations, DNA damage or metabolic insult. Senescence is associated with aging and chronic age associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The involvement of cellular senescence in Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is not fully understood however, recent studies suggest that such patients have a higher-than-normal level of cellular senescence and accelerated aging. This study aimed to discover key biomarkers of senescence in AKI and CKD patients compared to other chronic ageing diseases as controls. We show that senescence proteins CKAP4 and PTX3 are upregulated in AKI and CKD patients compared with controls with chronic diseases suggesting they may play in a role in overall kidney disease development. Additionally, CKAP4 was found to be differentially expressed in both AKI and CKD when compared to unhealthy controls hence this biomarker could be prognostic senescence biomarker of both AKI and CKD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e396b657f30a52b73924a2fa3051a91c1d141849d53eddd46b3881c30d127ee4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
