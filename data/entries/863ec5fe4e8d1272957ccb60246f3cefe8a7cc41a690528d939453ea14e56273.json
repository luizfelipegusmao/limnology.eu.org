{"title":"Upper Bound Limit Analysis of Deep Tunnel Face Support Pressure with Nonlinear Failure Criterion under Pore Water Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1133/v1","date":1721022718000,"content":"Based on the nonlinear failure criterion and modified tangential technique, the upper bound solutions of supporting pressure on the deep tunnel face were obtained under pore water pressure conditions. The influence of parameters on the supporting pressure and collapse range was investigated according to the unlimited block failure mechanism. It is found that the upper bound solutions of supporting pressure increase with the growth of the nonlinear coefficient and pore water pressure coefficient. The collapse range of the tunnel face scales out with the increase of the nonlinear coefficient and shrinks when increasing the pore water pressure coefficient. Moreover, with the increase of the nonlinear coefficient, the impact strength on supporting pressure and collapse range declines gradually. According to the calculating results, it is manifest that both the pore water pressure and nonlinear criterion factors have negative impacts on the stability of the tunnel face. Thus, more attention should be paid to these parameters to ensure face stability in deep tunnel construction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"863ec5fe4e8d1272957ccb60246f3cefe8a7cc41a690528d939453ea14e56273","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
