{"title":"Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1401/v1","date":1716292941000,"content":"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) now represents the mainstay in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Owing to its exceptional procedural efficacy and safety, TAVI has been extended to include patients at lower surgical risk, thus now encompassing a diverse patient population receiving this treatment. Yet, long-term outcomes also depend on optimal medical therapy for secondary vascular prevention, with antithrombotic therapy serving as a cornerstone. Leveraging data from multiple randomized controlled trials, current guidelines generally recommend single antithrombotic therapy, with either single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or oral anticoagulation (OAC) alone in those patients without, or with atrial fibrillation respectively. Yet, individualization of this pattern, as well as specific case uses, may be needed based on individual-patient characteristics and concurrent procedures. This review aims to discuss the evidence supporting antithrombotic treatments in patients treated with TAVI, indications for a standardized treatment, as well as specific considerations for an individualized approach to treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2788c11d4b4c255946bc985d9c4b3dd3a535e06c21ffc8456b43b3bb07c9d352","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
