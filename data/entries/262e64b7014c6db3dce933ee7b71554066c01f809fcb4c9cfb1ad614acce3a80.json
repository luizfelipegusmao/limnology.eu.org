{"title":"Wearable sensors to measure the influence of sonic seasoning on wine consumers in a live context: a preliminary proof‐of‐concept study","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13432?af=R","date":1710504625000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Any action capable of creating expectations about product quality would be able to modulate experienced pleasantness. In this context, during the 2022 edition of the Internet Festival (Pisa, Italy) a ‘social experiment’ was promoted to set up an affordable and reliable methodology based on wearable sensors to measure the emotions aroused in a live context on consumers by different kinds of wines. Therefore, five wines (two faulty ones and three high-quality samples) were proposed to 50 non-selected consumers in an arousing context with live jazz music as background. Both explicit (questionnaires) and two different approaches for implicit methods (electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded by wearable sensors <i>vs.</i> smartphones), the latter performed on a subgroup of 16, to measure the emotions aroused by wines and music were utilized synergistically.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>According to our findings: (i) wine undoubtedly generates a significant emotional response on consumers; (ii) this answer is multifaceted and attributable to the quality level of the wine tasted. In fact, all things being equal, while drinking wine even untrained consumers can perfectly recognize good wines compared to products of lower quality; (iii) high-quality wines are able to induce a spectrum of positive emotions, as observed by the analysis of ECG signals, especially when they are coupled with background music.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The framework has certainly played to the advantage of good-quality wines, fostering their positive emotional characteristics on the palate even of some less experienced consumers, thanks to a dragging effect towards a positive mood generated by the surrounding conditions (good music in a beautiful location). © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Lucia Billeci, \nChiara Sanmartin, \nAlessandro Tonacci, \nIsabella Taglieri, \nGiuseppe Ferroni, \nRoberto Marangoni, \nFrancesca Venturi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"262e64b7014c6db3dce933ee7b71554066c01f809fcb4c9cfb1ad614acce3a80","category":"Environment"}
