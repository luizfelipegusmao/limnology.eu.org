{"title":"Various Grids in Moiré Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0979/v1","date":1726124363000,"content":"The moiré effect is typically observed in regular periodic structures and sometimes in random (aperiodic) structures. However, only regular structures were used in measurements. In this study, we propose structures whose images are not regular but not completely random, and resemble a series of lines, such as a grid of dotted lines or a matrix of dots. A relatively simple image processing technique can make the moiré effect in such structures very similar to regular structures. We demonstrated using five different structures (including text) in measurements, with similar results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c45fa18f3b16fb79434c79519b9e4b97eab305e88d7842c379b3981a333a42e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
