{"title":"Three-Dimensional Origin of Fivefold Misfit in Icosahedral Multiply Twinned Particles at Atomic Level","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.886/7719911?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Fivefold symmetry is mysterious in crystallography because it lacks translational invariance and periodic structures. We cannot fill two-dimensional (2D) planes with regular pentagons or make an icosahedron with regular tetrahedra (Figure 1a-b). Multiply twinned particles (MTPs) have attracted attention since their discovery because of their excellent optical and catalytic properties, crystallographically forbidden fivefold symmetry and associated lattice misfit strain. Icosahedral MTPs composed of fivefold twinned tetrahedra have broad applications and the researchers have observed from 2D perspective for decades [<a href=\"#ozae044.886-B1\">1-5</a>]. Electron tomography offers a method to image internal distortions and visualize successive twinning in three-dimensional (3D) [<a href=\"#ozae044.886-B6\">6-7</a>]. However, the atomic misfit, the associated strain relief mechanism, and the bridging solid-angles in icosahedral MTPs are not yet quantitatively understood in 3D, primarily due to a lack of experimentally obtained 3D atomic structures of MTPs. Here, we resolved the 3D atomic structures of Janus icosahedral nanoparticles using atomic resolution electron tomography. A geometrically fivefold face (C5 side) consistently corresponds to a less ordered face (C5’ side) like two hemispheres (Figure 1c-d). We found that the 3D angular deficiency is compensated by insertion of edge dislocations and amorphization of several tetrahedra. The disordered amorphous domain with the largest solid angle is 14.6° larger than the ideal fcc domain, relaxing a large amount of strain and filling the largest angular defects (Figure 1e-h). Our research has unveiled, for the first time, how the spatial gap of the icosahedron is compensated at the 3D atomic scale and provide a completely new insight on atomistic models for the modelling of formation mechanisms of fivefold and icosahedral twinned structures by molecular dynamics as well as computer simulations of lattice distortions and defects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3d018d58456486b3ff6f9a0ad26fba038bd2fcd64ad7646241abb74d8cca6efc","category":"Environment"}
