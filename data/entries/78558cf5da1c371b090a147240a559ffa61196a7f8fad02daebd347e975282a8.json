Phylogenetic relationships and divergence time estimations within each species were inferred using the combined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence dataset for the cytochrome <span>c</span> oxidase subunit I (<span>COI</span>) and large subunit ribosomal RNA (<span>16S rRNA</span>). In addition, the rapidly evolving <span>COI</span> datasets were used to infer intraspecific genetic structure and population differentiation within both species. Phylogeographical concordance factor (PCF) analysis was used to statistically estimate the degree of congruence between the two species at localities where both species were sampled. Phylogenetically, <span>G. spadicea</span> exhibited two clades that diverged during the Plio/Pleistocene, while <span>M. wahlbergi</span> formed a single shallow clade that showed Pleistocene divergence. The haplotype networks for the <span>COI</span> locus demonstrated evidence of geographical and genetic isolation within both species. PCF analysis demonstrated partial phylogeographical concordance, suggesting that the two species may have been affected by similar ancient climatic events. Traits other than poor dispersal capabilities and limited gene flow may also influence how a species responds to fluctuating climate change.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"78558cf5da1c371b090a147240a559ffa61196a7f8fad02daebd347e975282a8","category":"Environment"}
