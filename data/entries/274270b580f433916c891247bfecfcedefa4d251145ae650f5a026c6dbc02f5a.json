{"title":"Damage Free 3D Characterization and TEM Sample Preparation of Beam Sensitive Materials Using Advanced Multiple Ion Source PFIB under Cryogenic Conditions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.872/7720205?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Direct quantitative investigation of the inner morphology and structure of materials is of critical importance to provide profound insights for properties evaluation. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB), combined known as FIB-SEM or DualBeam, has been widely recognized as a highly effective method to obtain 3D volume information. FIB-SEM together with advanced serial sectioning software has made 3D data acquisition and analysis possible in an unattended manner. However, slicing using Ga ion beam at room temperature has been found inducing severe damage to beam sensitive materials, resulting in significant deterioration of the 3D data quality. Advanced FIB-SEM platforms integrated with state of the art rotatory cryo stage provide an unprecedent opportunity for damage-free ion beam slicing and high spatial resolution SEM acquisition under cryogenic conditions. Subsequently we can recover the comprehensive volume information of such beam sensitive materials from 3D reconstruction of the micrograph stacks. In addition, cryogenic multiple ion source PFIB has been proven capable of fabricating high-quality large area TEM lamellae without damaging the beam sensitive bulk samples. The flexibility and unparalleled stability of this dedicated rotatory cryo stage make fabricating TEM lamellae under cryogenic temperatures conveniently just as at room temperature. Coupled with cryogenic in-situ nanomanipulator, the TEM samples can be easily lifted out under cryogenic conditions and subsequently transferred to TEM for further inspection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"274270b580f433916c891247bfecfcedefa4d251145ae650f5a026c6dbc02f5a","category":"Environment"}
