{"title":"Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Main Effects and Interaction Parameters in Thermoacoustic Refrigerators Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0658/v1","date":1725875314000,"content":"Efforts to optimize the design and enhance the efficiency of standing-wave thermoacoustic refrigerators (SWTAR), particularly those with parallel plate stacks, are crucial for achieving rapid and straightforward engineering estimates. This study primarily focuses on optimizing the Coefficient of Performance (COP) by combining the linear thermoacoustic theory (LTT) with the Design of Experiments (DOE) approach. The investigation centers around five key parameters affecting the COP, once the working gas is selected. Then, based on the LLT theory, the COP was estimated numerically, over defined intervals of those five parameters. Moreover, through quantitative and qualitative effect analyses, these five parameters and their interactions are determined. Utilizing a transfer function and surface response analyses based on the COP, the study aims to delineate the best COP value as well as the contribution of the thermoacoustic parameters and their interactions. Furthermore, a comparison between contour and surface responses and several statistical decision approaches applying the Full Factorial Design verify the robustness of the study’s findings. Ultimately, the COP results obtained align with existing literature, underscoring the validity and relevance of the study’s methodologies and conclusions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e27379dc674a98078dd6f62b6880af69f1c9813771ea5e337d75b0687808c62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
