{"title":"The Roles of Phytogenic Feed Additives on Mitigating Ruminant Methane Emission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0347/v1","date":1717642810000,"content":"Ruminant animals naturally emit methane gas owing to anaerobic microbial fermentation in the rumen, and these gases are considered major contributors to global warming. Scientists worldwide are attempting to minimize methane emissions from ruminant animals. Some of these attempts include the manipulation of rumen microbes using antibiotics, synthetic chemicals, dietary interventions, probiotics, propionate enhancers, stimulation of acetogens, manipulation of rumination time, vaccination, and genetic selection of animals that produce low methane (CH4). The majority of synthetic additives are harmful to both beneficial rumen microbes and the host or only temporarily affect methanogenesis. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) have recently emerged as the best alternatives to antibiotics and synthetic chemicals because of growing public concerns regarding drug resistance and the negative impacts of antibiotics and synthetic chemicals on humans, livestock, and the environment. These additives reduce methane production and improve the volatile fatty acid profile. In this review, we provide an overview of PFA sources and how their bioactive components affect the rumen microbiome to reduce methane emissions. Additionally, we highlight the mechanisms of action of PFAs as a whole as well as some of their bioactive components.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ff1819e83a6366c834d422ec2ec6bb1f169c256e19a7575925fa6b227f1c52e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
