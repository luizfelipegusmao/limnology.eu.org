{"title":"The first baleen whale marine protected area proposed for Bryde's whales in the Beibu Gulf, China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13082?af=R","date":1712234898000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) for cetaceans is an important strategy to mitigate human disturbance and protect biodiversity. Despite abundant cetacean species, there are only a few MPAs dedicated to cetacean conservation in China, all of which are for inshore dolphins. Bryde's whales, the only nearshore baleen whale population in mainland China, are conflicting with intensive human activities, yet an effective conservation strategy is lacking. This study used species distribution models to analyze distribution patterns and suitable habitats of Bryde's whales in the Beibu Gulf and proposes the first baleen whale MPA in China. Our results showed Bryde's whales have a seasonal distribution pattern in the Beibu Gulf, and that the waters around Weizhou Island and the southeastern coast of Vietnam were their core habitats. The seasonal nighttime light data indicated a negative relationship between the number of ship lights and Bryde's whale sightings and suggest that Bryde's whales might be threatened by fisheries. We proposed an MPA based on the results, suggesting that the waters within 20â€‰km around Weizhou Island should be declared a protected area. Furthermore, we recommend that anthropogenic activities in the waters around Weizhou Island are better managed to reduce negative impacts on marine life.</p>","author":"Yaoyao Zhang, \nXiaodong Sun, \nZhiwen Nong, \nMo Chen, \nYujiang Hao, \nJianghua Wang, \nKexiong Wang, \nDing Wang, \nZhigang Mei","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Mammal Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"41f2ab2fb7823483a860925793cfe03661521bf60a4c6416d33f6b2a3c4db49f","entryHash":"787e6c39a5de59c23a6d24856764f7ed3b8183a16e2e1597e4eaa3ea16532cdc","category":"Environment"}
