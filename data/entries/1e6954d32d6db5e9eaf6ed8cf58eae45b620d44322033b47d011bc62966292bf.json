{"title":"The Mean Inner Potential of Hematite- α-Fe2O3 across the Morin Transition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.837/7719964?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The mean inner potential (MIP) is defined as the volume averaged electrostatic (Coulomb) potential within a crystal with respect to vacuum [<a href=\"#ozae044.837-B1\">1</a>]. It is a fundamental material property depending on composition, crystal structure and surfaces. We measured the MIP of crystals using off-axis electron holography (OAEH, see Fig. 1(a)) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), e.g. Refs. [<a href=\"#ozae044.837-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.837-B3\">3</a>]. The MIP is sensitive to the distribution of valence electrons, so we suggest its use as a chemical bonding parameter for solids: Hematite, α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a test case to the sensitivity of the MIP as a proposed bonding parameter because of the Morin antiferromagnetic phase transition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1e6954d32d6db5e9eaf6ed8cf58eae45b620d44322033b47d011bc62966292bf","category":"Environment"}
