{"title":"Vesicle trafficking pathways in defence-related cell wall modifications: papillae and encasements","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/12/3700/7644523?rss=1","date":1712880000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Filamentous pathogens that cause plant diseases such as powdery mildew, rust, anthracnose, and late blight continue to represent an enormous challenge for farmers worldwide. Interestingly, these pathogens, although phylogenetically distant, initiate pathogenesis in a very similar way by penetrating the cell wall and establishing a feeding structure inside the plant host cell. To prevent pathogen ingress, the host cell responds by forming defence structures known as papillae and encasements that are thought to mediate pre- and post-invasive immunity, respectively. This form of defence is evolutionarily conserved in land plants and is highly effective and durable against a broad selection of non-adapted filamentous pathogens. As most pathogens have evolved strategies to overcome the defences of only a limited range of host plants, the papilla/encasement response could hold the potential to become an optimal transfer of resistance from one plant species to another. In this review I lay out current knowledge of the involvement of membrane trafficking that forms these important defence structures and highlight some of the questions that still need to be resolved.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7456d6b6a94976a9b6f94206dd07ed1f85d8453f3c5e52697fd41d8330eb834c","category":"Environment"}
