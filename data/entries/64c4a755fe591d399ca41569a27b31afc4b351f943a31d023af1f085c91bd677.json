WDS quantitative analysis of light elements at trace levels brings into play additional effects such as non-linear background shapes and spectral interferences. We will examine these analytical issues for both major and trace levels of light elements and review what software methods and tools can aid in obtaining accurate light element analyses with WDS EPMA.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"64c4a755fe591d399ca41569a27b31afc4b351f943a31d023af1f085c91bd677","category":"Environment"}
