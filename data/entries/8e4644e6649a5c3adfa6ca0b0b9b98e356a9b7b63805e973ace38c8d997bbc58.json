{"title":"Effect of Gurney Flaps on Non-Planar Wings at Low Reynolds Number","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1866/v1","date":1721832026000,"content":"The effect of spanwise wing non-planarity, implemented in conjunction with a Gurney flap is presented. Testing was undertaken in a low speed wind tunnel using a rectangular wing with an aspect ratio of 3. The outer 1/3 of the wing was non-planar which took the form of dihedral or a circular arc. A 2% high Gurney flap was implemented such that it could extend over the entire span, or the planar inboard section. Loads were measured using a sting balance. The data shows that non-planarity increases the maximum lift coefficient and the wingâ€™s lift curve slope. Gurney flap lift modulation was enhanced in the presence of non-planarity. The addition of Gurney flaps caused a greater minimum drag coefficient increment for the non-planar wings. The Gurney flaps reduced the lift dependent drag of the wings; however, the minimum drag coefficient was observed to increase. The Gurney flaps reduced the maximum lift to drag ratio (L/D) for the non-planar wings; however, the flat wing showed a small L/D increment with flap addition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e4644e6649a5c3adfa6ca0b0b9b98e356a9b7b63805e973ace38c8d997bbc58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
