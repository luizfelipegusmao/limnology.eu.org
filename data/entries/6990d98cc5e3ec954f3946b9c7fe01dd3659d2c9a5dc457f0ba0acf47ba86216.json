In fish, the thymus gland is a primary lymphoid organ: ‘Old Gland’ [<a href=\"#ozae044.424-B1\">1</a>], always exposed to the external aquatic environment.

The thymic vascular net-working system and the rejuvenation of thymic trabeculae are the regular events of cellular homeostasis [<a href=\"#ozae044.424-B3\">3</a>]. Interestingly, the periodic occurrence and frequency of fibroblast cells, morph of macrophages, mast cells, rodlet cells, cystic elements, <span>etc.</span> may show their definite identity within the thymic structure in different environmental conditions.
