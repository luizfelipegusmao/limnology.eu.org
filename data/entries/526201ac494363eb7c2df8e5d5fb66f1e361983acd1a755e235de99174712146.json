{"title":"IgG Antibody Titers against Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides Stercolaris, and Toxocara canis in Venezuelan Patients with Asthma or COPD","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0144/v1","date":1725343740000,"content":"It has been suggested that parasitic infections, common in Latin American populations, may amplify the inflammatory response of the airways. There are several reports in atopic and asthmatic patients, but few reports of parasitic infection in COPD patients. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of parasitic infections in COPD patients as compared to atopic and asthmatic patients attending the outpatient clinics of the Institute of Immunology and the pneumonology service of the University hospital. A case-control study was conducted: 100 patients with bronchial asthma, 100 patients with COPD, 100 individuals with atopy without respiratory symptoms, and 100 healthy individuals. Serum specific IgG antibody against the parasites Ascaris lumbricoides (Al), Strongyloides stercolaris (Ss) and Toxocara canis (Tc) were measured: by ELISA. IgE levels were used as an indirect indicator of atopy. Positive IgG for Al was observed in all groups, predominantly in atopic cohort, Ss positiveness was recorded only in 4 COPD patients and Tc positiveness was observed in all groups except in controls. There are significant correlations between the values of Al and IgE in controls, atopic and asthmatic patients not with COPD. No correlation was found for Tc. IgE levels and FEV1 correlate only in atopic and asthmatic patients. Parasitic infections are common in atopic patients and in moderate and severe asthmatic and COPD patients. Anti-inflammatory treatment may be responsible for the increase frequency of infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"526201ac494363eb7c2df8e5d5fb66f1e361983acd1a755e235de99174712146","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
