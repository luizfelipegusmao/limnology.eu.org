Of particular interest within this field are the presence of Au nanomaterials, typically in the nanoparticle morphology, on statues which had previously been crafted with an Au gilding layer on their surface. Moreover, in these cases the presence of the Au particles is easily detected via the presence of a vibrant purple hue on the archaeological samples surface with examples coming from many different cultures, geographies, and 3D artistic mediums [<a href=\"#ozae044.056-B1\">1-5</a>]. Intriguingly, how the gilding layer changes into Au nanoparticles (NPs) in buried samples is poorly understood, such as in the case of Antinous statue at the San Antonio Museum of Art, which would have been buried for hundreds of years (Figure 1). This is for two primary reasons: 1) it is energetically unfavorable, as the Au leaf gliding layer should be extremely stable in its Au (0) oxidization state and in the bulk length scale; 2) having Au (0) as a starting material not standard in Au NP generation which typically goes through a process of either a Au (I) or Au (III) salt being reduced to Au (0) atoms in the presence of a stabilizing agent, such as citrate or polyvinylpyridine [<a href=\"#ozae044.056-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.056-B7\">7</a>]. One key effort, performed by Cardell <span>et al</span>., to understand how the NPs come about focused on their appearance on gilded tin plasterwork in the Alhambra palaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.056-B2\">2</a>]. In this case the gilt work is present above ground exposing it to a high salinity air environment owing to its location near the sea, leading to a favorable electrochemical setup which drives the conversion of the Au/Sn gilding into the nano-length scale with the assistance of an organic stabilizing layer.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"68a9456eac738a2eeb0312399e7f11e7c6ef021658b5422491102650c1acddb0","category":"Environment"}
