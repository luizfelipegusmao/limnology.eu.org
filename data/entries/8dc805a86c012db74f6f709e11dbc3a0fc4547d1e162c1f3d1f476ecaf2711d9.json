Significantly, the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 has shown continual progression, with a recent global shift observed from XBB to BA.2.86, exemplified by the emergence of the predominant JN.1 subvariant. This phenomenon highlights the need for vaccines that can provide broad-spectrum antigenic coverage. In this study, we utilized a NS1-deleted (dNS1) influenza viral vector to engineer an updated live-attenuated vectored vaccine called dNS1-XBB-RBD. This vaccine encodes the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of the XBB.1.5 strain. Our findings demonstrate that the dNS1-XBB-RBD vaccine elicits a similar systemic and mucosal immune response compared to its prototypic form, dNS1-RBD. In hamsters, the dNS1-XBB-RBD vaccine provided robust protection against the SARS-CoV-2 immune-evasive strains XBB.1.9.2.1 and Beta. Remarkably, nasal vaccination with dNS1-RBD, which encodes the ancestor RBD gene, also effectively protected hamsters against both the XBB.1.9.2.1 and Beta strains. These results provide valuable insights about nasal influenza-vectored vaccine and present a promising strategy for the development of a broad-spectrum vaccine against COVID-19 in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"8dc805a86c012db74f6f709e11dbc3a0fc4547d1e162c1f3d1f476ecaf2711d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
