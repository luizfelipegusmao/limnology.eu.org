{"title":"Differentiation of acanthamoeba keratitis from other non-acanthamoeba keratitis: Risk factors and clinical features","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299492","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Shaker Osaywid Alreshidi, José Manuel Vargas, Khabir Ahmad, Ahmed Yousef Alothman, Eman D. Albalawi, Abdulmohsen Almulhim, Saad Hamdan Alenezi, Hani Basher ALBalawi, Naif Mamdouh Alali, Faris Hashem, Mohanna Aljindan</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Infectious Keratitis is one of the most common ocular emergencies seen by ophthalmologists. Our aim is to identify the risk factors and clinical features of Acanthamoeba Keratitis (AK).</p> Methods <p>This retrospective chart review study was conducted at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and included all the microbial keratitis cases, male and female patients of all ages. The main outcome is the differentiation between various microbial keratitis types.</p> Results <p>We included 134 consecutive eyes of 126 persons. We had 24 cases of acanthamoeba keratitis, 22 bacterial keratitis, 24 fungal keratitis, 32 herpetic keratitis, and 32 bacterial co-infection. Contact lens wear was found in 33 eyes (24.6%). Among acanthamoeba keratitis patients, 73% were ≤ 39 years of age, and 73% were females (P &lt;0.001). Also, in AK cases, epithelial defect was found in all cases (100%), endothelial plaques were found in 18 eyes (69.2%), 12 cases had radial keratoneuritis (46.2%), and ring infiltrate was found in 53.8% of AK cases.</p> Conclusions <p>We determined the factors that increase the risk of acanthamoeba infection and the clinical characteristics that help distinguish it from other types of microbial keratitis. Our findings suggest that younger females and patients who wear contact lenses are more likely to develop acanthamoeba keratitis. The occurrence of epitheliopathy, ring infiltrate, radial keratoneuritis, and endothelial plaques indicate the possibility of acanthamoeba infection. Promoting education on wearing contact lenses is essential to reduce the risk of acanthamoeba infection, as it is the most significant risk factor for this infection.</p>","author":"Shaker Osaywid Alreshidi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"934bd8cfa81d8c374cf2f3b34d2fc449bf7395ca4c0fe0c7dca174b8308e61c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
