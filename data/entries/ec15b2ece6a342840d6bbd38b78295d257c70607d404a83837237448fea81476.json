{"title":"The Cretaceous Diatom Database: A tool for investigating early diatom evolution","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13499?af=R","date":1725089950000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Cretaceous period is the time of the first appearance of the diatoms in the fossil record. These fossils give us direct evidence of the age and early evolution of the diatom lineage. The fossil record, however, is incomplete and therefore often extrapolated through time-calibrated phylogenies. These two approaches offer different perspectives on the early evolution of diatoms, which is still poorly understood. We compiled the first comprehensive Cretaceous Diatom Database, a tool to investigate the taxonomy, diversity, and occurrence of the earliest known diatom lineages. To further aid the integration and use of the oldest diatom fossils in molecular clock analyses, we present a set of well-documented Cretaceous fossils that can be placed onto molecular phylogenetic trees of extant and extinct species, making them ideal candidates for the calibration of molecular clocks. The analysis of the fossil record and the Cretaceous Diatom Database revealed Cretaceous diversity is substantially greater than previously thought, yet considerable taxonomic work is still needed. The Cretaceous Diatom Database and the list of Cretaceous fossils for calibrating molecular clocks represent valuable resources for future evolutionary and taxonomic studies of modern and fossil diatoms.</p>","author":"Karolina Bry≈Çka, \nMatt P.
