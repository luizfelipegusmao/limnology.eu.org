{"title":"Exploring Sustainable Aquafeed Alternatives with a Specific Focus on the Ensilaging Technology of Fish Waste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0553/v1","date":1710143928000,"content":"The global increase in population has placed significant pressure on food security, leading to the emergence of aquaculture as a vital source of aquatic foods. However, rising costs and the limited availability of fishmeal in aquafeeds have spurred the search for alternative protein sources. While plant-based ingredients have been integrated into commercial aquafeeds, they come with challenges, including low protein content, palatability issues, and the presence of antinutritional factors. In this context, fish silage, derived from fish waste and discarded fish, stands out as a promising alternative technology due to its cost-effectiveness and sustainability attributes. The production of fish silage involves the addition of organic/inorganic acids or lactic acid bacteria to homogenized fish waste. This process yields a valuable mixture rich in peptides, free amino acids, and partially hydrolyzed proteins, offering significant nutritional benefits for animal diets. Beyond its nutritional advantages, fish silage contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing the impact of waste disposal and enhancing the value of fish waste. The objective of this review is to promote sustainable practices in the aquaculture industry in response to the increasing demand for high-quality feed nutrients. To achieve this, it includes an analysis of research results related to silage technology, an appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages of using fish silage as a feed additive, and a focus on emerging trends in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60b8f2f391b20541ed5b6d797ebfdd71f8c8a3a1c6eb6f15c8298f362e524aee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
