{"title":"Feature Coding and Graph via Transformer: Different Granularities Classification for Aircrafts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1433/v1","date":1726796857000,"content":"Against the background of the sky, imaging and perception of aircraft are cru-\ncial. Among these, the location of aircrafts is not a very difficult problem\nin general, because that deep learning algorithms and object detection models\nbased on convolutional neural network(CNN) are ever-evolving. In order to have\na better identification of various aircrafts, or to accurately locate different types\nof flying targets in the sky, it becomes significant to distinguish and recognize\ndifferent types of aircrafts. One question is that, distinguishing and recognizing\nbetween sub-categories of aircrafts pose great challenges. Although fine-grained\nrecognition focuses on exploring and studying such problems, aircrafts under\ndifferent sub-categories and granularities lead us to rethink the application of\nfeatures. We noticed that features in swin-transformer demonstrates the under-\nstanding and processing of images, fully showcasing the encoding and indexing of information. Through this research and proposed approach, we discovered a\nbetter understanding of features encoding and use, which are inspired by the\nfeature encoding and computation in swin-transformer. In our paper, our ap-\nproach has achieved effects on features encoded graphically, manifested from the\narchitecture design and convolutional neural network computation, and outper-\nforms other famous fine-graiend classification models on this issue. Not only\napproach we proposed has demonstrated superior performance in fine-grained\naicraft classification, but also the mechanisms of the feature encoding under\ndifferent sample space partitions is revealed for this issue, which provides a re-\nsearch for the representation of aircraft fineness characteristics. The relationship\nbetween representation orientation of aircraft feature information under various\ngrained divisions, shows that the recognition of different categories according to\nman-made, such as aircraft, can be achieved by means of the feature represen-\ntations studied in this paper, for more specific defined classification tasks and\nvarious man-made targets partition criteria, which may influences the princi-\nple of design for calculation and feature extraction in fine-grained classification\nmodels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e0d94af624cc51458cce47f8dc8ac0ccccbf068bca20c5cb1802d1bc3ba3223","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
