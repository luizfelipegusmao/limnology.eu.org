Tetrabromobisphenol A can be bioaccumulated in the freshwater insect <i>Chironomus sancticaroli</i>.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Wastewater containing tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), a commonly used flame retardant found in wastewater, can present significant toxic effects on biota, yet its impact on tropical freshwater environments is not well understood. This study explores the effectiveness of two independent anaerobic treatment systems, the acidogenic reactor (AR) and the methanogenic reactor (MR), for the ecotoxicity reduction of TBBPA-rich wastewater in four tropical freshwater species. Despite presenting good physicochemical performance and reduced toxicity of the influent for most species, AR and MR treatments remain acute and chronic toxicity. Overall, MR exhibited greater efficacy in reducing influent toxicity compared with AR. TBBPA bioaccumulation was observed in <i>Chironomus sancticaroli</i> after short-term exposure to 100% MR effluent. Multigenerational exposures highlighted changes in the wing length of <i>C. sancticaroli</i>, showing decreases after influent and AR exposures and increases after MR exposures. These findings underscore the need for ecotoxicological tools in studies of new treatment technologies, combining the removal of emerging contaminants with safeguarding aquatic biota.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nAcidogenic and methanogenic reactors reduced the acute and chronic toxicity of wastewater containing tetrabromobisphenol A.\nBoth treatments still exhibit toxicity, inducing short- and long-term toxic effects on four native tropical species.\nThe aquatic species <i>Pristina longiseta</i> was most sensitive to effluents from acidogenic and methanogenic reactors.\nTBBPA concentrations recovered from <i>Chironomus sancticaroli</i> bioaccumulation analysis ranged from 1.07 to 1.35 μg g<sup>−1</sup>.\nEvaluating new treatment technologies with multiple species bioassays is essential for a comprehensive effluent toxicity assessment and ensuring aquatic safety.\n</p>","author":"Aline Christine Bernegossi, \nGleyson Borges Castro, \nMayara Caroline Felipe, \nTallyson Tavares Cunha de Souza, \nWilliane Vieira Macêdo, \nGuilherme Rossi Gorni, \nJuliano José Corbi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"d55137bd28c188c535fa61c162188137d20042b5cce95ccf5bcfa03d1e000e33","category":"Environment"}
