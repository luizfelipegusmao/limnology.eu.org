{"title":"Deposition of W Nanoparticles by Magnetron Sputtering Gas Aggregation Using Different Amounts of H2/Ar and Air Leaks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0183/v1","date":1719907424000,"content":"This work presents the results regarding the synthesis of tungsten nanoparticles (W NPs) by magnetron sputtering combined with gas aggregation (MSGA) when H2 mixed with Ar is used as working gas, the amount of H2 being increased up to 82%. The results show that up to 40% H2 in discharge the synthesis rate increases over 60 times, rapidly decreasing for over 50% H2 in discharge. The W dust is still produced in H2 dominated discharge (82%), the deposition rate being small but not negligible (20 mg/hour). The obtained WNPs are isolated, with the diameter decreasing from 50 nm to 15 nm when the amount of H2 in discharge is smaller than 41%. Over this value, the particles tend to agglomerate, forming structures similar to film-like deposits. Also, the diameter of the deposited spots on substrates is dependent on the H2 content in discharge. This allows the efficient coating of substrates with dimensions up to 26 mm by translating them in front of the MSGA cluster source exit aperture. Supplementary, for 41% H2 in discharge, the influence of synthetic air leaks (0-5%) in discharge was investigated. The deposition rate decreases rapidly (ceasing for around 4% air in discharge) and the obtained nanoparticles tend to agglomerate (at 2% air content, the dust deposit has the aspect of a near continuous film). Chemical composition investigations show a pronounced tendency of oxidation, nitridation and oxynitride formation in the presence of air leaks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"990c871d49aeb0826a33d8706b8e8156237e0f32bec90b3370b4106baa3369f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
