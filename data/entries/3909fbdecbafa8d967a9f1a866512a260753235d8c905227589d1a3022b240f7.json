{"title":"A Survey of Practice and Factors Affecting Physiotherapist-Led Health Promotion for People at Risk or with Cardiovascular Disease in Cameroon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0764/v1","date":1720525151000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated risk factors are a growing concern in Cameroon. Physiotherapists (PTs) can play a crucial role in prevention and management. However, the extent of Cameroonian PT involvement in health promotion (HP) activities remains unclear. This study assessed Cameroonian physiotherapistsâ€™ current HP practices for people at risk of developing or living with CVDs (pwCVDs). A cross-sectional survey was administered online to PTs practising in Cameroon.  Out of 181 PT responses, 95% reported providing a variety of HP activities, including weight management (74%), dietary advice (73%), physical activity (69%), smoking cessation (69%), stress management (61%), and sleep promotion (48%). While PTs were confident in lifestyle assessments, they felt less confident about sleep interventions. Strong beliefs, confidence, team support, and time allocation enhanced HP practice. However, preference for passive modalities, patient adherence issues, organisational challenges within healthcare services, role ambiguity among healthcare providers, inadequate training opportunities, and the absence of established guidelines for CVD prevention negatively affect HP practice. These findings highlight the challenges and opportunities for enhancing HP delivery within the physiotherapy profession in Cameroon. Strategic investments and concerted efforts are necessary to address barriers and leverage facilitators effectively for scaling up HP initiatives, given the significant burden of CVDs in the country.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3909fbdecbafa8d967a9f1a866512a260753235d8c905227589d1a3022b240f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
