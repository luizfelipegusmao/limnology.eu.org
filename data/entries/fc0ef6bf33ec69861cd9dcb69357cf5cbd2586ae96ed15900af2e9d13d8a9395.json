{"title":"Does Urbanization Exacerbate Asymmetrical Changes in Precipitation at Divergent Time Scales in China?","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004355?af=R","date":1721631600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Urbanization alters the thermal and dynamic environment of the local climate system, resulting in significant impacts on precipitation in both urban and adjacent areas. Nevertheless, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of urbanization-induced effects on asymmetrical, symmetrical, and other precipitation patterns in urban agglomerations (UAs) with divergent background climates and geographic regions at different timescales. Specifically, this asymmetrical change pattern is characterized by an increase in heavy (or light) rainfall and a decrease in light (or heavy) rainfall. Here, we assessed the effects of urbanization on precipitation patterns across 18 UAs situated in diverse background climates and geographical areas in China at different timescales. The results demonstrate that urbanization predominantly alters precipitation patterns in UAs located in the humid region. Specifically, urbanization amplified asymmetrical changes in Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Beibu Gulf, Middle Yangtze River, and Guanzhong, but exacerbated symmetrical changes in precipitation in some regions such as Chengdu-Chongqing. Notably, the urbanization effect demonstrates greater significance at the hourly scale, as exemplified in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Middle Yangtze River, where the urban impact is nearly twice as pronounced when compared to the daily scale. Moreover, urbanization had either no effect or has a negative impact on precipitation patterns in UAs located within continental and arid regions. This is related to the intensity of urbanization, background climate and complex topography. This finding implies that urban managers should consider the impact of urbanization on precipitation patterns in different contexts to provide scientific guidance for urban planning.</p>","author":"Fanggang Li, \nXin Pan, \nNan Xu, \nXiangjin Meng, \nZhiqing Li, \nRufat Guluzade, \nYang Dai, \nYingbao Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"fc0ef6bf33ec69861cd9dcb69357cf5cbd2586ae96ed15900af2e9d13d8a9395","category":"Environment"}
