{"title":"Prevalence and factors associated with generalized anxiety disorder among patients with chronic pain: A single center cross sectional study in Malaysia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307992","date":1722002400000,"content":"<p>by Norlaila Abd Rahman, Suthahar Ariaratnam, Nurul Azreen Hashim, Zahir Izuan Azhar</p>\r\nBackground <p>Managing chronic pain was not only a major challenge but also a source of significant disability associated with mental illness. Studies on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in chronic pain population was rather limited. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of GAD and its associated factors among patients attending a pain clinic at a general hospital.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional study recruited 201 patients. The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) was used to determine anxiety level. Subsequently, patients who had scored 8 and above on the HADS were interviewed using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) to ascertain the diagnosis of GAD. Whilst the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) assessed pain severity. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with GAD.</p> Results <p>Among those patients with chronic pain, the prevalence of GAD was 18.9%. Gender (AOR:7.94; 95% CI:2.34, 26.93), duration of the pain (AOR:1.30; 95% CI:1.03,1.63) and pain severity (AOR:18.75; CI:1.23,285.13) were significant factors associated with GAD.</p> Conclusion <p>GAD is a prevalent condition among chronic pain patients.</p>","author":"Norlaila Abd Rahman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d607c598433612a448359a1750c41d15ae3eb85426837fff41344bec53b0d78b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
