{"title":"PSVII-28 A comparative analysis on student learning using DNA barcoding in undergraduate biology courses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/818/7757629?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>DNA barcoding is a growing field and is increasingly used to identify animal and plant specimens down to the species level. This type of molecular work is beneficial for animal science students for its use in identifying insect pests or bacterial infections. However, it is equally important for students outside of STEM concentrations to be exposed to molecular work to develop a better understanding of science and combat the growing distrust in science. The overall goal of this project was to train non-molecular biologists in DNA barcoding using active learning techniques. The objectives of the present study were to 1) expose two groups of students (BSCI145 and BSCI467) to molecular lab work, particularly DNA barcoding, 2) effectively communicate how molecular methods can be applied to ecological purposes, and 3) demonstrate that this molecular method can be used for university-level education at two scales. We hypothesized that students at both the 100 and 400 level would exit this experience with a proportionally deeper understanding of how DNA barcoding works and an appreciation for its applications as a result of the hands-on module. We did not expect there to be a significant barrier between the ability to learn this molecular method of 100 and 400 level students. To assess these hypotheses, students in both courses were given a survey at the beginning and end of the semester with the same or very similar questions to observe how their knowledge of DNA barcoding did or did not change. One semester of BSCI145 and 2 semesters of BSCI467 were sampled (n = 24 100 level students, n = 84 400 level students). Surveys were collected anonymously and evaluated using rubrics to assess “correctness”. An ANOVA revealed statistically significant effects from both the course level (<span>P</span> = 0.004) and the survey scores (<span>P</span> = 0.001), indicating that both course level and basal knowledge contribute to explaining the variance in learning. Additionally, Tukey HSD test results displayed students in BSCI 145 exhibited a significantly greater mean learning change when compared with both BSCI 467 2022 and BSCI 467 2023 (<span>P</span> = 0.008 and <span>P</span> = 0.006 respectively). Finally, a linear regression analysis displayed a significant negative relationship between pre-survey scores and mean learning change (β = -0.850, <span>P</span> = 0.001). This means that students with a greater initial learning reference point will not increase in learning as much when compared with students with a decreased initial learning reference point. In conclusion, we accept our hypotheses that students at different academic levels with different backgrounds can successfully learn molecular techniques when provided hands-on modules. This is relevant to education and extension when working with individuals who may not know hard science.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ff5e15b2d69dd1a62a7047a734c70363e9c45b7922c443d1ffaeb652fc593595","category":"Environment"}
