{"title":"Spatial variability in wave characteristics along the eastern Arabian Sea","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10872-024-00715-x","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>We utilized data from the numerical wave model WAVEWATCH-III and examined the spatial variability of waves considering 30 nearshore locations in the eastern Arabian Sea. The wave parameters from the model compare well with the buoy data (correlation coefficient ~ 0.98 and bias ~ 0.17 m). During monsoon, wave heights in the central-eastern Arabian Sea are higher than those in the southern and northern parts due to the influence of the Findlater jet and intermediate-period waves are dominating the entire area. The significant wave height is less than 1.5 m in non-monsoon and reaches 5 m in July. Variation in wave height between two nearby locations is highest in the northeastern Arabian Sea along the Gujarat coast. For a distance of 388 km from central Kerala to Karnataka, there is no significant spatial variability in wave height. Eastern Arabian Sea experiences a higher peak period in the non-monsoon due to reduction in the local wind speed. The integral period does not show significant spatial variability similar to wave height. The maximum (minimum) wave heights were found in 2013 (2015) and the variations are linked to the monsoon intensity.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"f3935114d27f6a60f2ced7c44b6615acecc6d0c291bf5edbfe8234692e261647","category":"Environment"}
