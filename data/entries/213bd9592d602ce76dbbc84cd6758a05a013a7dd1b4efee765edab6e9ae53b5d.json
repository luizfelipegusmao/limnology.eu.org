{"title":"Explaining Clusters in RDF Datasets: Computational Aspects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1258/v1","date":1723820992000,"content":"Clustering is a very common analysis of data present in large datasets, with the aims of \nunderstanding and summarizing data, and discovering similarities, among others. However, despite \nthe present success of subsymbolic methods for data clustering, the description of the obtained \nclusters cannot rely on the intricacies of the subsymbolic processing. For clusters of data expressed \nin the Resource Description Framework (RDF) we extend and implement an optimized previously \nproposed logic-based methodology which computed an RDF structure — called a Common Subsumer \n— describing the commonalities among all resources. We tested our implementation with two open, \nand very different RDF datasets: one devoted to Public Procurement, and the other devoted to \ndrugs in Pharmacology. For both datasets, we were able to provide reasonably concise and readable \ndescriptions of clusters up to 1800 resources. Our analysis shows the viability of our methodology \nand computation, and paves the way for general cluster explanations to lay users.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"213bd9592d602ce76dbbc84cd6758a05a013a7dd1b4efee765edab6e9ae53b5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
