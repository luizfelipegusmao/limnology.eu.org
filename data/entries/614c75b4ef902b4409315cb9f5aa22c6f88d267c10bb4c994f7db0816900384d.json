HE-MAX phase exhibit extraordinary mechanical strong properties and also compatible with excellent thermal-shock resistance, corrosion resistance, and thermal &amp; electrical conductivity that promote wide applications prospective. The unprecedented mechanical properties were found to be closely related to short-range orderings, local lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion, and other features resulted from high configuration entropy [<a href=\"#ozae044.657-B2\">2-4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"614c75b4ef902b4409315cb9f5aa22c6f88d267c10bb4c994f7db0816900384d","category":"Environment"}
