{"title":"Characterization of Unique Eukaryotic Sphingolipids with Temperature-Dependent Δ8-Unsaturation from the Picoalga Ostreococcus tauri","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/1029/7584932?rss=1","date":1705881600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sphingolipids (SLs) are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cell membranes and are found in some prokaryotic organisms and viruses. They are composed of a sphingoid backbone that may be acylated and glycosylated. Assembly of various sphingoid base, fatty acyl and glycosyl moieties results in highly diverse structures. The functional significance of variations in SL chemical diversity and abundance is still in the early stages of investigation. Among SL modifications, Δ8-desaturation of the sphingoid base occurs only in plants and fungi. In plants, SL Δ8-unsaturation is involved in cold hardiness. Our knowledge of the structure and functions of SLs in microalgae lags far behind that of animals, plants and fungi. Original SL structures have been reported from microalgae. However, functional studies are still missing. <span>Ostreococcus tauri</span> is a minimal microalga at the base of the green lineage and is therefore a key organism for understanding lipid evolution. In the present work, we achieved the detailed characterization of <span>O. tauri</span> SLs and unveiled unique glycosylceramides as sole complex SLs. The head groups are reminiscent of bacterial SLs, as they contain hexuronic acid residues and can be polyglycosylated. Ceramide backbones show a limited variety, and SL modification is restricted to Δ8-unsaturation. The Δ8-SL desaturase from <span>O. tauri</span> only produced <span>E</span> isomers. Expression of both Δ8-SL desaturase and Δ8-unsaturation of sphingolipids varied with temperature, with lower levels at 24°C than at 14°C. Overexpression of the Δ8-SL desaturase dramatically increases the level of Δ8 unsaturation at 24°C and is paralleled by a failure to increase cell size. Our work provides the first characterization of <span>O. tauri</span> SLs and functional evidence for the involvement of SL Δ8-unsaturation for temperature acclimation in microalgae, suggesting that this function is an ancestral feature in the green lineage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"12876c2624bdfe7f14b72f239fcb0e42b8c94ed7ed26e4b25123c79239fea1e7","category":"Environment"}
