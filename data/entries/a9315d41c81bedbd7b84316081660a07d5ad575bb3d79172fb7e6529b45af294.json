These include lighting, where interference manifests itself, among others, in the form of light flickering. The article presents phenomena accompanying the operation of modern light sources against the background of exemplary results of studies on the flicker of conventional light sources, such as incandescent or fluorescent lamps. To assess the effects of these phenomena, it is necessary to use measures other than those traditionally used. The results of measurements carried out in accordance with different recommendations take into account both power supply disturbances and the properties of modern light sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9315d41c81bedbd7b84316081660a07d5ad575bb3d79172fb7e6529b45af294","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
