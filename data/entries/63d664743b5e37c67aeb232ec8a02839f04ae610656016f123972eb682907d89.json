{"title":"Tree species richness and ash density have variable effects on emerald ash borer biological control by woodpeckers and parasitoid wasps in post-invasion white ash stands","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/544/7697759?rss=1","date":1719187200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Emerald ash borer (EAB) (<span>Agrilus planipennis</span> Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is the most destructive insect to invade North American forests. Identifying habitat features that support EAB natural enemies is necessary to enhance EAB biological control. In many forest ecosystems, tree species diversity has been linked with reduced pest abundance and increases in natural enemy abundance. We assessed the influence of tree species richness, ash density, and proportion of total ash basal area on ash canopy condition, EAB larval densities, and biocontrol by woodpeckers and parasitoids in pairs of healthy and declining overstory (DBH &gt; 10 cm) and recruit-sized ash (DBH 2–10 cm) in 4 post-invasion forests in Michigan, USA. Tree species richness and ash density were not significantly associated with EAB larval densities, ash canopy dieback and transparency, and woodpecker predation of EAB larvae. In declining and healthy overstory ash, woodpeckers killed 38.5 ± 3.9% and 13.2 ± 3.7% of larvae, respectively, while the native parasitoid <span>Phasgonophora sulcata</span> Westwood killed 15.8 ± 3.8% and 8.3 ± 3.0% and the introduced parasitoid <span>Spathius galinae</span> Belokobylskij &amp; Strazanac killed 10.8 ± 2.5% and 5.0 ± 2.6% of EAB larvae. Parasitism by <span>P. sulcata</span> was inversely related to ash density while parasitism by <span>S. galinae</span> was positively associated with ash density. Ash density, but not tree diversity, appears to differentially influence biological control of EAB by parasitoids, but this effect is not associated with reduced EAB densities or improved canopy condition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"63d664743b5e37c67aeb232ec8a02839f04ae610656016f123972eb682907d89","category":"Environment"}
