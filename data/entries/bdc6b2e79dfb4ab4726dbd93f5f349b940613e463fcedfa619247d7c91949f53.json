{"title":"Status and Challenges of Medical History-Taking in Developing Countries and an Affordable Digital Solution to Tackle Them","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1363/v1","date":1713670123000,"content":"1) Background: Capturing patientsâ€™ medical histories significantly influences clinical decisions. Errors in this process lead to clinical errors, increase costs and dissatisfaction among physicians and patients. Physicians in developing countries are overloaded with patients and cannot always follow the proper history-taking procedure. The challenges are acknowledged; however, a comprehensive understanding of the status and the remedies remained unexplored. 2) Objective: This paper aims to investigate the workload, history-taking challenges, and the willingness of the physicians to accept digital solutions. 3) Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on 104 physicians across Bangladesh, featuring 22 questions regarding their professional environment, workload, digitization status of health records, challenges in history-taking, and attitudes toward adopting digital solutions for managing patient histories; 4) Results: 92.67% of the physicians face workloads, 88.46% struggle in medical history-taking, and only 4.81% use digital medical records. About 70% struggle to complete the necessary history-taking steps, emphasizing the urgent need for solutions. An AI-based Smart Health Gantt Chart (SHGC) system has been introduced for their instant feedback. 93.27% of physicians expressed their willingness to use such a system. 5) Conclusions: The proposed SHGC has the potential to enhance healthcare efficiency in developing nations, benefit physicians, and improve patient-centered care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdc6b2e79dfb4ab4726dbd93f5f349b940613e463fcedfa619247d7c91949f53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
