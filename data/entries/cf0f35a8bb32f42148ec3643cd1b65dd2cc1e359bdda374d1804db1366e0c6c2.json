{"title":"Biologically Active Compounds of Tomato Fruits Affected by Application of Spirulina, Dunaliella and Chlorella Microalgae Extracts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0180/v1","date":1722591145000,"content":"The present study aimed to investigate the effect of solution of ethanol extractions of different microalgae species: Spirulina sp., Dunaliella sp. and Chlorella sp. on the accumulation of biologically active compounds in tomato fruits. Ethanol solution as well as treatment with drinking water were used as a control. Tomato cultivar ‘Belle’ F1 (Enza Zaden) was grown in 25 L pots, in peat substrate (pHKCl 5.5, producer Laflora LTd), polycarbonate greenhouse. Chemical composition – total carotenoids, lycopene and β-carotene content, total phenolics and anthocyanins, organic acids, vitamin C as well as dry matter, pH and soluble solids content – was determined in tomato fruits at the stage of full ripen. The influence of tested extracts on biologically active compounds on quality parameters of tomatoes was different, but no negative effect was observed. As only pH values as well as total phenol content and total soluble solids had statistically significant differences, results can be described with genetical stability of the cultivar.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf0f35a8bb32f42148ec3643cd1b65dd2cc1e359bdda374d1804db1366e0c6c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
