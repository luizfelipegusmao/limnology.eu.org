{"title":"A Novel Mixed Finite/Infinite Dimensional Port-Hamiltonian Model of a Mechanical Ventilator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1827/v1","date":1716878719000,"content":"Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment for critically ill patients who are struggling to breathe independently due to injury or disease. Globally, large numbers of Individuals have always required mechanical ventilation per year. The Covid-19 pandemic elevated the significance of the mechanical ventilation which have played a significant role in sustaining Covid 19 infected critically ill patients who could not breathe on their own. The pandemic drew the attention of the world to the shortage of ventilators globally.This research work presents the formulation of a detailed Port Hamiltonian model of a mechanical ventilator integrated to the human respiratory system. The interconnection and coupling conditions for the various subsystem within the mechanical ventilator and the coupling between the mechanical ventilator and the human respiratory system is also presented.A structure preservation discretization is provided along side numerical simulations and results. The obtained results are found to be comparable to results presented in literature.The future work will include the design of suitable controllers for system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e4fb843d59577bb1f4805e58e82b1e92f45cf2197a96217c5205a08f1670682","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
