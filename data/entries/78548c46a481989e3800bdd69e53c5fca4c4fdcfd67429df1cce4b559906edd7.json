{"title":"Environmental Impact Minimization Model for Storage Yard of In-Situ Produced PC Components: Comparison of Dung Beetle Algorithm and Improved Dung Beetle Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1022/v1","date":1726280949000,"content":"In-situ production of PC components is the same process as in a factory, with the order of installing processed rebar, pouring concrete, curing, and storage. In-situ production not only reduces environmental impact by more than 14.58% compared to factory production, but also reduces costs by up to 39.4% compared to factory production when increasing the number of in-situ produced PC components. The stock yard area is more than 5 times larger than the production area, which accounts for a significantly higher proportion. Research on in-situ production of PC components is mainly focused on the production area. PC component yard layout planning for in-situ production can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve construction efficiency. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop an environmental impact minimization model for in-situ production of PC components. As a result of applying the developed model, the improved dung beetle optimization algorithm optimization improved the adjacent correlation by 22.79% and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 18.33% compared to the dung beetle optimization algorithm, which verifies its efficiency. The proposed environmental impact minimization model can support the construction, reconstruction, and functional upgrade of logistics centers, contributing to low carbon dioxide in the logistics industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78548c46a481989e3800bdd69e53c5fca4c4fdcfd67429df1cce4b559906edd7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
