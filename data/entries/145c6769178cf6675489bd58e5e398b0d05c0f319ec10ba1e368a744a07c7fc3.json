{"title":"Treating Anxiety-Based Cognitive Distortions Pertaining to Somatic Perception for Better Chronic Pain Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1772/v2","date":1724925344000,"content":"Anxiety-based cognitive distortions pertaining to somatic perception (ABCD-SP) - primarily catastrophizing, fear avoidance and kinesiophobia- have been repeatedly linked to worsening chronic, non-cancer pain (CNCP) outcomes of increased disability, amplified pain, ineffective opioid use, and opioid misuse. Several studies have suggested that treating ABCD-SP can improve pain outcomes. Utilizing a narrative review of proposed mechanisms, published patient perspectives, and study correlates connecting these cognitive distortions with CNCP outcomes, a better practice approach to the delivery of standard clinical CNCP care can be deduced. These recommendations require relatively few resources to implement and have the potential to lead to more effective CNCP treatment on a large scale.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"145c6769178cf6675489bd58e5e398b0d05c0f319ec10ba1e368a744a07c7fc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
