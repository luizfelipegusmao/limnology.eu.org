{"title":"Reinforcement Learning-based Network Dismantling by Targeting Maximum Degree Nodes in the Giant Connected Component","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1397/v1","date":1724138705000,"content":"Tackling the intricacies of network dismantling in complex systems poses significant challenges. This task has relevance across various practical domains, yet traditional approaches focus primarily on singular metrics, such as the number of nodes in the Giant Connected Component (GCC) or average pairwise connectivity. In contrast, we propose a unique metric that concurrently targets nodes with the highest degree and reduces the GCC size. Given the NP-hard nature of optimizing this metric, we introduce MaxShot, an innovative end-to-end solution that leverages graph representation learning and reinforcement learning. Through comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, our method consistently outperforms leading benchmarks in accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight MaxShotâ€™s potential as a superior approach to address the network dismantling problem effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7de7e730c75b3c2d47545bc8ff776b4ff4bc4605dc6ed522e03163a2c7d4cf33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
