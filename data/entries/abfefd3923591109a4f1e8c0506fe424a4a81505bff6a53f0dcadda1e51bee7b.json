{"title":"Holocene overflow events of the lower Yellow River recorded in Huangdun ancient lake, northern Jiangsu Plain, China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3599?af=R","date":1712050550000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Overflow events are important embodiments of the evolutionary characteristics of the lower Yellow River. Lakes in the lower reaches of the Yellow River have the capacity to record these events. Due to the complex provenance and transport pathways of sediments in local lakes, it is difficult to extract reliable information on sediments delivered by the Yellow River based on conventional methods and proxies. Here, we show results from a genetically meaningful end-member (EM) decomposition of sediment grain-size data from Huangdun ancient lake. The grain-size of the sediments can be decomposed into three end-members. Comprehensive analysis combining environmental magnetism and geochemical indicators clarifies the significance of each end-member. EM1 represents mixed signals of various proximal fluvial sediments and the Yellow River materials. EM2 is similar to terrestrial fine-grained debris in conjunction with local pedogenic materials, aeolian inputs and some Yi River materials. EM3 represents a component that is mainly derived from long-distance transport by the lower Yellow River. End-member analysis successfully identified overflow events of the lower Yellow River on a southward-flowing path during the Holocene. This study provides a meaningful attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the lower Yellow River from sedimentary records.</p>","author":"Rui Zhang, \nLi Xing, \nShi‚ÄêYong Yu, \nJunsheng Nie, \nJinjia Wu, \nZhao Wang, \nShiyue Chen, \nZhanfang Hou, \nGuodong Zhang, \nDenghui Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"abfefd3923591109a4f1e8c0506fe424a4a81505bff6a53f0dcadda1e51bee7b","category":"Environment"}
