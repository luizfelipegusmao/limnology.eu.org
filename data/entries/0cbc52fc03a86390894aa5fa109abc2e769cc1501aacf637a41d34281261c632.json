{"title":"Electrocatalysis in MOF Films for Flexible Electrochemical Sensing: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1169/v1","date":1723732525000,"content":"Flexible electrochemical sensors can adhere to any bendable surface with conformal contact, enabling continuous data monitoring without compromising the surface's dynamics. Among various materials that have been explored for flexible electronics, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit dynamic responses to physical and chemical signals, offering new opportunities for flexible electrochemical sensing technologies. This review aims to explore the role of electrocatalysis in MOF films specifically designed for flexible electrochemical sensing applications, with a focus on their design, fabrication techniques, and applications. We systematically categorize the design and fabrication techniques used in preparing MOF films, including in-situ growth, layer-by-layer assembly, and polymer-assisted strategies. The implications of MOF-based flexible electrochemical sensors are examined in the context of wearable devices, environmental monitoring, and healthcare diagnostics. Future research is anticipated to shift from traditional microcrystalline powder synthesis to MOF thin-film deposition, which is expected to not only enhance the performance of MOFs in flexible electronics but also improve sensing efficiency and reliability, paving the way for more robust and versatile sensor technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cbc52fc03a86390894aa5fa109abc2e769cc1501aacf637a41d34281261c632","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
