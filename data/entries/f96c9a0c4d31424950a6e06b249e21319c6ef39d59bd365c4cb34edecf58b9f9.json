{"title":"Model-Independent Odderon Results Based on New TOTEM Data on Elastic Pp Collisions at 8 TeV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0595/v1","date":1715328487000,"content":"Evaluating the H(x, s|pp) scaling function of elastic proton-proton (pp) collisions from recent TOTEM data at √ s = 8 TeV and comparing it with the same function of elastic proton-antiproton (p¯p) data of the D0 collaboration at √ s = 1.96 TeV, we find, from this comparison alone, an at least 3.79 σ signal of Odderon exchange. If we combine this model independently obtained result with that of a similar analysis but using TOTEM elastic pp scattering data at √ s = 7 TeV, which resulted in an at least 6.26 σ signal, the combined significance of Odderon exchange increases to at least 7.08 σ, model independently. Further combinations of various datasets in the TeV energy range are detailed in the manuscript","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f96c9a0c4d31424950a6e06b249e21319c6ef39d59bd365c4cb34edecf58b9f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
