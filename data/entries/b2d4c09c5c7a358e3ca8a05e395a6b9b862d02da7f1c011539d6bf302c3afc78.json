{"title":"In vitro fermentation characteristics of different types of fiber‐rich ingredients by pig fecal inoculum","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13355?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Dietary fibers with varying physicochemical properties have different fermentation characteristics, which may differently impact host health. The present study aimed to determine the fermentation characteristics including gas production kinetics, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and microbial composition of different fibrous ingredients using <i>in vitro</i> fermentation by fecal microbiota.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Sugar beet pule (SBP), wheat bran (WB), dried corn distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), rice bran (RB) and alfalfa meal (AM) were selected to fermentation <i>in vitro</i> for 36 h. The results showed that SBP had the greatest gas production. SBP had the highest <i>in vitro</i> dry matter fermentability (IVDMF) and production of acetate, propionate and total SCFAs, followed by WB, which were all greater than DDGS, AM and RB. The alpha-diversity was higher in the DDGS, AM and RB groups than in the WB and SBP groups. Differences in microbial community composition were observed among groups. The relative abundance of <i>Treponema</i> was highest in WB group. RB group showed lower <i>Prevotella</i> abundance than other groups but had higher <i>Succinivibrio</i> abundance. Interestingly, the <i>Lactobacillus</i> reached the highest abundances in the DDGS group. Correlation analysis indicated that the relative abundance of <i>Treponema</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> was positively associated with the gas production, IVDMF and SCFAs, whereas <i>norank_f_Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group</i>, <i>Lysinibacillus</i> and <i>Succinivibrio</i> were the opposite.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Collectively, WB and SBP were fermented rapidly by fecal microbiota compared to DDGS, AM and RB. Different fiber sources have different fiber compositions and fermentation properties that affect the microbial compositins and SCFAs production. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chengzeng Luo, \nJiujun Duan, \nRuqing Zhong, \nLei Liu, \nQingtao Gao, \nXuelan Liu, \nLiang Chen, \nHongfu Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b2d4c09c5c7a358e3ca8a05e395a6b9b862d02da7f1c011539d6bf302c3afc78","category":"Environment"}
