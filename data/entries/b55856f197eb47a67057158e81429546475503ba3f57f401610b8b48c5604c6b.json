{"title":"Effects of different roughness on Brazilian splitting characteristics of rock-concrete interface","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307190","date":1724421600000,"content":"<p>by Yan Chen, Gaofei Wang, Lei Zhou, Liangtao Deng, Jiahao Wang</p>\r\n\r\nIn order to study the tensile properties of rock-concrete composite disc specimens with different roughness, the surface of the gray-white sand specimen was artificially grooved, and six different roughness were configured. The test results show that the roughness size and roughness mode jointly control the tensile strength of the rock-concrete interface. With the increase of roughness, the tensile strength of the sample changes from the initial decrease to the increase and then decrease, and the tensile strength reaches the highest when the roughness is <i>f</i><sub>3</sub>. The variation trend of pre-peak energy accumulation and post-peak energy accumulation of the sample is opposite, and the dissipation energy is closely related to the crack propagation strain. The roughness and crack closure strain, crack peak strain, crack propagation strain and crack closure stress show a sinusoidal periodic variation. The crack propagation strain is closely related to the change of dissipation energy. The change trend of crack closure stress is basically consistent with the change trend of tensile strength. Therefore, in the actual project, grasping the period of roughness variation and selecting the construction position can make the rock-concrete interface stable and get twice the result with half the effort.","author":"Yan Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b55856f197eb47a67057158e81429546475503ba3f57f401610b8b48c5604c6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
