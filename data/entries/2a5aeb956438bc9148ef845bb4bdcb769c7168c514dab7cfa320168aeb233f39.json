{"title":"Isolation and Characterization of Indigenous Acetobacter Strains from Cashew Apple and Their Potential Use as Vinegar Producers in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1677/v1","date":1727085588000,"content":"Côte d’Ivoire has the main cashew tree culture area worldwide, but the cashew apple produced is still underutilized although its potential for industry. In the present study, the aim was to isolate and identify acetic acid bacterial strains, and to assess their potential use for cashew apple-based vinegar production. Vinegar mother from fermented juice was used to isolate acetic acid bacteria on a standard glucose-based medium. Physiological and biochemical tests followed by 16S rRNA gene analysis and phylogeny were used for isolate characterization. Moreover, their acetic acid production capacity was assessed. As results, five (05) strains of the Acetobacter genus were isolated. Phenotypic and phylogenetic analysis revealed that four of them, namely OYA2, OYA6, OYA9, and OYA10, belong to A. tropicalis / A. senegalensis species complex with 99,7% or 100% similarity. The last strain, OYA7, match to A. syzygii (99,7%). All the isolates were resistant to 15° alcohol (v/v) and grew well between pH 5.0 and 6.5. Their optimal growth temperatures varied between 27°C and 37°C, and only isolate OYA6 grows up to 40°C. They produced vinegar with yield (Yp/s , g/g) varying from 0.82 to 0.92, and acetic acid content (g/L) of 80.67 ± 2.1, 70.26 ± 0.9, 70.11 ± 1.7, 68.70 ± 1.5 and 67.22 ± 0.40 were obtained with OYA6, OYA7, OYA2, OYA10, and OYA9, respectively. Thus, the isolate OYA6 appeared as the best candidate for vinegar production, owing to its superior yield and thermotolerance ability that need to be further explored for industry use purpose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a5aeb956438bc9148ef845bb4bdcb769c7168c514dab7cfa320168aeb233f39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
