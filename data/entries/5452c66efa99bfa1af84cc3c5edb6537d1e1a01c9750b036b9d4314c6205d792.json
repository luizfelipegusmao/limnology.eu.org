{"title":"130 Meta-analysis of the impact of Quebracho and Chestnut tannin extract supplementation on the growth performance in growing and finishing beef cattle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/335/7757258?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Integrating tannin extracts (TE) into the diet of growing and finishing beef cattle has shown promise in optimizing protein utilization while potentially mitigating methane emissions. Despite these potential benefits, there is a notable gap in a comprehensive analysis of the influence of TE on growth rate. This study addressed this gap by collecting data on the supplementation of a blend of condensed (from <span>Schinopsis spp</span>.) and hydrolyzable (from <span>Castanea spp.</span>) tannins, which has about 70% total tannins, and its impact on critical metrics, such as average daily gain (ADG, kg/d), dry matter intake (DMI, kg/d), and feed efficiency ratio (FER, g/kg). Our objective was to conduct meta-regression analyses to understand better the nuanced effects of condensed tannin supplementation on the overall performance of beef cattle during the critical stages of growth and finishing. The dataset was constructed by collecting published studies that reported in vivo experimental data on growing and finishing beef cattle supplemented with different levels of TE. It contained 132 observations from 35 publications. The meta-analysis was conducted by linear regression with a mixed-effects model fitted by the restricted maximum likelihood method using the nlme package of R software (ver. 4.3.1). Studies were assumed as random variables, and their interaction with the intercept and slope were included in the regression. The number of animals per treatment was used as a study-specific weight. Studies accounted for 32%, 35%, or 27% of the total variance when regressing ADG, DMI, or FER, respectively, on TE (% DM). After adjusting for random effects, the ADG increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) with increasing levels of dietary TE (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001): 1.344 (± 0.0071) + 0.240 (±0.0298) × TE (n = 99, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.40). It was observed that as the dietary TE level increased, its impact on the ADG tended to decrease from 0.33 kgּ d<sup>-1</sup>ּ % TE<sup>-1</sup> when fed up to 0.5% TE to 0.24 kgּ d<sup>-1</sup>ּ % TE<sup>-1</sup> when fed up to 1.5% TE, suggesting a possible nonlinear relationship between these two variables. Similarly, DMI decreased slightly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) at 0.61 kg/d/% TE, but with a lower precision (n = 115, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.14). Consequently, FER increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) at 17 kgּ d<sup>-1</sup>ּ % TE<sup>-1</sup> (n = 93, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.34). Initial findings suggest that incorporating TE into the diet of growing and finishing cattle, up to a concentration of 0.5% DM, positively influences the growth rate and enhances FER while minimally affecting DMI. Subsequent research endeavors should delve into a more intricate examination of optimal TE inclusion levels and explore additional performance indicators for a comprehensive understanding of its impact.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5452c66efa99bfa1af84cc3c5edb6537d1e1a01c9750b036b9d4314c6205d792","category":"Environment"}
