{"title":"Numerical Approach to Determine the Resistance of Threaded Anchors in UHPFRC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2131/v1","date":1727388954000,"content":"In this study, the structural behavior of a short threaded anchor with a 20 mm diameter and an embedment length of 50 mm (2.5Ã˜) in UHPFRC is investigated using non-linear Finite Element models. UHPFRC is assumed to exhibit tensile strain-hardening behavior, with tensile strengths of 7 MPa and 11 MPa, respectively. The modelled anchor was subjected to a continuously increasing uniaxial pull-out force. The results indicate that the fracture mechanism of threaded anchors in UHPFRC is primarily characterized by the formation of a tensile membrane within the UHPFRC, which acts as the main resisting element against the pull-out force. Additionally, the influence of UHPFRC's tensile properties on the pull-out behavior and ultimate resistance of the threaded anchors was determined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5fd04d9d8e46912d24728a81dcaffbfe081289aea0d2d82e9d4008bc59988f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
