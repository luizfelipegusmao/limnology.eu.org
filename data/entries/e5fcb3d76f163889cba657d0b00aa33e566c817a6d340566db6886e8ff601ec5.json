{"title":"Effects of Social Facilitation and Introduction Methods of Cattle on Virtual Fence Adaptation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0073/v1","date":1711984557000,"content":"The agricultural industry relies on physical fences to manage livestock. However, physical fences present some practical, financial, and ecological problems, that partly may be solved by virtual fencing. However, it is necessary for the livestock to be adapted to virtual fencing. This study aims to identify if adaptation to virtual fence can be improved through social facilitation between experienced cattle and the remaining herd. Moreover, which of the two different learning processes, a gradual or instant introduction to virtual fence is the most effective in associating warnings with impulses. Three pastures containing Angus (Bos taurus) will be used to examine these investigations; A, B and C. All investigations are conducted on the Danish Island of Fan√∏. Three methods of learning process were used, one gradual and two instant introductions to the virtual fence. The investigations had varying amounts of experienced cattle. Impulses and warnings were recorded during a learning period and the following observation period. To quantify if the cattle adapt to the warnings, impulses per warning are used. There was no evidence of improvement with the presence of experienced cattle for any pastures, indicating no social facilitation. Gradual introduction was found to be more beneficial than instant introduction. More standardized tests are necessary to discover the full effect of experienced cattle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5fcb3d76f163889cba657d0b00aa33e566c817a6d340566db6886e8ff601ec5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
