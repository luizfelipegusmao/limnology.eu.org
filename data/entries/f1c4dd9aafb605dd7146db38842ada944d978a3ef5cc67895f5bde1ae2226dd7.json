{"title":"A Novel Active Resonance Fitting Model to Optimize the Energy Harvesting from Rotational Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1930/v1","date":1719469244000,"content":"Energy harvesting is an emerging topic recently. This harvested energy is used to operate wireless sensors for different industrial monitoring and automation. To maximize the harvested energy in spinning systems, the harvester should vibrate at resonance for different spinning frequencies which can be achieved by active fitting. In this research, a novel methodology was developed by actively customizing the length of vibrating element beam to manipulate its natural frequency according to the spinning frequency. Different models were investigated numerically and experimentally to verify the proposed methodology. COMSOL Multiphysics software V5.1 was used to develop the numerical model, then and tip deformation and voltage difference results were benchmarked. The numerical model was verified experimentally by attaching a piezoelectric MIDE PPA 1021 which its vibrating length was varied by changing the supporting length from 0 mm to 12 mm to a spinning object having variable frequency from 0-200 Hz. It is found that the MIDE PPA 1021 beam vibrated at its resonance throughout the specified spinning frequencies. The proposed harvester can be applied in battery-free sensors being used in automotives, wind-mills blades, and rotating machinery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1c4dd9aafb605dd7146db38842ada944d978a3ef5cc67895f5bde1ae2226dd7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
