{"title":"Quantum Dot–Based Nanosensors for in Vitro Detection of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0285/v1","date":1725375026000,"content":"Despite the existing effective treatment methods, tuberculosis (TB) is the second most deadly infectious disease globally, its carriers in the latent and active phases accounting for more than 20% of the world population. An effective method to control TB and reduce the mortality is regular population screening and diagnosis of the latent form of TB in order to take preventive and curative measures. Numerous methods allow diagnosing TB and directly detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) biomarkers, including M.tb DNA, proteins, and specific metabolites, as well as antibodies produced by the host immune system in response to M.tb. PCR, ELISA, immunofluorescence and immunochemical analyses, flow cytometry, and other methods allow the detection of M.tb biomarkers or the host immune response to M.tb by recording the optical signal of fluorescent or colorimetric dyes included in the diagnostic tools. Current research in biosensors is aimed at increasing the sensitivity of detection, which can be achieved by using brighter and more photostable optical tags containing fluorescent quantum dots. Here, we review current methods for detection of M.tb biomarkers using optical sensor systems, primarily quantum dot–based nanosensors, and summarize M.tb biomarkers whose detection can be made significantly more sensitive by using quantum dot–based nanosensors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02f5ccef7dbd482e33f97331f8d08c7afbdd8408c24161c01de29b5ac4a70ffc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
