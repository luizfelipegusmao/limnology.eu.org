{"title":"Recommendations for the Isokinetic Test of Female&rsquo;s Soccer Players Knee: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202306.0684/v2","date":1717227599000,"content":"Isokinetic testing of the knee joint is the “gold standard” in strength assessment in sport especially in soccer, where it is part of pre-season screening to establish norms in case of injuries. There are many devices on the market that make it difficult to use of normative data. Isokinetics literature in females’ soccer players is scarce in comparison to males. Furthermore, evaluation protocols strongly differ from each other, using different ranges of speeds, movement patterns and output data. Thus, it is difficult for the researcher and the clinician to choose a correct protocol for isokinetic evaluation in female soccer players. The indexes of isokinetic performance that are widely accepted are the hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio and dominant/non-dominant (D/ND) ratio as reference. In this review are highlighted some common features of isokinetic testing in female soccer players of different levels of qualification. From this study, it emerges that, for a reliable test, 3 reps at the speed of 60°/sec in knee flexion/extension is preferable due to the high reliability and that an optimal H/Q ratio in healthy female soccer players of different level of qualification and age is 50%, while the interlimb differences (D/ND) should be below 10%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07690f58a0aa35c21d6ad5441a25e851e85ab3b42130ba0102b07b61897543b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
