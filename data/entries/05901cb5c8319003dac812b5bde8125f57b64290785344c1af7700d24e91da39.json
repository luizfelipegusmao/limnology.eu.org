{"title":"Improved 30‐m Evapotranspiration Estimates Over 145 Eddy Covariance Sites in the Contiguous United States: The Role of ECOSTRESS, Harmonized Landsat Sentinel‐2 Imagery, Climate Reanalysis, and Deep Neural Network Postprocessing","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036313?af=R","date":1713769200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study developed and evaluated 30-m daily evapotranspiration (ET) estimates using the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model with ECOSTRESS, Moderate MODIS, harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery, ERA5-Land reanalysis, and eddy covariance measurements. The new daily 30-m ET showed significantly improved performance (overall, <i>r</i> = 0.8, RMSE = 1.736, KGE = 0.466) at 145 EC sites over contiguous United States compared to the current 70-m ECOSTRESS ET (overall, <i>r</i> = 0.485, RMSE = 4.696, KGE = −0.841). A deep neural network postprocessing model trained with ET measurements from EC sites further improved the performance on test sites that were not used for model training (overall, <i>r</i> = 0.842, RMSE = 0.88, KGE = 0.792). The 30-m ET estimation biases were significantly related to the biases in the upwelling longwave (<i>R</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>UL</i>\n</sub>) and downwelling shortwave radiation (<i>R</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>DS</i>\n</sub>) inputs, with ET estimates driven by MODIS radiation showing higher biases compared to those driven by ERA5-Land radiation. The error diagnosis using random forest indicates that ET biases tend to be larger under higher ET estimates, and <i>R</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>UL</i>\n</sub> and <i>R</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>DS</i>\n</sub> were the primary contributors to the high bias at the higher ET ranges, with partial dependence plots revealing that the estimation biases tend to be higher under more humid environment, denser vegetation covers, and high net radiation conditions. In conclusion, higher spatial resolution satellite imagery of vegetation characteristics and higher temporal resolution radiation data, combined with continent-wide EC measurements and deep learning, provided substantial added value for improving ET estimations at the field scale (30-m).</p>","author":"Taufiq Rashid, \nDi Tian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"05901cb5c8319003dac812b5bde8125f57b64290785344c1af7700d24e91da39","category":"Environment"}
