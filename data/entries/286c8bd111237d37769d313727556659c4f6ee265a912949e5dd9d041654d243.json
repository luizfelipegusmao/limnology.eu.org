{"title":"Determining 1:1 Charge Stoichiometry and Rheological Characterization for pH Induced Chitosan-Albizia procera Complex Coacervate Xerogels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2533/v1","date":1722481099000,"content":"Abstract: In order to explore new options for colon targeting, this study designs new polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) coacervate xerogels of chitosan (Ch) with Albizia procera (AP). It was determined by potentiometric titration tests that a 1:5 Ch/AP weight ratio was necessary for 1:1 charge stoichiometry. Rheological characterizations experiments were carried out for the pH independent coacervates and 1:5 coacervate was found to be having the highest G/ value in the strain sweep experiment. In the frequency sweep experiments the coacervate (1:5) with the highest storage modulus (G/) values was produced at pH 4.5.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"286c8bd111237d37769d313727556659c4f6ee265a912949e5dd9d041654d243","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
