Recent multivariate work indicates that SER levels powerfully relate to intrinsic functional connectivity patterns across the entire brain. Nevertheless, the neuroscientific meaning of these widespread neural differences remains poorly understood, despite its translational promise for early risk identification, targeted intervention, and policy reform. In the present study, we leverage graph theory to precisely characterize multivariate and univariate associations between SER across household and neighborhood contexts and the intrinsic functional architecture of brain regions in 5,821 youth (9–10 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. First, we establish that decomposing the brain into profiles of integration and segregation captures more than half of the multivariate association between SER and functional connectivity with greater parsimony (100-fold reduction in number of features) and interpretability. Second, we show that the topological effects of SER are not uniform across the brain; rather, higher SER levels are associated with greater integration of somatomotor and subcortical systems, but greater segregation of default mode, orbitofrontal, and cerebellar systems. Finally, we demonstrate that topological associations with SER are spatially patterned along the unimodal–transmodal gradient of brain organization. These findings provide critical interpretive context for the established and widespread associations between SER and brain organization. This study highlights both higher-order and somatomotor networks that are differentially implicated in environmental stress, disadvantage, and opportunity in youth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"e6c955aaedd82c132cde3f1625e3de3ac40212922664bdd590e87898c68ad99f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
