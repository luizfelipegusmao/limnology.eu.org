Biofilms on plastic and natural surfaces share similar composition and activity, with some differences due to factors such as porosity. In freshwaters, most studies have examined biofilms on benthic substrates, while little research has compared the activity and composition of biofilms on buoyant plastic and natural surfaces. Additionally, the influence of substrate size and successional stage on biofilm composition has not been commonly assessed. We incubated three plastics of distinct textures that are buoyant in rivers, low-density polyethylene (rigid; 1.7 mm thick), low-density polyethylene film (flexible; 0.0254 mm thick), and foamed polystyrene (brittle; 6.5 mm thick), as well as wood substrates (untreated oak veneer; 0.6 mm thick) in the Chicago River. Each material was incubated at three sizes (1, 7.5, and 15 cm<sup>2</sup>). Substrates were incubated at 2–10 cm depths and removed weekly for 6 weeks. On each substrate we measured chlorophyll concentration, biofilm biomass, respiration, and flux of nitrogen gas. We sequenced 16S and 23S rRNA genes at Weeks 1, 3, and 6 to capture biofilm community composition across successional stages. Chlorophyll, biomass, and N<sub>2</sub> flux were similar across substrates, but respiration was greater on wood than plastics. Bacterial and algal richness and diversity were highest on foam and wood compared to polyethylene substrates. Bacterial biofilm community composition was distinct between wood and plastic substrates, while the algal community was distinct on wood and foam, which were different from each other and polyethylene substrates. These results indicate that polymer properties influence biofilm alpha and beta diversity, which may affect transport and distribution of plastic pollution and associated microbes, as well as biogeochemical processes in urban rivers. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of substrate on biofilm characteristics, and the ecological impacts of plastic pollution on urban rivers.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nPlastic physical and chemical properties act as forces of selection for biofilm.\nBiofilm activity was similar among three different types of plastic.\nCommunity composition between plastic and wood was different.\n</p>","author":"Raúl F.
