{"title":"Global Aging and the Importance of Research Collaboration in Sick Sinus Syndrome: A Comprehensive Network StudyNetwork Study.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0209/v1","date":1727935686000,"content":"Aim: This study aims to investigate the global collaboration network among researchers studying Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS) from 2000 to 2023. Given the syndrome's increasing prevalence in aging populations, understanding the structure of research collaboration is crucial to advancing the field. This analysis explores co-authorship networks to identify key contributors, institutions, and trends in SSS research. Method: This study utilized network analysis techniques to evaluate 1,693 publications related to SSS research indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection between 2000 and 2023. The analysis was conducted using Python (Version 3.10.5) in the PyCharm development environment (Software Version 2022.1.3). The co-authorship networks were assessed using macro-level indicators such as network density (the ratio of actual to possible connections), clustering coefficient (degree of node clustering), number of components (distinct connected subgroups), and average path length (average distance between nodes). Micro-level indicators including degree centrality (importance based on the number of connections), closeness centrality (proximity to other nodes), and betweenness centrality (frequency of a node on the shortest paths between others) were also analyzed.Result: The analysis revealed an overall increase in collaboration over time, with rising network density and stronger local clusters, although the network remained fragmented. Key researchers, including Boriani, Giuseppe (Italy), and Glikson, Michael (Australia), emerged as central figures, demonstrating high degrees of centrality in different periods. The results also highlight persistent regional and institutional collaboration patterns, reflecting the growing importance of global partnerships in addressing SSS.Conclusion: This comprehensive network analysis underscores the importance of international collaboration in advancing SSS research. Despite growing collaborative efforts, the field remains somewhat fragmented, suggesting further opportunities for integration. This research has enabled us to identify influential researchers and research institutions, and we will be able to promote research collaboration to further understand and improve treatment methods for SSS as a response to the aging of the world's population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea9b8f02633ef14c3a1c367beb1b37be219b65ed1324b8f206345095ac88a0d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
