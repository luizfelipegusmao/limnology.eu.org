{"title":"Dysregulation of LINC00324 promotes poor prognosis in patients with glioma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298055","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Xin Jin, Jiandong Zhu, Haoyun Yu, Shengjun Shi, Kecheng Shen, Jingyu Gu, Ziqian Yin, Zhengquan Yu, Jiang Wu</p>\r\nBackground <p>LINC00324 is a long-stranded non-coding RNA, which is aberrantly expressed in various cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and clinical features. It involves multiple oncogenic molecular pathways affecting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. However, the expression, function, and mechanism of LINC00324 in glioma have not been reported.</p> Material and methods <p>We assessed the expression of LINC00324 of LINC00324 in glioma patients based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to identify pathways involved in LINC00324-related glioma pathogenesis.</p> Results <p>Based on our findings, we observed differential expression of LINC00324 between tumor and normal tissues in glioma patients. Our analysis of overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) indicated that glioma patients with high LINC00324 expression had a poorer prognosis compared to those with low LINC00324 expression. By integrating clinical data and genetic signatures from TCGA patients, we developed a nomogram to predict OS and DSS in glioma patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that several pathways, including JAK/STAT3 signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, STAT5 signaling, NF-ÎºB activation, and apoptosis, were differentially enriched in glioma samples with high LINC00324 expression. Furthermore, we observed significant correlations between LINC00324 expression, immune infiltration levels, and expression of immune checkpoint-related genes (HAVCR2: r = 0.627, P = 1.54e-77; CD40: r = 0.604, P = 1.36e-70; ITGB2: r = 0.612, P = 6.33e-7; CX3CL1: r = -0.307, P = 9.24e-17). These findings highlight the potential significance of LINC00324 in glioma progression and suggest avenues for further research and potential therapeutic targets.</p> Conclusion <p>Indeed, our results confirm that the LINC00324 signature holds promise as a prognostic predictor in glioma patients. This finding opens up new possibilities for understanding the disease and may offer valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies.</p>","author":"Xin Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8b90bd4ba5c69b80344a89974a4ddc41302a98a4bc30d1a6899d8fa11d683d06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
