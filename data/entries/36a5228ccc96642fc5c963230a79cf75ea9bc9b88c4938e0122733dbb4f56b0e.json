{"title":"Instrumental procedures to assess the extensibility of pounded yam and relationship with sensory stretchability and consumer preferences","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.12598?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Stretchability is the most important sensory textural attribute considered by consumers of pounded yam. It is important both for the processor during pounding and for the consumer during consumption to measure this attribute while screening large populations of yam genotypes intended for advanced breeding and eventual adoption. Texture determined by sensory evaluation and consumer perception is time consuming and expensive. It can be instrumentally mimicked by texture analyzer, thereby providing an efficient alternative screening tool.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Two instrumental methods (uniaxial extensibility and lubricated squeezing flow) were applied to assess the extensional properties of pounded yam. In order to evaluate the accuracy, repeatability and discrimination of the methods, six yam genotypes with contrasting extensional properties, previously evaluated by 13 panellists in terms of stretchability and moldability and by 99 participants randomly selected in terms of overall liking, were used. Both methods allowed the discrimination of different genotypes as a function of extensional properties. Principal components showed that the genotypes were grouped within separate components associated with specific sensory attributes and their related instrumental texture parameters. Moreover, significant correlations were found between uniaxial extensibility textural attributes, bi-extensional viscosity and consumer overall liking. However, the sensory attributes were not significantly correlated with instrumental data and consumer overall liking.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Bi-extensional viscosity and uniaxial extensibility attributes can be used to discriminate and screen yam genotypes for their stretchability characteristics. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Santiago Arufe, \nOluwatoyin Ayetigbo, \nRomain Domingo, \nLaurent Adinsi, \nM.
