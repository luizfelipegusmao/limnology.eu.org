The advanced development of Artificial intelligence (AI), has turned out to be the heart of game development technology and AI has revolutionized gaming and brought so many features to life.in reality, it isn't easy to give a definition and meaning to it even though games are becoming a part of human survival. It is difficult to define the real meaning of a game but it is part of human survival as it usually refers to the cleverness of the way the human being involvement in the characters of the game.\n\nAs a part of game development, many technologies were used to create a game for the players with creativity, complex design, variety of levels, and aspects for the player to use choices effectively and efficiently to interact with the character in the game and enhance the experience to the next levels. This paper initially gives the importance of game development and need for the technology usage to enhance the current state of games. Then analyzes the history and present state of Artificial intelligence in game development. Finally, it explains the highlights of potential changes in game development and the impact and influence of artificial intelligence and machine learning models in the future development of games.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f04f6b08e3c3ce7126ca31ca5ea975d253d60b6567199465a2fc553bdbb93c69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
