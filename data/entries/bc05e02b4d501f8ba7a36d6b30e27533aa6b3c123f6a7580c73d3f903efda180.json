{"title":"Time Evolution of Energy States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202305.0952/v7","date":1712282096000,"content":"In our investigation of the time evolution of energy states Einstein’s interpretation from more than a century ago is found to have greater internal consistency than that of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We choose to align more closely with his methods by abandoning the non-relativistic Hamiltonian method, which has been the standard for nearly a century, in favor of a relativistically correct Lagrangian method. Integral equations of motion for the absorption and emission of radiation are derived that underlie and anticipate the differentially motivated Schrödinger equation. This new interpretation applies to a large volume of experimental evidence of both classical and quantum mechanical origin. Among the examples discussed in support are Planck’s law describing black body radiation, matrix mechanics, the function of the simplest quantum mechanical system an electron cyclotron, chaos theory, and evolutionary biology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc05e02b4d501f8ba7a36d6b30e27533aa6b3c123f6a7580c73d3f903efda180","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
