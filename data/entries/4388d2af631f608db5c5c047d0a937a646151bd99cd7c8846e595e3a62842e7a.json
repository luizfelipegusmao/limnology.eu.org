{"title":"Physics-Based Scan Distortion Correction in Hardware","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1088/7720349?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The application of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques to the study of dynamic specimens (<span>in situ</span> STEM), large specimen areas, and/or biological or other radiation-sensitive specimens, is hindered by limited acquisition speed [<a href=\"#ozae044.1088-B1\">1</a>] and specimen radiation damage effects [<a href=\"#ozae044.1088-B2\">2</a>]. Even with high-speed pixelated detectors for 4D STEM or the use of even faster analog detectors for 2D STEM, high sampling rates do not entirely alleviate these problems. Unfortunately, decreasing dwell time introduces significant scan distortions [<a href=\"#ozae044.1088-B3\">3</a>] which hinder accurate interpretation of results. For conventional raster scans (where the beam proceeds across each row from left to right, then moves to the next row, proceeding again from left to right), these distortions are primarily evident at the beginning of each row, where the movement of the beam deviates significantly from its otherwise constant movement from left to right. Therefore, STEM acquisitions have often used “flyback time” to delay acquisition at the beginning of each row while the beam stabilizes. However, at high acquisition speeds (small dwell time), flyback time can become a significant bottleneck to time resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.1088-B4\">4</a>]. Additionally, the use of flyback time is not applicable for non-rastered scan patterns, which are increasingly of interest for improving time resolution or reducing radiation damage [<a href=\"#ozae044.1088-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1088-B5\">5</a>]. Therefore, scan distortions remain a considerable challenge to the future development of high-speed 2D and 4D STEM techniques.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4388d2af631f608db5c5c047d0a937a646151bd99cd7c8846e595e3a62842e7a","category":"Environment"}
