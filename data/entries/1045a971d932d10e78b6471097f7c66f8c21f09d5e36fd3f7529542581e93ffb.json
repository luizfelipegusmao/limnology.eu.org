{"title":"Enhancing Sustainability: Brewer&#039;s Spent Grain-based Biochar as a Renewable Energy Source and Agriculture Substrate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0589/v1","date":1720420522000,"content":"This study investigates the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the main properties of BSG (brewer's spent grain) biochar and evaluates its suitability as an energy vector and as a substrate component. Pyrolysis tests were carried out at 673, 773, and 873 K. Bioenergy indexes were calculated for BSG and its biochar, and germination tests were carried out to obtain lentil sprouts. The results showed that the BSG biochar obtained at the lowest temperature biochar presented the best performance for use as biofuel. Regarding the germination tests, the different biochars were applied at 4 doses, and the evaluated parameters such as germination percentage, germination rate, mean germination time, and seed vigor were strongly influenced by the biochar addition. The biochar at 773 K added at a dose of 5% doubled the values of mean germination time, seed vigor, and time for 50% of the seeds to emerge compared to the control, constituted only with distilled water. The sustainable BSG valorization through pyrolysis reduces waste and contributes to circular economy practices by transforming industrial by-products into valuable resources for energy and agriculture. This approach highlights the importance of sustainability in reducing the environmental impact of industrial waste and promoting renewable energy sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1045a971d932d10e78b6471097f7c66f8c21f09d5e36fd3f7529542581e93ffb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
