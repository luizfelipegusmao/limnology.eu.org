{"title":"Impacts of Am Aggregation on the Bulk Properties of Mixed Oxides (U, Am)O2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2599/v1","date":1722592718000,"content":": We present first-principles DFT+U investigation of the bulk properties including structural, energetic and mechanical properties for uranium-americium mixed oxides (U, Am)O2. The various Am aggregation contents have been investigated to better understand the impact of Am in the nuclear fuel UO2. The supercell defect models at different scales were used to describe the solid solution (U, Am)O2. The obtained results show that different contents of Am has a significant impact on the volume and energy of the mixed oxides systems. The results on the electronic structure calculations exhibit a narrow band gap owing to the mixing of UO2 and AmO2. The mixing enthalpy of the Am aggregation systems are used to describe the phase stability for the solid solution. In particular, mixing enthalpy of the (U, Am)O2 significantly reduced as the Am content increases. The elastic properties of the (U, Am)O2 mixed oxides have also been compared as a function of Am content. Moreover, the impacts of the whole Pu aggregation content range on the bulk properties for the (U, Pu)O2 mixed oxides is also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44923806c059d4b627e327e46d5777ee66aa4a06b26fe78901b3d2d1f25d3fbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
