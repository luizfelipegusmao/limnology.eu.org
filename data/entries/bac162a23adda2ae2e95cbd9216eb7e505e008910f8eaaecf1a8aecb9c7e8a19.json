{"title":"Mapping evidence on the factors contributing to long waiting times and interventions to reduce waiting times within primary health care facilities in South Africa: A scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299253","date":1724248800000,"content":"<p>by Ugochinyere I. Nwagbara, Khumbulani W. Hlongwana, Sylvester C. Chima</p>\r\nBackground <p>Globally, reduction of patient waiting time has been identified as one of the major characteristics of a functional health system. In South Africa, 83% of the general population visiting primary healthcare (PHC) facilities must contend with long waiting times, overcrowding, staff shortages, poor quality of care, an ineffective appointment booking system, and a lack of medication. These experiences may, in turn, affect how patients view service quality.</p> Methods <p>This scoping review was guided by Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework. The primary literature search of peer-reviewed and review articles was achieved through PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and World Health Organization (WHO) library databases, using waiting times, outpatient departments, factors, interventions, and primary healthcare facilities as keywords. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full articles, using the set inclusion and exclusion criteria. We used NVIVO<sup>®</sup> version 10 software to facilitate thematic analysis of the results from included studies.</p> Results <p>From the initial 250 records screened, nine studies were eligible for inclusion in this scoping review. Seven papers identified the factors contributing to waiting time, and five papers mentioned effective interventions implemented to reduce waiting times within PHC facilities. Our analysis produced three (patient factors, staff factors, and administrative systems) and two (manual-based waiting time reduction systems and electronic-based waiting time reduction systems) main themes pertaining to factors contributing to long waiting times and interventions to reduce waiting times, respectively.</p> Conclusion <p>Our results revealed that the patients, staff, and administrative systems all contribute to long waiting times within the PHC facilities. Patient waiting times recorded a wider and more evenly spread patient arrival pattern after the identified interventions in our study were implemented. There is a need to constantly strategize on measures such as implementing the use of an electronic appointment scheduling system and database, improving staff training on efficient patient flow management, and regularly assessing and optimizing administrative processes. By continuously monitoring and adapting these strategies, PHC facility managers can create a more efficient and patient-centered healthcare experience.</p>","author":"Ugochinyere I.
