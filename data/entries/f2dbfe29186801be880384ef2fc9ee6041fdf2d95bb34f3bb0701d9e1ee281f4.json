This paper aims to validate the ability of CFD simula-tions to predict particle size distribution in a polymer microencapsulation process. The CFD mod-eling approach employed an Eulerian multiphase framework, incorporating a discrete population balance model to track the evolution of the droplet population. A realizable k-ε turbulence model and a multiple reference frame strategy were utilized to capture the system’s flow dynamics. The results reveal that while the CFD simulations align well with experimental data at higher agitation speeds (&gt;10000 rpm), discrepancies arise at lower speeds (","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2dbfe29186801be880384ef2fc9ee6041fdf2d95bb34f3bb0701d9e1ee281f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
