{"title":"Use of Digital Technology in Integrated Mathematics Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0295/v1","date":1717669320000,"content":"The use of didactic and interactive materials is essential in generating interest among students and teachers in utilizing mathematical models and digital technologies for the educational process. These materials create a dynamic and engaging learning environment that promotes a deeper understanding of complex concepts and fosters a passion for learning. Additionally, integrating interactive materials into pilot courses can assist teachers in better assessing student learning and adjusting the teaching strategies accordingly and the teachers can receive valuable insights into students' strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to provide targeted support and intervention when needed. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an approach for solving mathematics problems embedded in technical scenarios within the defense and security fields with the aid of digital technology. In this way, students can visualize abstract concepts, experiment with different scenarios, and receive instant feedback on their understanding. This paper helps to reinforce key concepts and enhance problem-solving skills, sparking curiosity, creativity, and encouraging active participation and collaboration. Throughout the development of this proposal, good practices are adopted, and advice for improvement is collected while having a wide range of users, giving feedback, discussions, and testing (pilot) short-term learning/teaching/training activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b397e59a26b4483519138de1a157d66f2d02371f97e9f82d2ec5c8655a93010c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
