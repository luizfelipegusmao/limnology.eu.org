{"title":"Characterization of Avian Influenza Viruses Detected in Kenyan Live Bird Markets and Wild Bird Habitats Reveal Genetically Diverse Subtypes and High Proportion of A(H9N2), 2018-2020","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0600/v1","date":1723100017000,"content":"Following the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus in countries bordering Kenya to the west, we conducted surveillance among domestic and wild birds along the shores of Lake Victoria. In addition, between 2018 and 2020, we conducted surveillance among poultry and poultry workers in live bird markets and among wild migratory birds in various lakes that are resting sites during migration to assess introduction and circulation of avian influenza viruses in these populations.\nWe tested 7,464 specimens (oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs) from poultry and 6,531 fresh fecal specimens from wild birds for influenza A viruses by real-time RT-PCR. Influenza was detected in 3.9% (n=292) of specimens collected from poultry and 0.2% (n=10) of fecal specimens from wild birds. On hemagglutinin subtyping, most of the influenza A positives from poultry (274/292, 93.8%) were H9. Of 34 H9 specimens randomly selected for further subtyping, all were H9N2. On phylogenetic analysis, these viruses were genetically similar to other H9 viruses detected in East Africa.\nOnly two of the ten influenza A positive specimens from the wild bird fecal specimens were successfully subtyped; sequencing analysis of one specimen collected in 2018 was identified as low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 virus of the Eurasian lineage and the second specimen, collected in 2020, was subtyped as H11. A total of 18 OP/NS swabs from poultry workers with ARI (12%) were collected; none were positive for influenza A virus.\nWe observed significant circulation of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry in live bird markets in Kenya. During the same period, low pathogenic H5N2 virus was detected in a fecal specimen collected in a site hosting a variety of migratory and resident birds. Although HPAI H5N8 was not detected in this survey, these results highlight the potential for introduction and establishment of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in poultry populations and the associated risk of spillover to human populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33b0dea781bc5f9213001a1dfcc8b9345fdd10a76bfdc12aa9ea61a965fe7a2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
