{"title":"CP Violation: Differing Binding Energy Levels of Quarks and Antiquarks, and their Transitions in Λ-baryons and B-mesons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1751/v1","date":1721652293000,"content":"We consider spontaneous quark transitions between the Λ0 baryon and its resonant states, and (anti)quark transitions between the neutral kaon K0 and the two heavy ηq-mesons (q = c, b). We use the measured differences in mass deficits to calculate the binding energy levels of valence c and b (anti)quarks in these transitions. In the process, we account for isospin energy release in K0 transitions and for the work done by the strong force in suppressing Coulomb repulsions in the charged Λc+-baryon. We find that the flips s→c and s¯→c¯ both release energy back to the strong field; and that the overall range of quark energy levels above their u-ground is 100-MeV wider than that of antiquark energy levels above their d¯-ground. The wider quark range stems from the flip s→b, which costs 283 MeV more (or 3× more) than the corresponding antiquark flip s¯→b¯. At the same time, transitions from the respective ground states to the s and s¯ states (or the c and c¯ states) point to a clear origin of the elusive charge-parity (CP) violation. The determined binding energy levels of (anti)quarks allow us to analyze in depth the (anti)quark transitions in Λ-baryons and B-mesons.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6708a74dd07043e3c661556a0f74b2887db950789f0af0300cdd1fa381cc4e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
