This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the shade performance of single-shade RBCs in direct restorations were included. A search of the scientific literature was performed in 5 databases (April 2024). The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4, calculating the risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the dichotomous outcome using a random effects model. Bias was assessed using the RoB 2.0 tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool. Four studies with 263 restorations analyzed were selected. The results showed comparable performance between single-shade RBCs and multishade RBCs in terms of color match and color stability over 12 months. Three studies had a low risk of bias with all expected results, and one study had some concerns. The certainty of evidence for color stability was considered low for all follow-up periods due to the small number of events and sample size. According to the United States Public Health Service Evaluation (USPHS) and the World Dental Federation (FDI), there is comparable clinical color performance between single-shade and multishade RBCs over 12 months.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"daf54c59092e36f42fcce235dc22bf3f5ba7ba7cb14abbd04f2fac2810cc9097","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
