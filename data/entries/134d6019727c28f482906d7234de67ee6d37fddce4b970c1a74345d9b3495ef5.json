{"title":"Foliar application of melatonin improve the number of secondary branches and secondary branch grains quality of rice","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307368","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Feiyu Yan, Guoliang Zhang, Hongliang Zhao, Zhiwei Huang, Yuan Niu, Mingchao Zhu</p>\r\n\r\nMelatonin plays an important role in plant growth and development. However, little information is available about melatonin regulating rice panicle structure and yield. This study explored the regulatory effects and mechanisms of melatonin spraying before the panicle differentiation stage on rice panicle structure and grain quality. The results showed that spraying melatonin before panicle differentiation increased rice yield, which was mainly reflected in the increase in spikelets per panicle and the percentage of filled grains. In addition, melatonin treatment significantly increased the panicle length. The results of panicle structure analysis showed that the increase in spikelets per panicle caused by melatonin was attributed to the significant increase in the number of secondary branches, total number of secondary branch spikelets, and number of spikelets per secondary branch. The results showed that melatonin can increase the content of zeatin, auxin, and gibberellin, and reduce the content of abscisic acid. These results showed that melatonin affected panicle structure by regulating hormone content, thereby improving yield. In addition, melatonin improves the processing quality, appearance quality, and nutritional quality of secondary branch grains. The above results indicate that application of melatonin improves the number of secondary branches and the quality of grainss on secondary branches.","author":"Feiyu Yan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"134d6019727c28f482906d7234de67ee6d37fddce4b970c1a74345d9b3495ef5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
