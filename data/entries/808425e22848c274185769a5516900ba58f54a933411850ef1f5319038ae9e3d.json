{"title":"Gallbladder Burkitt’s Lymphoma in a Child Living with HIV: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1084/v1","date":1718604368000,"content":"Malignant lymphoma is an unusual form of gallbladder neoplasm. Almost all of these tumors are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type lymphomas. Herein, we report a rare case of a gallbladder Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) in a child living with HIV. As far as we are concerned, this is the first report in the pediatric population and in an individual living with HIV. The patient attended the Federal Hospital of Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, underwent cholecystectomy and the postoperative pathological analysis of the gallbladder revealed a diagnosis of BL. Also, HIV serology was performed and returned positive. She was transferred to the Martagão Gesteira Institute of Pediatrics and Childcare for oncological treatment, dying from sepsis and disease progression about 18 months later. Patient did not undergo ART/cART. Previous cases of gallbladder BL were analyzed to characterize the clinicopathological features. BL can occur in the gallbladder both in the context of HIV infection and in the pediatric population. Biopsy is mandatory in cases with suggestive findings of lymphoma, and an early diagnosis can change the course of the disease. Furthermore, the case highlights the importance of an early initiation of ART/cART in people living with HIV (PLWH).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"808425e22848c274185769a5516900ba58f54a933411850ef1f5319038ae9e3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
