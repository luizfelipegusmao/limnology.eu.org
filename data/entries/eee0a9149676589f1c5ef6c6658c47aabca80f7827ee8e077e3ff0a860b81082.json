{"title":"Mirror-Image RNA: A Right-Handed Z-Form RNA and Its Ligand Complex","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0457/v1","date":1728373250000,"content":"Until now, Z-form RNAs were believed to only adopt a left-handed double helix structure. In this study, we describe the first observation of a right-handed Z-form RNA in NMR solution formed by L-nucleic acid RNA and present the first resolution structure of the complex between a right-handed Z-form RNA and a curaxin ligand. This newly described topology is of great interest as it shows that Z-form RNAs can also adopt a right-handed double helix structure and interact with ligand molecules. The structural information provides a platform for the design of topology specific Z-form-targeting compounds and is valuable for the development of new potent anticancer drugs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eee0a9149676589f1c5ef6c6658c47aabca80f7827ee8e077e3ff0a860b81082","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
