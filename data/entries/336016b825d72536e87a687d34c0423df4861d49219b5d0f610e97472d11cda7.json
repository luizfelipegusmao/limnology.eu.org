The ability to design periodic and localized quantum potentials using these moiré patterns holds the potential to drive advancements in quantum technologies [<a href=\"#ozae044.818-B1\">1</a>]. The stacking domains formed are strongly controlled by the interplay of strain and flat band structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.818-B2\">2</a>]. Application of external stimulus like light, electric field and molecular absorption perturbs the local strain network and are known to cause stacking order transitions in tri-layer graphene [<a href=\"#ozae044.818-B3\">3</a>]. Recently, twisted WS<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> hetero-bilayers have shown to conduct heat at the ultrafast speeds due to Vander Waals interaction between the layers. However, the dynamics involved behind the process at high spatial resolution are still unknown [<a href=\"#ozae044.818-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"336016b825d72536e87a687d34c0423df4861d49219b5d0f610e97472d11cda7","category":"Environment"}
