{"title":"Modulation of gut‐microbiota through probiotics and dietary interventions to improve host health","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13370?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Dietary patterns play an important role in regards to the modulation and control of the gut microbiome composition and function. The interaction between diet and microbiota plays an important role in order to maintain intestinal homeostasis, which ultimately affect the host's health. Diet directly impacts the microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which then contributes to the production of secondary metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters, and antimicrobial peptides. Dietary consumption with genetically modified probiotics can be the best vaccine delivery vector and protect cells from various illnesses. A holistic approach to disease prevention, treatment, and management takes these intrinsically linked diet-microbes, microbe–microbe interactions, and microbe–host interactions into account. Dietary components, such as fiber can modulate beneficial gut microbiota, and they have resulting ameliorative effects against metabolic disorders. Medical interventions, such as antibiotic drugs can conversely have detrimental effects on gut microbiota by disputing the balance between <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>firmicute</i>, which contribute to continuing disease states. We summarize the known effects of various dietary components, such as fibers, carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, proteins, phenolic acids, and antibiotics on the composition of the gut microbiota in this article in addition to the beneficial effect of genetically modified probiotics and consequentially their role in regards to shaping human health. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Vaishali Lekchand Dasriya, \nMrinal Samtiya, \nSoniya Ranveer, \nHarmeet Singh Dhillon, \nNishu Devi, \nVikas Sharma, \nPranali Nikam, \nMonica Puniya, \nPriya Chaudhary, \nVishu Chaudhary, \nPradip V Behare, \nTejpal Dhewa, \nRavichandra Vemuri, \nAntónio Raposo, \nDharun Vijay Puniya, \nGulab D.
