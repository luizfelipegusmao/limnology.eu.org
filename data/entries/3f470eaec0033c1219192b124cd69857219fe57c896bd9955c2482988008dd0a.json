{"title":"The double-edged sword of potassium and sodium fertilization in xylem embolism resistance of two Eucalyptus species under drought stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5641/7686876?rss=1","date":1717372800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is a beneficial element for most plants and may replace potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) in osmoregulatory process to a certain extent, increasing plant water use efficiency. Thus, understanding coordinated mechanisms underlying the combined use of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> in tree drought tolerance is a key challenge for forestry in dealing with productivity and water limitations. A pot experiment with three ratios of K/Na (K-supplied, partial K replacement by Na, and K-deficient plants) and two water regimes, well-watered (W+) and water-stressed (W−), was conducted on saplings of two <span>Eucalyptus</span> species with contrasting drought sensitivities. We evaluated the point of stomatal closure (<span>P</span><sub>gs90</sub>), xylem water potential at 12, 50, and 88% embolized xylem area (<span>P</span><sub>12</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>50</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>88</sub>), hydraulic safety margin, leaf gas exchange (<span>A</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>g</span><sub>s</sub>, and dark respiration), pre-dawn and midday leaf water potential (Ψ<sub>PD</sub> and Ψ<sub>MD</sub>), long-term water use efficiency (WUE<sub>L</sub>) and total dry mass. Partial K replacement by Na increased leaf gas exchange, WUE<sub>L</sub>, and total dry mass, while <span>P</span><sub>gs90</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>12</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>50</sub>, <span>P</span><sub>88</sub>, and Ψ<sub>MD</sub> decreased (were more negative), compared with plants exclusively supplied with K and K-deficient plants of both species. Fertilized plants had narrower hydraulic safety margins than K-deficient plants, indicating that these <span>Eucalyptus</span> species adopt the functional adaptive strategy of operating close to their hydraulic limits to maximize carbon uptake while increasing the risk of hydraulic failure under drought stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"3f470eaec0033c1219192b124cd69857219fe57c896bd9955c2482988008dd0a","category":"Environment"}
