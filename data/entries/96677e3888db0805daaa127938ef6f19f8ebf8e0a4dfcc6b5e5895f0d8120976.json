{"title":"CBP60b clade proteins are prototypical transcription factors mediating immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1489/7695747?rss=1","date":1718668800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Transcriptional reprogramming is critical for plant immunity. Several calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein 60 (CBP60) family transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), including CBP60g, systemic acquired resistance deficient 1 (SARD1), CBP60a, and CBP60b, are critical for and show distinct roles in immunity. However, there are additional CBP60 members whose function is unclear. We report here that Arabidopsis CBP60c–f, 4 uncharacterized CBP60 members, play redundant roles with CBP60b in the transcriptional regulation of immunity responses, whose <span>pCBP60b</span>-driven expression compensates the loss of <span>CBP60b</span>. By contrast, neither CBP60g nor SARD1 is interchangeable with CBP60b, suggesting clade-specific functionalization. We further show that the function of CBP60b clade TFs relies on DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and CaM-binding domains, suggesting that they are downstream components of calcium signaling. Importantly, we demonstrate that CBP60s encoded in earliest land plant lineage <span>Physcomitrium patens</span> and <span>Selaginella moellendorffii</span> are functionally homologous to Arabidopsis CBP60b, suggesting that the CBP60b clade contains the prototype TFs of the CBP60 family. Furthermore, tomato and cucumber CBP60b–like genes rescue the defects of Arabidopsis <span>cbp60b</span> and activate the expression of tomato and cucumber <span>SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIIENT2</span> (<span>SID2</span>) and <span>ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1</span> (<span>EDS1</span>) genes, suggesting that immune response pathways centered on CBP60b are also evolutionarily conserved. Together, these findings suggest that CBP60b clade TFs are functionally conserved in evolution and positively mediate immunity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"96677e3888db0805daaa127938ef6f19f8ebf8e0a4dfcc6b5e5895f0d8120976","category":"Environment"}
