These operators successfully manage imprecision and uncertainty in the preferences of senior tourists. However, the Hamy mean (HM) operator can identify the connections between various input data sets and produce excellent outcomes when combining and evaluating information. We illustrate their usefulness and efficacy through a case study, providing a strong instrument for improving service quality for senior citizens and promoting an inclusive and fulfilling travel experience. In this work, we develop the HM operator and Dombi operations with Complex interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (CIVIFNs). We recommend the CIVIFDHM operator, complex interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted Dombi Hamy mean (CIVIFWDHM), complex interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy dual Dombi Hamy mean (CIVIFDDHM), and complex interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted dual Dombi Hamy mean (CIVIFWDD) operators. Next, multiple attribute decision making (MADM) models are constructed with the help of CIVIFWDHM and CIVIFWDDHM operators. We provided an evaluation of an older tourism operator in a tourist area as an example to show the suggested models.","author":"Ali N. A.
