{"title":"Targeting Toll-like Receptor 4 in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Perspectives of Ulcerative Colitis: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0064/v1","date":1719838925000,"content":"Gastrointestinal inflammation is a key feature of several common disorders, such as cancer treatmentâ€“induced mucositis and ulcerative colitis. These conditions lead to severe symptoms, significantly affect the quality of life, and are often not well-managed. Research has suggested that the activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a critical role in the inflammatory signalling pathways of the intestinal tract. Consequently, inhibiting TLR4 is proposed as a promising strategy to treat intestinal inflammation. Despite this, few studies have explored the potential of TLR4 antagonism as a therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammation. This review examined existing literature and evaluated the effects of TLR4 in various models of intestinal inflammation, including in vitro (lab-based), ex vivo (outside the organism), and in vivo (within living organisms) studies. The findings indicate that TLR4 may indeed have the potential to treat inflammation. However, only a small number of studies have directly investigated the use of TLR4 antagonists for treating intestinal inflammation. These preliminary results highlight the need for further research into the target of TLR4 for UC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be80a8a700b70997e71e818af503e539a7f000eebf9e73d32e18cbe6940ec0fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
