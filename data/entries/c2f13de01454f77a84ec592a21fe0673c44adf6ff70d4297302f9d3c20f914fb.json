{"title":"Improving Geotechnical Properties of Expansive Subgrade Using Sugar Cane Molasses and Cement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0881/v1","date":1726044581000,"content":"Soil stabilization using Portland cement is a widely adopted technique. Previous research has demonstrated that molasses, which contains sugars, enhances the reaction between cement and aggregates. This study investigates the impact of adding molasses to soil stabilized with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) on geotechnical properties. Expansive clay soil samples from Taru Jabba, District Nowshera, Pakistan, were treated with various combinations of molasses and cement. The concentrations of each stabilizer were varied at 0%, 4%, 8%, and 12% by dry weight of the soil. Additionally, the soil was treated with constant molasses contents of 4%, 8%, and 12%, while varying the cement content at 4%, 8%, and 12% by dry weight. Geotechnical tests, including Proctor compaction, Atterberg limits, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), California Bearing Ratio (CBR), and swelling potential, were conducted to assess the effects of the stabilizers. The results indicated that the addition of molasses improved soil strength, mitigated shrinkage cracks, and reduced brittleness. Specifically, the CBR value increased from 3.2% in the native soil to 12.3% with 12% molasses and 12% cement. The Plasticity Index (PI) decreased from 14.23% to 8.12%, and the CBR swell value reduced from 9.66% to 3.82%. Furthermore, the UCS of the stabilized soil increased by 64.7% compared to the untreated soil after a 7-day curing period.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2f13de01454f77a84ec592a21fe0673c44adf6ff70d4297302f9d3c20f914fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
