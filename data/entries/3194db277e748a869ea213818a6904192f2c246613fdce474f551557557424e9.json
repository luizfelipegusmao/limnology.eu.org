Data were collected using a questionnaire applied to 229 entering the courses, and the analysis was carried out using Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results demonstrated that: a) H1a: education had a positive influence on the choice of an entrepreneurial career, and b) H1b: business-friendly environments reinforce this choice, influenced by broader social and cultural support. This demonstrates that environmental, factors enhance cognitive factors and the intention to undertake. The results also showed that: c) H2c: the perception of abilities to start a business, and d) H2a: the favorable evaluation of choosing an entrepreneurial career, are determining elements of entrepreneurial intentions in the studied context. However, the negative relationship between e) H1c: government incentives and the ability to start a business, and f) H2b: the influence of social and environmental on entrepreneurial intentions requires attention from universities and governments in promoting environments conducive to entrepreneurship, the choice of an entrepreneurial career and the decision of young people to get involved in sustainable business projects. In conclusion, environmental and psychological aspects have positive and significant effects on the entrepreneurial career intentions of higher education students, opening space for governments and universities to promote student entrepreneurship with the sustainability business as beliefs and values.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3194db277e748a869ea213818a6904192f2c246613fdce474f551557557424e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
