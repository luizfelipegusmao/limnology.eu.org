{"title":"Blockchain Technology Implementation in Supply Chain Management: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1269/v1","date":1711073836000,"content":"The paper's objectives are to identify the main benefits, limitations, and challenges facing using Blockchain technology in the Supply Chain Management (SCM). To explore the factors that affect the adoption and application of Blockchain technology in SCM. The study uses a systematic literature review methodology to analyze and compare selected related articles published between 2016 and 2022 on the usage of Blockchain technology in the SCM. Several studies showed that there are many benefits to using Blockchain technology in SCM such as enhanced security, confidentiality, traceability, transparency, data accuracy, privacy, efficiency, accountability, and trust. At the same time, there are many limitations and challenges like scalability, interoperability, legal (regulatory) issues, high implementation and maintenance costs, standardization and information, lack of trust in technology, high energy consumption, limited awareness, integration with current systems, and privacy. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but there are still several issues that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential. Understanding the benefits and difficulties of applying Blockchain technology in different industries, including the SCM, is essential in determining its effectiveness and the different strategies needed to assess its application and implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87f696a80ff11f5a2f4e5ac92455fc13c764dc697ff4fabfcfd4d876e21fca90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
