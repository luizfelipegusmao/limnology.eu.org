{"title":"New Geometric Theorems Derived from Integral Equations Applied to Radiative Transfer in Spherical Sectors and Circular Segments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0886/v1","date":1723595724000,"content":"Circles, semicircles and its derived circular sectors are ubiquitous both in human creations and in the natural realm. However, mathematically speaking they have always represented a certain level of enigma or even mysticism since ancient times for being such a perfect shape that enclosed the irrational value that we now call π. Such figure was relatively unknown until the seventeenth century; polymaths like Guarini even equated it, after so many centuries, to the Archimedes fraction of 22/7 or sometimes 25/8 which, giving a value 3.125 introduces a considerable degree of error; Eventually, Lambert had to demonstrate, well advanced the eighteenth century that π was actually an irrational number. In recent years, the author has worked with sections of spheres and other curved bodies as related to radiative heat transfer and applied to the finding of form factors pertaining to such special geometries, to the point of defining new postulates. The main theorems so far enunciated refer to the radiative exchange between circles and half disks, but recently the possibility to treat circular sectors has arrived, thanks to the research already conducted in which, by virtue of Cabeza-Lainez first postulate, we are able to know the form factor of any spherical segment over itself, discarding in this way, the former uncertainties that appeared when dealing with the inner side of spherical surfaces. As it is known, to find the exact expression of the configuration factor by integration alone is mostly a tedious task and the results are not readily available as it has been frequently proved. In the said problem of the circular sectors, the author could integrate the first two steps of the basic formulation for radiant exchange. Subsequently, the novelty of the procedure lies in introducing a finite differences approximation for the third and fourth integrals which still remain unsolved, once that we have been able to find the first and second integrals of the form factor. This possibility had not been identified by former research. This sole output provides us with an ample variety of scenarios previously unforeseen. As a consequence, we would be able to analyze with more precision but freely, the spatial transference of radiant heat for figures composed of circular sectors such as spherical sectors like quarters or octaves of spheres. Many architectural, industrial or aircraft modules and objects fall into this category. We already know that spherical shapes cannot be discretized with any accuracy as there are no spherical tiles of the same size, therefore we hope to overcome with our finding a persistent extent of error. In this situation we are able to reduce a considerable amount of hindrances in the progress of thermal radiation science, due to the advances hereby presented. As the new formulations found can be adapted for algorithms, they will be integrated in simulation procedures with significant avail. Our achievement may be considered timely in the effort invested to square the elements of mathematics for radiative transfer. Important sequels are already being derived for radiation in the entrance to tunnels, aircraft design, low-energy building construction and also lighting and HVAC industries to cite just a few.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6870e75875b6156c8018dae1d2fc12d9a16c3c31d1752984fb24986a9c93897b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
