{"title":"Remote Patient Monitoring for Global Emergencies: a case study in COVID-19 patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1206/v1","date":1726473548000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for telehealth and remote patient monitoring in healthcare delivery. Despite the growing use of on-body wearable sensors for continuous monitoring and predicting adverse events, such as hospitalizations or falls, their widespread adoption within the healthcare ecosystem remains a significant challenge. While the pandemic has accelerated the acceptance of these technologies, achieving widespread integration requires their sustained incorporation into routine healthcare practices beyond emergency situations. In this study, we extend the application of our previously developed remote patient monitoring system, originally designed for the geriatric frail population, to COVID-19 patients. Our objective is to assess whether the metrics obtained from this system, which includes physical activity and indoor localization sensors, along with vital sign monitoring, can provide additional insights into the recovery trajectory of individuals affected by COVID-19.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad0b53291c8d6d0ea8aa29eb6a5362cf5ce611a291019f43e9c2390f6daa816b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
