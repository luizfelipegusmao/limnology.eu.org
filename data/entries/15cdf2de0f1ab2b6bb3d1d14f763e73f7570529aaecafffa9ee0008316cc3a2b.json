{"title":"From lawns to meadows: spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) as indicators to measure urban grassland restoration success","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11252-024-01626-x","date":1738368000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>In the present study, we investigate how spiders can be used to assess the effectiveness of restoring mesic grasslands on former urban lawns. We compile and analyze a comprehensive dataset, including both past and current data, focusing on the Aachen region. By systematically examining this data, we identify various indicators using different analytical methods. This approach allows us to distinguish distinct species communities, making them useful as diagnostic tools at various stages of habitat development. Additionally, we identify further parameters that are essential for evaluating meadow restoration in urban settings. We highlight the crucial importance of understanding the local species repertoire, as this knowledge is vital for setting realistic benchmarks for restoration projects.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"15cdf2de0f1ab2b6bb3d1d14f763e73f7570529aaecafffa9ee0008316cc3a2b","category":"Environment"}
