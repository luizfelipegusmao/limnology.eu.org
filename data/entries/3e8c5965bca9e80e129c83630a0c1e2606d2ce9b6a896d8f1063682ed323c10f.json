Pixelated STEM detector is one of these instruments for utilizing diffraction information that was otherwise partly lost in the conventional single-channel STEM detectors. Various types of applications have been introduced using the 4-dimensional (4D) dataset which include synthetic STEM image reconstruction, field map visualization and phase image reconstruction by ptychography, etc. [<a href=\"#ozae044.948-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.948-B2\">2</a>]. Meanwhile, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is also an important and popular means of obtaining information on the composition and even on the chemical bonding inside a sample. Considering the type of necessary electron signal for both 4D-STEM and EELS, they should go well with each other in many cases: the former needs a part of transmitted electron beam and scattered or diffracted beams and the latter needs a part of transmitted beam which is complementary to the former [<a href=\"#ozae044.948-B3\">3</a>]. Although simultaneous analysis using both instruments has been anticipated, making a center hole in the middle of a pixelated detector to let electron beam pass through into an EELS spectrometer was a manufacturing challenge. PNDetector is a company manufacturing high-speed pnCCD camera which can be operated at 7,500 frames per second for the 4D-STEM application. It recently manufactured a prototype pnCCD sensor with a center hole while keeping other specs the same, realizing the simultaneous acquisition of 4D and EELS data [<a href=\"#ozae044.948-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3e8c5965bca9e80e129c83630a0c1e2606d2ce9b6a896d8f1063682ed323c10f","category":"Environment"}
