{"title":"Permafrost Degradation Induces the Abrupt Changes of Vegetation NDVI in the Northern Hemisphere","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004309?af=R","date":1728126613000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Permafrost, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, plays a vital role in regulating heat and moisture cycles within ecosystems. In the last four decades, due to global warming, permafrost degradation has accelerated significantly in high latitudes and altitudes. However, the impact of permafrost degradation on vegetation remains poorly understood to date. Based on active layer thickness (ALT) monitoring data, meteorological data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, we found that most ALT-monitored sites in the Northern Hemisphere show an increasing trend in NDVI and ALT. This suggests an overall increase in NDVI from 1980 to 2021 while permafrost degradation has been occurring. Permafrost degradation positively influences NDVI growth, with the intensity of the effects varying across land cover types and permafrost regions. Furthermore, based on Mann-Kendall trend test, we detected abrupt changes in NDVI and environmental factors, further confirming that there is a strong consistency between the abrupt changes of ALT and NDVI, and the consistency between the abrupt change events of ALT and NDVI is stronger than that of air temperature and precipitation. These findings work toward a better comprehending of permafrost effects on vegetation growth in the context of climate change.</p>","author":"Yanpeng Yang, \nXufeng Wang, \nTonghong Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"d45dde5dafe26ef5385746026646c41c7be3c2e6ae40bfdb8e0d28dc1f6764f1","category":"Environment"}
