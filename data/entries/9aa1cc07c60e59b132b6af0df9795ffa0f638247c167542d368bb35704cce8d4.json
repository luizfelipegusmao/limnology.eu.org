{"title":"Evaluation of the Quality of ChatGPT&rsquo;s Responses to Top 20 Questions about Robotic Hip and Knee Arthroplasty: Findings, Perspectives and Critical Remark on Healthcare Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1595/v1","date":1719209744000,"content":"Robotic-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty represents significant advancements in orthopedic surgery. Artificial intelligence (AI) - driven chatbots, such ChatGP, plays a significant role in healthcare education. This study aims to evaluate the quality of responses provided by ChatGPT to the top 20 questions concerning robotic-assisted hip and knee arthroplasty.We have asked ChatGPT to select the top 20 questions on Google concerning robotic hip and knee arthroplasty and to provide a detailed answer to each of them. The accuracy of the information provided were examined by three orthopedic surgeons with scientific and clinical experience in hip and knee replacement surgery. The accuracy was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 – completely incorrect to 5 – correct); the completeness through a 4-point Likert scale (from 0 – comprehensiveness not assessable for completely incorrect answers to 3 – exhaustive information) on two different occasions to ensure the consistency of the assessment. Our analysis reveals that ChatGPT provides a relatively high degree of accuracy, moreover the explanations can be considered satisfy, especially for factual questions. The findings suggest that ChatGPT can serve as a valuable initial resource for general information on robotic hip and knee arthroplasty but the integration with human expertise remains essential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9aa1cc07c60e59b132b6af0df9795ffa0f638247c167542d368bb35704cce8d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
