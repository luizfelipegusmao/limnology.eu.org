{"title":"Still exotic? Comparison of macroinvertebrates associated with Elodea nuttallii and native macrophytes in urban artificial lakes","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05598-z","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Invasions of non-native species are considered major threats to biodiversity in urban waterbodies. We compared macroinvertebrate richness, density, and community composition among three urban lakes with varying macrophyte covers: One dominated by the invasive macrophyte species <em>Elodea nuttallii</em>, one by the native species <em>Myriophyllum spicatum</em>, and the third one by the native <em>Phragmites australis</em>. We also monitored substrate parameters and water quality. Canonical correspondence analysis combined with hierarchical and variation partitioning confirmed that macrophytes were the most different feature among the lakes and that dominant macrophytes of each lake best explained differences in invertebrate communities, followed by water quality and substrate type. Macrophyte growth form could be linked to certain invertebrate taxa: emergent macrophytes supported abundant shredders (<em>Gammarus</em> sp. and <em>Asellus aquaticus</em>); and submerged macrophytes favored certain predators (Hemiptera, e.g., <em>Plea leachi</em>). Our data also show that the invasive species <em>E. nuttallii</em> supports similar richness and density of invertebrates as the native macrophyte <em>M. spicatum</em>. Overall, our findings indicate a positive effect of <em>E. nuttallii</em> on the richness and density of invertebrates in the studied urban lakes. Future studies should analyze how the structural complexity of macrophytes can be managed in urban water bodies to improve macroinvertebrate diversity.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"3e5a67b9d9288218ea5b2ac40ca7af594c270ba354e41ee82143ddac5090dc78","category":"Environment"}
