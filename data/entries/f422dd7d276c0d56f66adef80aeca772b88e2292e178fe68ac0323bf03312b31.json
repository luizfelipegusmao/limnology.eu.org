{"title":"ClpL Chaperone as a Possible Component of the Disaggregase Activity of Limosilactobacillus fermentum U-21","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1769/v1","date":1716810936000,"content":"Strain L. fermentum U-21 secretes chaperones into the medium and it is considered as the candidate for the development of drugs, so-called disaggregases, for Parkinsonâ€™s disease therapy. This study is devoted to characterization of secreted protein encoded by C0965_000195 locus. Analysis of sequence and predicted structure of the protein encoded by C0965_000195 allows us to attribute it to the ClpL, homologs of which are known to be chaperones. The chaperone activity of ClpL L. fermentum U-21 was evaluated in vivo by refolding of differing in thermostability luciferases from Aliivibrio fischeri and Photorhabdus luminescens in Escherichia coli cells. It was observed that clpL from L. fermentum U-21 can compensate for the deficiency in the clpB gene and enhance the ability to refold thermodenatured proteins in clpB- cells. In vitro experiments have demonstrated the ability of a spent culture medium containing proteins secreted by L. fermentum U-21 cells, including ClpL, to prevent thermodenaturation of luciferases partially.We suggest that the ClpL protein from L. fermentum U-21 strain, which exhibits disaggregase properties against aggregating proteins, may be one of the clue components that play a role in the pharmabiotic properties of this strain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f422dd7d276c0d56f66adef80aeca772b88e2292e178fe68ac0323bf03312b31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
