{"title":"The Combination of Spray-Drying and Spray-Chilling Techniques to Encapsulate Chasteberry (Vitex agnus castus L.) Extract: Characterization of the Particles and Its Application in Dark Chocolate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1045/v1","date":1728957080000,"content":"The extract of the fruit chasteberry has phytotherapeutic effects, making it an important ally in women's well-being during premenstrual syndrome (PMS); however, it contains alcohol in the composition, has a bitter taste and spicy flavor, and can also cause a burning sensation. Encapsulation techniques can minimize these problems. In this context, the present study aimed to encapsulate the concentrated extract of chasteberry and develop dark chocolate with the potential for minimizing PMS symptoms by adding 2.5% free or microencapsulated chasteberry extract in the chocolate bar formulation. Microparticles loaded with chasteberry extract were produced by spray drying and covered by spray-chilling using Arabic gum and vegetable fat as the carriers, respectively. The particles were characterized by morphology, size, X-ray diffraction, TGA, and stability of total phenolics and casticin â€“ the molecule responsible for phytotherapeutic effects-. The best particle was added to a dark chocolate mixture.  The chocolate samples produced with free and encapsulated extracts were submitted to sensory trials. The two paired comparison tests proved that particles efficiently for masking the chasteberry extract burning sensation and bitterness in the chocolates. Besides, particles were also efficient in protecting casticin. In this context, the encapsulation using the combination of both techniques was efficient in promoting casticin and total phenolics stability and producing chocolate with good sensory aspects. Therefore, it was possible to develop a product that can be used in clinical trials to evaluate its potential to minimize PMS symptoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5f93f08d81cdd09ed7ab5815968e0f7ad6bfad38b4ae90db96e5d2575d5e177","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
