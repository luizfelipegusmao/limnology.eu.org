{"title":"Immuno-Haematologic Aspects of Dengue Infection: Biologic Insights and Clinical Implications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0900/v1","date":1715668025000,"content":"Dengue infection is caused by the Dengue virus (DENV) and is transmitted to humans by infected female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. There are nearly 100 million new dengue cases yearly in more than 120 countries with a five-fold increase in incidence over the past four decades. While many patients experience a mild illness, a subset suffer from severe disease which can be fatal. Dysregulated immune responses are central to the pathogenesis of dengue, and haematologic manifestations are a prominent feature of severe disease. While thrombocytopaenia and coagulopathy are major causes of bleeding in severe dengue, leucocyte abnormities are emerging as important markers of prognosis. In this review, we provide our perspective on the clinical aspects and pathophysiology of haematologic manifestations in dengue. We also discuss the key gaps in our current practice and areas to be addressed by future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b331c016653e555078c10dcea0ee176b077c87cc3e22d80618401d9d5c877610","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
