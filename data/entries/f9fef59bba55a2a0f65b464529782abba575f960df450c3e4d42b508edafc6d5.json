By integrating bibliometric analysis with a systematic review, the research offers a comprehensive understanding of key themes, trends, and debates in the field. The review process culminated in the selection of 59 publications, which were analyzed to identify critical topics including embedding emerging skills in built environment competencies, competency-based curriculum, technology infrastructure and assessment, municipal competency training, and the role of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The findings underscore the importance of evolving educational frameworks to meet the demands of globalization, integrating advanced technologies, and fostering industry-academic collaborations to enhance the skills of professionals in the built environment sector. This approach ensures a robust examination of the competencies necessary for effective infrastructure delivery in emerging economies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9fef59bba55a2a0f65b464529782abba575f960df450c3e4d42b508edafc6d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
