However, it is the atomic scale fabrication that can be expected to be the key technology of the XXI century. The need for such fabrication is by now well realized - in particular, biological sequencing, quantum communication, quantum computing, and single spin magnetoelectronic devices all need fabrication at the atomic level, including precise positioning of functional dopant atoms and avoiding even atomic-scale defects in the active region of the device and interconnects. Over the last decade, this electron beams have been used to enable direct atomic motion [<a href=\"#ozae044.1013-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1013-B2\">2</a>], building homo- and multiatomic artificial molecules in 2D materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.1013-B3\">3</a>], and atomic-plane sculpting of 2D and 3D materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.1013-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.1013-B5\">5</a>] . Here, we harness the power of electron beams assisted by machine learning-based control for atomic fabrication of quantum materials and devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7af3f94735cfd2c213df6c570aee5f41139bfa402f802d425397a94ce67d21bc","category":"Environment"}
