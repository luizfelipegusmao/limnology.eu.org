{"title":"Enabling 3D Imaging of Operating Batteries","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.117/7719525?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Over the past decade, an explosion of <span>in situ</span> and <span>operando</span> synchrotron-based X-ray studies have provided unprecedented insight into Li-ion batteries and other electrochemical energy storage devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.117-B1\">1-3</a>]. <span>In situ</span> characterization, meaning done without disassembling a system to study its components, and <span>operando</span> characterization, meaning studying the system during normal operating conditions, provide unprecedented insight into complex, dynamic system such as the Li-ion battery. The gained understanding spans the fundamental structureâ€“property relationship of novel energy storage materials and their interfaces as they evolve [<a href=\"#ozae044.117-B4\">4</a>] to issues directly relevant to current commercial battery technologies such as enabling extreme fast charging by avoiding Li metal plating [<a href=\"#ozae044.117-B5\">5</a>] and protecting the layered oxide cathode while expanding the operational voltage window to increase energy capacity [<a href=\"#ozae044.117-B6\">6</a>]. This explosion of X-ray characterization is in part due to the recognition that X-rays, particularly hard X-rays (&gt;5 keV), can penetrate through the standard, single-layer pouch cell battery geometry (Figure 1a), avoiding the need for specialized <span>in situ</span> cells with X-ray transparent windows or modified coin cells (Figure 1b). Specialized <span>in situ</span> cell designs require compromises in electrochemistry performance for the sake of characterization which can result in misleading conclusions. With standard pouch cell batteries, no compromises are needed to accommodate the <span>operando</span> measurements allowing truly realistic electrochemical systems to be characterized. At Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), this advantage has been realized in how we routinely collect <span>operando</span> X-ray diffraction, absorption spectroscopy, and microscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3157bec7b877fefdbda06ffa7d61f6514fafe57469d97a8522631746072ea348","category":"Environment"}
