{"title":"Unveiling interactions mediated by B vitamins between diatoms and their associated bacteria from cocultures","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13515?af=R","date":1729102133000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Unveiling the interactions among phytoplankton and bacteria at the level of species requires axenic isolates to experimentally demonstrate their mutual effects. In this study, we describe the interactions among the diatoms <i>Pseudo-nitzschia granii</i> and <i>Chaetoceros tenuissimus</i> and their associated bacterial species, isolated from surface water of a coastal upwelling system using coculture experiments. Microalgae growth was assessed in axenic monocultures or in coculture with each of their co-isolated bacteria in the presence or absence of B vitamins. <i>Pseudo-nitzschia granii</i> growth was limited by B-vitamin supply, except when cultured with the bacteria <i>Jannaschia cystaugens</i>, which seemed to provide adequate levels of B vitamins to the diatom. <i>Chaetoceros tenuissimus</i> growth was reduced in the absence of B vitamins. Moreover, the growth of <i>C</i>. <i>tenuissimus</i> was stimulated by <i>Alteromonas</i> sp. and <i>Celeribacter baekdonensis</i> during the exponential growth. These results show a diversity of specific interactions between the diatoms and co-isolated bacteria, ranging from allelopathy to commensalism. Understanding how interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria modulate the structure and function of marine microbial plankton communities will contribute to a greater knowledge of plankton ecology and improve our ability to predict nutrient fluxes in marine ecosystems or the formation of blooms in a context of global change.</p>","author":"Cecilia Costas‐Selas, \nSandra Martínez‐García, \nJarone Pinhassi, \nEmilio Fernández, \nEva Teira","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"d02d26ed9c97efb62c7577a03ea165aa84cd31fceab29420a0ca423b1052d9aa","category":"Environment"}
