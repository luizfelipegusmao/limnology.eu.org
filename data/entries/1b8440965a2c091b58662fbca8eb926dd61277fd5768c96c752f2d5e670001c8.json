{"title":"Unveiling the Predictive Model for Macrovascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: microRNAs Expression, Lipid Profile and Oxidative Stress Markers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0180/v1","date":1727870988000,"content":"To evaluate new circulating markers related to macrovascular complications (MVC) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we recruited 30 controls (CG), 34 patients with T2DM (DG), and 28 patients with T2DM and vascular complications (DG+C), among them, 22 presented MVC. Pe-ripheral blood was used to determine redox status (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; glutathione reductase, GRd; glutathione peroxidase, GPx; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD) and markers of oxidative damage (advanced oxidation protein products, AOPP; lipid pe-roxidation, LPO). Inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, MCP-1, TNF-α) and the relative expression of c-miRNAs were analyzed. The real-time PCR results showed that the expressions of miR-155-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-146a-3p, and miR-210-3p were significantly higher in the DG group compared to CG. DG+C group presented statistically relevant differences with CG for four miRs: the increased expression of miR-484-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-210-3p, and decreased for miR-126a-3p. Moreover, miR-126a-3p was significantly less expressed in DG+C compared to DG. The application of binary logistic regression analysis and construction of receiving operator characteristic curves (ROC) revealed two models with high predictive value for vascular complications presence: 1) HbAc1, creatinine, total cholesterol (TC), LPO, GPx, SOD, miR-126, miR-484. 2) HbAc1, creatinine, TC, IL-6, LPO, miR-126, miR-484. Moreover, our data demonstrated that gender, TC, GPx, CAT, and miR-484 were associated with MVC and exhibited higher predictive values than classical variables. miR-126, miR-484, IL-6, SOD, CAT, and GPx participate in vascular damage development in the studied diabetic population and should be considered for future studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b8440965a2c091b58662fbca8eb926dd61277fd5768c96c752f2d5e670001c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
