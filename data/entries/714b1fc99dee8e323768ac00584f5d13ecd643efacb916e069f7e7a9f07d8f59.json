{"title":"Deep brain stimulation of the <i>Tbr1</i>-deficient mouse model of autism spectrum disorder at the basolateral amygdala alters amygdalar connectivity, whole-brain synchronization, and social behaviors","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002646","date":1721138400000,"content":"<p>by Tsan-Ting Hsu, Tzyy-Nan Huang, Chien-Yao Wang, Yi-Ping Hsueh</p>\r\n\r\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are considered neural dysconnectivity syndromes. To better understand ASD and uncover potential treatments, it is imperative to know and dissect the connectivity deficits under conditions of autism. Here, we apply a whole-brain immunostaining and quantification platform to demonstrate impaired structural and functional connectivity and aberrant whole-brain synchronization in a <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>autism mouse model. We express a channelrhodopsin variant oChIEF fused with Citrine at the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to outline the axonal projections of BLA neurons. By activating the BLA under blue light theta-burst stimulation (TBS), we then evaluate the effect of BLA activation on C-FOS expression at a whole brain level to represent neural activity. We show that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency almost completely disrupts contralateral BLA axonal projections and results in mistargeting in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, thereby globally altering BLA functional connectivity. Based on correlated C-FOS expression among brain regions, we further show that <i>Tbr1</i> deficiency severely disrupts whole-brain synchronization in the absence of salient stimulation. <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>and wild-type (WT) mice exhibit opposing responses to TBS-induced amygdalar activation, reducing synchronization in WT mice but enhancing it in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice. Whole-brain modular organization and intermodule connectivity are also affected by Tbr1 deficiency and amygdalar activation. Following BLA activation by TBS, the synchronizations of the whole brain and the default mode network, a specific subnetwork highly relevant to ASD, are enhanced in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice, implying a potential ameliorating effect of amygdalar stimulation on brain function. Indeed, TBS-mediated BLA activation increases nose-to-nose social interactions of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice, strengthening evidence for the role of amygdalar connectivity in social behaviors. Our high-resolution analytical platform reveals the inter- and intrahemispheric connectopathies arising from ASD. Our study emphasizes the defective synchronization at a whole-brain scale caused by <i>Tbr1</i> deficiency and implies a potential beneficial effect of deep brain stimulation at the amygdala for TBR1-linked autism.","author":"Tsan-Ting Hsu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"714b1fc99dee8e323768ac00584f5d13ecd643efacb916e069f7e7a9f07d8f59","category":"Environment"}
