The international standards developed by the World Health Organization and World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WHO-WFSA) serve as a guideline to assess the provision of anesthetic care. This study aims to describe anesthesia capacity for children in Somaliland and assess progress towards reaching the WHO-WFSA international standards. In this cross-sectional study, anesthesia infrastructure and workforce data, as well as pediatric clinical and demographic data were collected from fifteen private, charity, and government hospitals in the six regions of Somaliland. We described anesthesia capacity in Somaliland and compared baseline data to the WHO-WFSA international standards. Overall, Somaliland did not reach most of the target goals for anesthesia capacity as defined by the WHO-WFSA. Most markers for anesthesia capacity were far behind the established targets, with deficits of 99% for anesthesiologists density, 83% for operating room density, and 83% for ventilator density. Hospitals in urban Maroodi-Jeex, and private hospitals had more supplies, infrastructure, and surgical personnel than hospitals in rural areas. There are large gaps in current anesthetic resources for children according to WHO-WFSA global standards, as well as wide disparities between regions and types of hospitals in Somaliland. Increased investment in anesthesia infrastructure and workforce is required to meet the needs of pediatric surgical patients across the country.","author":"Mubarak Mohamed","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"7db2d5d9a7d15f2ade6e4d41991a13d7a15e2e2dba8cc5c0a793045edc72d8e3","category":"Environment"}
