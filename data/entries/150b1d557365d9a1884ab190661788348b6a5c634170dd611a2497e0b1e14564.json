{"title":"EGFR Level in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers Is Associated with the Expression of SATB1 and EMT-Promoting Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0473/v1","date":1728296870000,"content":"Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) expression is an important aspect in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it becomes important to identify factors that may influence EGFR level. There are reports suggesting that one of the positive EGFR gene transcription regulators may be Special AT-rich Binding Protein 1 (SATB1), but so far these ob-servations have not been confirmed in NSCLC. \nThe main aim of the present study was to investigate the possible links between the EGFR and SATB1 expression on both protein and mRNA levels in NSCLC clinical samples, and to correlate the obtained results with the clinical-pathological data of the patients. Additionally, we analysed the relationships between the expression levels of EGFR and the known tumour promoters, in-cluding Ki67 proliferative antigen and EMT-promoting transcription factors - SLUG, SNAIL, and Twist1.\nWe demonstrated that EGFR expression in NSCLC was positively correlated both with the SATB1 level and with the expression of EMT-promoting proteins. Moreover, we were the first to analyse EGFR expression exclusively in NSCLC cancer cells without the interference caused by respiratory epithelium and tumour stroma. Our analysis revealed that the prognostic significance of EGFR expression was dependent on tumour histology and differed significantly between the AC and LSCC samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"150b1d557365d9a1884ab190661788348b6a5c634170dd611a2497e0b1e14564","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
