{"title":"Forward Response and Inversion Imaging Study of Borehole Resistivity Configurations in Tunnels","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10706-023-02658-4","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Large buried depths, extensive tunnel lines, and challenging geological conditions are characteristics of tunnel construction. There is a rising need for high-quality disaster source prospecting in advance, particularly for water-bearing structures. Due to its high sensitivity to aquatic conditions, the electrical resistivity method is frequently utilized in forward tunnel prospecting. However, the configurations of the electrical resistivity method commonly used in tunnels are limited by the narrow space of the tunnel. Their capacity for depth sounding is constrained, and precise detection is challenging. In light of the requirements of fine detection and the limits of existing methods, as well as the advantages of the borehole resistivity detection method in detection accuracy and depth, we conducted research on three distinct types of borehole resistivity configurations in tunnels. We calculated and analyzed the potential characteristic curves of three different types of borehole configurations, as well as quantitatively evaluated their depth. The model test is made to invert and contrast the information gathered by various gadgets. The advantages and disadvantages of various borehole resistivity settings for tunnels are thus demonstrated.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"ef6a3c6a9e37bb63ea91f8bddeca78506d60adef5272d033d34648dbba9d8a08","category":"Environment"}
