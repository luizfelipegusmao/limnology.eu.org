This paper compares the results of photocatalytic oxidation–adsorption co-treatment of organic arsenic pollutants such as monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, phenylarsonic acid, p-arsanilic acid, and 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid on titanium dioxide, goethite, zinc oxide, and copper oxide. It examines the influence of the morphology of organic arsenic molecules, pH, coexisting ions, and the role of natural organic matter. The photocatalytic oxidation–adsorption co-treatment mechanism is investigated, comparing the hydroxyl radical oxidation mechanism, the hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical cooxidation mechanism, and the hydroxyl radical and hole cooxidation mechanism. Finally, the future prospects of metal oxide photocatalytic materials and the development of robust and efficient technologies for removing organic arsenic are envisioned.</p>","author":"Hadiya Ablat, \nXamsiya Nurmamat, \nJianrong Tian, \nZhixi Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"a18d973c78e8daa8790160719143038ed6cff612aef77687d1ba23538e0c8be2","category":"Environment"}
