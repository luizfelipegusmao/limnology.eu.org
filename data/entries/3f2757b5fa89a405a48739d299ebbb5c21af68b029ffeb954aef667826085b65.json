{"title":"Towards an ITU Standard for DLT Energy Consumption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0290/v1","date":1712146811000,"content":"The emergence of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in the past decade has challenged our imagination to discover new, innovative and disruptive solutions to problems in domains ranging from finance and healthcare to supply chain and smart cities. However, the enormous energy consumption that has been observed in some of the most successful DLT applications raises the question of their long term sustainability. This article reviews the standardization efforts of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to provide guidelines to regulators and policy makers for making informed decisions on the applicability and sustainability of DLT architectures from the point of view of energy consumption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f2757b5fa89a405a48739d299ebbb5c21af68b029ffeb954aef667826085b65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
