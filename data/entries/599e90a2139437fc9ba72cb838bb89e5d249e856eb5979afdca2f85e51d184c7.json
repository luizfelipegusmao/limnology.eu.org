{"title":"Affibody PET Imaging of HER2-Expressing Cancers as a Key to Guide HER2-Targeted Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1295/v1","date":1713532133000,"content":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a major prognostic and predictive marker overexpressed in 15- 20 % of breast cancers. The diagnostic reference standard for selecting patients for HER2-targeted therapy is by analysis of tumor biopsies for HER2 expression and amplification. Previously patients were either defined as HER2-positive or negative, however, with approval of novel treatment options, specifically the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan, many breast cancer patients with tumors expressing low levels of HER2 and lacking HER2 amplification have become eligible for HER2-targeted therapy. Such patients will need to be reliably identified by suitable diagnostic methods. Biopsy-based diagnostics are invasive, and repeat biopsies are not always feasible. They cannot visualize heterogeneity of HER2 expression, leading to a substantial number of misdiagnosed patients. An alternative and highly accurate diagnostic method is mo-lecular imaging with radiotracers. In case of HER2, various studies demonstrate the clinical utility and feasibility of such approaches. Affibody-based radiotracers are clinically validated molecules with favorable characteristics for imaging. In this article we summarize the HER2-targeted therapeutic landscape, describe the experience with imaging diagnostics for HER2, and review the currently available clinical data on HER2-Affibody-based molecular imaging as novel diagnostic tool in breast cancer and beyond.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"599e90a2139437fc9ba72cb838bb89e5d249e856eb5979afdca2f85e51d184c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
