Many of the current drugs used to treat wounds have problems such as; allergies and drug resistance. Hence, the exploration of new therapeutic agents from natural origin may avert this problem. <i>Clerodendrum myricoides</i> have long been used to treat wounds in Ethiopia. Despite this, nothing has so far been reported about the wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity of <i>C</i>. <i>myricoides</i>. This study aimed to evaluate the wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity of 80% methanol extract and solvent fractions of <i>C</i>. <i>myricoides</i> leaves in mice.</p> Methods <p>Leaves of <i>C</i>. <i>myricoides</i> were extracted using the maceration technique. The extract was formulated as 5% and 10% w/w ointments. The wound healing activity of the extract was evaluated using excision, incision, and burn wound models whereas the healing activities of solvent fractions were evaluated using the excision wound model. A carrageenan-induced paw edema model was used for the anti-inflammatory test.</p> Results <p>In the dermal toxicity test, 2000 mg/kg of 10% extract was found to be safe. In excision and burn wound models, treatment with 10% and 5% extract showed a significant (p&lt;0.001) wound contraction. Solvent fractions of the extract significantly reduced wound contraction. A significant reduction in periods of epithelialization and favorable histopathology changes were shown by extract ointments. In incision wounds, 10% (p&lt;0.001) and 5% (p&lt;0.01) extracts significantly increase skin-breaking strength. After one hour of treatment, 400 mg/kg (p&lt;0.001) and 200 mg/kg (p&lt;0.05) showed significant reduction in paw edema.</p> Conclusion <p>Results of this study indicate that 80% methanol extract and the solvent fraction of the leaves of <i>C</i>. <i>myricoides</i> possess wound-healing and anti-inflammatory activity and support traditional claims.</p>","author":"Alemante Tafese Beyna","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c398349e4916b191af3ea3d538ecb1cc447aa937fdf93feb5686e4f150992d75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
