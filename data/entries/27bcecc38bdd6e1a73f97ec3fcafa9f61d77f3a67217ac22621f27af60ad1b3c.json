{"title":"Large Language Models in Healthcare Current Development and Future Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0923/v1","date":1720686018000,"content":"The rapid advancement of large language  models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has revolutionized  natural language processing, enabling these models to  generate coherent and contextually relevant text. These  capabilities hold significant potential for various  applications, particularly in the medical field. LLMs  can assist healthcare professionals by providing  accurate information, supporting diagnostic processes,  and enhancing medical education. However, the  implementation of LLMs in clinical settings faces  several barriers, including technical limitations, ethical  concerns, regulatory constraints, and practical  challenges. Ensuring accuracy, reliability, and  interpretability is crucial, along with addressing biases,  ensuring data privacy, and establishing ethical  guidelines. Future research should focus on improving  training techniques, developing explainable AI methods,  and creating efficient, resource-saving models.  Expanding applications through domain-specific  models and multi-modal integration can further unlock  the potential of LLMs. By addressing these challenges  and prioritizing responsible development, LLM  technology can be safely and effectively integrated into  various domains, driving innovation and improving  outcomes. This paper explores the current state of LLM  technology, its medical applications, barriers to implementation, and directions for future research and development","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27bcecc38bdd6e1a73f97ec3fcafa9f61d77f3a67217ac22621f27af60ad1b3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
