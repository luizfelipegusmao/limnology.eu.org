{"title":"H3K27 demethylase SsJMJ4 negatively regulates drought-stress responses in sugarcane","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/3040/7600491?rss=1","date":1706918400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sugarcane (<span>Saccharum</span> spp.), a leading sugar and energy crop, is seriously impacted by drought stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying sugarcane drought resistance, especially the functions of epigenetic regulators, remain elusive. Here, we show that a <span>S. spontaneum</span> KDM4/JHDM3 group JmjC protein, SsJMJ4, negatively regulates drought-stress responses through its H3K27me3 demethylase activity. Ectopic overexpression of <span>SsJMJ4</span> in Arabidopsis reduced drought resistance possibly by promoting expression of <span>AtWRKY54</span> and <span>AtWRKY70</span>, encoding two negative regulators of drought stress. SsJMJ4 directly bound to <span>AtWRKY54</span> and <span>AtWRKY70</span>, and reduced H3K27me3 levels at these loci to ensure their proper transcription under normal conditions. Drought stress down-regulated both transcription and protein abundance of SsJMJ4, which was correlated with the reduced occupancy of SsJMJ4 at <span>AtWRKY54</span> and <span>AtWRKY70</span> chromatin, increased H3K27me3 levels at these loci, as well as reduced transcription levels of these genes. In <span>S. spontaneum</span>, drought stress-repressed transcription of <span>SsWRKY122</span>, an ortholog of <span>AtWRKY54</span> and <span>AtWRKY70</span>, was associated with increased H3K27me3 levels at these loci. Transient overexpression of <span>SsJMJ4</span> in <span>S. spontaneum</span> protoplasts raised transcription of <span>SsWRKY122</span>, paralleled with reduced H3K27me3 levels at its loci. These results suggest that the SsJMJ4-mediated dynamic deposition of H3K27me3 is required for an appropriate response to drought stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0d4acb13c8445773bd4b048dfb28b7bfd3f319ed407a0cd8381f998a94bb5b6e","category":"Environment"}
