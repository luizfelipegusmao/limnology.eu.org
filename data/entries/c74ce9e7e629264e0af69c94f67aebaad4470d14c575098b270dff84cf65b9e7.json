Human–wildlife conflicts, particularly human–tiger conflicts (HTCs), have been a prevalent and severe issue in tiger-range countries from ancient times to the present day, with various regional characteristics. This article discusses human–tiger interactions in China, including different types of HTCs throughout history and the various measures implemented to promote human–tiger coexistence. Employing a historiographic approach, this study is based on case studies. It relies on historical documentation as its primary source, using methods such as literature analysis, digital humanities techniques, and field investigations. The results reveal various forms of direct negative human–tiger interactions, ranging from mild to intense HTCs, as well as other interactions such as tiger trade, medicinal use of tiger parts, and tiger habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and urbanization, all of which have led to reductions in tiger populations. Meanwhile, the study also identifies different conceptions and measures for human–tiger coexistence amidst conflicts, including animal protection and tiger worship in China's history, and modern conservation efforts such as the inclusion of tigers on protection lists, bans on tiger medicine and trade, and the establishment of nature reserves and national parks to protect tiger habitats.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>老虎（<i>Panthera tigris</i>）作为食物链顶端的捕食者，在维持其生态系统内的生态功能方面发挥着至关重要的作用。人类与野生动物的冲突，尤其是人虎冲突（HTCs），自古至今一直是老虎原产国普遍存在的严重问题，具有不同的区域性特征。本文探讨了中国的人虎互动情况，包括历史上不同类型的人虎冲突以及促进人虎共存的各种措施。该研究主要以历史文献作为主要资料来源，采用历史学方法，基于不同的案例研究进行综合分析，具体研究方法包括文献分析、数字人文技术和实地考察等。研究结果揭示了各种直接和间接的人虎冲突:直接人虎冲突包括一般性人虎相遇冲突和激烈的虎患冲突，间接人虎冲突包括虎产品贸易、虎产品药用、森林砍伐和城市化导致的虎栖息地丧失和破碎化等。这些消极的人虎互动导致了虎数量的减少。与此同时，本研究还探讨了在冲突中实现人虎共存的理念和措施，包括历史上的动物保护理念和虎崇拜现象，以及现代的保护措施，如将虎列入保护名单、禁止虎产品药用和虎产品贸易、设立自然保护区和国家公园来保护虎及其栖息地等【翻译: 曹志红】。</p>","author":"Zhihong Cao, \nYu Li, \nSaud uz Zafar, \nYi Wang, \nChuanping Nie","siteTitle":"Wiley: Integrative Conservation: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b2434e359c647f096191c4befea99097fa9394fd28e02b126976eb35d9219c03","entryHash":"c74ce9e7e629264e0af69c94f67aebaad4470d14c575098b270dff84cf65b9e7","category":"Environment"}
