{"title":"MUTARS Prosthesis in Patients with Bone Cancer of Lower Limb: A Narrative Review of Functional Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0248/v1","date":1714973768000,"content":"Limb-salvage surgery is the first choice for treatment of primary or metastatic bone tumors when possible to perform. Rehabilitation plays a major role after surgery, with the aim of improving function and maintaining the highest possible quality of life. Megaprostheses are currently the most frequent type of limb reconstruction used to treat the bone defect after tumor resection and The Modular Universal Tumor And Revision System (MUTARS®)is currently among the most used tumor and revision systems. Several studies have evaluated the causes and rate of failure of this system, but only few studies investigated the rehabilitative outcomes in terms of function and quality of daily life.\nThe aim of this narrative review is to explore the correlations between functional outcomes and quality of life after implant of MUTARS® prostheses surgery in patients with bone tumor of the lower extremities.\nA comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus using the following MESH terms: “MUTARS”, “Megaprosthesis”, “bone”, “tumors”, “metastasis”, “lower limb”, “rehabilitation”, “outcome”, “quality of life”, and 12 studies were included. The most frequent oncological pathology was found to be primitive bone tumors treated with modular prosthesis. Outcome measures used were Henderson et al classification, HHS, MSTS, VAS, ROM,LSR, KPS and quality of life questionnaire. Reconstruction of the lower limbs with the MUTARS® system seemed to be a valid treatment option after bone tumor resection. Rehabilitation after MUTARS® surgery is very relevant, but currently, functional and rehabilitative outcomes are inadequately represented in the literature. Therefore, further studies are needed to define best rehabilitation protocols in clinical practice after oncological orthopedic surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30e746fe992be2e24c4199a10d66152e93828d345b6c1021fa75fdaaf57c28dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
