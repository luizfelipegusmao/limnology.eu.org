{"title":"Convolutional Neural Network-Based ECG Signal Classification Model: A Study on Addressing Class Imbalance and Enhancing Model Interpretability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1290/v1","date":1716201730000,"content":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often criticized for their lack of transparency, acting as 'black boxes' in decision-making, a challenge compounded by class imbalance in ECG datasets, which limits their clinical application. This study introduces a CNN-based ECG signal classification model that enhances interpretability and addresses class imbalance through the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The model also integrates Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and SHAP value analysis, facilitating the visualization of decision boundaries and the assessment of feature contributions. Our evaluation using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database highlights the model's high performance, with accuracy and precision nearing 1.00 for Normal ECG (NOR), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), and Ventricular Premature Beat (PVC) in the six-class task. In the ten-class task, the model demonstrated robustness, particularly with an accuracy of 0.9846, precision of 0.9783, recall of 0.9736, and F1 score of 0.9760 in Pacemaker Fusion Beat (PFHB), supported by an AUC of 0.9999 and AP of 0.9885. These results underscore the model's efficacy in cardiac rhythm recognition and resilience to class imbalance. Future research will explore sophisticated model architectures and feature extraction methods to enhance the model's generalization and clinical applicability for early heart disease diagnosis and personalized treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3adc15dacf1ebbddc13465e9cdacbd11f4ccca0a51250c617ee032b364d7c14a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
