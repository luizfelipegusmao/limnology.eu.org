{"title":"Harnessing the Therapeutic Potential of Salvia spp. in Ameliorating Obesity: A Special Focus on Mechanistic Insights through Gut Microbiota Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1806/v1","date":1724684163000,"content":"Obesity looms large in the contemporary health landscape, extending its impact beyond physical appearance to influencing overall well-being. This slow intruder subtly weaves its influence through society, affecting individual health and presenting a significant public health dilemma. Beyond the visible weight gain, a web of interconnected health issues emerges, from cardiovascular complications to metabolic disorders, casting a pervasive shadow over the pursuit of a healthy, fulfilling life. In response to the escalating prevalence of obesity and its associated health complexities, there is a growing interest in swift weight management medications. However, current pharmacotherapies targeting crucial weight management pathways often fall short due to substantial side effects outweighing their benefits. Recently, plant extracts have emerged as potential regulators of lipid metabolism and obesity by influencing gut microbiota composition and abundance. This comprehensive review takes deep dive into the potential roles of Salvia spp. phytochemicals as health-promoting agents, with a specific focus on the anti-obesity properties of Salvia spp. by compiling a wealth of in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical studies. Drawing from the latest research, we unravel the potential of Salvia spp. by shedding light on their underlying mechanisms intertwined with gut microbiota dynamics. As scientific inquiry progresses, unraveling the intricate interplay between plant extracts, gut microbiota, and metabolic health holds tremendous promise for addressing the escalating global burden of obesity. This review is a humble attempt to provide a valuable synthesis of current knowledge, so as to pave the way for future advancements in pursuit of effective anti-obesity strategies for clinical interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab5a6673ec117986c0f8dcdd42d240776fb37e85d7866209b427ecad50482fa5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
