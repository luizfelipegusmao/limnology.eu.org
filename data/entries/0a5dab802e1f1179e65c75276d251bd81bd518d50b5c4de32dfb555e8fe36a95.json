{"title":"Case Study: Occupational Orthostatic Hypotension in Nepal: Prevalence, Causes, and Management in High-Risk Professions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0524/v1","date":1728338794000,"content":"Abstract: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a condition marked by a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing, resulting from impaired autonomic regulation of vascular tone and blood volume. This study investigates the prevalence, physiological mechanisms, and occupational risk factors for OH among high-risk professions in Nepal, such as traffic police, security guards, and shopkeepers. Using a cross-sectional design, participants were evaluated for blood pressure variability, autonomic function, and fluid balance. The findings reveal a high incidence of OH, linked to reduced baroreceptor sensitivity and impaired sympathetic activation due to prolonged standing and inadequate hydration. This study highlights the need for tailored clinical interventions and workplace modifications to mitigate OH in vulnerable occupational groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a5dab802e1f1179e65c75276d251bd81bd518d50b5c4de32dfb555e8fe36a95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
