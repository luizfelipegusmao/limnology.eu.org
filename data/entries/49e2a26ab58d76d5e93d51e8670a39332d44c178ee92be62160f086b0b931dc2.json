{"title":"Development and applications of somatic embryogenesis in grapevine (Vitis spp.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2073/v1","date":1724914188000,"content":"Somatic embryogenesis (SE) provides alternative methodologies for the propagation of grapevine (Vitis spp.) cultivars, conservation of its germplasm resources and for crop improvement. In this review, the current state of knowledge regarding grapevine SE as applied to these technologies is presented, with a focus on the benefits, challenges, and limitations of this method. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different steps involved in the grapevine SE process, including callus induction, maintenance of embryogenic cultures, and the production of plantlets. Additionally, the review explores development of high-health plant material through SE, the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying SE, including the regulation of gene expression, hormone signalling pathways, and metabolic pathways as well as its use in crop improvement programmes. The review concludes by highlighting the future directions for grapevine SE research, including the development of new and improved protocols, the integration of SE with other plant tissue culture techniques, and the application of SE for the production of elite grapevine cultivars, for the conservation of endangered grapevine species as well as for cultivars with unique traits that are valuable for breeding programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49e2a26ab58d76d5e93d51e8670a39332d44c178ee92be62160f086b0b931dc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
