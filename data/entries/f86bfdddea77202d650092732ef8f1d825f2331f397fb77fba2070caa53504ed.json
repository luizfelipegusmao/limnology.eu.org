{"title":"Development of an Injectable DNA Vaccine Against Aeromonas hydrophila Infection Nanoencapsulated With Poly(Lactic‐Co‐Glycolic) Acid (PLGA) in Common Carp","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/7270489?af=R","date":1729076693000,"content":"<p>In this study, we developed an injectable DNA vaccine targeting the aopB gene of <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i>, encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, for use in common carp. Juvenile common carp were divided into six groups with three replicates each. Groups A and B received intramuscular injections of the plasmid containing the target gene (pCDNA3.1-aopB) with or without encapsulation, respectively. Groups C and D received the plasmid lacking the target gene via the same route. Group E received PLGA, while Group F (control) received phosphate-buffered saline. Sampling occurred on days 0, 30, and 60, and hematological and immunological indices were compared among the groups. On day 60, all groups were challenged with <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i>, and cumulative mortality rates were assessed. Our results indicated successful detection of the target gene in various tissues of vaccinated fish. Notably, vaccinated groups exhibited a significant decrease in cumulative mortality (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Immunological indices, such as serum antibody titer and nonspecific immune responses, significantly improved in vaccinated groups, particularly those receiving the DNA vaccine with PLGA encapsulation (<i>p</i>  &lt; 0.05). Overall, the DNA vaccine, especially when nanoencapsulated with PLGA, demonstrated efficacy and immunogenicity against <i>A. Hydrophila</i> in common carp, suggesting its potential as a vaccination strategy against this infection. Further research could optimize its effectiveness and applicability.</p>","author":"Mojtaba Alishahi, \nHoda Lababian, \nHadi Heidari, \nMohammad Reza Tabandeh, \nMohammad Khosravi, \nChristyn Bailey","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"f86bfdddea77202d650092732ef8f1d825f2331f397fb77fba2070caa53504ed","category":"Environment"}
