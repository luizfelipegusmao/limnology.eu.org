{"title":"Combined Transcriptome and Metabolome Analysis of Chicken Follicles in China Tengchong Snow Chicken Follicle Selection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1196/v1","date":1729042591000,"content":"The development of pre-hierarchical follicle (PHF), especially small yellow follicles (SYFs), directly affects the recruitment of dominant follicles and thus affects the egg-laying performance of chickens. However, the development of PHF, especially the development of SYF, and its regulatory mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we performed transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of large white follicles (LWFs) and SYFs in chickens. Transcriptome sequencing revealed 258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SYF and LWF, of which 172 were upregulated and 86 were downregulated. The DEGs were mapped to 17 KEGG pathways, mainly the gap junction, calcium signaling, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways. The results of the metabolome analysis revealed 129 significant differential metabolites (DMs), including 36 upregulated DMs and 93 downregulated DMs. The DMs were mapped to 9 KEGG pathways for follicle tissue, which included mainly glutathione metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism, etc. The combined transcriptional and metabolic analysis revealed significantly enriched pathways, and four metabolically related pathways, including glutathione metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism, were identified. Glutathione metabolism is a critical signaling pathway that may affect ovarian follicle development to regulate the SYF reserve process in chickens. These results can act as a reference for improving the egg-laying performance of Tengchong snow chickens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6873016320f6c0bb31132368183dddab354af50f42aab0224d6235977777ad8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
