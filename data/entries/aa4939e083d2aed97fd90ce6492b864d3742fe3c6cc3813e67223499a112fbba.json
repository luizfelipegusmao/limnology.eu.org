{"title":"Leadership and Strategic Management: The Impact of Effective Leadership Skills on Organizational Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1484/v1","date":1726731559000,"content":"This paper is intended to correlate the impact of leadership skills on organizations' performance, all organizations grow differently, and their growth depends mostly on positive performance from one year to another which has direct correlations to the leadership dreams, visions, foresight and aspirations for the organization. There is one thing for the leader to have vision, but the leader needs to have followership to assist in implementing their vision to make it goals which translate to performance in the organization and growth. The leadership style or management skills greatly influence how they command and motivate followership to actualize their dreams or the organizational visions and mission which results in the organization's performance. A positive leadership influence produces or actualizes a positive organisational performance that will move the organization towards the vision of the organization. Knowing the difference between a manager and a leader is pertinent in explaining the correlation between leadership and organizational performance. The understanding of these two roles provides credence to the correlation between effective leadership and organisational performance, and the understanding of the term, the use and the importance of strategic management to leadership and organizational performance. There is a wide difference between managers and leaders, which is based on personality and their approach to the resolution of challenges they are confronted with.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa4939e083d2aed97fd90ce6492b864d3742fe3c6cc3813e67223499a112fbba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
