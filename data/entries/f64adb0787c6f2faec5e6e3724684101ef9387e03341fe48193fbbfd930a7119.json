{"title":"Application of CRISPR/Cas9 Technology in Rice Germplasm Innovation and Genetic Improvement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1114/v1","date":1728998806000,"content":"Improving the efficiency of germplasm innovation has always been the aim of rice breeders. Tra-ditional hybrid breeding methods for variety selection rarely meet the practical needs of rice pro-duction. The emergence of genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, provides a new approach to the genetic improvement of crops such as rice. The number of published scientific papers related to \"gene editing\" and \"CRISPR/Cas9\" retrievable in literature websites of China and other countries exhibited an increasing trend year by year from 2014 to 2023. The literature related to gene editing in rice accounts for 33.4% and 12.3% of all literature on crop gene editing published in China and other countries, respectively, much higher than those in maize and wheat. This article reviews the recent research on CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in rice, especially the germplasm innovation and genetic improvement of commercially promoted varieties with im-proved traits such as disease and insect resistance, herbicide resistance, salt tolerance, quality, nu-trition, and safety. The aim is to provide a reference for the precise and efficient development of new rice cultivars that meet market demand.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f64adb0787c6f2faec5e6e3724684101ef9387e03341fe48193fbbfd930a7119","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
