{"title":"Land Use Change and its Impacts on a Critical African Watershed: Lessons from the Ruhuhu River Sub-Basin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1106/v1","date":1721012043000,"content":"Background: Land use and land cover change (LULCC) in the Ruhuhu River Sub-Basin (RRSB), a crucial watershed within the Lake Nyasa Basin in Tanzania, poses a significant threat to water resource sustainability and ecological integrity. However, a lack of comprehensive data on long-term LULCC trends has hindered effective conservation efforts.\nMethods: This study utilized Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data within Google Earth Engine to quantify LULCC dynamics from 1990 to 2023. Six land cover classes were analyzed: water, forest, barren land, grassland, shrubland, and farmland.\nResults: Results revealed a substantial decline in forest cover (56.92% to 28.60%), primarily converted to farmland (2.99% to 20.22%). Shrubland expanded initially but then declined, while barren land steadily increased. These changes have profound implications for water resources, biodiversity, and ecosystem services within the RRSB and the broader Lake Nyasa Basin.\nConclusions: This research highlights the urgency of implementing sustainable land management practices to mitigate the adverse impacts of LULCC in the RRSB. The high classification accuracies achieved (90.9% to 98.7%) validate the robustness of the methodology. This study provides crucial insights for policymakers, land managers, and conservation practitioners, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to promote sustainable land use and ensure the long-term resilience of the RRSB ecosystem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5faa15cc6ef82e79b2d2b8b5b053fb69e9cd2428463ae7a91e6fa61faa65a99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
