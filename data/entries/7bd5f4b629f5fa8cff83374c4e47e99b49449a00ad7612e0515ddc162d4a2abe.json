{"title":"Phytochemical Profiles and Cytotoxic Activity of Bursera fagaroides Leaves and Its Callus Culture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0802/v1","date":1712821727000,"content":"Bursera fagaroides popularly used in México possess bioactive lignans. These compounds are low in the bark, and its extraction endangers the life of the trees. The aim of the present investigation was to search for alternative sources of cytotoxic compounds from B. fagaroides as leaves and in vitro callus cultures. The friable callus of B. fagaroides were established using a combination of phytoregulators: 4 mgL-1 of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 1 mgL-1 Naphthaleneacetic Acid (NAA) and 1 mgL-1 Zeatin. The maximum cell growth was at day 28 with a specific growth rate μ= 0.059 days-1 and duplication time td=11.8 days. Scopoletin with a concentration of 10.7 µg/g dry weight was the main compound inducible as a phytoalexin by the addition of high concentrations of 2,4-D, as well as by the absence of nutrients in the culture medium. The com-pounds γ-sitosterol, and stigmasterol were also present. Open column chromatography was used to separate and identify: yatein, acetyl podophyllotoxin and 7'8'-dehydropodophyllotoxin in the leaves of the wild plant. Cytotoxic activity on four cancer cell lines was tested, being PC-3 prostate carcinoma (IC50 of 12.6±4.6) the most sensitive to the wild-type plant extract and HeLa cervical carcinoma (IC50 of 72±5) to the callus culture extract.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bd5f4b629f5fa8cff83374c4e47e99b49449a00ad7612e0515ddc162d4a2abe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
