At the same time, matrix remodeling with increasing collagen cross-linking and architecture changes lead to enhanced viscoelasticity and stiffness, affecting cell–matrix interactions and propagation of fibrosis.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Metabolic dysfunction−associated liver disease (MASLD) and steatohepatitis (MASH) are becoming the most common causes of chronic liver disease in the United States and worldwide due to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. It is estimated that by 2030 close to 100 million people might be affected and patients with type 2 diabetes are especially at high risk. Twenty to 30% of patients with MASLD can progress to MASH, which is characterized by steatosis, necroinflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and in advanced cases, fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis. Clinically, it is recognized that disease progression in diabetic patients is accelerated and the role of various genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as cell–matrix interactions in fibrosis and stromal remodeling, have recently been recognized. While there has been great progress in drug development and clinical trials for MASLD/MASH, the complexity of these pathways highlights the need to improve diagnosis/early detection and develop more successful antifibrotic therapies that not only prevent but reverse fibrosis.</p>","author":"Weiguo Fan, \nToby M.
