{"title":"Exploring Antibiotics Use in Community: A Household-Based Survey Using the Drug Bag Method in Rural Burkina Faso","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0028/v1","date":1722568819000,"content":"In Burkina Faso, there is lack of awareness of antibiotics use at community level. In this study, we generate information on the commonly used antibiotics along with the reasons for which they have been used, in rural Burkina Faso. The ‘drug bag’ method, was employed to collect information from 423 households, in the health district of Nanoro. Descriptive analyses were performed using R software version 4.2.1. The number of self-reported antibiotic use on a regular basis was estimated at 3401 of which amoxicillin was reported 367 times (10.8 %), oxytetracycline was reported 288 times (8.5 %), ampicillin, 245 times (7.2 %), metronidazole, 239 times (7 %), and norfloxacin 223 times (6.6 %). Among the health complaints for which amoxicillin was used, wounds accounted for 28.5% (88/309) and gastrointestinal disorders 17.1% (53/309). For oxytetracycline, gastrointestinal disorders accounted for 57.1% (121/212) and wounds 22.64% (48/212). The study highlights the use of antibiotics for a range of health problems within the community, as well as antibiotics that appeared to of importance in people’s life. Further research is essential to elucidating the rationalities and logic reasoning underlying such use of antibiotics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e060f2bda78e5a415599f5001a580a8acad80c159e1488baa24e3b2017826a82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
