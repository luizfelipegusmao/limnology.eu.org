{"title":"Insights from tuberose farmers: A survey study in Jashore District, Bangladesh","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302841","date":1714744800000,"content":"<p>by Rabita Zaman, Abu Noman Faruq Ahmmed</p>\r\n\r\nTo obtain information on the cultivation of tuberoses in Bangladesh’s Jashore district, a study has been carried out to evaluate the economic and social standing of cultivators and examine the methods employed in production and farmers’ attitudes towards field disease. The majority of surveyed farmers were men, aged between 30 and 40 years. Only 7.41% had a high level of education, and most had less than five years of experience in tuberose cultivation. On an annual basis, the total production cost amounted to Tk. 27,200 (bigha/year), yielding a net profit of Tk. 1,20,000 (bigha/year). 31.48% of farmers expressed the belief that diseases affecting tuberose originated from contaminated planting materials. A significant proportion (64.81%) of farmers used PGR to combat diseases affecting tuberose production. Government Agriculture Officers played a crucial role in assisting farmers with knowledge and guidance. Yet, most participants highlighted that the key to preventing diseases lies in the effective application of pesticides. The findings of this study can guide policymakers in implementing measures to enhance tuberose production and fortify the floriculture industry in Bangladesh.","author":"Rabita Zaman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"37aa8983ca3830bcc0a88a9efbd744b024281d0173aab97695040134b2e36cfa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
