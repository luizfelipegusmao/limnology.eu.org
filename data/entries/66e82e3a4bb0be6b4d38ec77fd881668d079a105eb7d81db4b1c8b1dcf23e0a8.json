{"title":"PSVII-16 Recombinant bovine lactoferrin expressed in Schizochytrium sp. alleviates inflammation and oxidative damage in calf intestinal epithelial cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/620/7757577?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study aims to generate recombinant bovine lactoferrin (rbLF) by expressing it in <span>Schizochytrium sp.</span> (SZ) and evaluate its effects on calf intestinal epithelial cells (CIECs) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or hydrogen peroxide-induced damage. The bovine lactoferrin expression cassette was transfected into Schizochytrium <span>sp.</span> via 18s rRNA gene recombination. Primary CIECs were utilized in this investigation, and the optimal dose of rbLF was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 assay after being treated with different concentrations of rbLF for 24 h. The optimal dose of rbLF was then used as a medium supplement before or after 24 h of 80 μg/mL LPS challenge or 4 h of 400 μM of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) challenge. Cell viability, gene expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, toll-like receptor (TLR) -4, interleukin (IL) -17A, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and claudin-1, as well as protein levels of TNF-α, IL-17A, ZO-1, and claudin-1, were assessed to elucidate the preventive and therapeutic effects of rbLF. Data analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 by F-test, The statistical significance was declared at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. Results indicate that rbLF demonstrated no cytotoxicity within the 50 to 1,000 μg/mL range on CIECs. Treatment with 175 μg/mL rbLF for 24 h increased cell viability, expression, and protein concentrations of ZO-1 and claudin following hydrogen peroxide challenge (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, rbLF pretreatment for 24 hours, despite decreasing cell viability after the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> challenge, increased the expression and protein concentrations of ZO-1 and claudin-1 compared with non-rbLF-treated groups (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). When used to prevent LPS-induced inflammation, rbLF enhanced the gene expression and protein concentrations of TNF-α, ZO-1, and claudin-1 compared with controls (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). As a treatment for LPS-induced inflammation, rbLF decreased TLR4, TNF-α, and IL-17A expression levels (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that SZ-expressed rbLF is safe for calve intestinal cells and 175 μg/mL of rbLF may mitigate inflammation-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"66e82e3a4bb0be6b4d38ec77fd881668d079a105eb7d81db4b1c8b1dcf23e0a8","category":"Environment"}
