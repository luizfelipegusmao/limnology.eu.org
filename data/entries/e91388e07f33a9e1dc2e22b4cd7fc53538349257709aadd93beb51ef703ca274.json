{"title":"Eco-friendly hotels and guesthouses as a new opportunity for resilience and sustainability: Evidence from the Czech Republic","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301936","date":1714399200000,"content":"<p>by Pavla Vrabcová, Petr Scholz, Ivica Linderová, Hana Kotoučková</p>\r\n\r\nThe economic recovery of the tourism industry after the Covid-19 pandemic to find modern and efficient trends to increase profitability is accompanied by the adoption of comprehensive accommodation approaches towards resilience and environmental sustainability. The research aims at the application of environmental management elements and measures in all types of accommodation facilities in the Czech Republic (<i>n</i><sub>1</sub> = 1,016). A qualitative focus group method complemented the quantitative research using correspondence analysis, Levene’s, Kruskal-Wallis, and Tukey’s HSD tests (<i>n</i><sub>2</sub> = 9 + moderator). The results indicate that the differences in the number of environmental measures implemented were minimal for the monitored hotels and guesthouses. On the other hand, the star rating of accommodation facilities is not a key parameter in the environmental impact assessment. The most used environmental measures were devices reducing electricity consumption (hotels 94%, guesthouses 94%), separating waste (hotels 88%, guesthouses 89%), and water consumption reduction (hotels 85%, guesthouses 86%). At the same time, the most minor used were measures reducing chemical consumption (hotels 23%, guesthouses 22%) communication and environmental education of employees and guests (hotels 32%, guesthouses 18%).","author":"Pavla Vrabcová","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e91388e07f33a9e1dc2e22b4cd7fc53538349257709aadd93beb51ef703ca274","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
