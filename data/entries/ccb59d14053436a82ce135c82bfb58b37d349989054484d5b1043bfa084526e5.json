{"title":"Effect of the Complex Allele p.[Ile148Thr;Ile1023_Val1024del] 2 in Cystic Fibrosis and Tracing of a Founder Effect in Mexican 3 Families","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0256/v1","date":1727950265000,"content":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis can be a challenge due to the large spectrum of pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene and the effects of complex alleles. Next-generation sequencing has improved our understanding of the contribution of these complex alleles to the wide spectrum of CF clinical symptoms and to the response to medications. Herein, we studied nine CF patients from six unrelated families carrying the complex allele p.[Ile148Thr;Ile1023_Val1024del] with a frequency of 0.18%. All the patients were from Central Mexico. This complex allele was found in trans with Class I and II pathogenic variants (PVs) such as [c.1521_1523del, p.(Phe508del), and  c.3231_3232del, p.(Phe1078Profs*77)]. A targeted search of a dataset of 2,217 exomes from healthy individuals revealed that eight individuals (0.18%) carried the p.(Ile148Thr) variant, but only one (0.022%), who was also born in Central Mexico, was a carrier of the complex allele. These findings led us to hypothesize a founder effect for the p.[Ile148Thr;Ile1023_Val1024del] complex allele in Mexican patients with CF, probably through migration from the French-Canadian population in Mexico. Finally, protein modeling revealed that this complex allele disrupts the secondary structure of the CFTR protein and might alter the ion flow.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccb59d14053436a82ce135c82bfb58b37d349989054484d5b1043bfa084526e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
