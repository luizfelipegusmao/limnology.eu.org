{"title":"Diospyros kaki Alcoholic Extract Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0887/v1","date":1728645940000,"content":"Diospyros kaki, the most widely cultivated species of persimmon, has been long used in traditional medicine since its leaves extracts contain high amounts of flavonoids and terpenoids, endowed with potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic and antimicrobial effects. Re-cently, many in vitro and in vivo studies have assessed different potential health benefits of per-simmon leaves; however, its anticancer activity towards colorectal cancer (CRC), the second deadliest cancer in Western countries, has not been investigated in depth. Since CRC current therapies are associated with serious side effects and show no efficacy towards patients carrying RAS/BRAF mutations, the search for new and more effective therapies has turned to plant extracts, which could help reduce conventional drugs dosages and toxicity. The effect of Diospyros kaki al-coholic extract has been investigated on E705 CRC cell line, representative of most CRC patients, and on SW480 cells, carrying a KRAS activating mutation. This extract is effective in reducing tumor cells viability, without affecting the healthy mucosa cell line CCD 841, and it triggers apoptosis in CRC cells, by disrupting mitochondrial functionality and increasing oxidative stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f51ae17045d43977bb271b523751563f8fdf58e261494cc3fe00e1797b319e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
