{"title":"Determination of the protein value of novel poultry meal ingredients for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13098?af=R","date":1728722048000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The aim of this study was to assess the digestible protein value of three novel poultry products (Pea/Lentil-PM, Hen on Hen-PM, and soybean meal (SBM)-PM), then a growth trial with a 2 × 5 design was conducted where SBM-PM was included at five levels: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30% in both a fish meal (FM)-based diet and a plant protein (PP)-based diet. Thirty rainbow trout (initial size = 10.7 ± 0.15 g; Troutlodge Inc, Sumner, WA) per tank were stocked into a 15°C recirculating system. Fish in triplicate tanks were fed twice daily to apparent satiation for 12 weeks. SBM-PM had no effect on final weight (<i>p</i> = 0.3665; FM 233 vs. PP 237) or growth rate (<i>p</i> = 0.4703; FM 2070% vs. PP 2097%). Significant interactions between dietary protein and SBM-PM for both intake (<i>p</i> = 0.0080) and FCR (<i>p</i> = 0.0081) indicate increased intake of fish fed the plant protein-based diet without SBM-PM. Regression modeling of this effect yields a polynomial model with an R-square of 0.78; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001 explained by the relationships: PlantFCR=0.875−0.0087Inclusion+0.00062Inclusion2$$ Plant\\  FCR=0.875-0.0087\\  Inclusion+0.00062\\ {Inclusion}^2 $$ and Plant intake=2.02−0.02Inclusion+0.0014Inclusion2$$ Plant\\ intake=2.02-0.02\\  Inclusion+0.0014\\ {Inclusion}^2 $$, respectively. These values suggest that the SBM-PM can be included up to 30% in rainbow trout feeds to reduce feed costs without negatively impacting performance.</p>","author":"Wendy M. Sealey, \nT.
