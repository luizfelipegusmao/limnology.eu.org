A xylanase/cellulase enzyme product (ENZ) was previously shown to increase the digestibility of nutrients and energy in growing pigs fed a corn-SBM diet with 30% corn dried distiller’s grains with solubles (cDDGS). To better elucidate the effects of ENZ on these components, further analysis was conducted on the fiber, non-starch polysaccharide, and ash components. A total of 12 ileal-cannulated pigs [initial body weight (BW) = 31.7 kg ± 3.04] were housed in individual metabolic crates for 21 d (period 1) and subsequently transferred to individual floor pens for an additional 28 d (period 2). These animals were assigned to 2 diets (n = 6) in a completely randomized design (CRD). The diets contained the main ingredients corn, soybean meal and cDDGS (30%) without (CON) or with ENZ supplementation. The inclusion rate of the ENZ (proprietary xylanase/cellulase product, Kerry Inc.) was 200 g/ton. Feed was formulated to 1.15% SID lysine and met or exceeded nutrient requirements for growing pigs (NRC, 2012). The diets were fed to pigs at three times maintenance energy requirement based on BW, which was assessed at 2 wk intervals throughout the study. The diets contained 0.3% titanium dioxide as an indigestible marker. In period 1, pigs had 14 d of adaptation, followed by 4 d of fecal and urine collection using the total collection method and 2 d of ileal digesta collection. In period 2, pigs had 23 days of adaptation, followed by 2 d of fecal collection and 2 d of ileal digesta collection. Data were analyzed as a CRD, using pig as the experimental unit and enzyme supplementation as the main effect. The ATTD of total NSP and galactose tended to improve in both periods 1 and 2. As consistent responses were observed in periods 1 and 2 and the ENZ X period interaction was not significant, the data from these time periods were combined for analysis. ENZ supplementation improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the ATTD of total NSP and galactose. Also, ENZ tended to improve (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) the ATTD of cellulose and glucose from NSP. ENZ addition also increased the ATTD of calcium (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) and tended to increase the ATTD of phosphorus (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10). In conclusion, supplementation of a corn-SBM-30% cDDGS diet with a multi-carbohydrase containing cellulase increased the ATTD of fiber, NSP and calcium in growing pigs. Novel enzymes represent a useful strategy to better utilize the nutrients in lower energy feedstuffs in monogastric animals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"330bd6e3a76110e4dd8bce3aa9edbb62c259a03a76bce6f67f74b86d24e699ea","category":"Environment"}
