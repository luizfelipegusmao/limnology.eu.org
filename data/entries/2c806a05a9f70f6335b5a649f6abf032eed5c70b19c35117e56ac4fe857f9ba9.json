{"title":"The Long-Term Effects of Using Placebo in Asthma Treatments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1395/v1","date":1726652351000,"content":"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by hyperreactivity in the airways, which can lead to significant lung damage if not properly managed. While placebos—medications with no active therapeutic ingredients—are sometimes used in clinical trials to gauge the effectiveness of asthma treatments, their long-term use raises concerns. Placebos work primarily through psychological mechanisms by enhancing patients’ expectations of treatment. However, prolonged reliance on placebo treatment in asthma could potentially mask symptoms, delay proper management, and lead to undetected lung damage or other adverse effects. This study explores the potential risks and consequences associated with long-term placebo use in asthma management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c806a05a9f70f6335b5a649f6abf032eed5c70b19c35117e56ac4fe857f9ba9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
