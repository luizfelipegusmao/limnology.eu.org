{"title":"Effects of Vibroacoustic Stimulation on Psychological, Physiological and Cognitive Stress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0171/v1","date":1717507618000,"content":"Global stress is widespread in todays post-pandemic world of political and economic uncertainty. Vibroacoustic technology is a vibrotactile intervention with multiple uses, and its impact on stress lacks interpretation. This research assessed if the vibroacoustic technology of a Vibroacoustic Sound Massage (VSM) can reduce psychological, physiological and cognitive stress. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) biosignals were used to quantify results. Participants were divided into Low Stress and High Stress groups. ECG results show VSM increased parasympathetic activity for all participants, with the Low Stress group more effected. EEG results indicate increased concentration (TBR), reduced arousal and increased relaxation (BAR), and non-significant effects on participant well-being (FAA), though variability in this metric was homogenised after VSM. Together, these results validate VSM as an effective support tool for stress management and further research is required.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52afba78ea7369636f4c1ddd97605bb07ebec6e5a6e1adb5bd71d7bbfa4edbb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
