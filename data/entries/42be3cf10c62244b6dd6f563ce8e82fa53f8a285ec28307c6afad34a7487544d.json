{"title":"Case Report: Molecular analyses of cell cycle-related genes in cortical brain tissue of a Rasmussen Encephalitis patient","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1985/v1","date":1719577088000,"content":": Rasmussen’s encephalitis (RE) stands as a rare neurological disorder marked by progressive cerebral hemiatrophy and epilepsy resistant to medical treatment. Despite extensive study, the primary cause of RE remains elusive, while its histopathological features encompass cortical inflammation, neuronal degeneration, and gliosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms driving disease progression remain largely unexplored. In this case study, we present a patient with RE who underwent hemispherectomy and has remained seizure-free for over six months, experiencing gradual motor improvement. Further-more, we conducted molecular analysis on the excised brain tissue, unveiling a decrease in the expres-sion of cell cycle-associated genes coupled with elevated levels of BDNF and TNF-α proteins. These findings suggest potential involvement of cell cycle regulators in the progression of RE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42be3cf10c62244b6dd6f563ce8e82fa53f8a285ec28307c6afad34a7487544d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
