{"title":"Development and Content Validation of a Clinical Screening Scale to Identify Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Considering the Gender Perspective: An eDelphi Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1415/v1","date":1718871823000,"content":"Background: Although many studies analyse gender differences in the clinical expression of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and prevalence studies show that girls with ADHD are underdiagnosed, there are no instruments that are sensitive to the detection of girls with ADHD.\nObjective: The objective of this study is to develop a self-report early detection instrument for ADHD for boys and girls aged 7 to 16, which includes the gender perspective and is sensitive to the detection of girls with ADHD.\nMethods: The development of the scale and the items that comprise it were created from the thematic analysis of ADHD and its evaluation in children, based on the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5-TR. A modified e-Delphi method involving a three-round web survey was used to reach a consensus on the content of the scale. Ten experts were recruited into a professional panel. The panel members were asked to assess the differential symptomatology of ADHD in boys and girls, the dimensions to be evaluated, and the importance of the scale items to evaluate the content.\nResults: Consensus was reached regarding 13 total items distributed in three dimensions: Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, and a third dimension, Internalisation, which includes symptoms most present in the expression of ADHD in girls.\nConclusions: To the best of our knowledge, the development of this scale using the Delphi method is the first specific scale for identifying ADHD that addresses the gender perspective and the differential symptomatology between boys and girls. Although we must proceed to the analysis of the psychometric properties, we can anticipate that this scale will provide relevant and reliable information for the identification of ADHD in both boys and girls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07d8f22fe58e72570331d81f592a6aaee8291d11401af0dfd4c0ecfe9846e288","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
