{"title":"Preparation and Characteristics of Ball-Milled Blueberry Peel Particles and Their Application in Ice Cream","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1218/v1","date":1729087033000,"content":"Ice cream is popular but contains high amounts of saturated fats and few health-promoting ingredients. In the presence of xanthan gum (0.25%), the blueberry peel particles prepared through ball-milling treatment (BMP) were used to prepare ice cream containing camellia oil as a fat replacer. BMP possessed smaller particle sizes, larger contact angles, and higher contents of anthocyanin aglycone, as compared with commonly-milled blueberry peel particles. BMP with the smallest D[4,3] value (about 10 μm) and the largest contact angle (66.30°) were obtained by ball-milling the blueberry peel at 15 Hz for 6 h (BMP15 Hz 6 h). The ice cream mixes were depicted as linear viscoelastic gel-like solids, and their apparent viscosity, G′ and G′ increased with the increase in BMP15 Hz 6 h concentrations. Ice cream with strong antioxidant activity and good freeze-thaw stability was acceptable and desirable in the presence of less than 0.5% BMP15 Hz 6 h.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d46b5330497ba393c5fa3d9b0ac6a3c3540eb78ad7b42a43e32992143ad08022","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
