{"title":"Leveraging VR for the Visualization of Non-Observable Electrical Circuits Principles in Engineering Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2050/v1","date":1717069167000,"content":"As technology advances, the field of electrical and computer engineering continuously demands the introduction of innovative new tools and methodologies to facilitate effective learning and comprehension of fundamental concepts. This research addresses an identified gap in technology-augmented education capabilities and researches the integration of Virtual Reality (VR) technology with real-time electronic circuit simulation to enable and enhance the visualization of non-observable concepts such as voltage distribution and current flow within these circuits. In this paper, we describe the development of our immersive educational platform, which makes understanding these abstract concepts intuitive and engaging. This research also involved the design and development of a VR-based circuit simulation environment. By leveraging VRâ€™s immersive capabilities, our system enables users to physically interact with electronic components, observe the flow of electrical signals, and manipulate circuit parameters in real-time. Through this immersive experience, learners can gain a deeper understanding of fundamental electronic principles, transcending the limitations of traditional two-dimensional diagrams and equations. Furthermore, this research focuses on the implementation of advanced and novel visualization techniques within the VR environment for non-observable electrical and electromagnetic properties, providing users with a clearer and more intuitive understanding of electrical circuit concepts. Examples include color-coded pathways for current flow and dynamic voltage gradient visualization. Additionally, real-time data representation and graphical overlays are researched and integrated to offer users insights into the dynamic behavior of circuits, allowing for better analysis and troubleshooting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b9500582f624b3ccae7877883bc92c9e8aa9ed5f578f6a50319fc8977e8a686","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
