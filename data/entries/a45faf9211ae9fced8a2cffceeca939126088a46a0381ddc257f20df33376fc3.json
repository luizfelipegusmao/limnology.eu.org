{"title":"Mitigating Endemic COVID-19 Risks in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and Kidney Transplantation: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1292/v1","date":1716217281000,"content":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing dialysis or kidney transplantation, face ongoing challenges in relation to the risk of COVID-19. In addition to their underlying condition, factors such as immune-evasive variants, immunosuppressive therapies, and the need for dialysis contribute to poor COVID-19 outcomes in this population. Severe COVID-19 can lead to the deterioration of CKD/ESKD, resulting in acute kidney injury, septic shock, and respiratory failure. Moreover, patients with CKD/ESKD have shown impaired response to COVID-19 vaccination, with seroconversion failures associated with the burden of immunosuppressive treatments, further heightening their vulnerability to severe disease. Despite the current endemic, it is crucial to acknowledge the ongoing significance of COVID-19 as a serious threat to patients burdened with chronic diseases like CKD and ESRD. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on these patients is essential, as they remain at risk of severe disease progression. This paper presents the results of a literature review to enhance our understanding of COVID-19-related risks in patients with CKD/ESKD. Expert insights and illustrative scenarios provide practical perspectives and highlight the importance of risk stratification based on clinical factors for guiding targeted measures and treatments to mitigate COVID-19 risks in these vulnerable patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a45faf9211ae9fced8a2cffceeca939126088a46a0381ddc257f20df33376fc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
