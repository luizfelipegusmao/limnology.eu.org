Insect phenology is tightly linked to developmental timing, which is regulated by environmental temperatures. However, the degree to which the effects of developmental temperatures extend across developmental stages and their inter-stage relationships have not been thoroughly quantified in mosquitoes. Here, we used the mosquito <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, which is an aggressive invasive species and an arboviral vector, to study how developmental temperature influences fitness across developmental stages, thermal traits, energy reserves, transcriptome and <i>Wolbachia</i> prevalence in laboratory-reared populations originally collected from either temperate or tropical regions. We show that hatchability, larval and pupal viability and developmental speed are strongly influenced by temperature, and these effects extend to wing length, body mass, longevity and content of water, protein and lipids in adults in a population-specific manner. On the contrary, neither adult thermal preference nor heat resistance significantly change with temperature. <i>Wolbachia</i> density was generally lower in adult mosquitoes reared at 18°C than at other tested temperatures, and transcriptome analysis showed enrichment for functions linked to stress responses (i.e. cuticle proteins and chitin, cytochrome p450 and heat shock proteins) in mosquitoes reared at both 18 and 32°C. Our data showed an overall reduced vector fitness performance when mosquitoes were reared at 32°C, and the absence of isomorphy in the relationship between developmental stages and temperature in the laboratory population deriving from larvae collected in northern Italy. Altogether, these results have important implications for reliable model projections of the invasion potentials of <i>Ae. albopictus</i> and its epidemiological impact.</p>","author":"Martina Carlassara, \nAyda Khorramnejad, \nHelen Oker, \nRomina Bahrami, \nAlejandro Nabor Lozada‐Chávez, \nMaria Vittoria Mancini, \nStefano Quaranta, \nMélanie J.
