Insects can climb a wide variety of surfaces using their specialized footpads, which stick and unstick with each step. The way they achieve this reversible adhesion is through a compliant adhesive pad that secretes a complex liquid. We combine in vivo observations with mathematical modelling to understand the elastocapillary adhesion of stick insects.\n\n</p><br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Scientific progress within the last few decades has revealed the functional morphology of an insect's sticky footpads—a compliant pad that secretes thin liquid films. However, the physico-chemical mechanisms underlying their adhesion remain elusive. Here, we explore these underlying mechanisms by simultaneously measuring adhesive force and contact geometry of the adhesive footpads of live, tethered Indian stick insects, <i>Carausius morosus</i>, spanning more than two orders of magnitude in body mass. We find that the adhesive force we measure is similar to the previous measurements that use a centrifuge. Our measurements afford us the opportunity to directly probe the adhesive stress in vivo and use existing theory on capillary adhesion to predict the surface tension of the secreted liquid and compare it to previous assumptions. From our predictions, we find that the surface tension required to generate the adhesive stresses we observed ranges between 0.68 and 12 mN m−1${\\rm m}^{-1}$. The low surface tension of the liquid would enhance the wetting of the stick insect's footpads and promote their ability to conform to various substrates. Our insights may inform the biomimetic design of capillary-based, reversible adhesives and motivate future studies on the physico-chemical properties of the secreted liquid.</p>","author":"Guillermo J.
