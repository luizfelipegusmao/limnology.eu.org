{"title":"Uncovering the Dynamic Drivers of Floods Through Interpretable Deep Learning","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004751?af=R","date":1729500605000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The formation of floods, as a complex physical process, exhibits dynamic changes in its driving factors over time and space under climate change. Due to the black-box nature of deep learning, its use alone does not enhance understanding of hydrological processes. The challenge lies in employing deep learning to uncover new knowledge on flood formation mechanism. This study proposes an interpretable framework for deep learning flood modeling that employs interpretability techniques to elucidate the inner workings of a peak-sensitive Informer, revealing the dynamic response of floods to driving factors in 482 watersheds across the United States. Accurate simulation is a prerequisite for interpretability techniques to provide reliable information. The study reveals that comparing the Informer with Transformer and LSTM, the former showed superior performance in peak flood simulation (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency over 0.6 in 70% of watersheds). By interpreting Informer's decision-making process, three primary flood-inducing patterns were identified: Precipitation, excess soil water, and snowmelt. The controlling effect of dominant factors is regional, and their impact on floods in time steps shows significant differences, challenging the traditional understanding that variables closer to the timing of flood event occurrence have a greater impact. Over 40% of watersheds exhibited shifts in dominant driving factors between 1981 and 2020, with precipitation-dominated watersheds undergoing more significant changes, corroborating climate change responses. Additionally, the study unveils the interplay and dynamic shifts among variables. These findings suggest that interpretable deep learning, through reverse deduction, transforms data-driven models from merely fitting nonlinear relationships to effective tools for enhancing understanding of hydrological characteristics.</p>","author":"Yuanhao Xu, \nKairong Lin, \nCaihong Hu, \nXiaohong Chen, \nJingwen Zhang, \nMingzhong Xiao, \nChong‚ÄêYu Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"d58f115eaa04dcaa3270dd75d049aad2d0e55572b3585d52c78706861e4cb116","category":"Environment"}
