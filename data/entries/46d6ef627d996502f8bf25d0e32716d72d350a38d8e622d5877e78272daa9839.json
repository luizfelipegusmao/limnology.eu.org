{"title":"Photosynthetic control at the cytochrome b6f complex","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4065/7658668?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Photosynthetic control (PCON) is a protective mechanism that prevents light-induced damage to PSI by ensuring the rate of NADPH and ATP production via linear electron transfer (LET) is balanced by their consumption in the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation reactions. Protection of PSI is a priority for plants since they lack a dedicated rapid-repair cycle for this complex, meaning that any damage leads to prolonged photoinhibition and decreased growth. The imbalance between LET and the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation reactions is sensed at the level of the transthylakoid ΔpH, which increases when light is in excess. The canonical mechanism of PCON involves feedback control by ΔpH on the plastoquinol oxidation step of LET at cytochrome <span>b</span><sub>6</sub><span>f</span>. PCON thereby maintains the PSI special pair chlorophylls (P700) in an oxidized state, which allows excess electrons unused in the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation reactions to be safely quenched via charge recombination. In this review we focus on angiosperms, consider how photo-oxidative damage to PSI comes about, explore the consequences of PSI photoinhibition on photosynthesis and growth, discuss recent progress in understanding PCON regulation, and finally consider the prospects for its future manipulation in crop plants to improve photosynthetic efficiency.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"46d6ef627d996502f8bf25d0e32716d72d350a38d8e622d5877e78272daa9839","category":"Environment"}
