{"title":"Evaluation of Solid Phase Joining Using Friction Stir Welding Technique between Aluminum 6061 and \nPolymer-Based Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2044/v1","date":1724943500000,"content":"Solid-phase joining is a technique used to fuse two materials by applying heat and pressure, causing plastic deformation without reaching the melting point. This method is applicable for similar and dissimilar materials, including metals, polymers, and ceramics, without the need for filler material. Among the various methods, Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is preferred for joining dissimilar materials due to its solid-state process, which enhances mechanical properties, metallurgical compatibility, and reduces distortion. FSW is particularly effective for materials with significant differences in melting points. The current project focuses on assessing the strength and mechanical properties of FSW joints between aluminum and polymer-based composites. FSW was selected for its ability to produce fine-grained, strong welds free from fusion-related defects such as porosity and cracks. Applications in sectors like automotive, aerospace, and shipbuilding are explored, with impact, hardness, and tensile tests conducted to evaluate joint performance. This comprehensive study includes literature review, fabrication, testing, and tool design to ensure a thorough understanding of dissimilar joint properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4991eb2ba14e3c865c4a431304acc13176de071df1e11dc270e6570b11195eb1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
