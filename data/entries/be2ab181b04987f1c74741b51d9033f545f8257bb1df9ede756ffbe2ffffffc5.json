In materials science, for instance, understanding the characteristics of particle sizes, shapes, and crystal structures facilitates the design of new materials and enhances existing ones. In the case of catalysts, particle size changes due to poisoning can lead to a decrease in active surface area, resulting in lower catalytic activity and slower reaction rates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"be2ab181b04987f1c74741b51d9033f545f8257bb1df9ede756ffbe2ffffffc5","category":"Environment"}
