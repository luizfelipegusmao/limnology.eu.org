They contain proteins and membranous materials injected directly into the host cells, participating in parasitophorous vacuole formation. <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> tachyzoites harbor 8 to 12 rhoptries, 2 of which are docked to an apical vesicle (AV), a central element associated with a rhoptry secretory apparatus prior to injection into the host cell. This parasite is also equipped with 5 to 6 microtubule-associated vesicles, presumably serving as AV replenishment for iterative rhoptry discharge. Here, we characterized a rhoptry protein, rhoptry discharge factor 3 (RDF3), crucial for rhoptry discharge and invasion. RDF3 enters the secretory pathway, localizing near the AV and associated with the rhoptry bulb. Upon invasion, RDF3 dynamically delocalizes, suggesting a critical role at the time of rhoptry discharge. Cryo-electron tomography analysis of RDF3-depleted parasites reveals irregularity in microtubule-associated vesicles morphology, presumably impacting on their preparedness to function as an AV. Our findings suggest that RDF3 is priming the microtubule-associated vesicles for rhoptry discharge by a mechanism distinct from the rhoptry secretory apparatus contribution.","author":"Rouaa Ben Chaabene","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"6130bb26b6d024bb04931aade326819aaf2e827edab32ed03beb4e9bd8642446","category":"Environment"}
