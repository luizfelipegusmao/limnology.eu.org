{"title":"Assessment of cellular senescence potential of PM2.5 using 3D human lung fibroblast spheroids in vitro model","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae037/7630120?rss=1","date":1710460800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Epidemiological studies demonstrate that particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exposure closely related to chronic respiratory diseases. Cellular senescence plays an important role in many diseases. However, it is not fully clear whether PM2.5 exposure could induce cellular senescence in the human lung. In this study, we generated a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid model using isolated primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) to investigate the effects of PM2.5 on cellular senescence at the 3D level.<div>Methods</div>3D spheroids were exposed to 25-100 μg/ml of PM2.5 in order to evaluate the impact on cellular senescence. SA-β-galactosidase activity, cell proliferation, and the expression of key genes and proteins were detected.<div>Results</div>Exposure of the HLF spheroids to PM2.5 yielded a more sensitive cytotoxicity than 2D HLF cell culture. Importantly, PM2.5 exposure induced the rapid progression of cellular senescence in 3D HLF spheroids, with a dramatically increased SA-β-Gal activity. In exploiting the mechanism underlying the effect of PM2.5 on senescence, we found a significant increase of DNA damage, upregulation of p21 protein levels, and suppression of cell proliferation in PM2.5-treated HLF spheroids. Moreover, PM2.5 exposure created a significant inflammatory response, which may be at least partially associated with the activation of TGF-β1/Smad3 axis and HMGB1 pathway.<div>Conclusions</div>Our results indicate that PM2.5 could induce DNA damage, inflammation, and cellular senescence in 3D HLF spheroids, which may provide a new evidence for PM2.5 toxicity based on a 3D model which has been shown to be more <span>in vivo</span>-like in their phenotype and physiology than 2D cultures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"acd6d0872e68aef56292f306ae7307ff81074a830b81f994ef913d61f0d0ad74","category":"Environment"}
