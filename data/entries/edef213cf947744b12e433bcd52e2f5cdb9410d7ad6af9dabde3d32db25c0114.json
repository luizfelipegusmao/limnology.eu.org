{"title":"Transorbital Alternating Current Stimulation in Glaucoma: From Neurophisiological Bases to Clinical Practice. A Clinical Review.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1250/v1","date":1721117461000,"content":"Recovery after visual loss is a key goal of neuroscience and treatments able to improve visual function are still largely lacking. Glaucoma, one of the leading causes of visual disability in the world, is usually associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) but a subset of “normal tension glaucoma” patients develops damage without ever manifesting high IOP. Sometimes, even in patients with a good control of IOP, the retinal ganglion cell degeneration can progress forward the blindness. Moreover usually the damage already caused by the disease remains. These considerations underline the needs to find new effective treatments and solution to add to the standard ones. In this paper, we expose the most important data supporting the use of alternating current stimulation, a relatively new option for treating low vision, in glaucoma including the theoretical bases of this approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edef213cf947744b12e433bcd52e2f5cdb9410d7ad6af9dabde3d32db25c0114","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
