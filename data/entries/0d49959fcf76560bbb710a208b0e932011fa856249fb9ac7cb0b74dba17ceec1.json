{"title":"Antibacterial, Antiviral and anti-biofilm Materials Evaluation Standards from the Viewpoint of Surface Science and Surface Engineering","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0664/v1","date":1712654754000,"content":": Since the COVID-19 pandemic, people have become aware that materials (products) can transmit infection and have begun to focus on questions such as how bacteria and germs, the sources of in-fection, maintain their infectivity on material surfaces, and the extent to which materials can or cannot prevent this. and to what extent materials can and cannot prevent it. The SIAA, a non-profit organization of many Japanese companies, had created an entirely separate interna-tional standard for materials' antibacterial, antiviral, and antibiofilm properties (products). The authors have studied the academic basis for the operation of the standards and were deeply in-volved as researchers in establishing one of the standards.  This paper describes the interna-tional standards and some representative examples of the authors' actual use of these standards and explains the current status and future problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d49959fcf76560bbb710a208b0e932011fa856249fb9ac7cb0b74dba17ceec1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
