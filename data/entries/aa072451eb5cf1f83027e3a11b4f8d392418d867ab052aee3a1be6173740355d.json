{"title":"Efficient Hydroxyapatite Extraction From Salmon Bone Waste: An Improved Lab-Scaled Physico-Chemico-Biological Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202311.1090/v2","date":1720514848000,"content":"Salmon aquaculture generates a substantial volume of waste material, offering potential for biomaterial production. This industry produces significant waste, which can be repurposed for various biological applications, particularly in biomaterial production for tissue engineering with pertinent applications in osteo-conduction, osteo-induction, and clinical/surgical bone regeneration and repair. The process involves a standardized pre-treatment stage aimed at minimizing biological waste content. Subsequently, the treatment stage, contingent on the chosen methodology, facilitates the removal of proteins, lipids, molecules, and other compounds, leaving the mineral phase as a valuable substrate. The selection of the optimal method, whether alkaline hydrolysis, calcination, or NaOH hydrolysis, for obtaining this substrate necessitates thorough examination through chemical, physical, and biological assessments, including Raman Spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction. This study aims to identify the most efficient laboratory process for biofunctional nano-sized hydroxyapatite mineral production derived from Chilean salmon fish backbone waste.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa072451eb5cf1f83027e3a11b4f8d392418d867ab052aee3a1be6173740355d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
