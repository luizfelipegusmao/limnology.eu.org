{"title":"Analysis of Road Roughness and Driver&rsquo;s Comfort in &lsquo;Long-Haul&rsquo; Road Transportation Using a Random Forest Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1924/v1","date":1724729772000,"content":"Road safety and the effectiveness of the transportation system as a whole are significantly impacted by driver comfort. Road surface quality can play a significant part in the driver’s comfort experienced on roads in any country. This study employs a Random Forest technique to examine the association between road roughness and drivers' comfort during long-distance driving. Using Random Forest, a dependable machine learning technique that can handle big datasets and detect nonlinear correlations, this work aims to shed light on the complex dynamics between road conditions and driver’s comfort. 1,048,576 rows of data from MIRANDA, an application developed at the University of Gustave Eiffel, were used in this study as part of the data collected from a probe vehicle. The data collected includes an International Roughness Index (IRI). The IRI thresholds offer a simple method for assessing driver comfort and road irregularity. While highlighting how uneven and uncomfortable the road is, the research's findings (Road Roughness: SD – 0.73; Driver's Comfort: - Mean, 10.01, SD – 0.64) also contribute to the standardization of road condition evaluation and maintenance communication. This finding is anticipated to aid in the development of strategies for improving the welfare of long-haul drivers and fixing road infrastructure to comply with standard road index, ultimately leading to the creation of more efficient and sustainable transportation systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d942b926b71735d09ade8b14611def5231072c834db3502a34729cac99a07385","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
