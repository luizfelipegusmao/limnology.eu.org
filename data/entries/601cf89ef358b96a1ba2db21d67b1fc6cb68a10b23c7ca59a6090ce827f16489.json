{"title":"Estimation of Requirements of the Standardized Ileal Digestible Tryptophan, Valine, Isoleucine and Methionine on Young Pigs (~50kg) Feed Efficiency: A Meta-Regression Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0465/v1","date":1725587070000,"content":"Currently, the NRC amino acids (AA) requirements for pigs published in 2012 are used as a reference in variable swine industries. However, recent results in several articles suggest that the standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA: Lysine (Lys) ratio significantly evolved over the last two decades, while some publications report inconsistent outcomes. Therefore, the present study used a meta-regression analysis to assess the relative ratio to lysine to maximize the feed efficiency of four essential amino acids (tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, and methionine) in pig diets. According to the PRISMA guidelines, articles examining the target AA requirement using a basal diet supplemented with varying levels of crystalline AA (tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, or methionine) were identified across Scopus, PubMed, and Science Direct. As a result, 23, 22, 16, and 9 articles using tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, and methionine were selected and categorized into experiments for inclusion in our meta-analysis. The results suggested that the requirements of tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, and methionine in our meta-regression analysis were superior to NRC recommendations regardless of the regression models and the growth phases with significant RSQ values (RSQ â‰ˆ 1). Also, the QUAD and CLP regression models emphasized higher requirements than the LP model for the great majority of amino acids and growth phases. The results of the QUAD and CLP models were selected as estimations of amino acid requirements for pigs under challenged conditions whereas the LP model was chosen to estimate the amino acid requirements of genetically improved pigs under a modern housing system. The results of this meta-regression analysis might be used to refresh the information on the NRC amino acids (AA) requirements for swine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"601cf89ef358b96a1ba2db21d67b1fc6cb68a10b23c7ca59a6090ce827f16489","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
