{"title":"An analysis of decentralised systems in environment-related projects: theoretical and practical perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1241/v1","date":1721097491000,"content":"The growing interest in environmental sustainability issues and, at the same time, the advantages offered by blockchain technology have strong connections between these two topics. This study explores the application of blockchain technology across various environmental domains, such as air quality, climate change impacts, and resource management. The research utilised a dual approach, combining a bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer and a topic analysis using BERT models to assess the discourse within both scientific literature extracted from Scopus and practical blockchain projects obtained from GitHub. The findings reveal that food security, energy, and sustainable agriculture are predominant topics in academic discussions, with a noticeable increase in focus from 2017 onwards. Practical projects are focused on transparent tracking and decentralised management. The overlap between academic and practical spheres is evident in the shared focus on energy and environmental management, demonstrating blockchain’s growing role in addressing global environmental challenges. The study underscores the importance of integrating theoretical research with practical implementations to harness blockchain’s full potential in promoting sustainable environmental practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ccae99da4110775dab2d983384ebb702c1f175f2c5cfa7d1f50c3acebe01807","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
