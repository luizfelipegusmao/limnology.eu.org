{"title":"Systematic Cause Analysis of Explosion Accident during the Packaging Process of Dangerous Goods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0321/v1","date":1725431566000,"content":"Chemical plants are characterized by the management and operation of various hazardous materials; thus, accident risk is inherently high. Nevertheless, the incidence of chemical accidents in Korea has effectively stabilized, with no marked increase attributable to the implementation of systematic safety management procedures based on process safety management system principles. In June 2023, the Ministry of Employment and Labor in Korea unveiled the Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF) report, meticulously cataloging 4,432 instances of grave accidents spanning six years (2016â€“2021). The compilation comprises 1,834 and 2,574 cases within the manufacturing and affiliated sectors and the construction sector, respectively. This study provides an overview of each accident, and elucidates the causes, and recommends preventative strategies. The objective was to galvanize companies across various industrial landscapes and fortify their intrinsic safety management protocols by using accident data delineated per sector. Sixteen specific accident cases from the SIF report, all of which occurred in facilities regulated by process safety management (PSM), were investigated. Technical analysis was conducted, focusing on explosion accidents within the organic catalyst packaging process, notable for their unique patterns of occurrence. This analysis extended to an examination of the reproducibility of such accidents. Employing two system analysis methodologies, system theoretic accident model and process and barrier-based systemic cause analysis technique, this study provides insights into the causative factors of the accidents and formulates comprehensive strategies for the prevention of future accidents. The findings will contribute significantly to reducing the risk of accidents within the catalyst packaging domain and assist in the development of robust recurrence prevention measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e15c1d437d07fddb4a4a3f347bda5c41df627aff51cdc999b1f5a3ff31a85b32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
