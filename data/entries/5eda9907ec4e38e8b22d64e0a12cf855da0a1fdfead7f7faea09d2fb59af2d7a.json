However, one limitation to develop viable commercial inoculants is the control of PGPB survival, requiring strategies that guarantee their survival during handling and field application. The application of sublethal stress appears to be a promising strategy to increase bacterial cells tolerance to adverse environmental conditions since previous stress induces the activation of physiological protection in bacterial cell. In this work, we evaluated the effects of thermal and salt stresses on the survival of inoculant containing <i>A. brasilense</i> Ab-V5 and Ab-V6 strains and we monitored <i>A. brasilense</i> viability in inoculated maize roots after stress treatment of inoculant.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Thermal stress application (&gt; 35 °C) in isolated cultures for both strains, as well as salt stress [sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations &gt; 0.3 mol L<sup>−1</sup>], resulted in growth rate decline. The <i>A. brasilense</i> enumeration in maize roots obtained by propidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR), for inoculated maize seedlings grown <i>in vitro</i> for 7 days, showed that there is an increased number of viable cells after the salt stress treatment, indicating that <i>A. brasilense</i> Ab-V5 and Ab-V6 strains are able to adapt to salt stress (0.3 mol L<sup>−1</sup> NaCl) growth conditions.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Azospirillum brasilense</i> Ab-V5 and Ab-V6 strains had potential for osmoadaptation and salt stress, resulting in increased cell survival after inoculation in maize plants. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Elisandra Triches da Cunha, \nAna Marina Pedrolo, \nAna Carolina Maisonnave Arisi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5eda9907ec4e38e8b22d64e0a12cf855da0a1fdfead7f7faea09d2fb59af2d7a","category":"Environment"}
