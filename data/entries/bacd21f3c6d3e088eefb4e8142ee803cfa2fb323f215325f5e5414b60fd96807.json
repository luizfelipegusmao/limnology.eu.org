{"title":"Geochemical and Thermodynamic Study of Formation Water for Reservoir Management in Bibi Hakimeh Oil and Gas Field, Iran","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1171/v1","date":1721081614000,"content":"This research evaluates the mineral ions and their concentrations in formation water from five well samples of the Bibi Hakimeh oil field. The study reveals the presence of calcium (Ca2+), so-dium (Na+), and magnesium (Mg2+) cations, as well as sulfate (SO42-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and chloride (Cl-) anions, which are soluble in water within the Bibi Hakimeh oil formation. Fur-thermore, mineral deposits of CaSO4, CaSO4.2H2O, CaCO3, and MgCO3 are investigated. The findings highlight the significant formation of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate mineral deposits under the operating conditions of the Bibi Hakimeh oil well. Additionally, the study examines the interaction between rock and water of the Bibi Hakimeh formation, revealing a notable correlation between the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions and the water-rock reaction in this field","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bacd21f3c6d3e088eefb4e8142ee803cfa2fb323f215325f5e5414b60fd96807","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
