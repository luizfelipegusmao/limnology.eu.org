The pathway to midwifery in India has been through integrated nursing and midwifery education. Since 2018, India has introduced an 18-month post nursing midwifery education programme. To establish a baseline for midwivesâ€™ competence and measure progress, there is a need for a quick, easy-to-administer and low-cost tool that can be used at scale to guide programme efforts. This paper describes the process of validation and testing of a tool to assess the confidence of practicing nurse-midwives as a proxy indicator for competence against the seven competency domains of the International Confederation of Midwives (2013). A total of 2198 nurse-midwives, providing maternal and new-born services at the time of the study, from 442 public and private hospitals across six states in India, responded to a self-administered questionnaire. The tool is psychometrically sound and can potentially be used in low-middle-income countries to measure confidence of midwives and nurse-midwives against international competence standards. It is suitable for quick large-scale programmatic assessments within a short time period, providing evidence to inform midwifery strengthening initiatives. The tool can be contextualized to suit specific country contexts. Since it was tested in India, where a distinct cadre of midwives is not yet established and nurse-midwives provide maternity care, the tool can be easily adapted for use in other countries in the South East Asia Region with similar contexts.","author":"Bharati Sharma","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"22effb59aa1f372547a197029b7f57d88846d5e3365ab2a9c658d3a6dae866d6","category":"Environment"}
