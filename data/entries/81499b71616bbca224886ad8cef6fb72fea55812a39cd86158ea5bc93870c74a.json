{"title":"Impact of the Implementation of a Selective Digestive Decontamination Protocol on Antibiotic Consumption in an Intensive Care Unit: A Quasi-Experimental Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2375/v1","date":1722317606000,"content":"The growing global threat of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has been exacerbated by inadequate antibiotic consumption and the difficulty in developing new therapeutic strategies. Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD) is presented as an encouraging measure to prevent the appearance and colonization of MDR bacteria. We compared the pattern of antibiotic consumption in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our hospital before and after the implementation of the SDD protocol. This quasi-experimental study was conducted in an ICU from June-2021 to June-2023. The incidence of nosocomial infections, colonizations, and the number of isolated MDR bacteria, as well as the defined-daily-dose (DDD), were monitored. A total of 3266 patients were included, with 1532 in the pre-intervention group and 1734 in the post-intervention group. The median age was 62 years, 66% were male, and the average APACHE II and SOFA scores were 15 and 6.5, respectively. There was a significant reduction in overall antibiotic consumption in the post-SDD group (p= 0.028), highlighting a decrease in Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) (p= 0.0099). There was also a reduction in colonization incidence density and nosocomial infections. Implementing the SDD protocol significantly reduced antibiotic consumption in the ICU, suggesting important implications for infection control and antimicrobial resistance management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81499b71616bbca224886ad8cef6fb72fea55812a39cd86158ea5bc93870c74a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
