{"title":"New Benzofuran-Pyrazole Based Compounds as Promising Antimicrobial Agents: Design, Synthesis, Antioxidant, Anti-Inflammatory, DNA Gyrase B Inhibition and In Silico Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1792/v2","date":1729750906000,"content":"The alarming rise of antibiotic resistance has made it imperative to find novel antimicrobial medications. This study reports the design and synthesis of new molecules based on benzofu-ran-pyrazole scaffolds hybridized with various N/O heterocycles using the molecular hybridiza-tion process. The newly synthesized candidates were confirmed using micro-analytical and spectral analyses, and their antimicrobial characteristics were assessed against different bacterial and fungal isolates in comparison with novobiocin and clotrimazole as antibacterial and anti-fungal standards, respectively. In addition, the new compounds were further evaluated as in vitro antioxidants and anti-inflammatory congeners. The most promising broad spectrum antimicrobial compounds 9, 10 with values ranging from 2.50-20.60 Î¼g/mL were further examined as E. coli DNA gyrase B enzyme suppressors using novobiocin as a reference drug.  In silico computational and ADMET studies were carried out for the most active compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85c5ff3c0695b370ce2f401bc14da94a125c8b97252249ebc9e351a096685e87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
