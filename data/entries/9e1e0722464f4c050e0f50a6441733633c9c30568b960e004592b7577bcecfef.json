{"title":"Enhancing Financial Advisory Services with GenAI: Consumer Perceptions and Attitudes through SDL and AIDUA Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1399/v1","date":1724118374000,"content":"Abstract: Financial institutions are currently undergoing a significant shift from traditional robo-advisors to more advanced generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies. This transformation has motivated us to investigate the factors influencing consumer responses to GenAI-driven financial advice. Despite extensive research on the adoption of robo-advisors, there is a gap in understanding the specific contributors and differences in consumer attitudes and reactions to GenAI-based financial guidance, particularly in the context of GenAI. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing the impact of personalized investment suggestions, human-like empathy, and the continuous improvement of GenAI-provided financial advice on consumers' perceived authenticity, their utilitarian attitude towards the use of GenAI for financial advice, and their reactions to GenAI-generated financial suggestions. A comprehensive research model was developed based on Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) and Artificial Intelligence Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA). The model was subsequently employed in a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of survey data from 822 mobile banking users. The findings of this study indicate that personalized investment suggestions, human-like empathy, and the continuous improvement of GenAI's recommendations have a positive influence on consumers' perception of its authenticity. Moreover, we discovered a positive correlation between utilitarian attitudes and perceived authenticity, which ultimately influences consumers' responses to GenAI's financial advisory solutions. This is manifested as either a willingness to engage or resistance to communication. This study contributes to the research on GenAI-powered financial services and underscores the significance of integrating GenAI financial guidance into the routine operations of financial institutions. Our work builds upon previous research on robo-advisors, offering practical insights for financial institutions seeking to leverage GenAI-driven technologies to enhance their services and customer experiences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e1e0722464f4c050e0f50a6441733633c9c30568b960e004592b7577bcecfef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
