{"title":"Comparison of Whole Genome Sequencing versus Pcr Kit for Detection of COVID-19 Variants in Wastewater","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0370/v1","date":1725454195000,"content":"This study explores the integration of genome sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods for tracking the diversity of Covid-19 variants in wastewater. The research focuses on monitoring various Omicron subvariants during a period of significant viral evolution. Genome sequencing, particularly using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), provides a detailed view of emerging variants, surpassing the limitations of PCR-based detection kits that rely on known sequences. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining these methodologies to enhance early detection and inform public health strategies, especially in regions with limited clinical sequencing capabilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bc9d53462b8df2fa6b5c0acbee342482537408004cd93ec6a0aeb0f6fb7a502","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
