{"title":"New Structural State of Tungsten in Obtaining Porous Tungsten Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1644/v1","date":1729573844000,"content":"For the first time porous tungsten coatings were obtained by vacuum annealing of coatings consisting of both lead solution in β-W and a mixture of Pb solution in β-W and pure lead. Electron-microscopic studies of the obtained coatings before and after vacuum annealing at 800 оС for 1 hour and 6 hours were carried out. The formation of a new phase of tungsten with an octa-lattice and parameter a = 0.4878±0.0005 nm was recorded.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e6fef659276eb4cf1a8cd4b51f74e93ddb7ffd697abbbf467067fa2992ae2ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
