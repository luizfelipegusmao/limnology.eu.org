This review summarizes current\nknowledge on the role of therapeutic endoscopy in stricturing CD, focusing on evidence gaps,\nrecent updates, and novel techniques intended for optimizing efficacy, safety, and tailoring of this\napproach in the view of precision endoscopy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91afad0df708500a99dc6f120c9e75af521008a2fc28b7e012a821551c1a9cb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
