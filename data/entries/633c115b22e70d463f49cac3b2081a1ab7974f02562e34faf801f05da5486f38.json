This diversity calls for multi-dimensional interventional approaches for hypertension control. This study assessed the treatment seeking behaviour and associated factors among adults with high blood pressure from three ethnic groups in Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 762 adults with high blood pressure from three purposively selected States representing the three main tribes in Nigeria. Using a multistage stratified sampling technique, five communities were selected from two Local Government Areas (LGAs) stratified into urban and rural LGAs in each State. All consenting respondents in each community were consecutively screened for hypertension and recruited. A pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics, treatment seeking behaviour and factors affecting their choice. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Relationship between individual, health-related factors and treatment seeking behaviour, as well as the predictors were assessed using a binary logistic regression. at p&lt;0.05 Participants’ mean age was 55.4 ± 16.6 years, 63.0% were females and most were Igbo speaking (39.9%). About half (368, 48.3%) were unaware of their status. Of those aware, most (58.9%) went to hospital upon diagnosis of hypertension while some sought advice from health care professionals (28.5%) mostly Hausas, others either went to chemists (6.2%) or did nothing (5.1%), predominantly Yorubas. Significant predictors of orthodox treatment seeking practices for hypertension were female gender [(AOR = 2.60; 95%CI (1.18–5.71)], availability of medicine and personnel [(AOR = 8.7; 95%CI (4.15–18.3)] and perceived good quality of care [(AOR = 4.88; 95%CI (1.81–13.1)]. Orthodox treatment was the common choice among adults with high blood pressure. To further encourage patronage of orthodox treatment, the health facilities should be adequately equipped with medications and trained personnel to improve the quality of care. Targeted education on continuous practice of orthodox treatment is recommended.","author":"Eniola Bamgboye","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"633c115b22e70d463f49cac3b2081a1ab7974f02562e34faf801f05da5486f38","category":"Environment"}
