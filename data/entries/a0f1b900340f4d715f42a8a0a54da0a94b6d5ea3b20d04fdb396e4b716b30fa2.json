{"title":"40-Year Fire History Reconstruction from Landsat Data in a Mediterranean Area of North Africa Following International Standards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0307/v1","date":1712148328000,"content":"Algeria, the main fire hotspot on the southern rim of the Mediterranean Basin, lacks complete fire dataset with official fire perimeters, and the existing one contains inconsistencies. Preprocessed global and regional burned area (BA) products provide valuable insights into fire patterns, characteristics and dynamics over time and space, and into their impact on climate change. Nevertheless, they exhibit certain limitations linked with their inherent spatio-temporal resolutions. To address the need for reliable BA information in Algeria, we systematically reconstructed, validated and analyzed a 40-year (1984â€“2023) BA product (NEALGEBA; North Eastern ALGeria Burned Area) at 30-m spatial resolution in the typical Mediterranean Ecosystems of this region, following international standards. We used Landsat data and the BA Mapping Tools (BAMTs) in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map BAs. The spatial validation of NEALGEBA, performed for 2017 and 2021 using independent 10-m spatial resolution Sentinel-2 reference data, showed overall accuracies &gt; 98.10 %; commission and omission errors &lt; 8.20 %; Dice coefficients &gt; 91.90 %, and relative biases &lt; 3.44 %. The temporal validation, however, using MODIS and VIIRS active fire hotspots, emphasized the limitation of Landsat-based BA products in temporal fire reporting accuracy terms. The intercomparison with five readily available BA products for 2017, by using the same validation process, demonstrated the overall outperformance of NEALGEBA. Furthermore, our BA product exhibited the highest correspondence with the ground-based BA estimates. NEALGEBA currently represents the most extensive and reliable time series of BA history at fine spatial resolution for NE Algeria, offering a significant contribution for further national and international fire hazard and impact assessments and acts as a reference dataset for contextualizing future weather extremes, such as the 2023 exceptional heat wave, which we show not to have led to the most extreme fire year over the last four decades.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0f1b900340f4d715f42a8a0a54da0a94b6d5ea3b20d04fdb396e4b716b30fa2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
