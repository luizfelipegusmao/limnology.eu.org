{"title":"Global, Layerwise and Multi-scale Modeling in Polymer Matrix Laminated Composites: A Review of Fundamentals, Advances and a Trend Analysis for Future Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0826/v1","date":1712890446000,"content":"In the last two decades, the application of composite structures in many industrial sectors has been made progressively. For the current major scientific and technological challenge, the energy transition with sustainable and eco-friendly initiatives, the polymer matrix laminated composites have been revealed as an excellent alternative for the renewable energy sector. In this context, the knowledge about mechanical behavior of multiphase materials is required. Then, researches related to macro, mesomechanical and multiscale approaches are very important to improve accuracy of the models to predict effective mechanical properties and to develop a better understanding about complex phenomena such as progressive damage, creep and fatigue. Due to theses needs, this research is a synthesis of fundamentals and advanced topics concerning to global modeling of laminated composite structures, layerwise analyzes and micro-macromechanical models, in which mainly fiber, matrix, interface and damage characteristics are studied and used in the macroscale approach. At the end of this study, some final remarks and a trend analysis are proposed based on literature consulted, in other words, expectations for the future works are made by the authors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a465efdad0f63689662aac9003c33f6009b05e832331e9e9dc5186c18d2e0347","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
