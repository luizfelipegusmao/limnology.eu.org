{"title":"Overcoming Waste Management Challenges in Costa Rica: Evaluating Practices, Government Initiatives, and Future Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0274/v6","date":1724832555000,"content":"Costa Rica, widely acknowledged for its environmental leadership, is now facing a significant challenge in managing waste, a situation that could potentially compromise both its environmental and public health achievements. This analysis delves into the waste management issues in Costa Rica, particularly in urban areas such as San José, responsible for nearly half of the country's waste. The study identifies several pressing concerns, including the heavy burden on landfill capacities, a recycling rate of just 9.6%, and substantial regional differences in waste management practices.To address these challenges, the research employs a combined methodology, utilizing Linear Regression (LR) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to project future trends in CO2e emissions and waste minimization from 2024 to 2050. This method underscores the vital need for public involvement and the introduction of innovative strategies in waste management. The research also introduces a Waste Management Innovation Index to compare Costa Rica’s practices with those of leading nations like Germany and South Korea, identifying key areas for improvement.Furthermore, the study incorporates insights from stakeholders, revealing the intricate balance of cultural, economic, and regulatory factors that shape waste management policies. Despite efforts by the government, such as the Environmental Health Route and the National Circular Economy Strategy, results show limited progress, particularly in rural regions. The study highlights the urgent need for better infrastructure, targeted public awareness campaigns, and the use of advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain to enhance sustainable waste management practices. The research provides strategic recommendations to help Costa Rica improve its waste management systems in line with international standards, ensuring long-term environmental sustainability and protection of public health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c6cbd55dd8419088851e7f28c8593b46f2b6080f13c2a11092e874a30ecaa53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
