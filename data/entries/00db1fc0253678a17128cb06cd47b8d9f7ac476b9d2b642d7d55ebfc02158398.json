{"title":"Constraint on the Cosmic Curvature in a Model with the Schwarzschild-De Sitter Metric from Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Burst Observational Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1777/v1","date":1719319237000,"content":"In developing his cosmological model of 1917, de Sitter theoretically predicted the phenomenon of cosmological redshift (the de Sitter effect), which he did long before the discovery of this phenomenon in observations. The de Sitter effect is gravitational by its nature, as it is due to differences between the coordinate systems of the observer and the distant source. However, the relationship between the redshift and distance derived from the de Sitter metric is at odds with observations, since this relationship is nonlinear (quadratic) for small redshifts, while the observed relationship between the same quantities is strictly linear. This paper discusses the possibility that cosmological redshift is gravitational by its nature, as in de Sitter’s 1917 model. At the same time, here, as in de Sitter’s model, an elliptical space is used, the main characteristic of which is the identification of its antipodal points. But, unlike de Sitter’s model, here, in order to ensure a strict linear dependence of the redshift on distance, the origin of the reference system is transferred to the observer’s antipodal point. The Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric used in this model allows you to estimate the curvature of space from observational data. To do this, a theoretical Hubble diagram is built within the framework of the model with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, which is compared with observations from the Pantheon+ catalogue of type Ia supernovae and the Amati catalogue of gamma-ray bursts in the redshift range of 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;8. As a results of the comparison, the lower estimate of the radius of curvature of space turned out to be quite large: 2.3·1015 Mpc. This means that the observational data indicate a negligible curvature of space.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00db1fc0253678a17128cb06cd47b8d9f7ac476b9d2b642d7d55ebfc02158398","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
