{"title":"Assessment of consumers’ preference for orange‐fleshed sweet potato puree chapati: a case of rural and urban consumers in Kenya","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.12734?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) is bio-fortified with vitamin A precursors through breeding and is thus ideal for combating vitamin A deficiency (VAD). One of the potential mechanisms to promote the consumption of OFSP is to enhance its availability through processing into products with a longer shelf life and more desirable to consumers. However, very few farmers and agro-processors practice value addition due to market uncertainties; there is little information on market availability for OFSP products. This study examined consumers’ preference for OFSP puree <i>chapati</i> in rural and urban areas of Kenya, using the contingent valuation method. Data was collected from a random sample of 411 sweet potato consumers and a double-bounded logit model was applied to analyze consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for OFSP puree <i>chapati.</i></p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Consumers were willing to pay a price of Kenya shillings (KES) 19 (USD 0.14) and 35 (USD 0.26) for OFSP puree <i>chapati</i> in Homa Bay and Nairobi counties, respectively. The presence of children under 5 years in a household, consumers’ awareness of OFSP products and benefits of consuming OFSP, and level of education had a positive and significant influence on WTP for OFSP puree <i>chapati</i> in both regions.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study demonstrated that consumers exhibited a positive preference for OFSP puree <i>chapati.</i> In order to increase the consumption of OFSP and its value-added products, it is important to promote consumer awareness of OFSP puree <i>chapati</i> and other such nutritious products through cooking demonstrations and other nudging approaches using attractive illustrations and social media platforms that engage mothers and care-givers of children under 5 years old as well as the youth. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Antonate Akinyi Owuor, \nDavid Jakinda Otieno, \nJulius Juma Okello, \nWillis Oluoch‐Kosura, \nDominique Dufour","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"7903f277942000ec648fc785bbb68fc34b2c3423800ee8affa6d0df6462e3d13","category":"Environment"}
