{"title":"Reliability Assessment of Wireless Sensor Networks by strain-based Region Analysis for Redundancy Estimation in Measurements on the Example of an Aircraft Wing Box","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1302/v1","date":1713520896000,"content":"Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs) are gaining more and more research interest due to their ability to monitor large areas more or less independent. However, their reliability is an important issue, since their system reliability is influenced from a hardware, a data and an energetic point of view due to different factors like loading conditions, signal attenuation and battery lifetime. Regarding these issues, the positions of sensor nodes have to be chosen correctly to maximize the system reliability, which has to be considered during the development of new products equipped with WSNs. In this paper, an approach to estimate a WSNs system reliability during the development phase based on the analysis of the measurements on the example of strain measurements in finite elements (FE) models is presented. For that, the part under consideration is divided into regions with similar strains by the use of a Region Growing Algorithm (RGA). Afterwards, the WSNâ€™s configuration is analyzed regarding its reliability in accordance to the data paths and measurement redundancy due to the sensor positions in the found measuring regions. This methodology is tested on an exemplary WSN configuration at an aircraft wing box under bending load and was found to work very well regarding the estimation of the hardware perspective on the system reliability. Therefore, the methodology and the developed algorithm show potentials for optimizations in sensor node positions for better reliability results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89fb937869083f2de1acb9fe07a69216c5950c63c1f912a9baaf6fa8f517ccb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
