{"title":"Circular Economy and Buildings as Material Banks in Mitigation of Environmental Impacts from Construction and Demolition Waste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1353/v1","date":1716272246000,"content":"The circular economy is one of the main strategies for mitigating the environmental impacts of civil construction, due to the generation of construction and demolition waste (CDW). In this transition, evaluating alternatives for using buildings as material banks is a way to make the process of reusing construction components more efficient. Thus, the article aimed to evaluate the state of the art of publications on the relationship between the circular economy in civil construction and the conceptual model of buildings as material banks, to mitigate the environmental impacts of CDW. The authors chose the methodological design of Systematic Literature Review, using the Scopus and Web of Science databases for research, with the following search strings: (\"construction\" or \"civil construction\" or \"built environment\" or \"construction industry\" ) and (\"circular economy\" or \"circular construction\") and (\"material banks\" or \"BAMB\" or \"buildings as material banks\" or \"building stocks\" or \"building materials\") and (\"construction waste\" or \"demolition waste\" or \"CDW\" or \"construction and demolition waste\" or \"environmental impacts\"). After a screening in which only articles published in journals were selected, from 2013 to 2023, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, to evaluate only those that had a direct relationship with CDW management through circular economy strategies and buildings such as banks of material. As a result, 93 articles remained, which were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative approach. The quantitative results showed an increase in publications since 2020, which are concentrated in European countries and China. The predominance of applied studies was also noted, through case studies that evaluate the management of materials and waste in the urban environment. The qualitative analysis, carried out using a SWOT Matrix, highlighted the strengths of the buildings, such as material banks, the potential reduction of resource extraction and urban mining, promoting the circulation of construction products. However, the recycling of waste, such as aggregates, still stands out as the main end-of-life strategy adopted, even without occupying the top of the waste hierarchy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3883b9deb7ea2c2e347b7293cb68f710435bb5ca07f4a66a835f8c6c8e7a1f10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
