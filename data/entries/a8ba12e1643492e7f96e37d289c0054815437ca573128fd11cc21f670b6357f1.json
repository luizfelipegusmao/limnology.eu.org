Sc<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>x-1</sub>N is formed by adding cubic ScN, to wurtzite AlN, which both softens the bonding and increases the polarization compared to AlN. High Sc compositions, x = 0.43, exhibit a fivefold increase in piezoresponse compared to pure AlN. This makes Sc<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>x-1</sub>N an extremely attractive candidate for future high frequency broadband filters [<a href=\"#ozae044.601-B2\">2</a>]. Sputtered polycrystalline Sc<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>x-1</sub>N films with x &gt; 0.27 have been shown to exhibit ferroelectricity, providing evidence that Sc<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>x-1</sub>N is the first experimentally demonstrated nitride ferroelectric and has led to renewed interest in ferroelectric non-volatile memory [<a href=\"#ozae044.601-B3\">3</a>]. Controlling the phase of epitaxially grown Sc<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>x-1</sub>N is challenging due to the interplay of misfit strain and Sc incorporation during growth, both which affect the hexagonal/cubic phase boundary in the Sc<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>x-1</sub>N alloy phase diagram. Transmission electron microscopy analysis is ideally suited to examine the local structural morphologic, defect, and phase/growth relationships resulting from film epitaxial growth.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a8ba12e1643492e7f96e37d289c0054815437ca573128fd11cc21f670b6357f1","category":"Environment"}
