{"title":"Machine Learning-Based Mortality Risk Stratification in Synovial Sarcoma Patients: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1326/v1","date":1726624759000,"content":"Background: Synovial sarcoma is a rare soft tissue tumor that constitutes 5-10% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Early diagnosis and risk stratification are essential for effective management. This study leverages machine learning models to improve the risk stratification of mortality in synovial sar-coma patients.\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to analyze patients diagnosed with synovial sarcoma between 2004 and 2015, as well as a validation cohort diagnosed from 2018 onward. The dataset encompassed demographic data, clinical characteristics, staging, treatment modalities, and outcomes. Four ma-chine learning models—support vector classifier (SVC), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes, and gradient boosting—were trained and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, AUC-ROC, and Brier score. SHAP analysis was performed to determine the most influential features impacting model predictions. The top-performing model was validated using the 2018+ cohort.\nResults: The study included a total of 762 patients, with an average age of 39.4 years. The support vector classifier (SVC) outperformed the other models, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.8153 (95% CI: 0.7578 to 0.8677) and a Brier score of 0.1715. Upon external validation with the 2018+ cohort, the SVC model yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.8179 (95% CI: 0.7632 to 0.8666). Key prognostic factors identified through SHAP analysis included tumor size, patient age, presence of metastasis, tumor differentiation, and cancer stage.\nConclusion: Machine learning models can be used to stratify the risk of death in synovial sarcoma patients effectively, with the support vector classifier showing the most promise.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93cd9d1d0e973d5ce7b765867eb28e40840e84d11356a3ccc814e926a76fe021","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
