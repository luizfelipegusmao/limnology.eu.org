{"title":"Development of a new perceived injustice scale for Bangla speaking population","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311272","date":1727964000000,"content":"<p>by Chandrima Mourin, Muhammad Kamruzzaman Mozumder</p>\r\nBackground <p>Perceived injustice is a relatively novel psychosocial construct starting to get some attention among researchers studying health and mental health outcomes. In the context of the widespread perception of being a victim of injustice in Bangladesh, a gap in instruments measuring perceived injustice was evident. The novelty of the construct and lack of similar instruments necessitated the development of a new Perceived Injustice Scale for Bangla speaking population.</p> Method <p>A three-stage approach was used to develop the instrument. A thorough review of literature coupled with interviews with the general population as well as professionals contributed to the conceptualization of the construct. A rigorous process of expert evaluation and item analysis resulted in the identification of the most suitable items.</p> Results <p>The scale demonstrated a single-factor structure with adequate evidence of its reliability and validity. Reliability of the scale was assessed using internal consistency method (Cronbach alpha = .931; p&lt; .01) and test-retest method (r = .837; p&lt; .01). While validity was assessed using criterion-related validity (correlation with the Steel Injustice Inventory at r = .428; p&lt; .01) and construct validity (correlation with the Perceived Stress Scale at r = .332; p&lt; .01; and with the WHO Wellbeing Index at r = -.361; p&lt; .01).</p> Conclusion <p>The strong evidence of reliability and validity suggests the suitability of the scale for measuring perceived injustice in Bangladesh. Researchers and clinicians can use this 10-item scale with confidence in assessing perceived injustice among the general population.</p>","author":"Chandrima Mourin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8a92268cdffd57445685bfe4078552bb0d9c7d279fa21dd9e8a764e0107412e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
