{"title":"Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma in an Early 18th Century South German Abbot&mdash;Interdisciplinary Research Reveals Clues to His Final Disease History","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1175/v1","date":1713357894000,"content":"This interdisciplinary investigation of the human remains of Balduin Helm, one of the most important abbots of Fürstenfeld monastery, provides novel information on that historic individual. This is particularly interesting since Balduin, during early 18th century, was involved in the renovation of this large Bavarian monastery. Metastatic prostate cancer was found as evidenced by multiple mixed osteolytic-osteoblastic bone lesions in all available vertebral bodies, fragments of both hemipelvises and isolated metastases in skull bones. Distribution, radio- and histomorphology, and especially the immunohistochemical detection of prostate-specific antigen in those metastases, definitively confirm this diagnosis. Further investigation, especially by stable isotope analysis, showed a balanced high-level diet with considerable contribution from animal protein and significant freshwater fish. These additional findings suggest a significant radiocarbon reservoir effect as an explanation for a “too old” radiocarbon dating. Finally, the obviously high-level protein diet may have contributed to the tumorigenesis which caused the death of the abbot at an advanced age.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e98f989f3feabd7d99dd2daf92563df029529bd03ff1d20cdd40e401a145dfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
