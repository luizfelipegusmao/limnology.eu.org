{"title":"Lesser mealworm Alphitobius diaperinus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) displays negative phototaxis and conditional hygrotaxis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/50/7431312?rss=1","date":1700438400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Arthropods use a variety of environmental cues to navigate between and locate hosts. In agricultural systems, clarifying the relevant cues and their effects on arthropod behavior can inform management practices to reduce or inhibit the activity of arthropod pests. The lesser mealworm <span>Alphitobius diaperinus</span> (Panzer) is a ubiquitous arthropod pest of broiler house chicken production, and while the patterns of movement and behavior of <span>A. diaperinus</span> are well documented, the specific environmental factors that govern these patterns are not known. We conducted behavioral assays testing the response of <span>A. diaperinus</span> adults and larvae to different wavelengths of light and to the presence of water. <span>Alphitobius diaperinus</span> displayed a significant repulsion from white, green, red, and blue light, while larvae consistently sought shelter and displayed no behavioral change in response to light. Dehydrated adult beetles displayed an attraction to water while hydrated beetles displayed a repulsion to water. Regardless of the availability of water, dehydrated beetles displayed a reduced repulsion from light. Taken together, these results indicate that <span>A. diaperinus</span> will hide from sources of light unless they are dehydrated. Knowledge of the environmental cues that influence the behavior of <span>A. diaperinus</span> could be used to improve methods of trapping, monitoring, and controlling populations of <span>A. diaperinus</span> in experimental and commercial settings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"521fac51accf88279e4723e042f26ea67238ce113700a895301dff2bf1c76d84","category":"Environment"}
