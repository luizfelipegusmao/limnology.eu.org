{"title":"Advanced NMR, FT-IR, UV-VIS and XRD Methods Used for Characterization of Organo-Mineral Fertilizers Based on Biosolids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0621/v1","date":1718092484000,"content":"Biosolids from stabilized sludge presents a high fertilization potential due to its rich content of nutrients and organic matter. Three formulas of organo-mineral fertilizers based on biosolids were manufactured having at least 2 % N, 2 % P2O5, and 2 % K2O and characterized by classical and advanced methods. The content of N and P in the final formula was measured using specific reactants combined with VIS-nearIR spectroscopy. Additionally, all three formulas were characterized by advanced 1H NMR relaxometry, double-quantum and FT-IR spectroscopy. Structural characterization was performed using SEM, EDX and X-ray diffraction. Four dynamical components were identified in the T2-distribution showing that the rigid component is into a percentage larger than 90 %. In order to evaluate the release properties of organo-mineral fertilizers dynamic measurements of electric conductivity and pH were performed, by placing 0.25 g of formulas (V1, V2 and V3) in 200 ml of distillate water. It was found that V3 present the smallest release velocity, but release the largest amount of fertilizers. Two release mechanisms were also observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8cd87ce87836f42aa680df9e5fe0cb6a005f009dbc3f20e4c87434e3387e54b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
