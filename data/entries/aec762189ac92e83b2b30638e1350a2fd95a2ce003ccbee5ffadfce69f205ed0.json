Measuring the 3D volumetric chemistry at high resolution can be achieved by fusing elastic and inelastic scattering signals [<a href=\"#ozae044.159-B2\">2</a>]. Data fusion, as opposed to traditional correlation, recovers new information and improves accuracy by linking separate signal modalities [<a href=\"#ozae044.159-B3\">3-5</a>]. Multi-modal (MM) electron tomography recovers the volumetric chemical structure of specimens by solving the following 3-term inverse problem:</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"aec762189ac92e83b2b30638e1350a2fd95a2ce003ccbee5ffadfce69f205ed0","category":"Environment"}
