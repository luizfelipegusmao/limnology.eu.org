{"title":"Polarization-Enhanced Underwater Laser Range-Gated Imaging for Subaquatic Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0390/v1","date":1725526615000,"content":"Laser range-gated underwater imaging technology, by removing most of the back scattering noise, can effectively increase the image contrast and extend the detection range. The optical signal captured by a range-gated imaging system primarily comprises reflected light from the object and backscattered light from the surrounding water. Consequently, surfaces with low reflectivity or highly turbid water environments substantially constrain the applicability of the range-gated imaging system. To enhance the detection capability of underwater laser range-gated imaging, this paper proposes the incorporation of underwater polarized light imaging technology as an enhancement method. Based on polarization differences, backscattered light and reflected light from an object can be distinguished. Experimental results indicate that, compared to images obtained using a conventional range-gated laser imaging system, those captured with a polarization-enhanced system exhibit an increase of up to 47%. The proposed approach, which integrates polarization imaging with range-gated laser imaging, has the potential to broaden the applicability of underwater laser imaging scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34bae1c7a67b26dfa0644fc690ce72b1913e116483f11518a84f171aeb19c97d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
