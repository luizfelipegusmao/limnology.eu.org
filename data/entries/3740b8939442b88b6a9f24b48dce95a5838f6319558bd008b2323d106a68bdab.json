{"title":"Ternary ZnS/ZnO/Graphitic Carbon Nitride Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable Hydrogen Photocatalytic Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0553/v1","date":1725717087000,"content":"Ternary ZnS/ZnO/graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) photocatalysts were prepared by coupling gCN sheets with ZnO nanorods under solvothermal conditions followed by sulfurization using Na2S. SEM and TEM analyses show that small-sized ZnS particles (ca. 7.2 nm) deposit homo-geneously on the surface of ZnO/gCN nanohybrids. Photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that ZnS allows an enhanced charge separation efficiency as well as prolonged lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers, leading to improved hydrogen photo-production under UV light irradiation compared to ZnO/gCN. Moreover, the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles improves the photostability of the ZnS/ZnO/gCN catalyst for hydrogen produc-tion. A double Z-scheme mechanism is proposed for hydrogen photoproduction using the ZnS/ZnO/gCN heterojunction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3740b8939442b88b6a9f24b48dce95a5838f6319558bd008b2323d106a68bdab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
