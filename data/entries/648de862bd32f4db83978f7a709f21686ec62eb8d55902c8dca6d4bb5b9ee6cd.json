{"title":"Molecular Modeling Tools Used for the Prediction of Amyloid-&beta; Fibrils Disaggregating Molecules from Plant Sources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0119/v1","date":1725312670000,"content":"The defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aberrant deposition of pathogenic proteins, particularly a massive build-up of amyloid-β peptides, specifically in the brain. Amy-loid-β aggregation is neurotoxic and ultimately results in dysfunction of the nervous system. The present investigation aims to predict potential amyloid-β fibrils disaggregating molecules from plant sources through molecular modeling techniques, this appears to be a very promising and appealing treatment philosophy. Here, 500 flavonoids from various plants were considered, ini-tially undergoing ADME studies to screen molecules that could cross the blood-brain barrier. Later, potential Amyloid-β-disaggregating molecules were identified by molecular docking and dynamics (MD) simulation studies. Five molecules, prenylmethoxy flavonol (-7.3 kcal×mol-1), isopentenyl flavonol (-7.3 kcal×mol-1), 7,3'-Dihydroxyflavone (-7.2 kcal×mol-1), 7-Hydroxy-5-methyl-4'-methoxyflavone (-7.2 kcal×mol-1), 8-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (-7 kcal×mol-1) showed higher binding affinity score against Alzheimer's Aβ (1-42) fibrils, these are very close to the standard drug (Donepezil) (-7.90 kcal×mol-1). Further, the MD simulation studies established the intermolecular interaction and stability of the five selected ligands-Amyloid-β oligomer protein complexes. These results suggest that the chosen five flavonoid molecules could be used as possible agents to disaggregate amyloid-β fibrils; however, more in vitro and in vivo investigations are required to verify the therapeutic effectiveness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"648de862bd32f4db83978f7a709f21686ec62eb8d55902c8dca6d4bb5b9ee6cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
