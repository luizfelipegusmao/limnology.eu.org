{"title":"191 Supplementing short- and medium-chain fatty acid-based products increases the health and performance of weaned piglets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/143/7664955?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Several feed supplements have received interest for their potential to increase growth performance and health post weaning, including alternatives to high levels of zinc oxide (ZnO) such as short- and medium-chain fatty acids (SCFA, MCFA), and phytogenics. The objective of this study is to observe the growth performance and intestinal health effects from the supplementation of SCFA with and without the addition of MCFA and phytogenics. The trial was performed on a commercial farm in Segovia, Spain. Piglets (n = 192; Topigs sow x Pietrain) were weaned at 28 d. The initial body weight (BW) was 8.5 ± 1.5 kg. Two phases were fed; phase 1 (d 1-14) and phase 2 (d 15-35). Piglets were distributed evenly to 4 treatments of 8 pens, 6 pigs/pen. Four treatments were evaluated: a negative control (NC) without addition of dietary additives any other growth promoters, a positive control (PC) with 3,000 ppm ZnO in the prestarter diet, NC with 2,000 ppm SCFA, coated butyrate, in the prestarter and 1,500 ppm SCFA in the starter (SB), and NC with a mixture of SCFA, MCFA, and phytogenics supplemented at 3,000 ppm in the prestarter and 2,000 ppm in the starter (SMP). Feed intake and individual BW were measured weekly. On d 0 and 7, one piglet per pen was rectally sampled for qPCR analysis of <span>Escherichia coli</span>, <span>Streptococcus suis</span>, and <span>Clostridium perfringens</span>. Veterinary interventions were recorded. Statistical analysis of growth performance, <span>E. coli</span>, and <span>S. suis</span> counts data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s t-test. The number of veterinary interventions and the occurrence of a high <span>C. perfringens</span> load were analyzed with a chi-square test. All statistical significance was set at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05. The PC had the greatest average daily gain (ADG) at d 14 with 235 g/d while the NC and the SB had statistically less ADG with 217 and 212 g/d, NC and SB, respectively (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05); however, no statistical differences between treatments were present at the end of the trial (332 NC, 335 PC, 331 SB, 347 SMP, <span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was less for PC (1.22) and SMP (1.23) in phase 1 than NC (1.33) and SB (1.35; <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05). No differences were detected in phase 2 (1.36 NC, 1.31 PC, 1.36 SB, 1.27 SMP; <span>P</span> &gt;0.05). Dietary interventions did not significantly affect <span>E. coli</span> and <span>S. suis</span> counts. However, SB and SMP treatments had sufficiently reduced fecal <span>C. perfringens</span> load and antimicrobic treatments, <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05 (Table 1). In conclusion, supplementation of SCFA, with or without MCFA or phytogenics, reduced <span>C. perfringens</span> and incidence of diarrhea. The addition of MCFA and phytogenics with SCFA, improved performance to the positive control.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"358b335ca43be86ea73eddaea1c95a22e840019ff562257e7d04af31a56c4f58","category":"Environment"}
