Organotypic culture models employing primary human cells enable consideration of human health effects and inter-individual variability but present significant challenges for test method standardization, transferability, and validation. Increasing confidence in the information provided by these <span>in vitro</span> NAMs requires setting appropriate performance standards and benchmarks, defined by the context of use, to consider human biology and mechanistic relevance without animal data. The human thyroid microtissue (hTMT) assay utilizes primary human thyrocytes to reproduce structural and functional features of the thyroid gland that enable testing for potential thyroid-disrupting chemicals. As a variable-donor assay platform, conventional principles for assay performance standardization need to be balanced with the ability to predict a range of human responses. The objectives of this study were to (1) define the technical parameters for optimal donor procurement, primary thyrocyte qualification, and performance in the hTMT assay, and (2) set benchmark ranges for reference chemical responses. Thyrocytes derived from a cohort of 32 demographically diverse euthyroid donors were characterized across a battery of endpoints to evaluate morphological and functional variability. Reference chemical responses were profiled to evaluate the range and chemical-specific variability of donor-dependent effects within the cohort. The data-informed minimum acceptance criteria for donor qualification and set benchmark parameters for method transfer proficiency testing and validation of assay performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"2b64fad3da7b2c18fda7070bf579918094826e0b6b514d34e83cbd1ce7b2b13f","category":"Environment"}
