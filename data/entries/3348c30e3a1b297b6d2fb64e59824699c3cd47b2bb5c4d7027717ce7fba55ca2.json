{"title":"Elucidating the Functional Roles of Long Non-coding RNAs in Alzheimer&#039;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0848/v1","date":1720648637000,"content":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuronal loss, representing a most challenging health issue. We present a computational analysis of transcriptomic data of AD tissues vs. healthy controls, focused on elucidation of functional roles played by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) throughout the AD progression. We first assembled our own lncRNA transcripts from the raw RNA-Seq data generated from 527 samples of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, resulting in the identification of 31,574 novel lncRNA genes. Based on co-expression analyses between mRNAs and lncRNAs, a co-expression network is constructed. Maximal subnetworks with dense connections are identified as functional clusters. Pathway enrichment analyses are conducted over mRNAs and lncRNAs in each cluster, which serve as the basis for the inference of functional roles played by lncRNAs involved in each of the key steps in an AD development model that we have previously build based on transcriptomic data of protein-encoding genes. Detailed information is presented about the functional roles by lncRNAs in activities related to stress response, reprogrammed metabolism, cell-polarity, and development. Our analyses have also revealed that lncRNAs have discerning power in distinguishing between AD samples of each stage and healthy controls. This study represents the first of its kind.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3348c30e3a1b297b6d2fb64e59824699c3cd47b2bb5c4d7027717ce7fba55ca2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
