{"title":"The wildlife–livestock interface: a general perspective","link":"https://academic.oup.com/af/article/14/1/3/7607883?rss=1","date":1707868800000,"content":"<span>Wildlife has historically coexisted with livestock in dynamic agroecosystems. However, the unceasing human population growth has given rise to an increase in animal protein demands. Consequently, livestock production has suffered an enormous expansion with changes in livestock breeding systems and a subsequent impact on biodiversity conservation. Livestock grazing is a widespread land use that occurs in a wide variety of ecosystems, occupying more than one-third of the earth’s land surface (<a href=\"#CIT0001\">Barroso and Gortázar, 2023</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0005\">Cravino et al., 2023</a>). These changes (farming practices, human demography, and land uses) together with changes in wildlife management and dynamics have led to increased interactions between wildlife and livestock across a variety of contexts. This is the origin of the concept ‘wildlife–livestock interface’. The wildlife–livestock interface is defined as a dynamic network of epidemiological and ecological connections between wildlife, livestock, and the physical space in which they overlap and potentially interact (<a href=\"#CIT0007\">Vicente et al., 2021</a>). This interface changes along with natural landscapes and is vulnerable to human intervention (<a href=\"#CIT0004\">VerCauteren and Breck, 2023</a>). This issue aims to bring together different aspects of wildlife–livestock coexistence, discussing the main positive and negative impacts on all the players implicated. To this end, six articles are compiled.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Animal Frontiers Current Issue","siteHash":"d2ebbba5d44268c4d5ae0a0fd5e2619282136fd9be49453f0fee01876d4d13af","entryHash":"c09c901c6a74102091b497bdca19c8cbaaecc6b1e9448e3f5b4a91ecffb349f1","category":"Environment"}
