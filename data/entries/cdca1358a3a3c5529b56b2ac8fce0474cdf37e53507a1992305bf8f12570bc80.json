{"title":"A Cyber-Physical System Based on Digital Twin and 3D SCADA for Real-Time Monitoring of Olive Oil Mills.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1443/v1","date":1711352925000,"content":"Cyber-physical Systems involve the creation, continuous updating and monitoring of virtual replicas that closely mirror their physical counterparts. These virtual representations are fed by real-time data from sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other sources, enabling a dynamic and accurate reflection of the state of the physical system. This emphasizes the importance of data synchronization, visualization and interaction within virtual environments as a means to improve decision-making, training, maintenance and overall operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel approach to a cyber-physical system to harness the power of Industry 4.0, Digital Twin technology, Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D SCADA in the context of monitoring and optimizing an olive mill. In conclusion, this paper presents a methodology that leverages digital twins and virtual reality to create an immersive, data-driven simulation and monitoring system for an olive mill. The proposed CPS takes data from the physical environment through the existing sensors and measurement elements in the olive mill, concentrates them and exposes them to the virtual environment through the Open Platform Communication United Architecture (OPC-UA) protocol, thus establishing a bidirectional and real-time communication. Furthermore, in the proposed virtual environment, the digital twin is interfaced with the 3D SCADA system, allowing it to create virtual models of the process. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the olive oil industry by improving operational efficiency, product quality and sustainability, while optimizing maintenance practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdca1358a3a3c5529b56b2ac8fce0474cdf37e53507a1992305bf8f12570bc80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
