{"title":"Design Methods of Aluminium Pin-Ended Columns with Topology Optimised Cross Sections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1414/v1","date":1726656971000,"content":"This paper presents a numerical study of topology-optimised pin-end aluminium alloy columns using finite element analysis (FEA). The FEA models integrate geometric imperfections and material nonlinearity, validated against experimental findings from existing literature. Furthermore, modern design methodologies including Eurocode 9, Direct Strength Method (DSM), and Continuous Strength Method (CSM) are employed to assess the maximum load capacity of such columns. Parametric investigations encompass diverse parameters such as varied cross-sections, column lengths, and global and local imperfections. By analysing a total of 288 FE models, incorporating 16 column cross-sections across two lengths with nine distinct imperfections, the study compares results with those derived from modern design methodologies. Thus, this research elucidates the behaviour of novel cross-sections and the application of contemporary design techniques in their analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc9189409593f122859b74fbd0140e1eb1200cf60a841292aca064a3a79b95f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
