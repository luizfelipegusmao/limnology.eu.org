{"title":"Degradation of FATTY ACID EXPORT PROTEIN1 by RHOMBOID-LIKE PROTEASE11 contributes to cold tolerance in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1937/7577599?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants need to acclimate to different stresses to optimize growth under unfavorable conditions. In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), the abundance of the chloroplast envelope protein FATTY ACID EXPORT PROTEIN1 (FAX1) decreases after the onset of low temperatures. However, how FAX1 degradation occurs and whether altered FAX1 abundance contributes to cold tolerance in plants remains unclear. The rapid cold-induced increase in <span>RHOMBOID-LIKE PROTEASE11</span> (<span>RBL11</span>) transcript levels, the physical interaction of RBL11 with FAX1, the specific FAX1 degradation after RBL11 expression, and the absence of cold-induced FAX1 degradation in <span>rbl11</span> loss-of-function mutants suggest that this enzyme is responsible for FAX1 degradation. Proteomic analyses showed that <span>rbl11</span> mutants have higher levels of FAX1 and other proteins involved in membrane lipid homeostasis, suggesting that RBL11 is a key element in the remodeling of membrane properties during cold conditions. Consequently, in the cold, <span>rbl11</span> mutants show a shift in lipid biosynthesis toward the eukaryotic pathway, which coincides with impaired cold tolerance. To test whether cold sensitivity is due to increased FAX1 levels, we analyzed FAX1 overexpressors. The <span>rbl11</span> mutants and FAX1 overexpressor lines show superimposable phenotypic defects upon exposure to cold temperatures. Our re­sults show that the cold-induced degradation of FAX1 by RBL11 is critical for Arabidop­sis to survive cold and freezing periods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"128454fe3a065a4273e77a8f8a04bceade7c9bf1adaa28db9c144b2597b78d3a","category":"Environment"}
