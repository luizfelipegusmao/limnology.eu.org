{"title":"Rapid and sensitive detection of large yellow croaker iridovirus by real‐time RPA and RPA‐LFD","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13930?af=R","date":1707846866000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Large yellow croaker (<i>Larimichthys crocea</i>) is a vital marine-cultured species in China. Large yellow croaker iridovirus (LYCIV) can cause a high mortality rate in <i>L. crocea</i>. Rapid and convenient detection of LYCIV is an urgent demand for diagnosis. In this study, rapid and simple recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), real-time RPA and RPA combined with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) methods were developed for the detection of LYCIV based on the conserved sequence of the LYCIV major capsid protein (MCP) gene. With these optimized RPA analyses, LYCIV detection could be completed within 20 min at 40°C. Both RPA and real-time RPA could detect viral DNA as low as 10<sup>2</sup> copies/μL, while the detection limit of RPA-LFD was 10<sup>1</sup> copies/μL, and there was no cross-reaction with other aquatic pathogens (KHV, CyHV-2, GCRV-JX01, SVCV, LCDV and LMBV). In practical evaluation of RPA, real-time RPA and RPA-LFD methods, the results showed consistency with the general PCR detection. In short, the developed RPA, real-time RPA and RPA-LFD analyses could be simple, rapid, sensitive and reliable methods for field diagnosis of LYCIV infection and have significant potential in the protection of LYCIV infection.</p>","author":"Xiaoru Liu, \nYong Cao, \nJiayin Wang, \nSuyuheng Cao, \nLiqun Lu, \nYousheng Jiang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"3641b192d41ab136e2f150b309ddd5119659a77842e889880c44a3c29860afc8","category":"Environment"}
