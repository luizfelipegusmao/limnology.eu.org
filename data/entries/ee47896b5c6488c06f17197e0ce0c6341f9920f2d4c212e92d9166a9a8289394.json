{"title":"Medical resource usage for COVID-19 evaluated using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303493","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Keita Fukuyama, Yukiko Mori, Hiroaki Ueshima, Shiho Ito, Masaki Tanabe, Tomohiro Kuroda</p>\r\nPurpose <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exhibited several different waves threatening global health care. During this pandemic, medical resources were depleted. However, the kind of medical resources provided to each wave was not clarified. This study aimed to examine the characteristics of medical care provision at COVID-19 peaks in preparation for the next pandemic.</p> Methods <p>Using medical insurance claim records in Japan, we examined the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection and the use of medical resources for all patients monthly by age group.</p> Results <p>The wave around August 2021 with the Delta strain had the strongest impact on the working population in terms of hospital admission and respiratory support. For healthcare providers, this peak had the highest frequency of severely ill patients. In the subsequent wave, although the number of patients with COVID-19 remained high, they were predominantly older adults, with relatively fewer patients receiving intensive care.</p> Conclusions <p>In future pandemics, we should refer to the wave around August 2021 as a situation of medical resource shortage resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>","author":"Keita Fukuyama","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee47896b5c6488c06f17197e0ce0c6341f9920f2d4c212e92d9166a9a8289394","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
