{"title":"Photodegradation of microplastics through nanomaterials: Insights into photocatalysts modification and detailed mechanisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1239/v1","date":1710947242000,"content":"Microplastics (MPs) are a critical environmental issue, with impacts ranging from ecosystem contamination to health risks through bioaccumulation. This review addresses the inefficacy of traditional water treatments in removing MPs and proposes photodegradation, particularly via nanomaterial-enhanced photocatalysts, as a solution. Utilizing their unique properties like large surface area and tunable bandgap, nanomaterials significantly improve degradation efficiency. Different strategies for photocatalysts modification to improve photocatalytic performance are thoroughly summarized, with the particular emphasis on element doping and heterojunction construction. Furthermore, this review thoroughly summarizes the possible fundamental mechanisms driving photodegradation of microplastics facilitated by nanomaterials, with a focus on processes like free radical formation and singlet oxygen oxidation. By clearly elucidating these strategies and mechanisms, this review aims to provide valuable insights and inspire further progress in microplastic photodegradation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ceef2a0b8192875ce8d1ccd42c34d5e7ec3a62386f053057bcd3f9705bbcce0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
