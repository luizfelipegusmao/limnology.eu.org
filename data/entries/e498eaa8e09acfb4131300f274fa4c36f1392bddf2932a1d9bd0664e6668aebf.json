{"title":"Interspecies Competition of Mono or Dual Species Biofilms of MDR Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Promotes the Killing Efficacy of Phage or Phage Cocktail","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0267/v1","date":1719967785000,"content":"Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are opportunistic pathogens commonly associated with burn wound infections. These bacteria can form biofilm and contribute a high-level drug resistance to available antibiotics. This study focused on the bacteriolytic activity of phages vB_SAnS_SADP1 and vB_PAnP_PADP4 on 24 h old single or dual-species biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in alone and in combination. Scanning and confocal laser scanning microscopic studies confirmed the structural organization of biofilms in single or dual-species combinations in in-vitro conditions.  Single species biofilms are more robust and densely packed at 24 h of incubation. In contrast, dual-species biofilms (0.67± 0.02) are weakly associated due to their inter-species competition and are easily affected by phage cocktails (0.16 ± 0.02). In Invitro conditions, dual-species biofilms were more easily affected by phage cocktail than single phage. Scanning electron microscopic studies revealed the complete diminishment of biofilm formation by four h treatment with single phage or phage cocktails on single species or dual-species biofilms. Confocal laser scanning microscopic images with stains Syto®9 and propidium iodide revealed that phage treatment showed significant uptake of propidium iodide, indicating massive cell death mediated by respective phage or phage cocktail.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e498eaa8e09acfb4131300f274fa4c36f1392bddf2932a1d9bd0664e6668aebf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
