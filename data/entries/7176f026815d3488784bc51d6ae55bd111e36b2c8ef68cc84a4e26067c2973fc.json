{"title":"Automatic deforestation detectors based on frequentist statistics and their extensions for other spatial objects","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2848?af=R","date":1721378427000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This article is devoted to the problem of detection of forest and nonforest areas on Earth images. We propose two statistical methods to tackle this problem: one based on multiple hypothesis testing with parametric distribution families, another one—on nonparametric tests. The parametric approach is novel in the literature and relevant to a larger class of problems—detection of natural objects, as well as anomaly detection. We develop mathematical background for each of the two methods, build self-sufficient detection algorithms using them and discuss practical aspects of their implementation. We also compare our algorithms with each other and with those from standard machine learning using satellite data.</p>","author":"Jesper Muren, \nVilhelm Niklasson, \nDmitry Otryakhin, \nMaxim Romashin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmetrics: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4718a208dff669d8713b9a4772fb9e30bd4e6b10bc59ba738841df9ffc8f1e42","entryHash":"7176f026815d3488784bc51d6ae55bd111e36b2c8ef68cc84a4e26067c2973fc","category":"Environment"}
