{"title":"Differentiating the Bonding States in Calcium Carbonate Polymorphs by Low-Loss Electron-Energy-Loss Spectroscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.576/7720174?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Calcium carbonate is one of the important building components in organisms, especially the two most common polymorphs, calcite and aragonite. Although their microstructures are well characterized, there is still lack of study about the electronic structures related to the bonding state (valence) in the compounds. A comprehensive understanding of their electronic structure could help to further understand structurally influenced and controlled material properties. Experimentally, the electronic structures of materials can be studied by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) [<a href=\"#ozae044.576-B1\">1-6</a>] and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Especially, low-loss EELS is indicative of outer-shell single electron transitions and collective excitations of valence electrons. Given an example of calcite and aragonite, the Ca L2 and L3 core edges around 345 eV represent transitions from the initial 2p to the final 3d states and are one of the effective means of characterizing calcite and aragonite as their constituent atoms are arranged differently, yielding different crystal field effects [<a href=\"#ozae044.576-B1\">1</a>]. However, similar to 3d transition metal compounds, the involvement of 2p to 3d states make the spectral features in the Ca-L edges strongly influenced by atomic multiplet effect (spin-orbit coupling) which makes it difficult to interpret the core-loss EELS data. Hence, the Ca L edges cannot provide us more information about the bonding states in these compounds. Fortunately, we found that Ca-M edges showed advantages for the analysis of bonding states in the two studied CaCO3 polymorphs because the spin-orbit coupling is much reduced for a 3p orbital as compared to a 2p orbital, which in turn reduces the atomic multiplet effect. This enables us to deeply explore the fine spectral features (band gap, bonding states and dielectric function) from low-loss EELS data.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5d2ad7a7e36dabb7c10c42e02f993af589bf7be90b847c5ebf917291bbb13fa5","category":"Environment"}
