{"title":"Photoactivation of nano MgO anchored g‐C3N4 enhances biodiesel production in Chlorella sorokiniana: A sustainable approach","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14470?af=R","date":1725538124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Investigating the potential of magnesium oxide (MgO), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), and their composite nanoparticles as nutrient sources for enhanced microalgae biodiesel production formed the core of this study. Supplementing the growth medium with g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and MgO/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles significantly increased microalgae (<i>Chlorella sorokiniana</i>) growth and lipid accumulation, culminating in a 58 mg/L lipid concentration. Interestingly, while MgO nanoparticles alone led to the highest biodiesel yield, the synergistic effect of MgO and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in the composite nanoparticles improved nutrient availability and facilitated optimal microalgae growth and lipid accumulation. These findings pave the way for further research and development of nanoparticle-based strategies to optimize microalgae-based biodiesel production, offering a promising avenue for a more sustainable and efficient future of biofuel generation. The results showed that the addition of 15 mg/L of MgO NPs produced the maximum biodiesel yield which reached 61.5 mg/L.</p>","author":"Amany Khalifa, \nMaryam Faried, \nEssam M.
