{"title":"Origin of the Dark Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1639/v1","date":1716540236000,"content":"We are going to demonstrate the origin of dark energy, using a Hardwire similarity, a test that is carried out in terrestrial seismic with vibroseis in the search for gas and oil. In the first instance, we are going to analyse the mathematical function of Dirac's delta and compare it with the detonation of an explosive that is carried out in the search for gas and oil. Let's understand that in both cases a frequency spectrum is produced. We will also explain the meaning of a non-causal, zero-phase system; a causal system, of minimum phase, in order to determine the mathematical behaviour that corresponds to the Big Bang. Next, following the line of seismic, we will analyse a Hardwire Similarity to demonstrate that a vibroseis source, which generates a sweep, produces, in addition to the ideal sweep of fundamental frequencies, spurious harmonic frequencies and additional noise. We will show that this additional energy generated by the spurious harmonic frequencies and additional noise adds to the energy of the fundamental frequency sweep in analogy as dark energy does.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"298d4859699fb8ba336c024f43f6ce0e8c05384ecb474af324edec8471397c4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
