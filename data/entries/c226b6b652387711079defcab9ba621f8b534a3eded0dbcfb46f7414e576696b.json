{"title":"Recovered Foam Impact Absorption Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0281/v1","date":1725375333000,"content":"The utilization of foam in contact with individuals often leads to its deterioration, necessitating periodic material changes to prevent degradation and maintain sanitary conditions. Foam, a porous plastic material formed by an aggregation of bubbles, offers lightweight and impact-absorbing properties, yet its porosity and susceptibility to wear pose challenges. The project's overarching goal is to develop a technological application for repurposing spent foam materials and textile elements from leisure facilities into impact absorption systems. This initiative aims to minimize environmental impact by reusing materials and leveraging their technical characteristics, including those of polyurethanes and textiles. By addressing the challenge of foam deterioration, the project seeks to create sustainable solutions. The development of impact absorption systems will involve the utilization of spent foam, either by reintegrating it into the system after its initial use or combining it with waste textiles. This innovative approach not only promotes sustainability but also enhances safety by ensuring the availability of high-quality impact-resistant elements. Through this endeavor, the project aims to contribute to both environmental conservation and the advancement of effective anti-impact measures in leisure facilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c226b6b652387711079defcab9ba621f8b534a3eded0dbcfb46f7414e576696b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
