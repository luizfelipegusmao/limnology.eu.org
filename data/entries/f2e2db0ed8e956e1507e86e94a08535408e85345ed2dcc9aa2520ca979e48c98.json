{"title":"Protocol for preliminary, multicenteric validation of “PoCOsteo device”: A point of care tool for proteomic and genomic study of osteoporosis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae006/7633921?rss=1","date":1711065600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract </div>One of the goals of the HORIZON 2020 project PoCOsteo was to develop a medical device, which would measure and/or quantify proteomic as well as genomic factors as present in whole blood samples collected through finger prick. After validating the tool in the clinical setting, the next step would be its clinical validation based on the existing guidelines. This article presents the protocol of a validation study to be carried out independently at two different centers (Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology at the Medical University of Graz as a clinic-based cohort, and the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences as a population-based cohort). It aims to assess the tool according to the Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, confirming if the proteomics and genomics measurements provided by the tool are accurate and reproducible compared with the existing state-of-the-art tests. This is the first time that such a detailed protocol for lab validation of a medical tool for proteomics and genomic measurement is designed based on the existing guidelines and thus could be used as a template for clinical validation of future point-of-care tools. Moreover, the multicentric cohort design will allow the study of a large number of diverse individuals, which will improve the validity and generalizability of the results for different settings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"f2e2db0ed8e956e1507e86e94a08535408e85345ed2dcc9aa2520ca979e48c98","category":"Environment"}
