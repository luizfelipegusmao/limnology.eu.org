It highlights the innovative integration of blockchain technology with CP-ABE, which introduces a decentralized and tamper-resistant key management system, thereby enhancing the overall security framework in cloud environments where data sharing is prevalent. Introducing an online/offline multi-authority CP-ABE scheme, characterized by hidden policies, offers significant advancements in protecting user attributes and access structures, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential even during encryption and decryption processes. This dual approach not only fortifies security but also optimizes the efficiency of data-sharing mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper delves into implementing hidden sensitive policies and keyword search techniques within smart city infrastructures, which are designed to facilitate secure and efficient data retrieval. These techniques ensure that while data remains accessible to authorized users, privacy is rigorously maintained. Collectively, these approaches represent significant strides in bolstering the security and confidentiality of data in both cloud-based and smart city applications, addressing the growing demand for robust and efficient data management solutions in increasingly interconnected environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"538ff3a617903947eed075d0b58e0cf95c8924f8675d6a8f182e9af4b32048e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
