{"title":"Treating Anxiety-Based Cognitive Distortions Pertaining to Somatic Perception for Better Chronic Pain Outcomes: A Better Practice Recommendation for Now and The Cyber Age of Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1772/v5","date":1727575040000,"content":"Anxiety-based cognitive distortions pertaining to somatic perception (ABCD-SP) - primarily catastrophizing, fear avoidance and kinesiophobia- have been repeatedly linked to worsening chronic, non-cancer pain (CNCP) outcomes of increased disability, amplified pain, ineffective opioid use, and opioid misuse. Several studies have suggested that treating ABCD-SP can improve pain outcomes, yet identification and targeting of ABCD-SP is not part of the standard medical pain assessment and treatment plan. Utilizing a narrative review of proposed mechanisms, published patient perspectives, and study correlates connecting these cognitive distortions with CNCP outcomes, a better practice approach to the delivery of standard medical CNCP care can be deduced and formulated into a Belief and Behavior Action Plan (BBAP) for medical clinicians treating CNCP to implement into initial and maintenance care planning. These recommendations require relatively few resources to implement and have the potential to disseminate more effective CNCP treatment on a large scale now, and into the new frontier of cognitive computing within medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9cf9487d0db39b8c0c2865dac161c3f9c584f8f97555b2455d914bf1e8561645","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
