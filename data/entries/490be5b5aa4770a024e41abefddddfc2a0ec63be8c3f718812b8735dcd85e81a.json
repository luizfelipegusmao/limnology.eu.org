{"title":"Pm‐miR‐29b is involved in nacre formation by regulating tyrosinase‐like protein in Pinctada martensii","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16099?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The miR-29 family includes miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-29c. Our previous research showed that miR-29a of <i>Pinctada martensii</i> (Pm-miR-29a) is involved in nacre formation via targeting neuropeptide Y receptor type 2 (<i>Y2R</i>). In this report, we validated and corrected the precise sequence of mature Pm-miR-29b and elucidated its function and mechanism difference with Pm-miR-29a in nacre formation. Our results showed that the precursor of Pm-miR-29b has 87 bp with a characteristic hairpin structure, which is the same with that of Pm-miR-29a. Stem-loop quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that Pm-miR-29b was constitutively expressed in all of the tissues, with high expression in gonads. After overexpression of Pm-miR-29b via mimic injection into <i>P. martensii</i>, the nacre microstructure showed a disordered growth status with a little difference with Pm-miR-29a. Target prediction analysis indicated that tyrosinase-like protein (<i>Pfty</i>), nacre protein (<i>N19</i>), fibroblast growth factor 18, protein serine kinase and neuropeptide <i>Y2R</i> were the potential target gene of Pm-miR-29b. Dual-luciferase analysis showed that the luciferase activity of the reporter containing 3′ UTR of <i>Pfty</i> and <i>Y2R</i> gene was significantly inhibited by Pm-miR-29b mimics. However, only the expression of <i>Pfty</i> was downregulated after overexpression of Pm-miR-29b in vivo. Therefore, Pm-miR-29b participated in nacre formation via targeting <i>Pfty</i> in <i>P. martensii</i>.</p>","author":"Xinlei Li, \nMing Zhang, \nMin Yang, \nRongrong Tian, \nYuewen Deng, \nYu Jiao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"490be5b5aa4770a024e41abefddddfc2a0ec63be8c3f718812b8735dcd85e81a","category":"Environment"}
