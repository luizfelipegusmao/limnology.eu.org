{"title":"96 The effect of embryo stage and biopsy on embryo viability","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/17/7617966?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The importance of embryo biopsy is running a 50K genomic test will be completed on the DNA biopsy, giving us the ability to collect genetic prediction data before the calf is even born. The objective of this study was to compare the viability of bovine embryos (n = 24) at different stages of embryo maturation, after microblade biopsy and embryo transfer. This process was achieved by taking a small biopsy of each embryo. The results of aspirating oocytes from packing house ovaries and in vitro fertilization (IVF), within a 48 h time period marked d 0. After a 7-d incubation period, the results consisted of 14 blastocysts and 10 early blastocysts. The final sample size, of 24 embryos, differing in stages between early blastocyst (TRT 6) and blastocyst (TRT 7). All the embryos, except for one, was a Grade 1 embryo. On d 7 the embryos were grouped by stage of embryo. Each embryo was washed, and biopsied with a microblade by a single technician. After the biopsy, the embryos were incubated for a 24 h period. Immediately after the incubation period, each embryo was analyzed for viability. On d 8, TRT 7 embryos had a 50% viability rate (n = 7), whereas TRT 6 embryos had a 70% viability rate (n = 7). Data were analyzed using GLIMMIX procedure of SAS 9.4. The viability did not differ between either treatment (P = 0.58). However, the biopsy of each embryo resulted in a significant effect on embryo viability (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, using embryo biopsy and the stage of the embryo may affect embryo viability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ea20cfe6671697404d8928a0122ba4d179b068c115f5bb8b5640b92a63890c1a","category":"Environment"}
