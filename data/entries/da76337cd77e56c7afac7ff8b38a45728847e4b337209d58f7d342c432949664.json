{"title":"The preS-Based Recombinant Vaccine VVX001 Induces Hepatitis B Virus Neutralizing Antibodies in a Low-Responder to HBsAg-Based HBV Vaccines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2044/v1","date":1721974028000,"content":"Background: Approximately 10-20% of subjects vaccinated with HBsAg-based hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines are non-responders. BM32 is a recombinant grass pollen allergy vaccine containing the HBV-derived preS surface antigen as immunological carrier protein. PreS includes the binding site of HBV to its receptor on hepatocytes. We investigated if immunological non-responsiveness to HBV after repeated HBsAg-based vaccinations can be overcome by immunization with VVX001 (i.e., Alum-adsorbed BM325, a component of BM32). Methods: A subject failing to develop protective HBV-specific immunity after HBsAg-based vaccination received five monthly injections of 20 Âµg VVX001. PreS-specific antibody responses were measured by ELISA and micro-array technology. Serum reactivity to subviral particles of different HBV genotypes was determined by sandwich ELISA. PreS-specific T cell responses were monitored by CFSE staining and subsequent FACS analysis. HBV neutralization was assessed using cultured HBV-infected HepG2 cells. Results: Vaccination with VVX001 induced a strong and sustained preS-specific antibody response composed mainly of the IgG1 subclass. PreS-specific IgG antibodies were primarily directed to the N-terminal part of preS containing the NTCP attachment site. IgG reactivity to sub-viral particles as well as to the N-terminal preS-derived peptides was comparable for HBV genotypes A-H. A pronounced reactivity of CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes specific for preS after the complete injection course remaining up to one year after the last injection was found. Maximal HBV neutralization (98.4%) in vitro was achieved 1 month after the last injection which correlated with the maximal IgG reactivity to the N-terminal part of preS. Conclusion: Our data suggest that VVX001 may be used as a preventive vaccination against HBV even in non-responders to HBsAg-based HBV vaccines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da76337cd77e56c7afac7ff8b38a45728847e4b337209d58f7d342c432949664","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
