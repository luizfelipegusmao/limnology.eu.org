{"title":"Moderate India Pale Ale beer consumption promotes antigenotoxic and non‐mutagenic effects in ex vivo and in vivo mice models","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13726?af=R","date":1720446321000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Discussion of the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption is ongoing. Broadly, research focusing on ethanol consumption tends to report no benefits. However, studies that distinguish between different types of alcoholic beverages, particularly beers, often reveal positive effects.</p>\n<p>The present study evaluated the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of moderate chronic consumption of India Pale Ale (IPA) craft beer. Sixty-four adult male Swiss mice were used and divided into control and treatment groups receiving water, IPA beer with 55.23 g of ethanol per liter of beer, aqueous solution with 55.23 g of ethanol per liter, and hop infusion <i>ad libitum</i> for 30 days. After this period, the animals were genetically evaluated with a comet assay. For the <i>ex vivo</i> comet assay, blood was collected and exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). For the <i>in vivo</i> assay, the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CP) was administered to the groups after blood collection and sacrificed after 24 h. Brain, liver, and heart tissues were analyzed. Bone marrow was collected and submitted to the micronucleus test.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The groups treated with IPA beer, ethanol, and hops did not show genotoxic and mutagenic action in the blood, brain, heart, or liver. The antigenotoxic action of IPA beer and hops was observed in both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> models, showing a similar reduction in DNA damage caused by CP. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to the formation of micronuclei by CP.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Moderate chronic consumption of IPA beer and hops infusion showed antigenotoxic effects in mice but no antimutagenic action. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Schellen de Cordova Kindermann, \nGlauco Caon, \nCarina Rodrigues Boeck, \nCarla de Oliveira Bauer, \nNicollas dos Santos da Silva, \nOtavio Lucio Possamai, \nLuiza Martins Longaretti, \nMarina Lummertz Magenis, \nAdriani Paganini Damiani, \nIsadora de Oliveira Monteiro, \nVanessa Moraes de Andrade","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"d6069777800cc6bb9545fdbdd5b969c6f1a7b596484c847f6297550052a8b175","category":"Environment"}
