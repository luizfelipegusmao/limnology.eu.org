{"title":"Bubble dynamics in the Polyakov quark-meson model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1444/v1","date":1718940681000,"content":"Based on the two-flavors Polyakov quark-meson model, we study the bubble dynamics of a first-order phase transition in chiral phase diagram at high density but low temperature in the framework of the homogeneous thermal nucleation theory. Under the mean-field approximation, after obtaining the effective potential with inclusion of the fermionic vacuum term, we build a geometric approach to probe two possibly existing minima, which can actually tunnel through a bounce interpolated between a metastable vacuum to an adjacent true vacuum. By separating our discussions into a weak first-order hadron quark phase transition and strong ones, the bubble profiles, the surface tension, the typical radius of the bounce and the saddle point action in the presence of a nucleation bubble as a function of temperature are numerically calculated in detail as the chemical potentials are fixed at $\\mu=306 \\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\\mu=310 \\mathrm{MeV}$. our results show that the surface tension remains a small value even when the density is very high and phase boundaries for hadron and quark matter should be resized properly according to the saddle point action evaluated on the bounce. It is also noticed that the inclusion of the deconfinement phase transition in term of the  Polyakov loop does not change chiral phase transition dramatically for light quarks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e945a31887861a11d117cc2a4c71cc156d31c4b0fcf966f6f7b13557835b31f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
