A crucial complement to art-historical and archaeological investigations, they provide information about material composition, manufacturing and artistic techniques, provenance and circulation of objects, authentication issues, technical properties, identification of polychrome decorations, and inform conservation treatments. Among all the available cutting-edge scientific techniques, the conservation scientist’s toolkit is complete without instruments that allow to investigate art at the microscale. In fact, microscopic techniques have been proved to be transformative for a better understanding and care of art. Even the initial assessment of an artwork surface can rely on powerful tools that enable observation and documentation of details otherwise not visible. The development of increasingly powerful portable digital microscopes capable of capturing high-resolution images up to 6000x magnification further improved the scientist’s toolkit, resulting critical where micro-sampling is not allowed. Observations with such typology of microscopes can prove for instance the presence of traces of polychromy on objects previously described as unpainted after visual observation [<a href=\"#ozae044.058-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.058-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3b1d00aea07ad907213236d97bc5ccacc283363da7ba74e7a628e1c26d8433fc","category":"Environment"}
