{"title":"Graphic Restitution and Recovery of the Chronos Pavement of the Marquis of Benicarlo&rsquo;s House","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1944/v1","date":1719483702000,"content":"The Marquis of Benicarloâ€™s House is a prime example of 18th-century Baroque civil architecture in the Valencian region. Inside, it preserves ceramic panels from this period of great historical and heritage value. However, prior to its designation as a Cultural Heritage Site, the building lost some of its most architecturally significant elements, such as the flooring in one of the main rooms, which was decorated with rich iconography. Fortunately, the original tiles from this flooring have been located in the collections of the National Museum of Ceramics. This study presents the recovery and graphic restitution of the flooring based on the pieces found in the museum's collections. This work allows us to understand the original appearance of the flooring before its dismantling and may enable its in-situ restoration through digital ceramic printing techniques, thus returning one of its most unique architectural elements to the building. It also details the process of digitally restoring the flooring to its original location using advanced digitization techniques. This enables the visualization of the hall in its authentic state using virtual reality methods, thereby facilitating its appreciation and dissemination as a heritage architectural space.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddd87773ba78453c7f0e08f16f1bc23820cb987ea44ce5b05a89c36fc42aa7bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
