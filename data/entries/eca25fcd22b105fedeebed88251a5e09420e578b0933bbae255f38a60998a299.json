{"title":"Cooking Spices: Potential Modulators for Gut Dysbiosis and Role in Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1795/v1","date":1719325719000,"content":"Abstract:\nBackground: \nThe gut microbiota, a diverse community of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, is essential for human health, primarily through nutrient metabolism and production of anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids. Dysbiosis, a disruption in microbial composition, is linked to diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, diabetes, asthma, and allergies. Dietary habits significantly influence gut microbiota diversity, with balanced diets crucial for maintaining microbial equilibrium. Culinary herbs and spices, known for their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, may positively modulate the gut microbiota by inhibiting inflammation, stimulating beneficial bacteria, and exhibiting prebiotic effects.\nMethods: \nA comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database to identify relevant research articles on the impact of culinary spices on the gut microbiome. The search terms included \"culinary spices,\" \"gut microbiome,\" \"gut modulation,\" \"gut dysbiosis,\" \"common spices,\" and \"gut health.\" Thirty-five articles published between 2016 and 2024 were reviewed, with eight directly addressing the effects of culinary spices on gut microbiome modulation. Priority was given to peer-reviewed journals and reputable scientific sources.\nResults: \nStudies demonstrate that mixed spices and individual spices like ginger, turmeric, and chili can induce favorable changes in gut microflora, promoting beneficial probiotics and inhibiting pathogenic bacteria. Spices such as turmeric and curcumin exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to their protective effects against chronic diseases like colon cancer and metabolic disorders.\nConclusions: \nIncorporating culinary spices into dietary interventions is important for overall well-being. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action and optimize the therapeutic applications of spices in clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eca25fcd22b105fedeebed88251a5e09420e578b0933bbae255f38a60998a299","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
