{"title":"Unlocking the Mask: Perceived Organizational Support as a Buffer of the Inimical Effect of Organizational Cynicism on Organizational Workplace Deviance Behaviour","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1471/v1","date":1729254287000,"content":"Leveraging on the theory of social exchange theory, the current study investigated the influential role that perceived organizational support plays in understanding the relationship between organizational cynicism and organizational deviant work behaviour. Scant research has addressed contextual factors in determining organizational cynicism and its relationship to negative work outcomes such as deviant work behaviour. An interactive effect of perceived organizational support was investigated to determine if deviant individuals are more or less prone to become organizational cynics based on the presence or absence of organizational support. The study was conducted in South-Eastern Nigeria, involving 575 nurses using two-wave design. Validated self-reported measures were used to collect data for perceived organizational support, organizational cynicism and organizational workplace deviance, which were analyzed using the Hayes PROCESS Macro for SPSS model 1 version 3.00. The results revealed that organizational cynicism positively correlated with organizational workplace deviant behaviour, whereas perceived organizational support negatively correlated with workplace deviant behaviour among nurses. In addition, perceived organizational support moderated the relationship between organizational cynicism and organizational workplace deviant behaviour. The study's findings revealed the imperativeness of a supportive work environment by underscoring the importance of contextual factors like perceived organizational support in mitigating workplace deviant behaviour. By focusing on fostering a supportive environment, organizations can better manage employee attitudes and reduce deviant behaviours, which enhances overall workplace performance and culture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b723207b1ddd5150ea22c47a9c8b53a7884eddd28ddce0422d0851683ad5742c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
