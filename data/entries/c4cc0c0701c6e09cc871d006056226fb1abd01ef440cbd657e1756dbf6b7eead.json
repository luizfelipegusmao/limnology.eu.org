{"title":"Representation Debiasing of Generated Data Involving Domain Experts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0050/v1","date":1717393601000,"content":"Biases in Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) systems due to skewed datasets problematise the application of prediction models in practice. Representation bias is a prevalent form of bias found in the majority of datasets. This bias arises when training data inadequately represents certain segments of the data space, resulting in poor generalisation of prediction models. Despite AI practitioners employing various methods to mitigate representation bias, their effectiveness is often limited due to a lack of thorough domain knowledge. To address this limitation, this paper introduces human-in-the-loop interaction approaches for representation debiasing of generated data involving domain experts. Our work advocates for a controlled data generation process involving domain experts to effectively mitigate the effects of representation bias. We argue that domain experts can leverage their expertise to assess how representation bias affects prediction models. Moreover, our interaction approaches can facilitate domain experts in steering data augmentation algorithms to produce debiased augmented data and validate or refine the generated samples to reduce representation bias. We also discuss how these approaches can be leveraged for designing and developing user-centred AI systems to mitigate the impact of representation bias through effective collaboration between domain experts and AI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4cc0c0701c6e09cc871d006056226fb1abd01ef440cbd657e1756dbf6b7eead","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
