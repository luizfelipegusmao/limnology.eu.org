{"title":"Advancing Sustainable Practice in Additive Manufacturing: A Comprehensive Review on Material Waste Recyclability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2215/v1","date":1724987436000,"content":"This review investigates the pivotal challenge of recycling material waste in the context of Additive Manufacturing with an emphasis on decentralized 3D printing, shedding light on its environmental and economic implications. With additive manufacturing experiencing exponential growth, the environmental impacts of waste generation during 3D printing processes have become increasingly significant. The paper explores various recycled materials commonly used in 3D printing, including polymers like polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), evaluating their characteristics and usability. General recycling methodologies, encompassing mechanical and chemical processes, are examined with attention to challenges such as polymer sorting, additives, coatings, contamination, and thermoset reprocessing. The economic and societal impact of integrating recycled materials into 3D printing and the environmental impacts are examined. By identifying research gaps and proposing future trends, this review contributes to a deeper understanding of how recycling can play a pivotal role in achieving environmental sustainability and economic viability within the decentralized 3D printing landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"631853826260008e459d9a16316c92f1b17208dfa314a813e5b971124cc43f1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
