{"title":"Positive modulation of a new reconstructed human gut microbiota by Maitake extract helpfully boosts the intestinal environment <i>in vitro</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301822","date":1712844000000,"content":"<p>by Alessandra De Giani, Federica Perillo, Alberto Baeri, Margherita Finazzi, Federica Facciotti, Patrizia Di Gennaro</p>\r\n\r\nThe human gut is a complex environment where the microbiota and its metabolites play a crucial role in the maintenance of a healthy state. The aim of the present work is the reconstruction of a new <i>in vitro</i> minimal human gut microbiota resembling the microbe-microbe networking comprising the principal phyla (Bacillota, Bacteroidota, Pseudomonadota, and Actinomycetota), to comprehend the intestinal ecosystem complexity. In the reductionist model, we mimicked the administration of Maitake extract as prebiotic and a probiotic formulation (three strains belonging to <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genera), evaluating the modulation of strain levels, the release of beneficial metabolites, and their health-promoting effects on human cell lines of the intestinal environment. The administration of Maitake and the selected probiotic strains generated a positive modulation of the <i>in vitro</i> bacterial community by qPCR analyses, evidencing the prominence of beneficial strains (<i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i>) after 48 hours. The bacterial community growths were associated with the production of metabolites over time through GC-MSD analyses such as lactate, butyrate, and propionate. Their effects on the host were evaluated on cell lines of the intestinal epithelium and the immune system, evidencing positive antioxidant (upregulation of SOD1 and NQO1 genes in HT-29 cell line) and anti-inflammatory effects (production of IL-10 from all the PBMCs). Therefore, the results highlighted a positive modulation induced by the synergic activities of probiotics and Maitake, inducing a tolerogenic microenvironment.","author":"Alessandra De Giani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2e4321e6b09946a5b63a298b0c1c38a9c8e1af5cbc249081d1ed5789e4c155de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
