{"title":"The effect of a direct-fed microbial (10-G) on live animal performance, carcass characteristics, and Salmonella prevalence of fed beef heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae086/7684338?rss=1","date":1716940800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the direct-fed microbial 10-G upon cattle growth performance, liver and lung health, carcass quality, and yield outcomes, as well as prevalence and enumeration of <span>Salmonella</span> in feces and lymph nodes. Fed beef heifers (<span>N</span> = 1,400; initial shrunk body weight [<strong>BW</strong>] 343.3 ± 36.2 kg) were blocked by the day of arrival and randomly allocated to one of two treatments (0 [negative control, CON] or 2 g of a direct-fed microbial [10-G] that provided 1 billion CFUs per animal per day of <span>Lactobacillus acidophilus</span>, <span>Enterococcus faecium</span>, <span>Pediococcus pentosaceus</span>, <span>L. brevis</span>, and <span>L. plantarum</span>) with 10 pens per treatment. Recto-anal mucosal fecal samples (<strong>RAMs</strong>; <span>n</span> = 477) and subiliac lymph nodes (<strong>SLNs</strong>; <span>n</span> = 479) were collected longitudinally at harvest from 23 to 25 heifers per pen. Data were analyzed using mixed models; pen served as the experimental unit; block and harvest date were random effects. No differences were detected in dry matter intake (<span>P</span> = 0.78), final BW (<span>P</span> = 0.64), average daily gain (<span>P</span> = 0.51), gain to feed (<span>P</span> = 0.71), hot carcass weight (<span>P</span> = 0.54), dressed carcass yield (<span>P</span> = 0.52), 12th rib fat depth (<span>P</span> = 0.13), longissimus muscle area (<span>P</span> = 0.62), calculated empty body fat (<span>P</span> = 0.26), or marbling score (<span>P</span> = 0.82). Distributions of liver scores (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.34), quality grades (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.23), and yield grades (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.11) were also not different between treatments. A tendency was detected for more normal lungs (<span>P</span> = 0.08; 10-G = 65.96%, CON = 61.12%) and fewer inflated lungs at harvest for cattle fed 10-G (<span>P</span> = 0.10; 10-G = 0.29%, CON = 1.16%); other lung outcomes did not differ (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.54). <span>Salmonella</span> prevalence did not differ for RAM samples (<span>P</span> = 0.41; 10-G = 97.74%, CON = 96.82%) or SLN (<span>P</span> = 0.22; 10-G = 17.92%, CON = 13.66%). <span>Salmonella</span> concentration of RAM samples (<span>P</span> = 0.25; 10-G = 3.87 log CFU/g, CON = 3.32 log CFU/g) or SLN (<span>P</span> = 0.37; 10-G = 1.46 log CFU/g, CON = 1.14 log CFU/g) also did not differ between treatments at harvest. These results do not demonstrate any difference in live animal performance, carcass characteristics, or <span>Salmonella</span> carriage for heifers fed 10-G.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"42e383d563c8ab79d01d282388d647d59c88b23cbf032159f7510b487c9ed6f4","category":"Environment"}
