{"title":"The Relationship between Intended Learning Outcomes and the Attainment of Graduate Competence among Cross-border E-commerce Learners: The chain mediating roles of project-based learning and assessment strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0204/v1","date":1717565464000,"content":"Exploring new approaches to innovating higher vocational education is a worldwide pursuit driven by the increasing demand for graduates equipped with competencies. This study investigated how Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) influences the attainment of graduate competence (AGC) in Chinaâ€™s higher vocational education, using the theory of Constructive Alignment (CA) as its foundation. The OBE framework incorporates intended learning outcomes (ILOs), project-based learning (PjBL), assessment strategies (ASs), and AGC. The study tested the model by assessing the impact of ILOs, PjBL, and ASs on AGC, respectively and sequentially. Surveys were administered to 320 CBEC learners in April 2024, resulting in 301 usable responses. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 24.0. Results indicated that PjBL and ASs were directly and positively related to graduate competency attainment, while ILOs were indirectly associated with graduate competence through the mediating roles of PjBL and ASs. The most substantial mediating effect between ILOs and graduate competence was ASs, followed by PjBL, and then, the chain mediating effect of PjBL and ASs. These findings enhance the theoretical understanding of OBE and provide detailed procedures for tracking and enhancing sustainability in higher vocational education. Beneficiaries include educators, policymakers, and accreditation bodies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fce535f6d23b3122ba8230d1fee8e51bc7bc7d542c951924b8f2c0ccfea2fe02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
