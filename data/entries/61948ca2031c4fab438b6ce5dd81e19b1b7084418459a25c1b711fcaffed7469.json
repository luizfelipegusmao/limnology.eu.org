In hydrogen energy storage and conversion applications, metal hydrides (MH) are studied as one of the materials with the greatest potential as power sources for vehicles with better electrochemical properties than Ni-Cd batteries [<a href=\"#ozae044.653-B2\">2</a>]. In addition, they have recently been designed for uses such as hydrogen sensors, switchable mirrors, rechargeable batteries, and other applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.653-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"61948ca2031c4fab438b6ce5dd81e19b1b7084418459a25c1b711fcaffed7469","category":"Environment"}
