{"title":"Generation, characterisation and identification of bioactive peptides from Mesopelagic fish protein hydrolysates using in silico and in vitro approaches.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0018/v1","date":1717407601000,"content":"Bioactive peptides are sequences of amino acids, cut from the parent protein with en-zymes or high pressure processing that can impart a tertiary health benefit to the con-sumer that goes beyond basic human nutrition. This study explores mesopelagic fish in-cluding Maurolicus muelleri and Benthosema glaciale as sources of peptides with an-ti-inflammatory, heart health beneficial, antioxidant and other bioactivities.  Bioactive peptides were generated post-catch using different enzymatic hydrolysis processes ap-plied to mesopelagic species caught from experimental cruises targeting these fish. Maurolicus muelleri and Benthosema glaciale were the dominant species processed. Bi-oactive hydrolysates included a Maurolicus muelleri Alcalase hydrolysate and a Maurolicus muelleri autolysis. Hundreds of peptide sequences were identified using mass spectrome-try from active hydrolysates. In silico analysis was used to rank identified peptide se-quences in terms of overall bioactivity using Peptide Ranker, anti-inflammatory activity using PrepAIP, ability to impart Umami flavours with Umami-MRNN and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory potential using AntiDMPpred . Thirty peptides were selected fol-lowing in silico analysis. Several of the selected peptides had sequence homology with peptides derived from other fish proteins including Atlantic salmon (peptide QCPLHR-PWAL) and thin-lipped mullet (peptide FDAFLPM). Seven peptides predicted to have an-ti-inflammatory, anti-type 2 diabetes or Umami potential using in silico strategies were chemically synthesized and their anti-inflammatory activities confirmed using in vitro bioassays with COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. The peptide QCPLHRPWAL inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 by 82.90% (+/-0.54) and 53.84% respectively and had a selectivity index greater than 10. This peptide warrant further research as a novel anti-inflammatory/pain relief peptide. Other bioactivities associated with DPP-IV inhibition and Umami flavours de-velopment are discussed. Identified peptides offer potential for use in functional foods or topical agents to prevent pain and inflammation associated with diseases like psoriasis, arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, however further research in vivo is required.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f21afe4f0c4e6ad66e6e18fa5016087f14cc26c8e85cf503edea50204ddc7d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
