{"title":"Interaction with YAP underlies the species differences between humans and rodents in CAR-dependent hepatocyte proliferation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/198/1/101/7486579?rss=1","date":1703116800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a nuclear receptor predominantly expressed in the liver, is activated by diverse chemicals and induces hepatocyte proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for CAR-dependent hepatocyte proliferation remains unclear. Importantly, this phenomenon has not been observed in the human liver. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying CAR-induced hepatocyte proliferation and to explore the species differences in hepatocyte proliferation between humans and rodents. Treatment of mice with the CAR activator TCPOBOP induced hepatocyte proliferation and nuclear accumulation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a known liver cancer inducer. This induction was abolished in CAR-knockout mice. Exogenously expressed YAP in cultured cells was accumulated in the nucleus by the coexpression with mouse CAR but not human CAR. Pull-down analysis of recombinant proteins revealed that mouse CAR interacted with YAP, whereas human CAR did not. Further investigations using YAP deletion mutants identified the WW domain of YAP as essential for interacting with CAR and showed that the PY motif (PPAY) in mouse CAR was crucial for binding to the WW domain, whereas human CAR with its mutated motif (PPAH) failed to interact with YAP. A mouse model harboring the Y150H mutation (PPAY to PPAH) in CAR displayed drastically attenuated TCPOBOP-induced hepatocyte proliferation and nuclear accumulation of YAP. CAR induces the nuclear accumulation of YAP through the PY motif-WW domain interaction to promote hepatocyte proliferation. The absence of this interaction in human CAR contributes to the lack of CAR-dependent hepatocyte proliferation in human livers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"98157a06eb5fea6767ee4398c1813465536a962692f379e960ef4b9a10841bd5","category":"Environment"}
