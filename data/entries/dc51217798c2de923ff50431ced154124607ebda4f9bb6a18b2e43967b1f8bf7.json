{"title":"Development of Multi-Resistant Rice Restorer Lines and Hybrid Varieties by Pyramiding Resistance Genes against Blast and Brown Planthopper","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1618/v1","date":1711467845000,"content":"Rice blast and brown planthopper (BPH) are two of the most destructive diseases and pests in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production in China. The development of multi-resistant varieties is widely recognized as the most efficient and environmentally friendly approach to controlling crop diseases and pests. Functional molecular markers (FMMs) have been developed from functional variants in the genic region associated with trait variation, greatly enhancing the efficiency of identifying and pyramiding valuable genes in crop breeding. In this study, two FMMs and a multiplex PCR amplification system were developed for two major broad-spectrum BPH resistance genes, Bph6 and Bph9. By assistance of FMMs in multi-resistant rice restorer line development pipeline, two lines (Huahui7713 and Huahui3006) with blast and BPH resistance were developed by pyramiding three resistance genes Pigm, Bph6 and Bph9. Huahui7713 and Huahui3006 as male lines, two new hybrid rice varieties (WeiLiangYou7713 and Xuanliangyou3006) were certificated and commercial released in China. WeiLiangYou7713 and Xuanliangyou3006 showed improved blast and BPH resistance, and no penalty on yield and grain-quality. Annual promotion area of WeiLiangYou7713 has exceeded 53.3 thousand hectares, indicating its widespread adoption and success in the market. Huahui7713 and Huahui3006 could have great potential for utilization in blast and BPH resistance rice breeding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc51217798c2de923ff50431ced154124607ebda4f9bb6a18b2e43967b1f8bf7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
