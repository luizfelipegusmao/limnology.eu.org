{"title":"Theoretical and Numerical Investigation of Mechanical Properties of Auxetic S-structure under Transverse Load","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0180/v3","date":1718957153000,"content":"A significantly reduced stress concentration effect and a stable deformation behavior are exhibited by the arc-like S-shaped auxetic structure. Analytical works beyond the bar and hinge method to capture structural effects, such as bending, shearing, etc., in the S-structure are scarce in the literature. The deformation pattern of the S-structure is dominated by bending and shearing within the linear elastic region. In this work, Timoshenko beam theory is used to derive closed-form expressions for overall elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio. This agrees well with the results of finite element simulations. An adjusted R-square value of over 0.99 and almost 0.82 is obtained for elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio, respectively. From parametric studies, it’s established that under quasi-static transverse load, strut thickness and the angle `α’ are the most important parameters for controlling elastic modulus, specific energy absorption, negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) effect, and relative density of the entire auxetic structure. Also, it’s found that energy absorption and elastic modulus increase together. Interestingly, the elastic modulus of the structure under transverse load lies in the range from 3 MPa to 250 MPa, which means this structure is compliant enough and can be used in cushioning, packaging, soft robotics applications, etc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ed1a7f4773cf8e1bbb5d1375df17f87976f81edebdb29bbab4089cd9e6e1924","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
