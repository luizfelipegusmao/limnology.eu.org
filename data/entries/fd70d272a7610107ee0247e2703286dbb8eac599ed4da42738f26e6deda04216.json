{"title":"Serum Calcium Levels Approaching the Upper Limit of Normal Can Predict Prostate Cancer Relapse to the Bone and Beyond in Patients Managed with Radiotherapy: Mature Data at 10 Years","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1558/v1","date":1714027144000,"content":"The most important prognostic factors in curatively treated prostate cancer at the initial diagnosis are T and N stage, histological subtype, Gleason score, initial PSA, PSA density and percentage of core biopsy positivity. Newer, but non-standard prognostic factors are urine PCA3 and genetic markers of prostate cancer. A simple, but seemingly underestimated standard test is serum Calcium (Ca) level, which has been shown by a previous study group to be a good predictor of lethal prostate cancer, but there is scarce evidence regarding the prognostic value of calcium levels at diagnosis. We aimed to determine whether a Ca level in the upper part of normal values has a prognostic value in curatively treated prostate cancer. We have retrospectively included 84 consecutive patients with prostate cancer, who underwent curative radiotherapy (primary or adjuvant; external beam RT with or without brachytherapy). We have performed statistical analysis of available prognostic factors. Ca level at diagnosis was found to be a statistically significant predictor of disease-free survival.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd70d272a7610107ee0247e2703286dbb8eac599ed4da42738f26e6deda04216","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
