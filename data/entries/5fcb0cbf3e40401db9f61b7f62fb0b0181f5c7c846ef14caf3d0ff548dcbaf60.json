Although rising ocean temperatures correlate with increased <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> pathogenicity, the specific molecular mechanisms and determinants contributing to virulence remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a contact-dependent toxin delivery apparatus, in <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i>. We identified 2 omnipresent T6SSs that are activated at temperatures in which <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> becomes virulent; T6SS1 is an antibacterial system mediating interbacterial competition, whereas T6SS2 mediates anti-eukaryotic toxicity and contributes to mortality during infection of an aquatic model organism, <i>Artemia salina</i>. Using comparative proteomics, we identified the T6SS1 and T6SS2 toxin arsenals of 3 <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i> strains with distinct disease etiologies. Remarkably, T6SS2 secretes at least 9 novel anti-eukaryotic toxins comprising core and accessory repertoires. We propose that T6SSs differently contribute to <i>V</i>. <i>coralliilyticus</i>â€™s virulence: T6SS2 plays a direct role by targeting the host, while T6SS1 plays an indirect role by eliminating competitors.","author":"Shir Mass","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"5fcb0cbf3e40401db9f61b7f62fb0b0181f5c7c846ef14caf3d0ff548dcbaf60","category":"Environment"}
