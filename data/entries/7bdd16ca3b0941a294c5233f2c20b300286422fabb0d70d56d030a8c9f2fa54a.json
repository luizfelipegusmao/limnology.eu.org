{"title":"Emerging Opportunistic Colpodella Species: Nutrient Uptake and Approaches to Diagnose Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1321/v1","date":1716276966000,"content":"Colpodella species are free-living opportunistic pathogens that cause human and animal infections and use ticks and flies as vectors. Trophozoite and cyst stages of Colpodella species can be distinguished from stages of the prey Parabodo caudatus using Sam-Yellowe’s trichrome staining. Colpodella species obtain nutrients by attaching to their prey, aspirating the prey’s cytoplasmic contents into a posterior food vacuole and encysting. It is unclear whether both trophozoite and cyst stages are present during infection. Molecular techniques identified Colpodella species in all reported infections. However, no morphological information was reported to aid life cycle stage identification in hosts. This review discusses the increased incidence of Colpodella infection in animals and in vectors and the need to identify stages used for transmission and pathogenesis. The potential for zoonotic infections through tick and fly bites is a public health concern. We previously used Sam-Yellowe’s trichrome staining to identify life cycle stages of Colpodella sp. In order to gain a better understanding of transmission and pathogenesis, identifying Colpodella life cycle stages in infected tissue and in vectors will provide important insights regarding nutrient uptake in hosts by determining whether attachment of trophozoites to host cells occurs, and identifying trophozoites and cysts in infected hosts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bdd16ca3b0941a294c5233f2c20b300286422fabb0d70d56d030a8c9f2fa54a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
