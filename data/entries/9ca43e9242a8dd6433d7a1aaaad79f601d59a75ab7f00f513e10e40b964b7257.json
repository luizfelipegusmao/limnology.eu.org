This present study investigates the Bio-silica (Silicon-dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>). The statistical and experimental study demonstrates the utilization of various levels of SiO<sub>2</sub> in Azolla Biodiesel blend (ABD) with appropriate engine parameters such as fuel injection pressure, fuel injection timing and compression ratio for minimal emissions and optimal performance employing response surface approach. In a mixture of Azolla biodiesel and diesel, SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were utilized at quantities of 25, 50, and 75 ppm. To determine the existence of Silicon-dioxide, the produced nanoparticles were subjected to tests such as XRD, SEM, TEM, and EDS. The Response Surface optimizer was used with DOE L29 array and the engine predictors with a desirability value of 0.6180, were18.5°bTDC (IT), 238 Bar (IP), 17.1237 (CR), and 45.885 ppm SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle. The results were determined to be fit statistically and with high assurance levels. Thus, the addition of SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoadditives along with aquatic fern Azolla oil methyl ester reduced the emission without affecting the engine performance.</p>","author":"T. R. Kannan, \nS.
