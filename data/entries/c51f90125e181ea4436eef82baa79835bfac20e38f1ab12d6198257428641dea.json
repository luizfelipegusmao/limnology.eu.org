{"title":"Two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling for prediction of bank erosion and bed incision in the Indus River","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11600-023-01116-2","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The Lower Indus River (LIR) in the Southern Sindh has experienced by multiple measurable changes in its planform and longitudinal profiles over the last 100 years. This research deals with a hydrodynamic model coupled with rough set theory (RST) model findings that accounts for the prediction of lateral and vertical morphodynamic evolution observed over the 32 km reach during the flood episode of 2020. Human interferences and hydrodynamic aspects during high flood periods were assessed in the context of channel morphology. Surveyed cross-sections were used to construct the geometry using two-dimensional (2D) Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model, and simulation was completed under the unsteady flow values among the highest runoff and bankfull values. The island and natural bend of the river have higher values of velocities and shear stresses, and consequently higher erosion and incision rate was observed. The bank erosion was computed with high precision (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.83) based on improved connection of erodibility coefficient and excess shear stress technique. The present study findings will be helpful to assist in the implementation of river protection works at the given locations of Indus River and will serve as a framework for similar river reaches.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"c51f90125e181ea4436eef82baa79835bfac20e38f1ab12d6198257428641dea","category":"Environment"}
