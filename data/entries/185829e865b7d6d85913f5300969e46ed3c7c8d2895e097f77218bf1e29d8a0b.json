{"title":"C1 Facetectomy and Ventral Fixation of Occipitoatlantoaxial Complex for Concurrent Congenital Atlanto-Occipital Dislocation and Atlantoaxial Instability in a Toy Poodle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0398/v1","date":1715080173000,"content":"An 8-month-old, 3.4 kg, castrated male Toy Poodle was referred for progressive tetraparesis and respiratory disorder without a history of trauma. Diagnostic imaging, including dynamic CT and MRI, revealed concurrent atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) and atlantoaxial instability (AAI) with spinal cord compression. This case was unique due to its congenital nature and the absence of trauma. The surgical intervention involved precise removal of the C1 vertebra's ventral articular facet, which was compressing on the spinal cord, attributed to its fixed and malaligned position within the atlantooccipital joint. Following facetectomy, the stabilization of the occipital bone to the C2 vertebra was achieved by screws, wire, and polymethyl methacrylate. Postoperative recovery was monitored with CT and radiographs, showing successful decompression and gradual improvement in gait, despite mild residual ataxia. The dog experienced postoperative complications with screw loosening at 114 days, which was managed successfully by extracting the problematic screws. Postoperatively, the dog showed a near-normal gait and experienced no pain through 21 months of monitoring. This case represents the first report of concurrent congenital AOD and AAI treated with ventral surgical approach, contributing new insights to the understanding and management of such complex cranio-cervical junction disorders in veterinary neurosurgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"185829e865b7d6d85913f5300969e46ed3c7c8d2895e097f77218bf1e29d8a0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
