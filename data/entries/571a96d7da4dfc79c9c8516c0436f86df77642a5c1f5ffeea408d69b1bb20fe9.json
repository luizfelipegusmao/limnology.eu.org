{"title":"A pgr5 suppressor screen uncovers two distinct suppression mechanisms and links cytochrome b6f complex stability to PGR5","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4245/7635904?rss=1","date":1711497600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5) is thought to promote cyclic electron flow, and its deficiency impairs photosynthetic control and increases photosensitivity of photosystem (PS) I, leading to seedling lethality under fluctuating light (FL). By screening for Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) suppressor mutations that rescue the seedling lethality of <span>pgr5</span> plants under FL, we identified a portfolio of mutations in 12 different genes. These mutations affect either PSII function, cytochrome <span>b</span><sub>6</sub><span>f</span> (cyt <span>b</span><sub>6</sub><span>f</span>) assembly, plastocyanin (PC) accumulation, the CHLOROPLAST FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE1 (cFBP1), or its negative regulator ATYPICAL CYS HIS-RICH THIOREDOXIN2 (ACHT2). The characterization of the mutants indicates that the recovery of viability can in most cases be explained by the restoration of PSI donor side limitation, which is caused by reduced electron flow to PSI due to defects in PSII, cyt <span>b</span><sub>6</sub><span>f</span>, or PC. Inactivation of cFBP1 or its negative regulator ACHT2 results in increased levels of the NADH dehydrogenase-like complex. This increased activity may be responsible for suppressing the <span>pgr5</span> phenotype under FL conditions. Plants that lack both PGR5 and DE-ETIOLATION-INDUCED PROTEIN1 (DEIP1)/NEW TINY ALBINO1 (NTA1), previously thought to be essential for cyt <span>b</span><sub>6</sub><span>f</span> assembly, are viable and accumulate cyt <span>b</span><sub>6</sub><span>f</span>. We suggest that PGR5 can have a negative effect on the cyt <span>b</span><sub>6</sub><span>f</span> complex and that DEIP1/NTA1 can ameliorate this negative effect.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"571a96d7da4dfc79c9c8516c0436f86df77642a5c1f5ffeea408d69b1bb20fe9","category":"Environment"}
