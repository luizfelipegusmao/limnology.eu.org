In mining, the equipment, tools, and techniques have changed significantly and continue to transform. This review work explores numerous such emerging problems and opportunities in different mining circumstances. The occupational safety and health management methods, as well as risk control technology allied with the mining industry, includes day-to-day management of operations, identification and assessment of risks, premature warning and active risk monitoring, etc. The research work in the safe and sustainable environment reveals that the major accidents occur due to natural calamity, human error, the control of which would ensure a sustainable and safe working environment for miners to a considerable extent. The present study proposed a smart and sustainable framework for a safe and clean environment for emerging safety and ergonomics issues through automated mining concept. The proposed framework has been developed by reviewing the previous research work related to mine safety, mine hazard, health, ergonomic issues, and mine automation.</p>","author":"Varun Tripathi, \nRituraj Singh Patwal","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"d3cb5c14d6d3492eb4a0b32eb51b8ce7219e0ddc44c1642087194330f716754a","category":"Environment"}
