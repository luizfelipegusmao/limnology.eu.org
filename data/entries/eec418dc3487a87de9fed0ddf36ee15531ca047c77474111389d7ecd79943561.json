{"title":"CarcSeq detection of lorcaserin-induced clonal expansion of Pik3ca H1047R mutants in rat mammary tissue","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/1/129/7690168?rss=1","date":1717804800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Lorcaserin is a 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (serotonin) receptor agonist and a nongenotoxic rat carcinogen, which induced mammary tumors in male and female rats in a 2-yr bioassay. Female Sprague Dawley rats were treated by gavage daily with 0, 30, or 100 mg/kg lorcaserin, replicating bioassay dosing but for shorter duration, 12 or 24 wk. To characterize exposure and eliminate possible confounding by a potentially genotoxic degradation product, lorcaserin and N-nitroso-lorcaserin were quantified in dosing solutions, terminal plasma, mammary, and liver samples using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. N-nitroso-lorcaserin was not detected, supporting lorcaserin classification as nongenotoxic carcinogen. Mammary DNA samples (<span>n</span> = 6/dose/timepoint) were used to synthesize PCR products from gene segments encompassing hotspot cancer driver mutations, namely regions of <span>Apc</span>, <span>Braf</span>, <span>Egfr</span>, <span>Hras</span>, <span>Kras</span>, <span>Nfe2l2</span>, <span>Pik3ca</span>, <span>Setbp1</span>, <span>Stk11</span>, and <span>Tp53</span>. Mutant fractions (MFs) in the amplicons were quantified by CarcSeq, an error-corrected next-generation sequencing approach. Considering all recovered mutants, no significant differences between lorcaserin dose groups were observed. However, significant dose-responsive increases in <span>Pik3ca</span> H1047R mutation were observed at both timepoints (ANOVA, <span>P </span>&lt;<span> </span>0.05), with greater numbers of mutants and mutants with greater MFs observed at 24 wk as compared with 12 wk. These observations suggest lorcaserin promotes outgrowth of spontaneously occurring <span>Pik3ca</span> H1047R mutant clones leading to mammary carcinogenesis. Importantly, this work reports approaches to analyze clonal expansion and demonstrates CarcSeq detection of the carcinogenic impact (selective <span>Pik3ca</span> H0147R mutant expansion) of a nongenotoxic carcinogen using a treatment duration as short as 3 months.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"eec418dc3487a87de9fed0ddf36ee15531ca047c77474111389d7ecd79943561","category":"Environment"}
