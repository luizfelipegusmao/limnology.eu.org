{"title":"Assumption based on Perelman-Einstein integration in Gravity Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0906/v1","date":1723539136000,"content":"This study introduces a new approach to modeling galaxy rotation curves by integrating concepts from Perelmanâ€™s functional with modifications to General Relativity. While initial numerical simulations indicate that our P-E Integration model may offer a closer fit to observed data than existing theories, we recognize the preliminary nature of these findings [14]. The results, though promising, should be interpreted cautiously. Further validation across different galactic systems and refinement of the model are necessary to confirm its broader applicability [15]. This work aims to contribute to the understanding of galactic dynamics, with the hope of opening new avenues for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dc8d287de4b508d8ccc5b437350eb9be4016f512fd7a638468aee766c0a5152","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
