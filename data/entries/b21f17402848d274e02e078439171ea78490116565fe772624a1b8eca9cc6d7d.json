These aim to inform customer purchasing and usage behaviors and are used by regulators to incentivize the replacement of older equipment with more environmentally-conscious choices. Currently, there is limited sustainability data available for large scientific infrastructures (such as magnetic resonance imagers, electron microscopes, and research furnaces, among many others). As a result, no scheme currently exists to fairly compare energy usage across different devices or between families of devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b21f17402848d274e02e078439171ea78490116565fe772624a1b8eca9cc6d7d","category":"Environment"}
