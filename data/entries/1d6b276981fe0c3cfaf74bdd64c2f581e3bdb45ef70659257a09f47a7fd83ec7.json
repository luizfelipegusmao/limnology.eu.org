{"title":"Solid State Additive Manufacturing of Thermoset Composites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1924/v1","date":1721818307000,"content":"This paper proposes an innovative approach to address the challenge of softening deformation of thermal-curable thermosets during additive manufacturing. This approach involves the development of a composite powder composed of thermosetting materials with distinct curing temperatures, the utilization of Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing (CSAM) technology for 3D printing, and the application of a stepwise isothermal curing process. The corresponding effectiveness is validated by case studies. The results demonstrate that samples printed via CSAM maintain a solid state without deformation. During the post-curing process, each component of the composite material cures independently while the other components remain in a solid state, providing structural support for the whole material, thereby effectively reducing the softening deformation during the post-curing process. This approach offers a novel perspective for the additive manufacturing of thermal-curable thermosets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d6b276981fe0c3cfaf74bdd64c2f581e3bdb45ef70659257a09f47a7fd83ec7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
