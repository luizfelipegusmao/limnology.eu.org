{"title":"A Review on Clinical Optoacoustic Imaging: Are We Close to Clinical Adoption?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1202/v2","date":1713835034000,"content":"Optoacoustic imaging is an emerging technology that holds great promise for improving general clinical practice since it offers a unique combination of optical absorption contrast, high resolution, and high penetration depth. This combination of factors provides a distinct advantage over alternative imaging modalities in oncology, cardiology, dermatology, or endocrinology among other medical fields. Optoacoustic technology affords the medical practitioner the possibility of visualizing light-absorbing biomolecules like water, lipids, oxy/deoxy hemoglobin, or melanin in deep tissue with relatively cheap and small form factor instruments, without the need of contrast agents or ionizing radiation. Moreover, exogenous fluorescent contrast agents like indocyanine green or methylene blue can also be observed. Driven by its potential for new applications in the clinic, the field has experienced intense changes in the last 20 years. Continuous technological advancements in instrumentation, image formation methods, or acquisition geometries, have led to the development of numerous clinical devices also motivating the creation of several startup companies that aim to translate the technology from the lab to the clinic. Thus, the question arises: how far are we from clinical adoption? In this article, we aim to shed light on such question by reviewing the clinical studies that have been performed in the last 10 years. Our intention is to go beyond the classical review format by providing a brief general overview of the steps that new imaging methods undergo on their journey from the lab to clinical adoption. Then we examine the progress that optoacoustic technology has made on such a journey.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac0c0bc9c64d93ad8b78d669eea768d1e4aa3dd31f6fe7a942d89291d5567410","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
