{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Prompt Strategies for LLMs: Single-Task vs. Multitasking Prompts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1334/v1","date":1729155061000,"content":"This study examines the impact of prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs), focusing on a comparison between multitasking and single-task prompts. Specifically, we explore whether a single prompt handling multiple tasks — such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and JSON output formatting — can achieve similar efficiency and accuracy to dedicated single-task prompts. The evaluation uses a combination of performance metrics to provide a comprehensive analysis of output quality. Experiments were conducted using a selection of open-source LLMs, including LLama3.1 8B, Qwen2 7B, Mistral 7B, Phi3 Medium, and Gemma2 9B. Results show that single-task prompts do not consistently outperform multitasking prompts, highlighting the significant influence of the model’s data and architecture on performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b28757620bfcbe03a0c5c1529cb466471d351c38abdc185eb4fc3c1d84fbcaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
