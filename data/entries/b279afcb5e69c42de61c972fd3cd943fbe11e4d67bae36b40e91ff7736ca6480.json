{"title":"Endomelanconiopsis endophytica Lipase Immobilized in Calcium Alginate for Production of Biodiesel from Waste Cooking Oil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2236/v1","date":1727443927000,"content":"The increasing global demand for biodiesel is due to the urgent need to replace mineral diesel with a fuel based on renewable energy sources. In this scenario, biocatalysis stands out as an efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to chemical catalysis. When associated with the use of immobilized enzymes, which allow their reuse in the process of obtaining biofuel, this approach makes production sustainable and reduces costs. In this sense, we investigated the use of the lipase produced by an Amazonian endophytic fungus in immobilized form as a biocatalyst in the transesterification of waste cooking oil for biodiesel production. The fungus Endomelanconiopsis endophytica QAT_7AC demonstrated high production of lipase. The lipolytic extract was precipitated in ethanol, which increased the specific enzyme activity by 28%. The lipolytic extract and the precipitated lipolytic extract were immobilized in calcium alginate beads. Immobilization efficiency was over 89%. The immobilized biocatalysts showed thermal stability (30-50 Â°C) and were used in the production of biodiesel using waste cooking oil and ethanol. It was possible to reuse them for up to four reaction cycles, with yields greater than 70%. These results prove the efficiency of immobilized biocatalysts in the production of ethyl esters from waste oils.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b279afcb5e69c42de61c972fd3cd943fbe11e4d67bae36b40e91ff7736ca6480","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
