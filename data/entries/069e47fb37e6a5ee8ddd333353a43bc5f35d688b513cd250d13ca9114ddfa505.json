{"title":"White matter disconnection impacts proprioception post-stroke","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310312","date":1726149600000,"content":"<p>by Matthew Chilvers, Trevor Low, Deepthi Rajashekar, Sean Dukelow</p>\r\n\r\nProprioceptive impairments occur in approximately 50â€“64% of people following stroke. While much is known about the grey matter structures underlying proprioception, our understanding of the white matter correlates of proprioceptive impairments is less well developed. It is recognised that behavioural impairments post-stroke are often the result of disconnection between wide-scale brain networks, however the disconnectome associated with proprioception post-stroke is unknown. In the current study, white matter disconnection was assessed in relation to performance on a robotic arm position matching (APM) task. Neuroimaging and robotic assessments of proprioception were collected for 203 stroke survivors, approximately 2-weeks post-stroke. The robotic assessment was performed in a KINARM Exoskeleton robotic device and consisted of a nine-target APM task. First, the relationship between white matter tract lesion load and performance on the APM task was assessed. Next, differences in the disconnectome between participants with and without impairments on the APM task were examined. Greater lesion load to the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF II and III), arcuate fasciculus (all segments) and fronto-insular tracts were associated with worse APM task performance. In those with APM task impairments, there was, additionally, disconnection of the posterior corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus and optic radiations. This study highlights an important perisylvian white matter network supporting proprioceptive processing in the human brain. It also identifies white matter tracts, important for relaying proprioceptive information from parietal and frontal brain regions, that are not traditionally considered proprioceptive in nature.","author":"Matthew Chilvers","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"069e47fb37e6a5ee8ddd333353a43bc5f35d688b513cd250d13ca9114ddfa505","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
