{"title":"An Artificial Intelligence Based Autonomous Road Lane Detection and Navigation System for Vehicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0350/v1","date":1717753378000,"content":"Lane detection is a foundational technology for autonomous driving systems. It involves identifying the boundaries of lanes on the road and ensuring the vehicle stays within these boundaries. Accurate lane detection is crucial for safety, navigation and traffic management. This paper presents an artificial intelligent based autonomous road lane detection and navigation system for vehicles. The system can detect and analyze road lanes accurately and efficiently in real-time, with frame rates of up to 17 FPS. By utilizing image processing techniques, the system can identify the location and boundaries of road lanes and obstacles on the road and provide accurate and reliable navigation guidance to the driver. The system is integrated with sensors and actuators to provide comprehensive autonomous navigation. The efficiency of the proposed system is demonstrated using accuracy of lane detection on straight and curve lanes covering frames per second and motor of the speed as parameters for assessment. Results show that the proposed system detects lane as entire lane detection, partial lane detection and no detection status on different settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02e6b7cc08ac2a1eb9eee87837e0b7efdf1cb347a863556339687cd6ca763c57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
