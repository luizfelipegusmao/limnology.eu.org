Juvenile bivalves are known to be able to absorb dissolved nutrients, but this ability has received minimal attention as a route for supplementary feeding. This study assessed the capacity of juvenile green-lipped mussels (GLMs) (<i>Perna canaliculus</i>) to uptake and assimilate dissolved glucose at five experimental concentrations (i.e. 10 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>, 100 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>, 1 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, 10 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> and 30 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) as a supplement to cultured microalgae. Growth and survival of the mussels were measured over 3 weeks. Although all glucose concentrations improved the performance of mussel spat compared to the control, the best performing was a concentration of 1 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> of dissolved glucose which enhanced daily spat growth 2.7 times that of the control live microalgal diet without glucose. Survival was high (i.e. &gt;95%) for all treatments except for the highest experimental concentration of glucose, for which a concentration of 30 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> resulted in mean mortality of 24%. Mussel spat supplemented with dissolved glucose accumulated up to 30% greater lipid and improved the carbohydrate content per mg g<sup>−1</sup> of ash-free dry weight as much as 3.5 times compared to those in the control treatment, indicating that they were in greater nutritional condition. This demonstration that dissolved glucose can be used to fuel growth by GLM spat at concentrations as low as 10 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> suggests that other soluble nutrients may also act as a supplemental feed for cultured juvenile molluscs. Dissolved nutrients have the potential to improve the performance of spat in nursery systems while simultaneously reducing the reliance of cultured microalgae as a sole feed input.</p>","author":"Andy Jordan, \nBrad Skelton, \nMaria Mugica, \nAndrew Jeffs","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture, Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be1e788988f9ff9949a6f7f759773ae166678ee7c383b954a977541fbea3ff","entryHash":"5ca9d2811426e9cd5615b000d8f2db2bffe9991fb79d44d8b23b0483665e1374","category":"Environment"}
