Dewey, or intermediate wheat grass (IWG), is being developed as the first widely-available perennial grain candidate. However, because the crop is still in development, grain yields are lower than those of traditional cereals. Utilization of its non-grain biomass (e.g. for biofuel production and as a source of fine chemicals) would increase the economic value of its cultivation. The present study provides a structural characterization of the lignin and cell wall carbohydrates in IWG biomass and qualitative profiling of biomass extractives and compares them to those of annual wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) biomass grown in the same location and growing season.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The monosaccharide composition and ester-linked phenolic acid contents of vegetative biomass material from annual wheat and IWG were similar. IWG vegetative biomass is rich in feruloylated arabinoxylans (AX) with a very low substitution rate, whereas the AX from IWG bran have a slightly higher substitution rate. The structure of IWG lignin was investigated using both the quantitative derivatization followed by reductive cleavage method and 2D-NMR analysis, revealing an H:G:S lignin that incorporates tricin and is acylated with coumaric acid and smaller amounts of ferulates. IWG and wheat extractives contained fatty acids, various free phenolic compounds (tricin, monolignols and phenolic acids), phenolic conjugates and phytosterols.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study provides firm support for the further exploration of <i>T. intermedium</i> biomass as a carbohydrate feedstock (e.g, abundant in lightly substituted AX and cellulose polymers) for biofuel production and source of high-value fine chemicals, such as tricin. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hannah Dräger, \nJustin Mobley, \nPoorya Kamali, \nMasoumeh Dorrani, \nBert Lynn, \nLee DeHaan, \nRachel R.
