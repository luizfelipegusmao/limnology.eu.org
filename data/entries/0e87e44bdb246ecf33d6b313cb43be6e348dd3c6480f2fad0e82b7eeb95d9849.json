{"title":"Brain mitochondrial damage attenuation by quercetin and N-acetyl cysteine: peripheral and central antiemetic effects","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae139/7749481?rss=1","date":1725494400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nausea serves as a protective mechanism in organisms to prevent excessive consumption of toxic substances. Due to the adverse effects of chemical anti-nausea drugs, there is a growing interest in using herbal remedies and natural antioxidants. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of quercetin (QU) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against oxidative damage induced by nausea. Emesis was induced in chickens using ipecac and copper sulfate (600 and 60 mg/kg, orally, respectively). QU and NAC (with doses of 50, 100, 200 mg/kg), and their combination were administered, along with a standard therapy (metoclopramide; MET 2 mg/kg) for one-time. Mitochondrial function, lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl (PC), glutathione level (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as oxidative damage biomarkers were evaluated in the chicken’s brain mitochondria. QU and NAC significantly reduced emesis induced by copper sulfate and ipecac compared to the control group (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Significant differences in oxidative damage were observed in the groups received of copper sulfate and ipecac compared with control group. Levels of LPO, ROS, and PC were significantly decreased after the administration of QU and NAC in emesis induced by copper sulfate and ipecac. While, mitochondrial function and GSH levels were increased after the administration of QU and NAC. Combination therapy with QU and NAC yielded the most effective results. This study suggests that QU and NAC possess antiemetic effects through both peripheral and central mechanisms and exhibit neuroprotective effects against oxidative brain damage induced by emesis by increasing plasma antioxidants or scavenging free radicals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"0e87e44bdb246ecf33d6b313cb43be6e348dd3c6480f2fad0e82b7eeb95d9849","category":"Environment"}
