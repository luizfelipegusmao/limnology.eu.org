Limited data availability from Southeast Asian countries, especially Indonesia, has impeded the disentanglement of post-stroke mortality determinants. This study aimed to investigate predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). This retrospective observational study used IS medical records from the National Brain Centre Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. A theoretically driven Cox’s regression and Fine-Gray models were established by controlling for age and sex to calculate the hazard ratio of each plausible risk factor for predicting in-hospital stroke mortality and addressing competing risks if they existed. This study finally included 3,278 patients with IS, 917 (28%) of whom had cardiovascular disease and 376 (11.5%) suffered renal disease. Bivariate exploratory analysis revealed lower blood levels of triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol associated with in-hospital-stroke mortality. The average age of patients with post-stroke mortality was 64.06 ± 11.32 years, with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 23.77 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 and an IQR of 5. Cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with IS mortality risk. NIHSS score at admission (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00–1.07), male sex (HR = 1.51[1.01–2.26] and uric acid level (HR = 1.02 [1.00–1.03]) predicted survivability. Comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (HR = 2.16 [1.37–3.40], pneumonia (HR = 2.43 [1.42–4.15] and sepsis (HR = 2.07 [1.09–3.94, had higher hazards for post-stroke mortality. Contrarily, the factors contributing to a lower hazard of mortality were BMI (HR = 0.94 [0.89–0.99]) and GCS (HR<sub>eye</sub> = 0.66 [0.48–0.89]. In summary, our study reported that male sex, NIHSS, uric acid level, cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, sepsis. BMI, and GCS on admission were strong determinants of in-hospital mortality in patients with IS.","author":"Nizar Yamanie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"378eac2eacf85518abcde0946a151fd27672148c81a353cb393e35631e5138e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
