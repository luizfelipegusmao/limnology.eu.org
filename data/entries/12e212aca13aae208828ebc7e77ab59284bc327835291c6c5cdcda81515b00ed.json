{"title":"Effects of dietary supplementation with Haematococcus pluvialis on the growth, antioxidantase activities, and gut microbiota of Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13060?af=R","date":1717392617000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Chinese mitten crab (<i>Eriocheir sinensis</i>) is bred extensively in Eastern and Northern China and faces a series of problems such as frequent diseases, germplasm degradation, and declining benefits, which have appeared to seriously affect the sustainable development of the cultivation industry. <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i>, a type of unicellular green algae, have been proven to be the suitable dietary supplementation in crustacean feeds. After 14 days of feeding with 5% dietary supplementation with <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> powder, the growth, antioxidantase activities, and gut microbiota of <i>E. sinensis</i> were analyzed. The results indicated that <i>H. pluvialis</i> powder could significantly improve growth indicators including weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) of <i>E. sinensis</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) declined, while that of phenoloxidase (PO) kept rising under the treatment of <i>H. pluvialis</i> powder. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity dropped initially and then increased. No significant differences in the Simpson index and Chao1 index in the control and <i>H. pluvialis</i> powder treatment were observed (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Although the dominant microbiota in the crab gut were not affected significantly by <i>H. pluvialis</i> powder, significant differences in the relative abundance of the dominant phyla between the control and <i>H. pluvialis</i> powder treatment groups were observed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Candidatus_Bacilloplasma, which play an important role in the life activities of <i>E. sinensis</i>, were significantly higher in the group treated by <i>H. pluvialis</i> powder than in the control (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, the <i>H. pluvialis</i> powder could be potentially used not only as a rapid fattening regulator, but also to improve the immunity and metabolic capacity of <i>E. sinensis</i>.</p>","author":"Yong Dou, \nXiangdong Bi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"12e212aca13aae208828ebc7e77ab59284bc327835291c6c5cdcda81515b00ed","category":"Environment"}
