However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 from <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher-order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The cryo-EM structure of NbNRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation and contribute to immune receptor autoinhibition. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways, possibly to minimise undesired cross-activation and evade pathogen suppression of immunity. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.","author":"Muniyandi Selvaraj","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"d13ad830183fcedf4f67f124a56b29cb0f94c86f93326d1b06a1ac85cd250033","category":"Environment"}
