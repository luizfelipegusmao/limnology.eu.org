{"title":"Obligatory Necessity Theory: Elements and Facts Influenced by the Intensity of the Specific Physical Concept","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1474/v5","date":1719391439000,"content":"The theory says that the first things to exist in the universe and the current moment were driven by an imperative need; that is, the intensities of the physical concept specify influence the existence of elements and facts based on the countless observations in physical spaces in relation to elements and facts. The existence of mandatory elements in space is motivated by the characteristics of the spaces that offer conditions for such an obligation. The theory states that the universe did not arise by chance; that is, the universe emerged through determination influenced by its surroundings. The objective of the study is to help explain the elements and facts of the universe from its origins to the present.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83971cfb6ec278a51165a3ed66382ef399b1a4b62ac9055b1605b01a187b6d60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
