{"title":"Mass Yield, Antioxidant and Anti-Prostate Cancer DU145 Cell Proliferative Properties of ProSoy Soymilk as Affected by Extraction Methods and Cooking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0724/v1","date":1715593510000,"content":"Both soybean variety and processing affect product characteristics. This studyâ€™s objective was to characterize the effect of four extraction methods (variations of soaking and grinding) combined with cooking on the content and composition of phenolic substances, antioxidant and anti-DU145 prostate cancer cell proliferative properties of soymilk prepared from a yellow soybean of the ProSoy variety, which is a high protein variety. Results showed soymilk processing yield was the greatest by Method 4, but Method 2 gave the highest solids and protein yields by about 14 and 12%, respectively. Method 4, a two-step grinding also increased yields (8 and 7%, for solids and protein, respectively), and in all but one instance produced higher total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), condensed tannin content (CTC) and total isoflavone content in both raw and cooked soymilk as compared to Method 1. Cooking soymilk reduced 14-17% of total phenolic substances.  Cooking reduced anticancer capacity of Method-4-prepared soymilk phenolic extract by increasing IC50 value from about 4.9 mg/mL to 6.8 mg/mL.   The increases in phenolic compounds and antioxidants produced in Prosoy soymilk by Methods 2 and 4 with simultaneous increases in product solids yield are significant to benefit the soymilk industry and consumer health. \nKeywords: ProSoy yellow soybean, soymilk processing, phenolics, isoflavones, antioxidant capacity, anti-DU145 prostate cancer proliferation","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c804b125ab2eed364c93202f23cc730cc556bd16d0e7be30974b430c90978686","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
