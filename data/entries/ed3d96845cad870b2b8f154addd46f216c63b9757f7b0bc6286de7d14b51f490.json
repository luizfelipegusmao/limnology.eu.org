{"title":"A new discovery of cryptic species in barred sand burrower Limnichthys fasciatus (Pisces: Creediidae) from the western Pacific, with evolutionary perspectives of anti‐equatorial species","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15927?af=R","date":1726556409000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Although the barred sand burrower, <i>Limnichthys fasciatus</i>, is widely distributed throughout the western Pacific, including Japan, Taiwan, and Australia, its morphology and genetics are poorly known. We discovered four cryptic species of <i>Limnichthys</i> from the western Pacific based on mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. Genetic distances showed remarkably large differences (12.7%–24.3% in COI and 7.9%–19.6% in 16S rRNA) between true <i>L</i>. <i>fasciatus</i> (type locality: southeastern Australia) and the others. A relaxed clock model with optimized selected substitution models showed that their deep divergence began in the middle Miocene epoch and subsequently diverged into the current cryptic species in the Plio-Pleistocene. A eurythermal common ancestor may have evolved independently in each region due to geographical events and paleoclimatic fluctuations, which made it possible for <i>L</i>. <i>fasciatus</i> complex to be an anti-equatorial species. Despite their deep genetic divergence, they showed marked phenotypic similarity, suggesting that they have experienced similar selective pressures related to their specific behavior.</p>","author":"Yu‐Jin Lee, \nJin‐Koo Kim","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"ed3d96845cad870b2b8f154addd46f216c63b9757f7b0bc6286de7d14b51f490","category":"Environment"}
