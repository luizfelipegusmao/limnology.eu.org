{"title":"A Mathematically Derived Unified Theoretical Framework Covering Special Relativity as a Special Case - &ldquo;Asymmetry Theory\"","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1330/v1","date":1729155548000,"content":"We mathematically derived a comprehensive theoretic framework “Asymmetry Theory”, based solely on the well-established principle of “the constancy of the velocity of light” without any other assumptions, like the ether. This paper proves that Asymmetry Theory encompasses all results of Special Relativity (STR) as a special case when the observer moves perpendicularly to the “source-observer” line. It explains everything STR does but extends beyond it, offering novel and groundbreaking insights. The longstanding controversies surrounding STR arise from its application outside its intended special case, hence, they are all resolved in Asymmetry Theory. Asymmetry Theory is supported by all experiments supporting STR, like Kaufmann, Ives-Stilwell, muon lifetime, nuclear reaction…., and those contradicting STR, like the Lunar range and GPS tests of light speed and the lack of transverse Doppler shift. Despite its mathematical rigorousness and all experimental evidence, we propose two new experiments to decisively test predictions from both theories.The mathematically derived Asymmetry Theory is a more comprehensive theoretical framework covering STR as a special case. It is self-consistent and theoretically proved by Maxwell’s equations. It does not contradict any established physical observations but instead resolves century-old controversies by providing a unified, mathematical and paradox-free explanation of key phenomena. Furthermore, its groundbreaking results offer a unified perspective across various distinct laws of physics, including: A formula for light velocity mathematically explains the Sagnac effect, one-way light speed, stellar aberration, Michelson-Morley, Hafele-Keating and Optic clocks. Electrodynamics formulas encompass particle acceleration, Mass-Energy and matter wave. A unified formula for all cases of classical and transverse Doppler effects covers time-varying Doppler effect, cosmological redshift, and Cherenkov radiation. A generalized form of Maxwell's equations for moving observers directly derives the formulas for light speed, Doppler effect and Sagnac effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7b15618acbeacb5ec97e7453384e99d38e96a7937775db12e349ce3b3d82720","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
