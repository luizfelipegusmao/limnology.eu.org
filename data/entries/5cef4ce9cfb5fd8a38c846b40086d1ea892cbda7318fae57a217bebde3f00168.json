{"title":"Physics-Informed Neural Network for Solving a 1-Dimensional Solid Mechanics Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1861/v1","date":1727174163000,"content":"Our objective in this work is to demonstrate how Physics-Informed Neural Networks,\na type of deep learning technology, can be utilized to examine the mechanical properties\nof a helicopter blade. The blade is regarded as a prismatic cantilever beam that is\nexposed to triangular loading, and comprehending its mechanical behavior is of utmost\nimportance in the aerospace field. PINNs utilize the physical information, including differential\nequations and boundary conditions, within the loss function of the neural network\nto approximate the solution. Our approach determines the overall loss by aggregating\nthe losses from the differential equation, boundary conditions, and data. We employed a\nPhysics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with\nequivalent hyperparameters to solve a fourth-order differential equation. By comparing\nthe performance of the PINN model against the analytical solution of the equation and\nthe results obtained from the ANN model, we have conclusively shown that the PINN\nmodel exhibits superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency when addressing\nhigh-order differential equations that govern physics-based problems. In conclusion,\nthe study demonstrates that PINN offers a superior alternative for addressing solid mechanics\nproblems with applications in the aerospace industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cef4ce9cfb5fd8a38c846b40086d1ea892cbda7318fae57a217bebde3f00168","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
