{"title":"Effects of microalgae diets on growth, proximate, and fatty acid composition of black mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13050?af=R","date":1707888042000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study evaluates the growth, proximate, and fatty acid composition of black mussel, <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> fed four marine microalgae (<i>Pavlova lutheri</i>, <i>Nannochloropsis oculata</i>, <i>Diacronema vlkianum</i> and <i>Rhinomonas reticulata</i>) diets for 21 days. Black mussel is a common bivalve species that has been recognized as important for marine aquaculture with increasing production in the last two decades. The mussel group fed <i>N. oculata</i> showed a significantly lower survival rate than the other groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Shell height, length, and width of mussels were measured. The height and length of the mussel group fed <i>N. oculata</i> were statistically higher than other experimental groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Shell width did not show any significant differences among groups (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The microalgae <i>N. oculata</i> showed the highest protein content whereas <i>P. lutheri</i> had the highest crude lipid content among dietary treatments. The group fed <i>P. lutheri</i> showed significantly higher protein, lipid, and ash contents among experimental groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The <i>D. vlkianum</i> diet enhanced the highest docosahexaenoic acid level in black mussels. Black mussel fed <i>P. lutheri</i> showed the highest eicosapentaenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid levels. Arachidonic acid was found to be similar among experimental groups. In our study, <i>P. lutheri</i> and <i>D. vlkianum</i> had outstanding results on survival, growth, and essential fatty acid accumulation in mussel culture.</p>","author":"Kamil Mert Eryalçın, \nZeynep Sena Pınarbaşı, \nSare Sena Turk, \nMerve Tınkır","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"5369fbf2b472d23797414a9871161d4e95896ba64359dcd80f51ef79a26905b6","category":"Environment"}
