Liquid bioaerosol droplets with sizes between 1 – 100 μm are readily generated by human respiratory/vocal activities, such as talking, coughing, and breathing [<a href=\"#ozae044.853-B1\">1</a>]. These liquid particles are produced within the lungs, where the relative humidity (RH) is ∼100%, and rapidly dry once exposed to atmospheric RH (≤ 80% RH) to form either solid or semi-solid particles. The resulting particle morphology and drying rate during this phase transition have been suggested to impact the virus viability within these bioaerosols [<a href=\"#ozae044.853-B2\">2-4</a>]. For instance, Huynh <span>et al.</span> showed evidence of a semi-solid phase-state exhibited by model human respiratory aerosols under decreasing RH that could provide a viscous, protective layer for viral particles from salts [<a href=\"#ozae044.853-B2\">2</a>]. However, the detailed dynamics of the drying process and how it impacts the final structure of solid bioaerosols remain unknown due to a lack of observations of this nanometer scale dynamic process. <span>In situ</span> transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allows for the visualization of relevant nano-scale processes (<span>e.g.</span>, phase-separation, nucleation) under controlled environmental conditions that may not be clearly resolved by conventional optical or fluorescence microscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1a23f95b461c985418ce11871859b3dbd75fefe7c92dbf942fee7f0e2ae4d8b5","category":"Environment"}
