This approach demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to traditional methods proposed in previous research. This article describes a new method for solving the factorization problem, based on the gradient descent algorithm, and demonstrates the transition from algebraic methods to approaches based on functional analysis. The proposed approach not only improves the efficiency of solving the problem but also allows the application of computational algorithms of functional analysis, opening new possibilities for research and optimization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab262834ed0dd1dba369f1d588cbd9c57abe85b6882c3d07bdbdeeee29cfa12e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
