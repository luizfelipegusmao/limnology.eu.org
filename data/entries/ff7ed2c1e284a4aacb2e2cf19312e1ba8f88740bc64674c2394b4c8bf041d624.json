{"title":"2D Behavior of Gravity at Large Distances","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202308.0891/v5","date":1715594991000,"content":"We show that the entropy or information flow of a gravitational system constrains the dependence of gravitational force on radial distance r which for very large r is equivalent to gravity in two dimensions. This explains the \"origin\" of dark matter and provides a natural solution to the problem of flat rotation curves of galaxies at very large distances and a larger deflection angle for a gravitational lens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff7ed2c1e284a4aacb2e2cf19312e1ba8f88740bc64674c2394b4c8bf041d624","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
