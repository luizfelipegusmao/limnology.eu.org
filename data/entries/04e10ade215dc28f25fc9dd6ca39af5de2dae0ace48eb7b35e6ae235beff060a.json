However, information about their synergistic effects on cognitive function is still limited. Here, we investigated the synergistic effects of tilapia head protein hydrolysate (THPH) and walnut protein hydrolysate (WPH) in mitigating CI induced by scopolamine in mice.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that the combined supplementation of THPH and WPH (mass ratio, 1:1) was superior to either individual supplement in enhancing spatial memory and object recognition abilities in CI mice, and significantly lessened brain injury in CI mice by alleviating neuronal damage, reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing the cholinergic system. In addition, the combined supplementation was found to be more conducive to remodeling the gut microbiota structure in CI mice by not only remarkably reducing the ratio of <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidota</i>, but also specifically enriching the genus <i>Roseburia</i>. On the other hand, the combined supplementation regulated the disorders of sphingolipid and amino acid metabolism in CI mice, particularly upregulating glutathione and histidine metabolism, and displayed a stronger ability to increase the expression of genes and proteins related to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB/CrEB signaling pathway in the brain.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These findings demonstrate that tilapia head and walnut-derived protein hydrolysates exerted synergistic effects in ameliorating CI, which was achieved through modulation of gut microbiota, serum metabolic pathways and BDNF signaling pathways.
