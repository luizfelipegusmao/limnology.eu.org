One of the ventures reliant upon the Web is finance. Pattern prediction and risk reduction in the stock market and other financial decisions are made possible by some technologies. These technologies promise to expand innovation, knowledge, and efficiency opportunities in the financial sector. Finance frequently uses machine learning technology to identify risks based on probabilistic statistics and historical data to support investment decisions. Additionally, it can be utilized for risk assessment and risk management planning. Internet technology, which enables real-time data analysis, streamlined transactions, and improved customer communication, has particularly benefited the financial sector. However, these advancements come with significant challenges, such as the need for robust online credit protection and security threats.
