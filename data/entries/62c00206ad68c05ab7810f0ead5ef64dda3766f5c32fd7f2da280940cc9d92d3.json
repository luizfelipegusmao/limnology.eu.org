{"title":"Enhancing Gelatine Hydrogel Robustness with Sacran-aldehyde: A Natural Crosslinker Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0711/v1","date":1720501220000,"content":"Tunable hydrogels have gained significant attention in the bioengineering field due to their designer preparation approach. Towards this end, gelatine stands out as a promising candidate owing to the desirable attributes, such as biocompatibility, ability to support cell adhesion and proliferation, biodegradability, along with being cost-effective. This study presents the preparation of a robust gelatine hydrogel employing sacran dialdehyde (SDA) as a natural crosslinker. The resulting SDA-crosslinked gelatine hydrogels (GSDA) display an optimal compressive stress of 0.15 MPa at 50% strain, five times higher as compared to pure gelatine hydrogel. As SDA crosslinking concentration is increased, swelling capacity of GSDA declines. Probing further with FTIR spectroscopy and SEM at the micron-scale unveiled a dual-crosslinking mechanism within the hydrogels. This mechanism encompasses both short- and long-range covalent crosslinking, along with thermo-reversible physical crosslinking, resulting in a significant enhancement of the load-bearing capacity of the fabricated hydrogels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62c00206ad68c05ab7810f0ead5ef64dda3766f5c32fd7f2da280940cc9d92d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
