{"title":"Quantitative Analysis of the Fractional Fokker–Planck Levy Equation via a Modified Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0525/v1","date":1728374512000,"content":"An innovative approach is utilized in this paper to solve the Fractional Fokker–Planck–Levy (FFPL) equation. A hybrid technique is designed by combining the finite difference method (FDM), Adams numerical technique, and physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture, namely, the FDM-APINN, to solve the fractional Fokker‒Planck‒Levy (FFPL) equation numerically. Two scenarios of the FFPL equation are considered by varying the value of α (i.e., 1.75,1.85). Moreover, three cases of each scenario are numerically studied for different discretized domains with 100,200 and 500 points in x∈[-1,1] and t∈[0,1]. For the FFPL equation, solutions are obtained via the FDM-APINN technique via 1000,2000, and 5000 iterations. The errors, loss function graphs, and statistical tables are presented to validate our claim that the FDM-APINN is a better alternative intelligent technique for handling fractional-order partial differential equations with complex terms. FDM-APINN can be extended by using nongradient-based bioinspired computing for higher-order fractional partial differential equations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58ab0480478885af88ca515eaa8544e5393603b79e00c750248aad9a1bc9ff31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
