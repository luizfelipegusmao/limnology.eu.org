{"title":"Exploring Cyclists Behavior, Traffic Safety Literacy, and Crash Occurrence in Latvia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1219/v1","date":1716201447000,"content":"While the role of safe riding behavior as a safety contributor for cyclists has been increasingly studied in recent years, there have been few studies analysing cycling behavior in relation to crash-related outcomes in Baltic countries. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this issue has been addressed in the case of Latvia. Aim: The objective of this study was to assess the relationships among self-repotted cyclists’ behavior, traffic safety literacy, and their cycling crash involvement rates. Method: A total of 299 cyclists aged M=32.8 from across Latvia (42% females) participated in an online survey, which comprised questions regarding respondents’ demographics, frequency of riding, and the number of crashes in the past five years. The Cycling Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) and the Cyclist Risk Perception and Regulation Scale (RPRS) were applied to assess cyclists' behavior patterns and traffic safety literacy. Results: According to the findings, it can be inferred that cyclists frequently engage in riding errors and traffic violations while cycling. Those who exhibit more antisocial behavior patterns are also more likely to be involved in road crashes. Conversely, cyclists with greater positive behavior rates more often also tend to possess better knowledge of traffic rules and exhibit a heightened risk perception, indicating a greater awareness of road traffic safety. Conclusion: All in sum, this study underscores key age differences, with older individuals significantly less involved in riding crashes, exhibiting fewer driving errors and a higher level of risk perception, which serves as a crucial factor in road safety. At the practical level, these results stress the need to address both traffic safety literacy and protective cycling factors of cyclists, in a manner to improve overall road safety and promote active transport modes in Latvia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5fa3462282c5040d6620c423c6c46a7ccb0a15d6b44bf4687550b245db069ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
