{"title":"Lactylation: A Novel Post-Translational Modification with Clinical Implications in CNS Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1493/v1","date":1721348786000,"content":"Lactate, an important metabolic product, provides energy to neural cells during energy depletion or high demand and acts as a signaling molecule in the central nervous system. Recent studies revealed that lactate-mediated protein lactylation regulates gene transcription and influences cell fate, metabolic processes, inflammation, and immune responses. This review comprehensively examines the regulatory roles and mechanisms of lactylation in neurodevelopment, neuropsychiatric disorders, brain tumors, and cerebrovascular diseases. This analysis indicates that lactylation has multifaceted effects on central nervous system function and pathology, particularly in hypoxia-induced brain damage. Highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic target, lactylation may play a significant role in treating neurological diseases. By summarizing current findings, this review aims to provide insights and guide future research and clinical strategies for central nervous system disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a755df023d64f35cc005c0e2c06fa12db6b030c6bbfe70f27482fc370932ceb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
