{"title":"Advances in Dendritic Cell-Based Vaccines Against Respiratory Fungal Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2092/v1","date":1721966539000,"content":"Ever since the discovery of dendritic cells by Ralph Steinman and Zanvil Cohn in 1973, it is increasingly evident that dendritic cells are integral for adaptive immune responses, and there is an undeniable focus on them for vaccines development. Fungal infections, often thought in-nocuous, are becoming significant threats due to increased immunocompromised or im-mune-suppressed population and climate change. Further, the recent COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the wrath of fungal infections and devastating outcomes. Invasive fungal infections cause significant case fatality rates ranging from 20% to 90%. Regrettably, no licensed fungal vaccines exist, and there is an urgent need for preventive and therapeutic purposes. In this re-view, we discuss the ontogeny, subsets, tissue distribution, and functions of lung dendritic cells. In the latter part, we summarize and discuss the studies on the DC-based vaccines against pulmonary fungal infections. Finally, we highlight some emerging potential avenues that can be incorporated for DC-based vaccines against fungal infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37e64b2bd44967003a304a4c2d76faa83d51f5f343464da3e6bfe7351d83b8f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
