{"title":"HIV Protein Nef Induces Cardiomyopathy through Induction of Bcl2 and p21","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0445/v1","date":1725526830000,"content":"HIV-associated cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of death in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Although antiretroviral drugs suppress the viral load, they fail to remove the virus entirely. HIV-1 Nef protein is known to play a role in viral virulence and HIV latency. Expression of Nef protein can be detected in different organs, including cardiac tissue. Despite the established role of Nef protein in HIV-1 replication, its impact on organ function inside the human body is not clear. To understand the effect of Nef at the organ level, we created a new Nef transgenic (Nef-TG) mouse that expresses Nef protein in the heart. Our study found that Nef expression caused inhibition of cardiac function and pathological changes in the heart with increased fibrosis, leading to heart failure and early mortality. Further, we found that cellular autophagy is significantly inhibited in cardiac tissue of Nef-TG mice. Mechanistically, we found that Nef protein causes the accumulation of Bcl2 and Beclin-1 protein in the tissue, which may affect the cellular autophagy system. Additionally, we found Nef expression causes upregulation of cellular senescence marker p21, and senescence-associated ÔÅ¢-galactosidase expression. Our findings suggested that Nef-mediated inhibition of autophagy and induction of senescence markers may promote aging in the PLWHA. Our mouse model could help us to understand the effect of Nef protein on organ function during latent HIV infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"240491f423b9558730de532083102f87c67297a56af1c9cf0c96a34ec3b9d6be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
