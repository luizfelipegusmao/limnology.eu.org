{"title":"Do Different Types of Dental Micro Applicators Influence the Amount of Surface Contamination during Clinical Procedures?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1942/v1","date":1721814400000,"content":"In the context of restorative dentistry and the use of different techniques and dental adhesive systems, this study was to designed to assess the degree of adhesive absorption and wetting for each dental micro applicator; and also quantify the amount of lost fiber flocks after three applications of dental adhesive on the inside surface of a plastic veneer tooth in order to reveal a potential contaminating factor at the adhesive interface. Initially, one drop of dental adhesive was dispensed into a glass dental mixing well. The dental adhesive was then applied onto the inside surface of the veneer restoration for 30s using a dental micro applicator which was weighed afterwards. For each dental micro applicator, this sequence was repeated three times and measured again by the same operator. Each adhesive application was analyzed separately, to show the values independently and compare them to the initial weight. The samples of Fiber-Free Elastomer Bristle Micro Applicators (FEBM) demonstrated the best performance with a good degree of absorption and wetting of the dental adhesive without the loss fiber flocks and release-induced weight loss. The samples of Conventional Fiber Flocked Micro Applicators (CFFM) demonstrated good initial absorption and wetting of the dental adhesive, but visually shed several fiber flocks which resulted in significant weight loss and can also be considered a contaminating factor at the adhesive interface.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50d476a485835d44f5e5af2be0c3857d0a3bf792d144df80e57cdc6e8d7d5a8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
