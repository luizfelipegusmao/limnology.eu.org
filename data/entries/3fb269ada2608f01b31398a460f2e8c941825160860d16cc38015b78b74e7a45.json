{"title":"French Cancer Incidence and Mortality from 2007 to 2016 in Terms of Solar UVB and Obesity: An Ecological Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0701/v2","date":1724653694000,"content":"Background: Many risk-modifying factors affect cancer incidence and mortality rates. Solar UVB reduces cancer risk by producing vitamin D, which has many mechanisms to reduce risk of cancer incidence, progression, and metastasis. Obesity increases cancer risk through several mechanisms, including increased inflammation. Method and Materials. We present an ecological study (a type of observational study) of incidence and/or mortality rates for cancers during 2007â€“2016 of 17 anatomical sites with respect to solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) doses and obesity prevalence. Data were averaged for 12 geographical regions. Results: Solar UVB doses were significantly inversely correlated with incidence rates for three types of cancer for males. They were inversely correlated with mortality rates for five cancers for males and four for females. Obesity prevalence was directly correlated with mortality rates for three cancers for males and seven for females. Discussion: The ecological approach has certain limitations, such as its sensitivity only to regional variations in relation to specific risk-modifying factors. In this study, these limitations include numerous factors influencing cancer risk and the fact that the data are averaged across entire regional populations, which may not reflect individual risks. Despite this, the study reveals important correlations. Specifically, it found that solar UVB exposure is linked to a lower risk of certain cancers, while obesity is associated with an increased risk of some cancers in France. These findings are consistent with results from a similar study in the United States on cancer rates between 2016 and 2020. The association between obesity and cancer risk aligns with other observational studies. However, it is uncertain to what extent higher solar UVB exposure or elevated serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels might mitigate the impact of obesity on cancer risk. Reducing cancer mortality in France may be achievable through vitamin D supplementation and efforts to lower obesity prevalence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fb269ada2608f01b31398a460f2e8c941825160860d16cc38015b78b74e7a45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
