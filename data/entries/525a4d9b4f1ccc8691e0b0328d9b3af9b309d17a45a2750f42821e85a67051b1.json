Up-regulation of Myc protein level rather than acquisition of neomorphic properties appears to underlie most Myc-driven cancers. Cellular mechanisms governing Myc expression remain incompletely defined. In this study, we show that ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) plays a critical role in maintaining Myc protein level. Ribosomes stall during the synthesis of the N-terminal portion of cMyc, generating aberrant cMyc species and necessitating deployment of the early RQC factor ZNF598 to handle translational stress and restore <span>cMyc</span> translation. ZNF598 expression is up-regulated in human glioblastoma (GBM), and its expression positively correlates with that of cMyc. ZNF598 knockdown inhibits human GBM neurosphere formation in cell culture and Myc-dependent tumor growth in vivo in <span>Drosophila</span>. Intriguingly, the SARS-COV-2-encoded translational regulator Nsp1 impinges on ZNF598 to restrain cMyc translation and consequently cMyc-dependent cancer growth. Remarkably, Nsp1 exhibits synthetic toxicity with the translation and RQC-related factor ATP-binding cassette subfamily E member 1, which, despite its normally positive correlation with cMyc in cancer cells, is co-opted by Nsp1 to down-regulate cMyc and inhibit tumor growth. Ribosome stalling during <span>c-myc</span> translation thus offers actionable cancer cell vulnerability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"525a4d9b4f1ccc8691e0b0328d9b3af9b309d17a45a2750f42821e85a67051b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
