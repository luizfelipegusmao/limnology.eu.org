A comprehensive understanding of the magnitude of AMR, particularly highly public health important pathogens such as <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, is necessary for the management of infections based on local information.</p> Objective <p>This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the country-wide AMR of <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>.</p> Methods <p>Systematic searches were performed to retrieve articles from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect electronic databases, Google Scholar search engine, and repository registrars from 2015 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2023. Twenty-three studies that provided important data on AMR in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> were systematically reviewed and analyzed to determine the country-wide magnitude of <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> AMR profile from healthcare-associated infections. AMR of <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> to 10 different antibiotics were extracted separately into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using STATA 17.0. Cohen’s kappa was computed to determine the agreement between reviewers, the Inverse of variance (I<sup>2</sup>) was used to evaluate heterogeneity across studies, and Egger’s test to identify publication bias. A random effect model was used to determine the pooled resistance to each antibiotic. Subgroup analysis was performed by infection type and year of publication.</p> Results <p>This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> in clinical specimens associated with HAI was 4.38%(95%CI: 3.00–5.76). The pooled prevalence of AMR in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> for different antibiotics varies, ranging from 20.9% (95%CI: 6.2–35.8) for amikacin to 98.72% (95%CI: 96.39–101.4) for ceftriaxone. The pooled resistance was higher for ceftriaxone (98.72%), Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75.41), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (91.2). In contrast relatively lower AMR were observed for amikacin (20.9%) and meropenem (28.64%). The pooled multi-drug resistance (MDR) in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> was 80.5% (95%CI: 66.25–93.84). Upon subgroup analysis by infection types and year of publication, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> isolated from healthcare-associated infections exhibited higher resistance to ceftazidime (94.72%) compared to isolates from mixed types of healthcare-associated infections (70.84%) and surgical site infections (57.84%). Antimicrobial resistance in gentamicin was higher during the periods of 2018–2020 (73.96%), while comparatively lower during 2021–2023 (42.69%) and 2015–2017 (29.82%)</p> Conclusions <p>Significantly high AMR and MDR were observed from this systematic review and meta-analysis. AMR obtained from this systematic review and meta-analysis urges the need for improved infection control, antimicrobial stewardship practices, and strengthened surveillance systems to control the spread of AMR and ensure effective treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.</p> Protocol registration <p>This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (Registration ID: CRD42024518145).</p>","author":"Zelalem Asmare","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b2eecc7ddb3a5232391822e0c2ed51a4ec1994aa3fc4bbc6ac4f8df95d513f56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
