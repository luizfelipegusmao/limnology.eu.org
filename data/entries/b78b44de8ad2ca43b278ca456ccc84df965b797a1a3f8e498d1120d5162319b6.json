{"title":"Advanced Visitor Profiling for Personalized Museum Experiences Using Telemetry-Driven Smart Badges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1570/v1","date":1724240011000,"content":"This paper presents an innovative methodology for enhancing museum visitor experiences through personalized content delivery using a combination of explicit and implicit visitor profiling. The approach integrates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) smart badges to collect telemetry data, enabling precise visitor localization and dynamic group formation based on real-time proximity and shared interests. Initial profiling begins with OAuth registration and brief surveys, which is then refined through continuous tracking of exhibit interactions and time spent at each exhibit. An AI-driven system delivers content to individual and group profiles, fostering both personalized learning and social interaction. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional profiling by adapting to visitor behaviors in real-time while maintaining a strong focus on data privacy and ethical considerations. The proposed system not only enhances engagement and satisfaction but also sets the stage for future advancements in personalized cultural experiences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b78b44de8ad2ca43b278ca456ccc84df965b797a1a3f8e498d1120d5162319b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
