However, prevailing explanations require that networks grow over time, an assumption that fails in some real-world settings. Here, we explain how scale-free structure can emerge without growth through network self-organization. Beginning with an arbitrary network, we allow connections to detach from random nodes and then reconnect under a mixture of preferential and random attachment. While the numbers of nodes and edges remain fixed, the degree distribution evolves toward a power-law with an exponent γ=1+1p that depends only on the proportion <span>p</span> of preferential (rather than random) attachment. Applying our model to several real networks, we infer <span>p</span> directly from data and predict the relationship between network size and degree heterogeneity. Together, these results establish how scale-free structure can arise in networks of constant size and density, with broad implications for the structure and function of complex systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"dff1045156e92d39dbe76ae7c78143580327f89a33deaee17833d562918504d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
