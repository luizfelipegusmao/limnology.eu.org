{"title":"High salinity tolerance of Zn-rich CNx in the photocatalytic treatment of wastewater","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1750/v1","date":1716802799000,"content":"physicochemical methods was effective for the degradation of organics, but was highly hampered by the salt coexist in the complex wastewater matrix, resulting in low degradation dynamics. In this study, ZnO loaded carbon nitride (Zn-CNx) was synthesized and exhibited an excellent performance for 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation (0.63 mg/L/min) in photcatalysis system. The doping of Zn into CNx contributed to the increased light absorption of the catalyst and the optimized electron transport pathways. The quenching experiment results proved that the superoxide radicals (·O2-) played a dominant role and hydroxyl radical (·OH) played a secondary role. Notably, the 2,4-DCP removal increased slightly with increasing salt content. As the initial pH increased from 3 to 11, the first-order degradation kinetic constants increased significantly, and the final pH was equilibrized in the range of 6.01-6.59. This study provided a high performance catalyst for photcatalysis and the mechanism for the effective degradation of 2,4-DCP under high salinity condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f04b0284de83ded93de86c0ae2d1b266b9afb293738a46516259576b6e1d3875","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
