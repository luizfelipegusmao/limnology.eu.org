{"title":"Heavy Metals Interactions with Neuroglia and Gut Microbiota: Implications for Huntington’s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0801/v1","date":1718196975000,"content":"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare but progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by involuntary movements, cognitive decline, executive dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression. It follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Thus, a child who has a parent with the mutated huntingtin (mHTT) gene has a 50% chance of developing the disease. Since HTT protein is involved in many critical cellular processes including neurogenesis, brain development, energy metabolism, transcriptional regulation, synaptic activity, vesicle trafficking, cell signaling, and autophagy, its aberrant aggregates lead to disruption of numerous cellular pathways and neurodegeneration. Essential heavy metals are vital at low concentrations, however, at higher concentrations, can exacerbate HD by disrupting the glial-neuronal communication, and/or causing dysbiosis (disturbance in the gut microbiota, GM), both of which can lead to neuroinflammation and further neurodegeneration. Here, we discuss in detail the interactions of iron, manganese and copper with glial-neuron communication and GM and indicate how this knowledge may pave the way for development of a new generation of disease-modifying therapies in HD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"faeef1864241d249a00847d11afaff15196a414bde2fbd9c3afd3af81c575ba0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
