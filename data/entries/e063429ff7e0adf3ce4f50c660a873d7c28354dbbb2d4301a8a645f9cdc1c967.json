{"title":"Wildfires, Vulnerability, and Climate Change: Methodology and Application to the Regions of Greece #","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0081/v1","date":1714622785000,"content":"The paper provides a methodological framework based on Multiple Criteria Decision Aid methods for determining relative regional vulnerabilities associated with forest fires that occurred during a given period. Different notions of ex-post vulnerability are defined based on the forest area burned and the frequency of forest fires, and their relation to the regions’ area and several socioeconomic characteristics. The methodology is applied to Greece and its administrative regions for the period 2000–2022. Linking the forest fire events with summer and spring temperatures and precipitation and using econometric count data analysis, the paper explores the climatic drivers of forest fire occurrence and provides projections of the expected change in the frequency of fires of specific size classes conditional on the evolution of mean seasonal regional temperature and precipitation according to IPCC scenarios. The results regarding relative regional vulnerabilities and expected forest fires could be useful in designing policies for preserving forests as natural capital and promoting sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e063429ff7e0adf3ce4f50c660a873d7c28354dbbb2d4301a8a645f9cdc1c967","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
