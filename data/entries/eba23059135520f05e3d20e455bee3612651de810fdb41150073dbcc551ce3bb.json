{"title":"Revealing Mass Transport Mechanisms and Pathways across Materials Using Isotopic Tracers and Atom Probe Tomography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.034/7719457?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>With its combination of high-spatial resolution, 3D imaging, and isotopic sensitivity, atom probe tomography (APT) provides a unique platform with which to study solid-state transport phenomena and mechanisms. In this presentation, I will discuss recent technique developments for combining isotopic tracers and APT, and its application to iron-based metals and oxides, which are of broad scientific and applied significance ranging from geochemistry to catalysis to nuclear environments. Whether considering the autocatalytic reactivity of surfaces during mineral recrystallization [<a href=\"#ozae044.034-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.034-B2\">2</a>], self-diffusion within bulk metals or oxides with embedded isotope tracers [<a href=\"#ozae044.034-B3\">3</a>], or diverse oxygen transport pathways existing across metal-oxide heterostructures [<a href=\"#ozae044.034-B4\">4</a>], APT is a powerful technique for capturing subtle atomic transport phenomena with unprecedented detail. Further, utilization of <span>in situ</span> atom probe capabilities enables high controllability of reactions at localized regions of interest, thereby enabling clear observation and quantification of self-diffusion (Fig. 1). Through these examples and experiences, I will also discuss challenges associated with this approach as well as potential new research opportunities [<a href=\"#ozae044.034-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"eba23059135520f05e3d20e455bee3612651de810fdb41150073dbcc551ce3bb","category":"Environment"}
