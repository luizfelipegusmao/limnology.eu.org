{"title":"Comparison of Indocyanine Green with conventional tracers for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: A multidisciplinary evaluation of clinical effectiveness, safety, organizational and economic impact","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309336","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Maria Pinelli, Chiara Gerardi, Emanuele Lettieri, Madalina Maioru, Laura Marone, Lorenzo Bertoldi, Giuseppe Navanteri, Maurizio Costantini, Claudio Botti, Francesca Pellini</p>\r\nBackground <p>Breast cancer is a global health problem, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard procedure for early-stage breast cancer. Technetium-99 (TC-99), alone or combined with blue dye (BD) are conventional tracers for SLNB, but they have safety, availability, and cost limitations. Indocyanine green (ICG) is an alternative tracer that has been gaining acceptance among healthcare professionals. This study aimed at assessing the clinical and economic value of ICG in hospital settings, using the health technology assessment (HTA) framework.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ICG for SLNB, based on literature sources and data collected from two Italian hospitals that switched from TC-99 to ICG. We analyzed ICG’s technical attributes through technology documentation and relevant databases. We performed a systematic literature review of 36 studies to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of ICG. We obtained organizational insights from clinicians and the clinical engineer involved in the study. We applied Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) and Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) to estimate the economic impact of ICG. The ethical, legal, and social implications of ICG were considered through clinicians’ inputs and technology documentation.</p> Results <p>Our results showed that ICG had equivalent or superior clinical effectiveness compared to TC-99 and BD, with minimal adverse events. ICG simplified the surgical pathways, by streamlining procedures, reducing waiting times, and increasing flexibility in scheduling surgeries. Moreover, the TDABC analysis showed significant cost reductions by avoiding the need for pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy and hospitalization, with average savings per single care pathway of around 18% for ICG compared to TC-99. Finally, ICG improved patient experience, and proved regulatory compliance.</p> Conclusions <p>This study provided strong evidence for ICG’s clinical and economic value for SLNB in breast cancer. It ascertained ICG as a valuable alternative to conventional tracers, ensuring clinical effectiveness along with economic and organizational benefits.</p>","author":"Maria Pinelli","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"49a4882129e8e0df3d10221c267d6e1f91ed90259fccf966dd0a27e9db103931","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
