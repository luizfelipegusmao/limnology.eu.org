{"title":"Growth performance and mineral composition of the white shrimp Penaeus vannamei and the sea grape Caulerpa lentillifera in a co‐culture system","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16118?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Integrated systems have been proposed as a sustainable solution to minimize the environmental impact of shrimp intensive aquaculture practices. The increasing demand for seafood is largely attributed to a growing need for healthy food recommended in a human balanced diet, but information on the nutritional quality of the resulting products is still scarce. In this study, a co-culture system (CO) of white shrimp <i>Penaeus vannamei</i> and sea grape <i>Caulerpa lentillifera</i> were evaluated in 50-L tanks during 28-days. Water nutrients and mineral composition were measured every 4 days using spectrophotometry and ICP-AES, respectively. At the end of the experiment, growth performance of shrimp and seaweed, proximal composition of shrimp and mineral composition of shrimp and seaweed were evaluated. Shrimps in CO revealed a better final weight (15.4 ± 0.02 g) and lower feed conversion rate (1.4) compared with monoculture system (13.5 ± 0.4 g; 1.9). <i>C. lentillifera</i>, in the CO system, bioremediate 64.0% of ammonium, 62.5% of nitrite, 82.4% of nitrate and 53.3% of phosphate. Regarding minerals, there were less P, Ca, Mn, Fe and Zn in CO water than in shrimp monoculture water<i>.</i> Concerning products' compositions, in CO, sea grapes had higher protein content and shrimps revealed higher lipid content in muscle, lower whole-body cholesterol, higher concentrations in Fe (+70.2%), Zn (+14.8%), Co (+62.7%), Mn (+49.9%) and lower concentrations in Na (−13.7%). Thus, cultivating <i>P. vannamei</i> and <i>C. lentillifera</i> in a co-culture system led to an increase the nutritional value of aquaculture products and to improve their interest in a human healthy diet.</p>","author":"Alexia Omont, \nAlberto Peña‐Rodríguez, \nShuma Terauchi, \nAyako Matsui, \nFrancisco Magallón‐Barajas, \nErika Torres‐Ochoa, \nMasato Endo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"97b31aedaebb3c1e55ef2fb6374de2304e1ddb7a551f5ebb94e0ba833e32ef1e","category":"Environment"}
