{"title":"Development of Aptamers for RNase Inactivation in Xtract-Free™ Sample Collection and Transport Medium","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1788/v1","date":1714154378000,"content":"There is significant need for development of a new environmentally friendly, extraction-free sample collection medium that can effectively preserve and protect genetic material for point-of-care, and/or self-collection, home-collection, and mail-back testing. Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) was used to create anti-ribonuclease (RNase) Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) aptamers against purified RNase A conjugated to paramagnetic carboxylated beads. Following 8 rounds of SELEX carried out under various stringency conditions, e.g., selection using Xtract-Free™ (XF) specimen collection medium, and elevated ambient temperature of 28 ºC, a panel of 5 aptamers was chosen following bioinformatic analysis using next-generation sequencing. The efficacy of aptamer inactivation of RNase was assessed by monitoring Ribonucleic acid (RNA) integrity by fluorometric and real-time RT-PCR analysis.  Inclusion of aptamers in reaction incubations resulted in an 8,800 to 11,200-fold reduction of RNase activity, i.e., digestion of viral RNA compared to control.   Thus, anti-RNase aptamers integrated into XF collection medium as well as other commercial reagents and kits have great potential for ensuring quality intact RNA for subsequent genomic analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23a46623a1c09129587b439abdbd1485f2d5c141da2238f7078f7ec5a93d0cf6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
