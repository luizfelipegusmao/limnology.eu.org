{"title":"Performance Evaluation of RTK-GNSS with Survey-Grade Receivers and Short Observation Times in Forested Areas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1605/v1","date":1724296663000,"content":"Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) is currently the most widely used method for positioning using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) due to its accuracy, efficiency and ease of use. In forestry, position is a critical factor for numerous applications, with GNSS nowadays the preferred solution for obtaining such data. However, the decreased performance of GNSS observations in challenging environments, such as under the forest canopy, must be considered. This paper analyzes the performance of a survey-grade GNSS receiver under coniferous/deciduous tree cover, with short observation times of 30 seconds and corrections received in the field from a Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) of the national RTK network in Romania. 84 test points were determined, randomly distributed under the canopy, with reference data collected by topographical surveys using total station equipment. Relatively good accuracies were obtained, especially for horizontal position (RMSEs of 1.47 â€“ 2.07 meters). The variation of GNSS performance under the different forest compositions was found to be statistically significant, while GNSS-specific factors such as DOP values only influenced the precision and not the accuracy of observations. We established that this methodology offers sufficient accuracy, application-dependent, even if the majority of GNSS solutions were code-based, rather than carrier phase-based, due to strong interference from the vegetation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5664c8b058da1bf71ae854255b4b21d335c9a67ba208ec7df5c40c5ae8eb12e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
