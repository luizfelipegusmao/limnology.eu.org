{"title":"Integration of New Technologies in Healthcare: Robotic Surgery and Artificial Intelligence in Cytology. Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1044/v1","date":1728910299000,"content":"Healthcare is undergoing a technological transformation, particularly in robotic surgery and arti-ficial intelligence (AI) applied to cytology. These innovations are improving the precision and effi-ciency of both surgical procedures and laboratory diagnostics. Robotic systems, such as the Da Vinci, enable surgeons to perform complex procedures with enhanced control and precision, leading to minimally invasive surgeries with reduced recovery times. This technology has signifi-cantly impacted urological, cardiac, and gastrointestinal surgeries, and its use is expected to grow.\nIn cytology, AI automates the analysis of cell samples, leading to faster and more accurate diag-noses, especially in detecting diseases like cervical cancer. AI reduces errors and enhances diag-nostic accuracy by identifying complex patterns in cellular images. Predictive analytics, driven by big data, also allows for personalized treatments based on patient-specific data.\nHowever, these technologies face challenges, including high costs, ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and resistance from healthcare professionals. Continuous training is essential for medical personnel to effectively adopt these tools. Furthermore, the rise of telemedicine and telesurgery, supported by advancements in 5G, offers new opportunities for remote care but also introduces risks, such as depersonalization of medical care and technological barriers.\nUltimately, while robotic surgery and AI hold great promise for improving clinical outcomes, their successful integration will depend on addressing these challenges and ensuring that healthcare professionals are adequately prepared for the digital future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee0ab71527b34473dbe557231188e11c50eeed52480cf89b92b1fb251ce0298a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
