{"title":"Immune-Inflammatory Response in Lifespan. What Role Does It Play in Extreme Longevity? A Sicilian Semi- and Supercentenarians Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0344/v1","date":1717642498000,"content":"Studying models of healthy aging and exceptional longevity is crucial to understand a possible longevity signature as most of them show resistance to age-related diseases. In particular, semi- and supercentenarians are a highly selected group, having survived significant adversities, including the Spanish Flu and COVID-19 pandemics, indicating distinctive immune system characteristics. This paper analyse the inflammatory scores (INFLA-score, Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI)) and Aging-Related Immune Phenotype (ARIP) indicators calculated from the dataset of the DESIGN project, including 249 participants aged 19-111 years, trying to understand the immune-inflammatory (IMFLAM) role to achieve longevity. Statistical analyses, including linear regression and one-way ANOVA, were performed to explore the correlations between these parameters and age. Both INFLA-score and SIRI showed a significant increase with age. However, no statistical difference is observed when analysing the values for semi- and supercentenarians with those for other age groups, whose values are similar to that of adults and less than younger centenariansRegarding ARIP values, it is noteworthy that when comparing the CD8 Naive/Effector scores between groups, no significant differences were observed between the semi- and supercentenarian group and the other groups. These results support the idea that the control of IMFLAM response can promote extreme longevity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"acea80a55432bb7c3ab42192a57b137d2849ac28957e0f78d905ee3393e2f90c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
