{"title":"Upgrading Biomass Wastes to Graphene Quantum Dots with White Light Emitting Features at the Solid State","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0124/v1","date":1725285891000,"content":"The emergence of \"green\" materials has been attracting significant attention along the last few years for various applications. Here, we report a rapid, efficient and reproducible microwave-assisted synthesis of graphene quantum dots GQDs of identical features whatever the nature of biomass wastes investigated. The synthesized GQDs were fully characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The nanoparticles display narrow size of some nanometers with crystal lattices. Furthermore, the water-soluble particles show excitation-dependent photoluminescence ranging from blue to orange emission wavelength in solution. Interestingly, thin films display white light emission under 325 nm UV-light excitation, while aggregation-induced quenching is usually observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d552e20ae890b742380a77a8f52fecbe98af554e1a13dbe4b4338bc4254df952","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
