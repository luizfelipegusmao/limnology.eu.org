{"title":"Natural Canopy Disturbance Patterns and Ecological Silviculture in the Alabama Fall Line Hills","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/1/57/7395485?rss=1","date":1699488000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As a natural disturbance-based approach to silviculture is increasingly embraced by forest managers, quantitative reference conditions of natural disturbance patterns are paramount. We used LiDAR data to quantify resultant structural patterns from an EF3 tornado on the Oakmulgee Ranger District of Talladega National Forest in the Alabama Fall Line Hills, USA. We found the zone of catastrophic disturbance totaled 123 ha, had a mean width of 360 m, and residual trees were randomly distributed. This zone was buffered by an edge zone of intermediate-severity disturbance where trees were removed individually and in groups. The edge zone averaged 220 m in width. In total, the study area included seventy-nine stands and the percentage of stand area damaged ranged from &lt; 1% to 94%. We suggest that clearcut, seed tree, and shelterwood with reserves regeneration methods may be appropriate analogs to natural canopy disturbance in the Fall Line Hills region. These catastrophic disturbance entries should be buffered from undisturbed neighborhoods by a system that retains mature forest structures and would constitute a zone of intermediate-severity disturbance. Our approach may be used as a template to expand our understanding of natural canopy disturbance patterns in other regions and forest types.<strong>Study Implications</strong>: In regions where tornadoes are a natural component of the disturbance regime, including much of the southeastern United States, we suggest that clearcut, seed tree, or shelterwood with reserves regeneration methods may be used to approximate the zone of catastrophic disturbance that corresponds to the tornado track. We observed that reserve tree spatial patterns were random, but residual trees could be selected based on desired species or protection of important biophysical features such as seeps. Surrounding the catastrophic disturbance zone was an edge zone of intermediate-severity disturbance where trees were removed individually and in variably sized groups. We suggest that the structural patterns documented in this edge zone may be created through variable retention harvesting.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"71490aa512bc71d39d9c73342b073af7c0c333ec10278bbb182d3233f6f68098","category":"Environment"}
