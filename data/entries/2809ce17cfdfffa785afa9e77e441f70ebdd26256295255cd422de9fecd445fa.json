These composite materials have been strategically employed in the development of hydrogen technologies, leveraging their unique properties to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of hydrogen production processes. NiCo alloys have been extensively explored as supportive substrates for the cultivation of innovative technologies aimed at optimizing hydrogen production. This exploration has been driven by the alloy's exceptional catalytic properties and its ability to facilitate the electrochemical splitting of water, a critical process in the generation of hydrogen fuel [<a href=\"#ozae044.608-B1\">1</a>]. In recent years, the scientific and engineering communities have shown a heightened interest in the development of NiCo nanostructures. The objective behind this interest is to engineer nanostructures that present the maximum possible surface area, thereby significantly increasing the material's catalytic efficiency. A larger surface area implies a greater number of active sites for catalysis, which is crucial for enhancing the rate and efficiency of hydrogen production. This focus on nanostructuring has led to several research groups dedicating efforts towards the synthesis and characterization of NiCo nanostructures, with the aim of unlocking their full potential in energy applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.608-B2\">2</a>]. Moreover, the in-situ monitoring of chemical reactions involving NiCo structures has become a focal point of research. This approach allows scientists to gain a deeper understanding of the chemical mechanisms at play, particularly in reactions relevant to hydrogen production. By observing these processes as they occur in real-time, researchers can identify the dynamics of atomic migration, surface interactions, and catalytic activity that define the efficiency of NiCo structures in hydrogen generation [<a href=\"#ozae044.608-B3\">3</a>]. Consequently, the development of techniques for the in situ synthesis and analysis of NiCo nanostructures within the confines of an electron microscope has emerged as a pivotal area of study. Such methodologies enable the detailed observation of nanostructure formation and evolution, providing invaluable insights into the mechanisms governing their performance in hydrogen production. This research not only contributes to the fundamental understanding of NiCo-based catalytic processes but also paves the way for the design of more efficient catalysts for hydrogen technology. Through these advanced studies, the scientific community continues to make significant strides towards the realization of sustainable and efficient hydrogen production technologies, marking an important step in the transition to cleaner energy sources [<a href=\"#ozae044.608-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2809ce17cfdfffa785afa9e77e441f70ebdd26256295255cd422de9fecd445fa","category":"Environment"}
