Nevertheless, the fate and behavior of microplastics in soil remain uncertain, particularly their distribution and transport, which are poorly understood. This study does a bibliometric analysis and visualization of relevant research publications using the CiteSpace software. It explores the limited research available on the topic, highlighting the potential for it to emerge as a research hotspot in the future. Chinese researchers and institutions are paying great attention to this field and are promoting close academic cooperation among international organizations. Current research hot topics mainly involve microplastic pollution caused by the land application of sewage sludge, as well as the detection, environmental fate, and removal of microplastics in soil. The presence of microplastics in sludge, typically ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of particles (p)/kg, inevitably leads to their introduction into soil upon land application. In China, the estimated annual accumulation of microplastics in the soil due to sludge use is approximately 1.7 × 10<sup>13</sup> p. In European countries, the accumulation ranges from 8.6 to 71 × 10<sup>13</sup> p. Sludge application has significantly elevated soil microplastic concentrations, with higher application rates and frequencies resulting in up to several-fold increases. The primary forms of microplastics found in soils treated with sludge are fragments and fibers, primarily in white color. These microplastics consist primarily of components such as polyamide, polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vertical transport behavior of microplastics is influenced by factors such as tillage, wind, rainfall, bioturbation, microplastic characteristics (e.g., fraction, particle size, and shape), and soil physicochemical properties (e.g., organic matter, porosity, electrical conductivity, and pH). Research indicates that microplastics can penetrate up to 90 cm into the soil profile and persist for decades. Microplastics in sewage sludge-amended soils pose potential long-term threats to soil ecosystems and even human health. Future research should focus on expanding the theoretical understanding of microplastic behavior in these soils, enabling the development of comprehensive risk assessments and informed decision-making for sludge management practices.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nMicroplastics in sewage sludge range from tens to hundreds of thousands per kilogram.\nSludge land application contributes significantly to soil microplastic pollution.\nThe main forms of microplastics in sludge-amended soils are fragments and fibers.\nMicroplastics are mainly composed of polyamide, polyethylene, and polypropylene.\nMicroplastics can penetrate up to 90 cm into the soil profile and persist for decades.\n</p>","author":"Bomin Fu, \nWeimin Zhou, \nYucai Chen, \nYang Wu, \nWenhui Gan, \nNian She, \nYibing Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"2575de15d415100361d7af586000c0f875d4fae9c0e4e1b8d1ecce6fe86d3925","category":"Environment"}
