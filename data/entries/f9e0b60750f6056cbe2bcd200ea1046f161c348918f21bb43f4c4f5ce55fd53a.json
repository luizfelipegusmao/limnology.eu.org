{"title":"Over-the-counter medications encountered in the postmortem pediatric population from 2010–2020","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/7/473/7678880?rss=1","date":1716249600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In forensic toxicology, the pediatric population requires special focus when evaluating positive findings because of the many toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic differences (e.g., metabolic capabilities, body size, etc.) between the pediatric and adult populations. In particular, the administration of over-the-counter (OTC) medications needs careful consideration, as dosages given to the pediatric population (0 days–18 years), particularly those given to individuals &lt;5 years of age, tend to be lower than those given to individuals closer to adulthood. Postmortem pediatric data from 11 years (2010–2020) was compiled. A total of 1413 positive cases contained one or more of the following common OTC medications: antihistamines (brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine and pheniramine), pain relievers (acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen and salicylates), cold/flu medications (dextro/levomethorphan, guaifenesin, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine), gastrointestinal aids (dicyclomine and loperamide) and/or sleep aids (melatonin). Antihistamines, cold/flu medications and pain relievers are the most common classes of drugs encountered in the postmortem pediatric population. To evaluate trends, three main age groups were created: ≤5 years old (5 U, birth-5 years old), middle childhood (MC, 6–11 years old), and early adolescence (EA, 12–18 years old). When considering the data, it must be noted that many of these drugs may be co-administered in single and/or multi-drug formulations. In addition, some drugs may have a variety of uses, e.g. antihistamines may also be used as sleep aids. Of note, the prevalence of cases involving those aged 6–11 years old was far less than their younger and older pediatric counterparts. With the widespread availability of OTC medications, unintentional overdoses, recreational misuse and suicidal overdoses can occur in the vulnerable, pediatric population.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"f9e0b60750f6056cbe2bcd200ea1046f161c348918f21bb43f4c4f5ce55fd53a","category":"Environment"}
