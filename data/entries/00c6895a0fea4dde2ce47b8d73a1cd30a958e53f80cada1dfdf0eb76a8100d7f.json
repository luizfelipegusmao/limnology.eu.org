{"title":"&micro;CT Imaging of Wheat Spikes Reveals Effect of Chronic Ozone on Individual Grains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1539/v1","date":1724223120000,"content":"Ground level ozone is an abiotic stress estimated to reduce mean global annual wheat yields by nearly 10%. This study in solardomes exposed an elite cultivar, and multiple lines of synthetic wheat (primary and F2) to four levels of ozone (30 ppb, 55 ppb, 80 ppb, 110 ppb) for three months, with two lines (cv Paragon and an F2 line, BC1) selected for X-ray microcomputed tomography. The uCT imaging revealed ozone’s effect on individual grain formation, both spatially within the spike and on grain shape. Reductions in grain number occurred primarily across the middle of the spike. Grain volume reductions were driven more by reduced width and depth than reduced length. Based on yield data, both lines demonstrated relative tolerance to ozone. Links between ozone’s effects on grain morphology and grain quality are also explored. These data provide information that could be utilised in wheat breeding programmes to increase tolerance to ozone of this staple food crop.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00c6895a0fea4dde2ce47b8d73a1cd30a958e53f80cada1dfdf0eb76a8100d7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
