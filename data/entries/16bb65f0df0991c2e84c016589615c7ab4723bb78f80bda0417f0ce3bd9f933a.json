{"title":"Exploring Thinopyrum spp. Group 7 Chromosome Introgressions to Improve Durum Wheat Performance under Intense Daytime and Night‐Time Heat Stress at Anthesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0355/v1","date":1722939479000,"content":"Durum wheat (DW) is one of the major crops grown in the Mediterranean area, a climate-vulnerable region where the increase in day/night (d/n) temperature are severely threatening DW yield stability. In order to improve DW heat tolerance, the introgression of chromosomal segments derived from the wild gene pool is a promising strategy. Here, four DW-Thinopyrum spp. near-isogenic recombinant lines (NIRLs) were assessed for their physiological response and productive performance after an intense heat stress (IH, 37/27°C d/n) applied for 3 days at anthesis. The NIRLs included two primary types (R5, R112), carriers (+) of a differently sized Th. ponticum 7el1L segment on DW 7AL arm, and two corresponding secondary types (R69-9/R5, R69-9/R112), possessing a Th. elongatum 7EL segment distally inserted into the 7el1L ones. Their response to the IH stress was compared to that of corresponding non-carrier sib lines (−) and of the heat tolerant cv. Margherita. Overall, the R112+, R69-9/R5+ and R69-9/R112+ NIRLs exhibited a tolerant behaviour towards the applied stress, standing out for maintenance of leaf relative water content, but also for accumulation of proline and soluble sugars in flag leaf and for preservation of photosynthetic efficiency. As a result, all the above three NIRLs (R112+ &gt; R69-9/R5+ &gt; R69-9/R112+) displayed good yield stability under the IH, also in comparison with cv. Margherita, R112+ particularly relying on strength of spike fertility/grain number traits, R69-9/R5+ on efficient compensation by grain weight increase. This work largely confirmed and further substantiated the value of exploiting the wild germplasm of Thinopyrum species as useful source for the improvement of DW tolerance to even extreme abiotic stress conditions, such as the severe heat treatment throughout day- and night-time applied here.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16bb65f0df0991c2e84c016589615c7ab4723bb78f80bda0417f0ce3bd9f933a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
