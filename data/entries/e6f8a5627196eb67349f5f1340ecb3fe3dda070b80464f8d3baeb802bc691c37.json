{"title":"Molecular and Clinical Features of Pancreatic Acinar Cell Carcinoma: A Single Institution Case Series","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1576/v1","date":1724310888000,"content":"Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) accounts for about 1% of pancreatic cancers. The molecular and clinical features of ACC are less characterized than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and molecular features of ACC patients who underwent germline and/or somatic molecular testing at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2008 to 2022. Patient information was extracted from our institutional database with the approval of Institutional Review Board. We identified 16 patients with available molecular testing results. Fourteen patients had metastatic disease, 1 had borderline resectable disease, and 1 had localized resectable disease at diagnosis. Fifteen patients were wild type for KRAS (1 patient had unknown KRAS status). Somatic/germline mutations of DNA damage repair genes (BRCA1/2, PALB2, and ATM) were present in 5 of 12 patients tested for these genes. One patient was found to have RET fusion and responded favorably to selpercatinib for over 42 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 24 months for patients with metastatic disease. One of the additional two cases which had BostonGene tests was found to have NTRK1 fusion. RNA and TME analysis by BostonGene of the two cases reported immune desert features and relatively lower RNA levels of CEACAM5, CD47, CD74 and MMP1 and higher CDH6 compared with PDAC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6f8a5627196eb67349f5f1340ecb3fe3dda070b80464f8d3baeb802bc691c37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
