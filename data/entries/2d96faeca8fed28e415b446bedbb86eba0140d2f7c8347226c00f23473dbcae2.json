{"title":"Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Multiparty Elections Results in Malawi since 1994: A GIS-Based Study on Voting Patterns and Electoral Outcomes.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1564/v1","date":1719219453000,"content":"Abstract: Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in the 1990s, Malawi has experienced significant political shifts, with elections playing a crucial role in shaping the political landscape. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of election results, especially regarding voting patterns and their effects on electoral outcomes. This gap hinders political parties, politicians, and electoral stakeholders in effectively managing regional and temporal changes in voting behaviors. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are underutilized in Malawi for studying geo-graphical and temporal election data. This study utilized GIS to analyze the spatial pat-terns of election results in Malawi since the advent of multiparty democracy. By collecting geographic data on election outcomes, including vote counts, candidate performance, voter turnout, and other relevant data, the study examined how the geographic distribution of votes impacts electoral results. GIS techniques such as spatial analysis, mapping, and spatial statistics were employed to assess the data and create maps illustrating spatial patterns in Malawi's election outcomes. The study revealed that voting patterns in Malawi are significantly influenced by regional lines. These insights can inform political campaigns, voter mobilization efforts, and strategies for electoral reform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d96faeca8fed28e415b446bedbb86eba0140d2f7c8347226c00f23473dbcae2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
