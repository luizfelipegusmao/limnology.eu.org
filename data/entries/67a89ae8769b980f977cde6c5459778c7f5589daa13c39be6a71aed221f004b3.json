{"title":"Effects of Salt Concentration on a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Based Aggregation Assay with a Tunable Dynamic Range","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1401/v1","date":1726654038000,"content":"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can be functionalized with antibodies to give them an affinity for a biomarker of interest. Functionalized MNPs (fMNPs) cluster in the presence of a multivalent target, causing a change in their magnetization. Target concentration can be proportional to the third harmonic phase of the fMNP magnetization signal. fMNP clustering can also be induced with salt. Generally, salt can alter the stability of charge stabilized fMNPs causing a change in magnetization that is not proportional to the target concentration. We have developed a model system consisting of biotinylated MNPs (biotin-MNPs) that target streptavidin to study the effects of salt concentration on fMNP-based biosensing in simulated in vivo conditions. We have found that biotin-MNP streptavidin targeting was independent of salt concentration for 0.005x to 1.00x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutions. Additionally, we show that our biosensorâ€™s measurable concentration range (dynamic range) can be tuned with biotin density. Our results can be leveraged to design an in vivo nanoparticle (NP)-based biosensor with enhanced efficacy in the event of varying salt concentrations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67a89ae8769b980f977cde6c5459778c7f5589daa13c39be6a71aed221f004b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
