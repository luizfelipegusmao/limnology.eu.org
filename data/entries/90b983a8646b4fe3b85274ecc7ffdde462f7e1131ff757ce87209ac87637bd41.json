{"title":"Determinants of riverine migration success by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts from rivers across the UK and Ireland","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15884?af=R","date":1723448676000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>There is some evidence that the river migration success of Atlantic salmon smolts, on their first migration to sea, varies both spatially and temporally. However, we have only a poor understanding of what may be driving this variation. In this study, we used acoustic telemetry to quantify the spatial and temporal variations in river migration success in Atlantic salmon smolts on their first migration to sea. In total 4120 Atlantic salmon smolts migrating through 22 rivers in Scotland, England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland over multiple years were included in the study. Individuals were defined as successful migrants if detected leaving the river to enter marine waters. The results show significant temporal (up to 4 years) and spatial (river) variations in migration success, with overall between-river migration success varying from 3.4% to 97.0% and between years from 3.4% and 61.0%. Temporal variation in migration success was river specific, with some rivers being more temporally stable (exhibiting little variation between years) than others. Across all rivers and years, individual migration success was predicted positively by body condition and negatively by tag burden. The rate of migration success for a population (migration success standardized to a common river distance [proportion km<sup>−1</sup>]) was predicted by a number of environmental factors. The proportion of river catchment that comprised wetland and woodland positively predicted migration success, whereas the proportion of grassland and peatland in a catchment negatively predicted the rate of migration success. Although the mechanisms through which these effects may be operating were not directly examined in this study, we discuss some potential routes through which they may occur.</p>","author":"Jessica R.
