But for perennial plants like poplar trees, the changing of seasons is weathered through careful timing of growth and dormancy. Photoreceptors, clock components, and effectors achieve a predictable cycle where active growth in the summer gives way to growth cessation and apical bud formation in the fall, protecting meristems through winter (<a href=\"#koae037-B5\">Singh et al. 2017</a>). <strong>Yongfeng Gao and colleagues (</strong><a href=\"#koae037-B1\">Gao et al. 2024</a><strong>)</strong> expose a new regulatory model for short-dayâ€“induced dormancy that involves a poplar (<span>Populus tomentosa</span>) ortholog of the Arabidopsis photomorphogenesis regulatory factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), HY5a. The model introduces poplar HY5a as a coordinator of growth cessation and bud set that promotes <span>FLOWERING LOCUS T2</span> (<span>FT2</span>) transcription through both direct and indirect routes (<a href=\"#koae037-F1\">Fig</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"0171786ecc354982e7f8b346de6f9a84c8ee35f2feb9ca8e4ff639ffb976fa93","category":"Environment"}
