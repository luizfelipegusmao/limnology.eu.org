{"title":"Overexpression of DTX1 inhibits D-GalN/TNF-α-induced pyroptosis and inflammation in hepatocytes by regulating NLRP3 ubiquitination","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae145/7764972?rss=1","date":1727049600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Acute liver injury (ALI) is characterized by massive hepatocyte death and has high mortality and poor prognosis. Hepatocyte pyroptosis plays a key role in the pathophysiology of ALI and is involved in the inflammatory response mediated by NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. Deltex 1 (DTX1) is a single transmembrane protein with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and is closely involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, as well as intracellular signal transduction. However, little is known about the influence of DTX1 on ALI. This study aimed to investigate the role of DTX1 in pyroptosis and inflammation induced by D-galactosamine (D-GalN) and tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) in human hepatocytes (LO2 cells) in vitro.<div>Methods</div>Cell pyroptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The levels of DTX1, pyroptosis-associated proteins, and inflammatory cytokines were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunofluorescence staining, co-immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination, and luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to detect the regulation between DTX1 and NLRP3 or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α). Analysis of variance was performed to compare groups.<div>Results</div>We found that DTX1 was decreased in D-GalN/TNF-α-induced LO2 cells. DTX1 overexpression significantly inhibited D-GalN/TNF-α-induced cell pyroptosis and inflammation. DTX1 interacted with NLRP3 and induced NLRP3 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, by targeting NLRP3, DTX1 knockdown significantly induced cell pyroptosis and inflammation. In addition, HNF4α promoted DTX1 transcription by binding with its promoter.<div>Conclusion</div>Our study revealed that DTX1 suppressed D-GalN/TNF-α-induced hepatocyte pyroptosis and inflammation by regulating NLRP3 ubiquitination.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"a0e8b627ca2ac68fd17ab619dc12aaf8d1d67c4a8cfdba222af0d6946cdec6f2","category":"Environment"}
