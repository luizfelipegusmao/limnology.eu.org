{"title":"Drainage models: An evaluation of their applicability for the design of drainage systems in arid regions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12893?af=R","date":1707382863000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Only 5%â€“10% of irrigated lands in least developed countries (LDCs) are currently drained. Although drainage simulation models (DSMs) are used to evaluate alternative designs, it is unclear which drainage model is suitable for LDCs' arid and semi-arid regions. This study evaluates selected DSMs (ADAPT, RZWQM2, DRAINMOD, EPIC, HYDRUS-1D, WaSim and SWAP) and critically assesses their applicability to arid and semi-arid areas. Also, establish and apply selection criteria based on the availability of data in LDCs with Libya as a case study, and identify the most suitable model for application in Libya. DRAINMOD had the highest overall score, and alternative methods to predict missing input parameters for DRAINMOD are discussed. Evaluating the feasibility of using predicted input parameters for DSMs to design drainage systems in LDCs would help farmers, planners and decision-makers to reduce the overall cost of drainage system and, also, make DRAINMOD a more accessible tool to evaluate different drainage designs.</p>","author":"Murad Ellafi, \nRobert Simmons, \nLynda Deeks","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"1895df655ee12adb478c543271b0ab0cecb1f6667276446ffddedb800c781182","category":"Environment"}
