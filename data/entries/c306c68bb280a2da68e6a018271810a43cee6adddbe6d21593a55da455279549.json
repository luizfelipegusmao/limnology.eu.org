While existing studies have primarily focused on the immediate effects of COVID-19-induced isolation, less attention has been given to the enduring impacts on green space usage patterns. This study addresses this gap by conducting three comprehensive surveys in Dezhou, China—before, during, and after the first wave of social isolation (December 2019, March 2020, December 2020). These surveys assessed socioeconomic conditions, commuting habits, green space usage habits, and landscape preferences, specifically focusing on usage frequency, duration of stays, and activities undertaken. Using Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> tests and Spearman's rho correlations, we identified significant long-term changes, including an increase in the frequency of visits by previously infrequent users, a reduction in visit durations, and a rise in high-intensity activities. These trends persisted 9 months post-isolation, highlighting the pandemic's lasting impact on green space usage and its critical role in enhancing public health and pandemic preparedness through thoughtful urban environmental design. This study not only sheds light on behavioral adaptations during a public health crisis but also offers evidence-based strategies for urban planning to bolster societal resilience in the face of future pandemics.</p>","author":"Fengdi Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: GeoHealth: Table of Contents","siteHash":"018a2f8ee482f9683e9bc368088d60586256b9cdf0b21bf2031822bf8cde1d3a","entryHash":"c306c68bb280a2da68e6a018271810a43cee6adddbe6d21593a55da455279549","category":"Environment"}
