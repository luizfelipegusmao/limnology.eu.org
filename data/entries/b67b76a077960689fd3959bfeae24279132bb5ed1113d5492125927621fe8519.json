{"title":"Most Relevant Genetic, Hormonal, and Environmental Factors in Ovarian Cancer Development &ndash; A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1320/v1","date":1716296483000,"content":"Ovarian cancer (OC) represents a significant challenge in the realm of gynecological cancers, characterized by poor survival rates and complex etiology. In this review, we delve into the se-lected genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors underpinning OC development.\nWe have reviewed scientific databases searching for ovarian cancer genetic and epigenetic factors. We have included studies based on their relevancy. As a result of exploring ovarian carcinogen-esis, this systematic review contains data collected from 126 various works. \nThe role of prominent genetic players such as BRCA mutations, DNA repair mechanisms, un-derscores the intricate landscape of OC susceptibility. We explore Li-Fraumeni and Lynch syn-drome, which impart a heightened predisposition to OC development. Hormonal factors such as estrogen, progesterone, and androgens are also discussed. Environmental alterations, ranging from lifestyle influences on OC to microbiome dysbiosis and lifestyle factors such as obesity, al-cohol consumption, and physical activity intersect with genetic and epigenetic pathways, shaping the risk landscape for OC.\nThrough a meticulous examination of current literature, this review provides a nuanced under-standing of the multifactorial nature of OC, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b67b76a077960689fd3959bfeae24279132bb5ed1113d5492125927621fe8519","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
