{"title":"A novel user clustering and efficient resource allocation in non-orthogonal mutliple access for IoT networks","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309695","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Syed Muhammad Hamedoon, Jawwad Nasar Chattha, Muhammad Bilal</p>\r\n\r\nOptimal resource allocation is crucial for 5G and beyond networks, especially when connecting numerous IoT devices. In this paper, user clustering and power allocation challenges in the downlink of a multi-carrier NOMA system are investigated, with sum rate as the optimization objective. The paper presents an iterative optimization process, starting with user clustering followed by power allocation of the users. Although the simultaneous transmission for multiple users achieves high system throughput in NOMA, it leads to more energy consumption, which is limited by the battery capacity of IoT devices. Enhancing energy efficiency by considering the QoS requirement is a primary challenge in NOMA-enabled IoT devices. Currently, fixed user clustering techniques are proposed without considering the diversity and heterogeneity of channels, leading to poor throughput performance. The proposed user clustering technique is based on the partial brute force search (P-BFS) method, which reduces complexity compared to the traditional exhaustive search method. After the user clustering, we performed optimal power allocation using the Lagrangian multiplier method with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal conditions for each user assigned to a subchannel in each cluster. Lastly, a deep neural network (DNN) based proposed P-BFS scheme is used to reduce resource allocationâ€™s complexity further. The simulation results show a significant improvement in the sum rate of the network.","author":"Syed Muhammad Hamedoon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c99176b2afe5badd88afe7ad505d7875403d5b0690e8e4fd06d18f6fcea73e6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
