The results show that, as the irradiation reached 1.9 × 10<sup>25</sup> n/m<sup>2</sup> and 1.0 × 10<sup>20</sup> Kr<sup>+</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, a large number of &lt;a&gt;-type dislocation loops and a small amount of large-sized &lt;c&gt;-type dislocations hundreds of nanometers or even micrometers in size are observed in both samples. EDS results confirmed that the concentrations of Nb and Fe in the &lt;c&gt;-type dislocation loops are higher than that in the matrix. With the increases of the dislocation loop size, part of the loop structure will decompose into the twisted, small-sized dislocation lines. Between two of the small-sized dislocation lines, a cubic structure was observed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ec2b82dfb384965811868a45a9a4323272877f2c98ac944c86a80a3eabcb4881","category":"Environment"}
