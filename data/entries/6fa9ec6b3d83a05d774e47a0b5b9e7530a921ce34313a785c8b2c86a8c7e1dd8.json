{"title":"The 2-Hour Plasma Glucose Levels During OGTT, Conducted in the Postprandial Period Between 4 and 7.9 Hours, Are Associated With the Diagnosis of Diabetes, Diabetes Mortality, and Cardiovascular Mortality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0510/v1","date":1720165742000,"content":"Postprandial plasma glucose between 4 and 7.9 hours is associated with the diagnosis of diabetes, diabetes mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. However, it is unknown whether 2-hour plasma glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test conducted in this postprandial period (4–7.9 hours), termed as 2-h PGOGTT@4–7.9h, can accurately classify diabetes diagnosis and predict mortality risks. This study aimed to address these questions using 2,347 adult participants. Diabetes was defined as HbA1c ≥6.5%, and the ability of 2-h PGOGTT@4–7.9h to classify diabetes was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to estimate mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results showed that 2-h PGOGTT@4–7.9h could classify diabetes with 92% accuracy. Participants were followed up for a mean of 21.4 years. A 1-natural-log higher 2-h PGOGTT@4–7.9h was associated with an increased risk of mortality from diabetes (adjusted HR, 21.1; 95% CI, 9.2–48.0) and cardiovascular disease (adjusted HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13–1.91). Simulation analysis indicated that future studies may require at least 100 participants to investigate 2-h PGOGTT@4–7.9h for diabetes diagnosis. In conclusion, 2-h PGOGTT@4–7.9h may be useful for diabetes classification and prediction of mortality risk.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6fa9ec6b3d83a05d774e47a0b5b9e7530a921ce34313a785c8b2c86a8c7e1dd8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
