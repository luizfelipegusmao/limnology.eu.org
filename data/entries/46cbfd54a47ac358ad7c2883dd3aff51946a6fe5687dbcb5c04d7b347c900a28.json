However, deriving optimal catalysts for such reactions is not straightforward [<a href=\"#ozae044.228-B1\">1</a>]. Electrocatalysts can restructure during reaction and create structural motifs that are only stable under working conditions. Therefore, we need insight into the morphology and chemical state of electrocatalysts within the electrolyte and under applied potential to elucidate their structure-function relationships. While there have been significant advances in operando methods for probing the structure and chemistry of catalysts during reaction, each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, <span>operando</span> X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides valuable information about the catalyst’s structure and chemistry but using it to rationalize the subtle changes on a catalyst’s surface is more challenging since XAS is a bulk-sensitive method and averages over the entire ensemble [<a href=\"#ozae044.228-B2\">2</a>]. Conversely, electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (EC-TEM) can provide catalyst morphology at nanoscale spatial resolution, but the images have limited chemical specificity [<a href=\"#ozae044.228-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"46cbfd54a47ac358ad7c2883dd3aff51946a6fe5687dbcb5c04d7b347c900a28","category":"Environment"}
