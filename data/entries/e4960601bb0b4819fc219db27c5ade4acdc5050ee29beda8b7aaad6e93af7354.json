{"title":"The Relationship Between Perceived Peer Support and Academic Adjustment Among Higher Vocational College Students: The Chain-Mediating Effect of Academic Hope and Professional Identity and the Moderating Effect of Educational Background","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0462/v1","date":1712460424000,"content":"Perceived peer support is a critical factor in the academic adjustment of higher vocational college students. While previous studies have explored this relationship, few studies have delved into the underlying mechanisms. This study surveyed 9782 students from 35 higher vocational colleges in 13 provinces and cities in China to explore the relationship and mechanisms between perceived peer support and academic adjustment. Drawing on Conservation of Resources theory and Social Support Resource theory, the findings revealed that perceived peer support not only directly predicted the academic adjustment of higher vocational college students, but also indirectly through the independent mediating effect of academic hope and professional identity, as well as the chain-mediating effect of academic hope to professional identity. Additionally, students from vocational high schools showed a more significant increase in academic hope due to  perceived peer support compared to those from general high schools, highlighting the moderating effect of educational background. The study provided a new theoretical perspective for understanding the complex mechanisms of academic adjustment in students and offers valuable guidance for educational practice, emphasizing the importance of fostering perceived peer support, academic hope, and professional identity in higher vocational education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4960601bb0b4819fc219db27c5ade4acdc5050ee29beda8b7aaad6e93af7354","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
