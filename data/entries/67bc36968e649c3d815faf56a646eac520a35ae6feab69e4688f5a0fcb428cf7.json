{"title":"Effects of Substituting Fishmeal with Soy Protein Concentrate Supplemented with Essential Amino Acids in the Olive Flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) Diet on the Expression of Growth, Stress, Immune, and Digestive Enzyme-Related Genes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0685/v1","date":1725876526000,"content":"This study identified the effects of substituting fishmeal (FM) with soy protein concentrate (SPC) supplemented with lysine and methionine in the olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) diet on the expression of genes related to growth, stress, immunity, and digestion. Three experimental diets were prepared; the control diet (Con) contained 60% FM, and 25% (SPC25) and 50% (SPC50) FM were replaced by SPC. After the 140-day feeding period, weight gain, specific growth rate, feed availability, biological indices and chemical composition of the muscle were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments. The gene expression levels of growth-related genes (IGF, GFB-3), immune-related genes (IL-8 and caspase), stress-related genes (SOD, GPX, PRX, TRX) were higher in Con fish than in those fed the SPC25 and SPC50 diets.  Chymo-TRY2, TRY2 and TRY3 in the stomach of fish fed the SPC25 diet were higher than fish fed the Con or SPC50 diets. TRY2 and lipase of fish fed the SPC25 diet were higher than those of fish fed the other diets but TRY3 was not significantly affected by the treatments in the intestine. In conclusion, substituting 25% FM with SPC was the most effective for the expression of growth, immune, stress, and digestive enzyme genes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67bc36968e649c3d815faf56a646eac520a35ae6feab69e4688f5a0fcb428cf7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
