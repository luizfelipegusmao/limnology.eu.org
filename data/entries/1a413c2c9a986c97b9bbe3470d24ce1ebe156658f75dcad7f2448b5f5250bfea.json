{"title":"Influence of Organic Humic Fertilizer &laquo;Tumat&raquo; on the Productivity of Sugar Beet","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0022/v1","date":1711960091000,"content":"The production of sugar beet in the Republic of Kazakhstan is insufficient to meet the do-mestic sugar needs of the population. This shortfall is attributed to the natural and climatic conditions, the high cost of production, and the low use of mineral fertilizers. The objective of the study is to investigate the impact of the organic humic fertilizer \"Tumat\" on the growth, development, yield, and sugar content of sugar beet in the conditions of irrigated light chestnut soils in Southeast Kazakhstan. The research employed widely accepted methods of field experiments and laboratory studies from the Commonwealth of Inde-pendent States. Scientific research confirms the effectiveness of using the organic humic fertilizer \"Tumat\" for cultivating sugar beets. This fertilizer is highly bioavailable and con-tains a balanced mix of essential macronutrients and micronutrients, polyunsaturated fat-ty acids, and other biologically active substances. Foliar feeding of sugar beets enriches the soil with exchangeable potassium, mobile phosphorus, and easily hydrolyzable nitrogen during the plant's vegetative period. Using \"Tumat\" fertilizer improves seed germination, stimulates growth and development, accelerates the ripening of sugar beets, and enhances tuber yield and sugar content. \"Tumat,\" an organic humic fertilizer, is recommended as an environmentally safe and effective agricultural product that boosts the productivity and quality of sugar beets, as well as soil fertility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a413c2c9a986c97b9bbe3470d24ce1ebe156658f75dcad7f2448b5f5250bfea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
