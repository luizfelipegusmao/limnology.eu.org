{"title":"Precision Medicine from a Public Health Perspective","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040617-014158","date":1522670400000,"content":"Over the past decade, precision medicine (PM) approaches have received significant investment to create new therapies, learn more about disease processes, and potentially prevent diseases before they arise. However, in many ways, PM investments may come at the expense of existing public health measures that could have a greater impact on population health. As we tackle burgeoning public health concerns, such as obesity, and chronic diseases, such as cancer, it is not clear whether PM is aligned with public health or in conflict with its goals. We summarize the areas of promise demonstrated by PM, discuss the limitations of each of these areas from a population health perspective, and discuss how we can approach PM in a manner that is congruent with the core aims of public health.","author":"Ramya Ramaswami, Ronald Bayer, and Sandro Galea","siteTitle":"Annual Review of Public Health","siteHash":"7a16e40f33727f64c92405053603e83c5cbbe960f1756170cbd1d528ffe78607","entryHash":"cfcf03c037dd4262787c195651b979e31577706d027a21b9e72d0ab13dfb7729","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
