{"title":"The Effects of Kale Biofortified with 8-Hydroxy-7-Iodo-5-Quinolinesulfonic Acid on Iodine Concentration in Various Tissues and Changes of Selected Thyroid-Regulated Biochemical Parameters in Blood Serum of Wistar Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1691/v1","date":1727059334000,"content":"Dietary intake of Wistar rats of biofortified with 8-hydroxy-7-iodo-5-quinolinesulfonic acid (8-OH-7-I-5QSA) kale of both cultivars ‘Oldenbor F1’ and ‘Redbor F1’ for 8 weeks resulted in sig-nificantly higher iodine concentrations in the urine and kidneys of rats, which proves iodine bio-availability. Rats diets with 'Oldenbor F1' and 'Redbor F1' kale non- and -biofortified with 8-OH-7-I-5QSA had a significantly lower or a tendency for lower concentration of TSH, triglyc-eride, total and direct bilirubin, TBARs, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations in serum. Dietary intake of 'Oldenbor F1' and 'Redbor F1' kale biofortified with 8-OH-7-I-5QSA significantly increased the total antioxidant status (TAS). The study confirms that kale biofortified with iodine in organic form iodoquinoline 8-OH-7-I-5QSA is bioavailable and well absorbed by the Wistar rat and has a positive effect on selected biochemical parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a966f9b04f39c4b0f6d70bdaf9e9d0a483b7a78b0b1475c2171dd6898444f10f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
