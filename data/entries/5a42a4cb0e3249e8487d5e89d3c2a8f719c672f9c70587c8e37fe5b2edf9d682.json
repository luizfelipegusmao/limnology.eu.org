{"title":"Impact of remittance on economic growth and environmental quality in the purview of energy use, regulatory quality, and financial development","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12353?af=R","date":1722998683000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigates the asymmetric effects of remittance on economic growth (EG) and environmental quality in the purview of energy use, regulatory quality (REQ), and financial development (FD) in the top 20 remittance-earning countries. It employs panel data from 1996 to 2020 and utilizes the generalized least square (GLS) estimation and the Dumitrescuâ€“Hurlin causality test. The GLS result shows that remittance inflow has an asymmetric effect on EG as well as environmental quality, validated by a long run asymmetric test. Remittance shocks are beneficial for both EG and maintaining environmental quality in the context of the Environmental Kuznets Curve framework. Energy use; FD, and REQ all positively affect EG, whereas FD, REQ, and gross domestic product (GDP) are favorable for the environment except for energy use. According to a supplemented analysis, remittance and regulatory quality's combined influence on EG and CO<sub>2</sub> are favorable, but regulatory quality's impact on the former is detrimental for both models. The results of the GLS estimation are endorsed by the causality analysis, which affirms their reliability. Positive remittance shock and financial development have bidirectional causality with EG, and both shocks of remittance and financial expansion have a two-way association with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Only REQ is affected by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The outcomes have important policy implications for enhancing remittance inflow, ensuring smooth energy availability, a prudential financial system, and improving REQ to influence EG and control CO<sub>2</sub> emissions effectively.</p>","author":"Md.
