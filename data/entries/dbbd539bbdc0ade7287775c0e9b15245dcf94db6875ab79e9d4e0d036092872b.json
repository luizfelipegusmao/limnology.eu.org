It has demonstrated an impact on atherosclerosis and neurological diseases. linked in part to cholesterol complexation and immune response, but the impact on inflammatory cascade pathways was not clear. Thus, the impact of KLEPTOSE® CRYSMEB on various pharmacological targets was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells in physiological and inflammatory conditions, followed by screening against twelve human primary cell-based systems designed to model complex human tissue and disease biology of the vasculature, skin, lung, and inflammatory tissues using the BioMAP® Diversity PLUS® Panel. Finally, the anti-inflammatory mechanism was investigated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells to evaluate anti-inflammatory or pro-resolving properties. The results showed that KLEPTOSE® CRYSMEB can modulate the immune system in vitro and potentially manage vascular issues by stimulating the expression of molecules involved in the crosstalk between immune cells and other cell types. It showed anti-inflammatory effects driven by pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion inhibition and could have different impacts on different tissue types. Moreover, this cyclodextrin showed no clear impact on pro-resolving lipid mediators. Finally, it appeared that the mechanism of action of KLEPTOSE® CRYSMEB seems to not be shared by well-known anti-inflammatory molecules.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbbd539bbdc0ade7287775c0e9b15245dcf94db6875ab79e9d4e0d036092872b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
