{"title":"Dental education amid armed conflict in Sudan: Unveiling the impact on training","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311583","date":1728482400000,"content":"<p>by Esra Abdallah Abdalwahed Mahgoub, Samar Osman, Musab Babiker Haga, Amna Khairy, Sarah Hashim Mohammed Osman, Abubker Mohammed Abbu Hassan, Nassifu Ssemwanga, Eiman Gamal Elgaali, Mohamed H. Taha</p>\r\n\r\nThe ongoing conflict in Sudan has severely disrupted the health professions education, notably in dentistry. This study aims to explore the impact of the armed conflict on dental education and training. A mixed-method cross-sectional study encompassed 29 dental schools in Khartoum, Darfur, Kordofan States, and Merowe City. Five key informants from the Sudanese Medical Specialization Board, the Human Resource Development Administration, and a university offering clinical dental master’s programs were interviewed. Quantitative data on attacks against dental schools were collected through a structured Google form, and qualitative data on postgraduate training were obtained through semi-structured key informant interviews. Findings reveal that 79.3% of dental schools faced military assaults, with 73.9% experiencing looting and 60.9% repurposed as military bases. Notably, 44.8% of schools shifted to online education,3.4% collaborated with other universities, and 27.6% adopted a combined approach. Key informants’ interviews unveiled disruptions in specialty training and housemanship, limiting access to crucial training facilities. The primary proposed solution was overseas training. Recurrently emphasized strategies to enhance the resilience of the training system included establishing dental centers in all states, collaborating with external training bodies, and anticipating and preparing for potential disasters. The adverse effects of the conflict on both undergraduate and postgraduate dental education are discernible, manifested through resource limitations, a shortage of dental materials and supplies within training facilities, and direct disruptions to clinical training due to attacks on healthcare institutions. The imperative need for urgent interventions is underscored to alleviate these consequences and safeguard the continuity of educational and training efforts.","author":"Esra Abdallah Abdalwahed Mahgoub","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"25c3dd7758d37f70bca11e3fecb03c17d8c81dc25a6f7b09272668894fe24238","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
