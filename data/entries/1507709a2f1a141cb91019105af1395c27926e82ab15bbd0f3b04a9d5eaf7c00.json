{"title":"Unique Properties of Naked Mole Rat Hyaluronan&mdash; Potential Utilization in Management of Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0357/v1","date":1728049412000,"content":"Hyaluronan has been considered in recent years as a potential naturally occurring modifiable scaffold that has the capability to absorb and release drugs over an extended period of time making it suitable as a chemotherapeutic delivery agent. Considering the limited treatment options available in the treatment of glioblastoma, in this review, we discuss the novel utilization of ultra high molecular weight hyaluronan - originally identified as a mechanism for maintaining longevity in the naked mole rat, as both a protective and extracellular matrix optimising scaffold, and a means to deliver therapy in resected brain tumors. The unique properties of this unique form of hyaluronan indicate potential future use in the prevention and treatment of both proliferative based and inflammation driven disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1507709a2f1a141cb91019105af1395c27926e82ab15bbd0f3b04a9d5eaf7c00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
