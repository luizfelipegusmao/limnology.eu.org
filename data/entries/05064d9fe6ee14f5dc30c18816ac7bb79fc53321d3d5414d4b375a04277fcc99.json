{"title":"Benchmarking current preslaughter management factors, welfare indicators, and meat quality outcomes at commercial fed cattle processing facilities in the United States","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txad150/7505493?rss=1","date":1704240000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Preslaughter management factors and their impacts on cattle welfare and meat quality are well documented in current literature. However, certain management factors related to transportation and lairage are underrepresented. Benchmarking preslaughter management factors that can impact welfare and meat quality outcomes will allow the industry to identify areas for improvement. The objective of the current study was to benchmark preslaughter management factors for a nationwide sample of commercial fed cattle processing facilities. Five processing facilities in the West, Midwest, and Southwest regions of the United States were sampled from March 2021 to July 2022. Data were collected on a total of <span>n</span> = 637 slaughter lots representing <span>n</span> = 87,220 head of cattle. Variables of interest included general cattle characteristics, distance traveled to the plant, truck wait times to unload, environmental conditions, lairage density, and lairage duration. Additionally, mobility was scored using a four-point locomotion scale (one being normal, not lame, and four being extremely reluctant to move). Carcasses were also observed for bruising using the following scale: no bruises, bruises smaller or larger than a deck of cards, and having multiple bruises. Descriptive statistics were performed on the data at the lot and individual animal level. On average, cattle traveled 155.8 ± 209.6 km (mean ± SD) from the feedlot to the processing facility and waited 30.3 ± 39.7 min to unload. Once in lairage pens, cattle were held for 200.7 ± 195.0 min. The mean lairage stocking density was 3.1 ± 2.0 m<sup>2</sup> per head. A majority of the cattle scored a mobility score of 1 (<span>n</span> = 77,645, 91.8%), 7.8% (<span>n</span> = 6,125) were scored as a two and the remaining less than one percent of cattle were scored as either a 3 or 4 (<span>n</span> = 265). Carcasses with bruises less than or equal to the size of a deck of cards (<span>n</span> = 22,672, 27.1%) were less frequent than bruises measuring greater than the size of a deck of cards (<span>n</span> = 34,427, 42.6%). Of carcasses that were bruised, 65.2% (<span>n = </span>39,856) had multiple bruises of varying size. This baseline data on preslaughter management factors identifies opportunities for improvement in wait times, lairage densities, and factors that cause bruising. Future studies should explore the relationships between these factors and their impacts on welfare and meat quality, report the economic value of these outcomes, and explore industry acceptability and adoptability of optimal preslaughter management practices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"05064d9fe6ee14f5dc30c18816ac7bb79fc53321d3d5414d4b375a04277fcc99","category":"Environment"}
