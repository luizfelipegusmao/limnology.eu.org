{"title":"Effect of temperature on the growth, feeding performance, gonadal development, and nutritive compositions in the muscle of fry stream groupers, Acrossocheilus fasciatus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13024?af=R","date":1695879535000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>To determine the optimal temperature in rearing of fry stream groupers, <i>Acrossocheilus fasciatus</i>, a total of 540 fry fish with an initial body weight of (0.57 ± 0.16) g, and body length of (4.08 ± 0.40) cm were randomly distributed to 18 15-L tanks and reared at six different temperatures (12, 16, 20, 24, 26, and 28°C) for a period of 60 days. Fish were hand-fed to satiation under all six different temperature treatments. At the end of the experiment, almost all the growth, feeding, and gonadal development parameters were higher in the 26°C group than in the rest of the groups. As temperature increased from 12 to 26°C, the specific growth rate and feeding efficiency of fry significantly increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). When temperature reached 28°C, these parameters were significantly lower than in the 26°C group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The histological structure of the gonads showed that in the 26°C group, a large number of sperm cells resided in the testis in a free condition, and many yolk granules aggregated together and formed plates in the ovary. This histological information indicated that the gonadal maturity of fish in the 26°C group was higher than that of the other groups. Thus showing a turning point of growth, feeding, and gonadal development in the 26°C group. In relation to the nutritive compositions of muscle tissue, fish reared at 16°C exhibited the highest content of amino acids and fatty acids. These parameters significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) decreased as the temperature increased from 16 to 28°C. The proportion of essential amino acids (EAA/NEAA) and unsaturation of fatty acids (∑UFA/FA) did not show significant temperature influence (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, increases in temperature significantly improved the growth rate, feeding performance, and gonadal development rate of fry <i>A. fasciatus</i>. Regression analysis based on growth and feeding performance showed that the optimal temperature of rearing fry <i>A. fasciatus</i> was 23.81–26.57°C.</p>","author":"Bo Zhao, \nWei Shi, \nYongyao Guo, \nYe Chen, \nHandong Wang, \nJinghong He, \nZhangjie Chu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"6a28f6eec3eaa61bd26b7f1f434a0320c8943ddb667700278a2cbce9b33d5233","category":"Environment"}
