In the US alone, consumption reached 315 million tons in the years 2018-2019, while in China, it amounted to approximately 276 million tons [<a href=\"#ozae044.474-B1\">1</a>]. Popcorn is composed of starch (7%), proteins (1.4%), and lipids (1%). In addition to these components, popcorn also contains phenolic compounds and essential amino acids, which contribute to its nutritional value [<a href=\"#ozae044.474-B2\">2</a>]. The pericarp, the layer of the popcorn kernel, likewise contains proteins, lipids, and phenolic compounds, and presents nanomechanical properties that affect the popping process [<a href=\"#ozae044.474-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.474-B3\">3</a>]. This study focuses on the application of microscopy techniques and image analysis to investigate the microstructure of both the kernel and pericarp of popcorn.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5ed2f68b9bae596dd656263cf96bfb65c2ef1b5c98e959c96bda96d62b414146","category":"Environment"}
