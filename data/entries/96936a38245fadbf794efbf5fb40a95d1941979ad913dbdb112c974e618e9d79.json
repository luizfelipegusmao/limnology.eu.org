{"title":"Individual-level social determinants of health and disparities in access to kidney transplant and waitlist mortality","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308407","date":1724248800000,"content":"<p>by Tatenda G. Mupfudze, Alina Martinez, Samantha M. Noreen, Darren E. Stewart, Jesse D. Schold, Laura Cartwright</p>\r\nBackground <p>Comprehensive, individual-level social determinants of health (SDOH) are not collected in national transplant registries, limiting research aimed at understanding the relationship between SDOH and waitlist outcomes among kidney transplant candidates.</p> Methods <p>We merged Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data with individual-level SDOH data from LexisNexis, a commercial data vendor, and conducted a competing risk analysis to determine the association between individual-level SDOH and the cumulative incidence of living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), deceased donor kidney transplant (DDKT), and waitlist mortality. We included adult kidney transplant candidates placed on the waiting list in 2020, followed through December 2023.</p> Results <p>In multivariable analysis, having public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), less than a college degree, and any type of derogatory record (liens, history of eviction, bankruptcy and/ felonies) were associated with lower likelihood of LDKT. Compared with patients with estimated individual annual incomes ≤ $30,000, patients with incomes ≥ $120,000 were more likely to receive a LDKT (sub distribution hazard ratio (sHR), 2.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.03–3.12). Being on Medicare (sHR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.42–1.57), having some college or technical school, or at most a high school diploma were associated with a higher likelihood of DDKT. Compared with patients with incomes ≤ $30,000, patients with incomes ≥ $120,000 were less likely to receive a DDKT (sHR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51–0.71). Lower individual annual income, having public insurance, at most a high school diploma, and a record of liens or eviction were associated with higher waitlist mortality.</p> Conclusions <p>Patients with adverse individual-level SDOH were less likely to receive LDKT, more likely to receive DDKT, and had higher risk of waitlist mortality. Differential relationships between SDOH, access to LDKT, DDKT, and waitlist mortality suggest the need for targeted interventions aimed at decreasing waitlist mortality and increasing access to LDKT among patients with adverse SDOH.</p>","author":"Tatenda G.
