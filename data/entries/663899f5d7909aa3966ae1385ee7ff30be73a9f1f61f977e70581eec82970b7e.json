{"title":"An Analysis of the Cloning, Functional Analysis, and Identification of Three Cloned Digestive Enzymes Associated with Growth Traits in Haliotis diversicolor","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/4191343?af=R","date":1680159600000,"content":"<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different feeds such as <i>Porphyra, Laminaria japonica</i>, Compound feed, and <i>Gracilaria</i> on the activities of alginate lyase, cellulase, and amylase in the digestive juice of <i>H. diversicolor</i> and to take their genes as candidate genes related to the growth traits of <i>H. diversicolor</i>. In order to provide data for selective breeding, SNPs that were significantly associated with growth traits were screened through gene cloning, high-throughput sequencing, and association analysis. It was found that there were no significant differences in the activities of alginate lyase and cellulase in <i>H. diversicolor</i> among different feeds, but there were significant differences between males and females in the group; <i>β</i>-amylase activity is higher than <i>α</i>-amylase activity; the DNA, full-length cDNA, and upstream sequences of genes of alginate lyase, cellulase, and amylase were cloned, and we found that the expressions of three genes are similar; they have started expression in the early prostrate stage of larvae, have tissue specificity in adults, and are highly expressed in hepatopancreas; 84 SNPs were found in alginate lyase through high-throughput sequencing, and 2 which had significant differences were left after associating with growth traits, and they are ALG1016 and ALG1544.</p>","author":"Weidong Li, \nHuaifeng Cao, \nWenxin Xu, \nMohsin Mahmood, \nWaqas Ahmed, \nSajid Mehmood, \nWeiwei You, \nZhitao Qi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"663899f5d7909aa3966ae1385ee7ff30be73a9f1f61f977e70581eec82970b7e","category":"Environment"}
