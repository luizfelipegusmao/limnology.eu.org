{"title":"Impact of a Near-Surface Plasma Region on the Bow Shock Wave and Aerodynamic Characteristics of a High-Speed Model in Xenon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1285/v1","date":1729068593000,"content":"The main objective of the present study is to demonstrate the possibility of actively influencing the position of the bow shock wave and the main parameters of supersonic flow over a blunt body by organizing a gas discharge near the front surface, in the region between the body and the bow shock wave. The research is carried out using both experimental and numerical methods. The working gas was xenon. It is shown that the steady bow shock wave stand-off distance along with the current and power of the discharge, is associated with the change in the adiabatic index of the plasma created by the discharge, which, in turn, is determined by the plasma parameters, such as the degrees of nonequilibrium and the degree of ionization. It is shown that the adiabatic index with the power supplied to the impact zone in the range of 30-120 kW can both increase and de-crease in the range of 1.25-1.288. The study of the discharge created plasma zone was conducted and the correspondence between the discharge current and power, and the average parameters in the plasma zone created by the discharge is presented. A good agreement between the numerical and experimental data was shown. The results may be useful in developing control systems for high-speed civil aircrafts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c88730058e02cdf1a9054c71c1877d83ab2327276eb507f954fa8a9e8f8f7a86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
