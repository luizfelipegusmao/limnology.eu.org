{"title":"Two Dimensional Differential Positioning with GNSS Signal Frequency Division Relay Forwarding to Parallel Leaky Coaxial Cables in Tunnel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1517/v1","date":1729320978000,"content":"To address the issue of GNSS receivers being unable to function properly in tunnels due to the loss of Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS) signals, this paper proposes a two-dimensional differential positioning system for tunnel environments, based on dual leaky coaxial(LCX) cables with GNSS signal frequency relay forwarding. The system receives mixed GNSS signals from open environments and utilizes the frequency selection capabilities of the MAX2769E chip to separate and generate radio frequency signals at different frequencies corresponding to GPS, BDS, and GLONASS. These signals are then used to drive three ports of the LCX cables, which are laid in parallel within the tunnel. By leveraging the uniform radiation characteristics of the LCX cables, stable GNSS signal coverage is achieved throughout the tunnel. On the receiving end, the GNSS receiver achieves two-dimensional positioning by utilizing inter-satellite pseudorange differences and reference point error correction. Simulation results indicate that the dual T-shaped radiating LCX cables configuration offers excellent positioning accuracy and noise resistance, achieving meter-level positioning accuracy in tunnel environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd48abd63676ab176e2239d0f331420bea5e405dac4d19e24a13d158dded8c8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
