{"title":"Emotion recognition and social functioning in individuals with autism spectrum condition and intellectual disability","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300973","date":1711029600000,"content":"<p>by Daniela Tamas, Nina Brkic Jovanovic, Stanka Stojkov, Danijela Cvijanović, Bozana Meinhardt–Injac</p>\r\nObjective <p>Most previous studies have examined emotion recognition in autism spectrum condition (ASC) without intellectual disability (ID). However, ASC and ID co-occur to a high degree. The main aims of the study were to examine emotion recognition in individuals with ASC and co-occurring intellectual disability (ASC-ID) as compared to individuals with ID alone, and to investigate the relationship between emotion recognition and social functioning.</p> Methods <p>The sample consisted of 30 adult participants with ASC-ID and a comparison group of 29 participants with ID. Emotion recognition was assessed by the facial emotions test, while. social functioning was assessed by the social responsiveness scale–second edition (SRS-2).</p> Results <p>The accuracy of emotion recognition was significantly lower in individuals with ASC-ID compared to the control group with ID, especially when it came to identifying angry and fearful emotions. Participants with ASC-ID exhibited more pronounced difficulties in social functioning compared to those with ID, and there was a significant negative correlation between emotion recognition and social functioning. However, emotion recognition accounted for only 8% of the variability observed in social functioning.</p> Conclusion <p>Our data indicate severe difficulties in the social-perceptual domain and in everyday social functioning in individuals with ASC-ID.</p>","author":"Daniela Tamas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ddbb43759022e53938d2fd2f6f415c5c55f369ca09e4e23b5f8c4ef6c740bcee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
