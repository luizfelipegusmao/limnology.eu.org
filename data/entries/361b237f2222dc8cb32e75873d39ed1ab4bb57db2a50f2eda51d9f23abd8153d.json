{"title":"VIX constant maturity futures trading strategy: <i>A walk-forward machine learning study</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302289","date":1713535200000,"content":"<p>by Sangyuan Wang, Keran Li, Yaling Liu, Yijun Chen, Xianbo Tang</p>\r\n\r\nThis study employs seven advanced machine learning approaches to conduct numerical predictions of the next-day returns of VIX constant-maturity futures (VIX CMFs) using the term structure information derived from VIX CMFs. Based on precise numerical predictions, this study proposes a new Constrained-Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (C-MVO) trading strategy and tests it against a benchmark long-short trading strategy to evaluate the profitability of the machine learning numerical predictions. This study applies three unique feature sets, each incrementally incorporating the VIX CMFsâ€™ term structure features, to individually examine the predictive ability of the seven machine learning models and their backtesting performance. Over a comprehensive 11-year period, the experiment adheres to a strict walk-forward expanding-window methodology for both training and backtesting. The predictive and backtesting results show that four of the seven machine learning models attain a prediction information ratio greater than 0.02, with an average prediction information ratio of 0.037. This result suggests that the VIX CMFs term structure features have predictive power for the next-day returns of VIX CMFs. Moreover, the average C-MVO information ratio is 0.623, and the long-short strategy information ratio is 0.404. This increase in the information ratio under the C-MVO strategy validates the effectiveness of the machine learning models and the C-MVO strategy.","author":"Sangyuan Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"361b237f2222dc8cb32e75873d39ed1ab4bb57db2a50f2eda51d9f23abd8153d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
