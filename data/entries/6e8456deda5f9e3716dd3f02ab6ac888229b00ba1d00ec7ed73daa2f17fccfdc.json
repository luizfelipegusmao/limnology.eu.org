{"title":"Colonial Legacy and Economic Persistence in the Americas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0396/v1","date":1728292518000,"content":"This article explores the enduring influence of colonial legacies on the economic development of the Americas, tracing their historical roots and contemporary repercussions. By examining a comprehensive range of historical and modern research, the article analyzes how colonial institutions, policies, and labour systems have profoundly shaped the economic trajectories of countries across the region. Central to the discussion is the lasting impact of colonial-era practices, such as the mining mita in Peru, and how factor endowments have influenced inequality and development patterns. The article further investigates the broader implications of these findings for understanding the deep-seated origins of economic disparities and the formidable challenge of overcoming colonial legacies in the present day. Special attention is given to the role of inclusive institutions, regional cooperation, and the intersection of culture and identity in fostering more equitable economic and social progress. Through this analysis, the article provides valuable insights into the historical foundations of contemporary economic imbalances and offers policy recommendations for addressing these persistent legacies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e8456deda5f9e3716dd3f02ab6ac888229b00ba1d00ec7ed73daa2f17fccfdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
