{"title":"Optimal Design of I-PD and PI-D Industrial Controllers Based on Artificial Intelligence Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0290/v1","date":1717669386000,"content":"The aim of this research is to apply artificial intelligence (AI) methods, specifically artificial immune systems (AIS), in order to design an optimal control strategy for a multivariable control plant. Two specific industrial control approaches are investigated: I-PD (Integral-Proportional Derivative) and PI-D (Proportional-Integral Derivative) control. The study results in a novel solution to the control synthesis problem for the industrial system. In particular, the research addresses the synthesis of I-P control for a two-loop system in the technological process of a distillation column. This synthesis is accomplished using the AIS algorithm, making it the first application of this technique to this specific context. Methodological approaches are proposed to enhance the performance of industrial multivariable control systems through effective utilization of optimization algorithms by establishing modified quality criteria. The problem of synthesis of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control system is solved, taking into account the interconnections due to the decoupling procedure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11b4131b3d6f5304c114258f9dd0dd3dd92eabcd3aed3d80ac4c44952b25a3b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
