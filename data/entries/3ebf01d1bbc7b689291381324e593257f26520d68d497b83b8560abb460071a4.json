{"title":"Towards In Situ Electromagnetic Field Imaging by Differential Phase Contrast Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.798/7719685?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Differential phase contrast (DPC) becomes one of the common imaging modes in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) due to the recent rapid progress in theoretical establishment, detector technology and software. DPC STEM can directly visualize electromagnetic fields inside materials and devices at very high spatial resolution, even down to atomic dimensions [<a href=\"#ozae044.798-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.798-B2\">2</a>]. Therefore, this technique is highly demanded to be applied for advanced material and device characterization. In recent years, there have been two seminal hardware developments in DPC STEM. One is the development of magnetic-field-free objective lens [<a href=\"#ozae044.798-B3\">3</a>]. In ordinary objective lens, we need to insert our specimen into very high perpendicular magnetic field. This has severely limited the observation of magnetic materials and devices by STEM. To overcome this limitation, in the newly developed objective lens, we can keep our sample in a magnetic-field-free condition by combining two magnetic lenses together to cancel out the fringing magnetic fields of the lenses onto the specimen position. This enables atomic-resolution STEM observation of magnetic materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.798-B4\">4</a>]. The second seminal development is the tilt-scan averaging system [<a href=\"#ozae044.798-B5\">5</a>]. In this new scanning system, tilted electron beams with many different orientations are scanned across the specimen and averaged DPC images of the many beam- tilt conditions are acquired very rapidly. This scan system is shown to be very effective for reducing diffraction contrast in DPC images, and thus facilitates the usage of DPC imaging for crystal defects such as interfaces [<a href=\"#ozae044.798-B6\">6</a>]. These two new developments accelerate the application of DPC STEM to real materials and devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3ebf01d1bbc7b689291381324e593257f26520d68d497b83b8560abb460071a4","category":"Environment"}
