{"title":"Characteristics of a Novel Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer for Non-Destructive Testing Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0477/v1","date":1723006953000,"content":"Ultrasonic transducers are widely used for non-destructive testing (NDT) and evaluation in various industries. While capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as significant novel transducers, their application in NDT has been limited. This study designed and fabricated a novel two-element CMUT device for NDT applications. The CMUT’s structural parameters were introduced, and the device was fabricated using silicon fusion wafer-bonding technology. The transducer’s sensitivity, bandwidth, and pulse-echo response performance were tested and analyzed. Testing with aluminum blocks demonstrated that the two-element transducer can transmit and receive ultrasonic waves, with central operating frequencies of 3.35 MHz. In addition, at 3.4 MHz, the receive sensitivities of both elements were –197.434 dB and –197.413 dB, respectively, meeting the requirements for NDT systems. In pulse-echo response testing, the CMUT successfully detected signals from the aluminum block interface and located the interface’s position. This study highlights the potential of CMUTs for NDT testing and evaluation applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a9a511c1ef026b893c624ddb8a2d1e78590804c861094ece99d7fbcb117fe71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
