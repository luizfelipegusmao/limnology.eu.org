Through semi-structured interviews with 15 restaurant owners across diverse regions of Italy, key themes emerged regarding supplier selection criteria, challenges in supplier management, strategies for ensuring quality, and the impact of external factors on supply chain dynamics. Findings reveal that authenticity, reliability, and sustainability are paramount in supplier selection, aligning with consumer expectations for genuine Italian ingredients and culinary excellence. Economic pressures, operational disruptions, and external influences, exacerbated by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitate adaptive strategies such as cost-effective sourcing, rigorous quality control measures, and technological integration to maintain supply chain continuity and uphold quality standards. Strategic initiatives, including rigorous quality assurance protocols, digital procurement platforms, and collaborative partnerships with suppliers, enhance transparency, efficiency, and responsiveness in supply chain operations. Entrepreneurial initiatives and emotional intelligence play crucial roles in fostering innovative sourcing strategies and building trust-based relationships with suppliers, enhancing supply chain resilience and responsiveness to market demands. External factors, such as market dynamics and sustainability trends, underscore the need for continuous adaptation and strategic foresight in supplier management practices. The study contributes to understanding the intricate dynamics of supplier management in Italian cuisine, offering insights for enhancing operational efficiency, maintaining quality standards, and fostering sustainable supplier relationships in the food service industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"871c049757ff3bd7aba6eb950b4ef99b638aea6ab4c98082b131e1bd6bf40c41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
