Vasorelaxation responses mediated through 5-HT<sub>4</sub> have only been documented to occur in cattle and sheep and thus, may represent a novel vasorelaxation mechanism that is specific to ruminants. In tissues from other species, the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor and its associated G protein couple with adenylate cyclase. However, the mechanisms contributing to 5-HT<sub>4</sub>-mediated vasorelaxation in vascular tissue remain undefined. To better understand the mechanisms of 5-HT<sub>4</sub>-mediated vasorelaxation, lateral saphenous veins from cattle (n = 4) were collected and assessed for vasoactivity in response to increasing concentrations of a selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist (BIMU-8) in the absence and presence of selective inhibitors of downstream proteins involved with cyclic mononucleotide-mediated signaling. Isolated vessel segments were suspended in chambers of a multi-myograph containing 5 mL of continuously oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer and equilibrated to 1 g tension for 90 min. After the equilibration period, vessels were exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; vehicle control) or selective inhibitors of downstream protein targets dissolved in DMSO (1×10<sup>-5</sup> M) for 5 min. Vessels were pre-contracted with 1×10<sup>-4</sup> M phenylephrine for 10 min to achieve a sustained increase in tension. After the 10-min pre-contraction period, vessels were exposed to increasing concentrations (1×10<sup>-9</sup> to 1×10<sup>-4</sup>) of BIMU-8 non-cumulatively. Vasoactive response data were normalized as a percentage of the maximum contractile response induced by the phenylephrine pre-contraction. In the absence of selective inhibitors (control), BIMU-8 induced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) dose-dependent relaxations (mean -log EC<sub>50</sub> = 6.30 M) with a 112% increase in maximal vasorelaxation activity occurring at 1×10<sup>-4</sup> M. In the presence of the selective inhibitors for adenylate cyclase (NKY80) or guanylate cyclase (NS2028), 66% and 86% of the vasorelaxation responses to BIMU-8 were attenuated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), respectively. In the presence of the selective inhibitors for protein kinase A [protein kinase A inhibitor fragment (6-22) amide] or protein kinase G (Rp-8-bromo-PET-Cyclic GMPS), 66% and 97% of the maximal vasorelaxation responses to BIMU-8 were attenuated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), respectively. In the presence of non-selective inhibitors for Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and K<sup>+</sup> channels, vasorelaxation responses to BIMU-8 were attenuated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). In the presence of selective inhibitors for the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A subunits of myosin light chain (calyculin A) and heat shock protein synthesis (quercetin), vasorelaxation responses to BIMU-8 were attenuated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). The findings of the current study demonstrate that 5-HT<sub>4</sub>-receptor mediated vasorelaxation occurs through a cyclic mononucleotide-dependent mechanism involving cross-activation of protein kinase A and G signaling. Downstream proteins involved in the signaling cascade leading to vasorelaxation include Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, K<sup>+</sup> channels, myosin light chain phosphatase, and heat shock proteins. More research is needed to fully describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor-mediated vasorelaxation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"6fd877e790267d7379da5e37853cd175ad142bf9282c83f0f290d81d09868897","category":"Environment"}
