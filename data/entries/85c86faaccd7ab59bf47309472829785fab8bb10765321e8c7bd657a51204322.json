{"title":"Oxidative stability in meat (pectoralis major) of broiler orally supplemented with essential oils of allium sativum, Curcuma longa, Zingiber officinale, and Cinnamomum zeylanicum","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae073/7659677?rss=1","date":1714348800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Lipid oxidation is a normal process in living muscles, but is escalated postmortem due to the loss of inherent antioxidant defense, which causes quality deterioration of meat. This study investigates the effects of essential oil (EO) supplementation to the drinking water of broiler chicken on physical properties, antioxidants, and lipid oxidation in <span>Pectoralis major</span> during frozen storage. Two hundred day-old chicks of arbo acre were allocated to five groups; control (T1) and the groups supplemented with: <span>Allium sativum</span> (T2)<span>, Curcuma longa</span> (T3)<span>, Zingiber officinale</span> (T4) and <span>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</span> (T5) at the level of 300ml/L into drinking water throughout a 49-d study. Thereafter, birds were slaughtered and breast meat excised for assessments during a 28-d storage period at 4 °C using standard procedure. The results show that cooking loss of <span>Pectoralis major</span> from T1 birds was not significantly (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) different from that of T4, and were significantly higher than those of T2, T3, and T5 birds. Meat from T5 birds showed the lowest drip loss. The results for total antioxidant activity are not similar among sampling days. In general, control group showed inferior values, but T2 and T4 had greater values on days 0 and 28. The rate of lipid peroxidation increased with time; however, EOs administration markedly reduced the peroxidation rates compared to controls. The catalase activity of breast meat was significantly declined from day 14, but was enhanced as an effect of EO consumption especially in group T5 at 21 and 28 d. Supplementation of garlic, turmeric, and cinnamon EOs to broiler chickens increased glutathione peroxidase in breast meat on days 21 and 28, while turmeric EO enhanced superoxide dismutase up to 7 d. In conclusion, EOs are valuable supplements for broiler chickens and potent in enhancing meat quality and prolonging the shelf life.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"85c86faaccd7ab59bf47309472829785fab8bb10765321e8c7bd657a51204322","category":"Environment"}
