Most prior research focused on maternal age. Since in most organisms the mother produces the costly eggs plus provides all or most parental care, it is difficult to distinguish maternal effects mediated via the egg from later maternal care. Here, we addressed the effects of parental age on offspring in <i>Syngnathus typhle</i>, a pipefish with male pregnancy. The divide between one parent producing the eggs and the second parent being the exclusive provider of parental care facilitates a distinction between the effects of parental age on egg quality versus parental age on early development. We fully reciprocally crossed young and old mothers and young and old fathers and assessed impact of parental age combination on offspring number, offspring size, and offspring gene expression patterns. Neither parental combination significantly influenced offspring size or male gestation duration; however, they influenced the number of offspring. Paternal, but not maternal, age strongly affected the offspring gene expression. Offspring from old fathers exhibited substantial changes in the expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation, protein synthesis, DNA repair, and neurogenesis. Our findings thus highlight the importance of gestation, as opposed to gamete production, in shaping the parental contribution to offspring development.</p>","author":"Freya Adele Pappert, \nDaniel Kolbe, \nArseny Dubin, \nOlivia Roth","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"f2860f6c17281cfd9ef855be8eb2d693a2b79cd47aba88347ef5b1756ffeb285","category":"Environment"}
