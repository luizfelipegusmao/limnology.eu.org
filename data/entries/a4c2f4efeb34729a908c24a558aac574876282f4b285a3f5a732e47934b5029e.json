{"title":"Coupled Transmission Electron Microscopy and Atom Probe Tomography Reveals an Interesting Pathway to Nanolamellar Microstructures in High Entropy Alloys","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.652/7719577?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Adding elements such as Al or Ti to near random face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solutions like CoFeNi or CoCrFeNi, introduces strong ordering tendencies in these high entropy alloys (HEAs) or complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) [<a href=\"#ozae044.652-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.652-B2\">2</a>]. This presentation will demonstrate the strong influence of Al addition to equiatomic CoFeNi on the stability and metastability of ordered phases (e.g. L1<sub>2</sub> and B2), and the consequent phase transformation pathways. A case study will be presented from a model Al<sub>0.3</sub>CoFeNi HEA/CCA wherein the phase stability (and attendant metastability) can lead to many different microstructures, including a homogeneous distribution of nanometer scale L1<sub>2</sub> (gamma prime-like) precipitates within the FCC matrix, ordered B2 precipitates distributed within the FCC matrix, a combination of L1<sub>2</sub> and B2 precipitates, and a complex four-phase hierarchical nanolamellar microstructure consisting of alternating lamellae of FCC + L1<sub>2</sub> and B2 + BCC within eutectoid-like colonies. However, the focus of this presentation will be the latter nanolamellar microstructure [<a href=\"#ozae044.652-B3\">3</a>]. Coupled transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography results reveal how a single FCC phase microstructure transforms into the complex four-phase nanolamellar microstructure. Such microstructure which resembles pearlitic steels opens new possibilities with HEAs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a4c2f4efeb34729a908c24a558aac574876282f4b285a3f5a732e47934b5029e","category":"Environment"}
