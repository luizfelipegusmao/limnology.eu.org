The findings demonstrated that, at low doses, [C<sub>14</sub>mim]BF<sub>4</sub> could raise WBC, NEU, and MID and lysozyme levels as well as spleen T-lymphocyte stimulation index in rats, however at high doses, the aforementioned indices were dramatically lowered. As the dose was raised, the proportion of RBC and PLT in the blood as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> in the spleen increased, but the quantity of immunoglobulin IgG, IgA, and IgM in the serum as well as the number of NK cells in the spleen considerably dropped. Even though there were varying degrees of improvement 30 days after ceasing exposure, all these changes were unable to return to normal, and the number of NK cells was further decreased. The study demonstrates that [C<sub>14</sub>mim]BF<sub>4</sub> can damage the specific immunity and non-specific immunity of rats, and cause immune dysfunction.</p>","author":"Manyu Shu, \nPengzhen Tan, \nYueyue Ge, \nXingxing Tian, \nHongmei Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"51d3a6337e03186bc0f4f5ed0e12225e3fe401f7495a64051c04ba71f8334678","category":"Environment"}
