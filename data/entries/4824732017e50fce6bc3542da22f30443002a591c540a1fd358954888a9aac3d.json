{"title":"Effects of developmental exposure to arsenic species on behavioral stress responses in larval zebrafish and implications for stress-related disorders","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/1/61/7687811?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Arsenic (As) is globally detected in drinking water and food products at levels repeatedly surpassing regulatory thresholds. Several neurological and mental health risks linked to arsenic exposure are proposed; however, the nature of these effects and their association with the chemical forms of arsenic are not fully understood. Gaining a clear understanding of the etiologies and characteristics of these effects is crucial, particularly in association with developmental exposures where the nervous system is most vulnerable. In this study, we investigated the effects of early developmental exposure (6- to 120-h postfertilization [hpf]) of larval zebrafish to environmentally relevant concentrations of arsenic species—trivalent/pentavalent, inorganic/organic forms—on developmental, behavioral, and molecular endpoints to determine their effect on stress response and their potential association with stress-related disorders. At 120 hpf, the developing larvae were assessed for a battery of endpoints including survival, developmental malformities, background activity, and behavioral responses to acute visual and acoustic stimuli. Pooled larval samples were analyzed for alterations in the transcript levels of genes associated with developmental neurotoxicity and stress-related disorders. Developmental exposures at target concentrations did not significantly alter survival, overall development, or background activity, and had minor effects on developmental morphology. Sodium arsenate and monomethylarsonic acid exaggerated the behavioral responses of larval zebrafish, whereas sodium arsenite depressed them. Sodium arsenate induced significant effects on molecular biomarkers. This study highlights the effects of developmental exposure to arsenicals on the behavioral stress response, the role chemical formulation plays in exerting toxicological effects, and the possible association with stress-related disorders.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"4824732017e50fce6bc3542da22f30443002a591c540a1fd358954888a9aac3d","category":"Environment"}
