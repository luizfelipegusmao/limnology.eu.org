{"title":"Critical Surface Heat Flows and the Future Evolution of Volcanism and Geothermal Power Resources on the Earth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0412/v1","date":1720074586000,"content":"Relevant observations suggest that in geothermal power resources and volcanic regions in Earth the mean heat flow is either comparable or greater than the current global mean heat flow of this planet. We have inferred that critical or minimum heat flow required to sustain geothermal provinces (T &gt;1500C) is at least 90 mWm-2 and the same required to sustain active volcanoes in Earth is at least 100 mWm-2.The volcanism in Venus is found have declined significantly during the past 300 Ma. It is suggested that Earth may lose significant part of its current active volcanoes and geothermal power resources in the next 300-500 Ma if the global mean heat flow in Earth is decreasing at a rate of 5.76 mW per 100 Ma. At the current inferred maximum rate of mantle cooling (20o C per 100 Myrs) the plate tectonics in Earth is likely to cease within 750 Myrs from now. The critical mean surface heat flux for sustaining plate tectonics in Earth is inferred to be around 50-55 mW/m2.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24ca32169fcdb53ecabfdc1952e443ec3da47b89dc920ae1ca3a2543f406f04f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
