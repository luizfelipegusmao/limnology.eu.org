{"title":"Architectural Form and State of Conservation: A Case Study from Damage Maps Using Drone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1162/v1","date":1723732588000,"content":"The Sustainable Development Center of the University of Brasilia is one of the modernist buildings that make up the Darcy Ribeiro campus. The architectural project contains several recommendations for the execution of the flat roof waterproofing system, as well as details for rainwater runoff and drainage, which reveals a certain concern with watertightness. The research seeks to identify the relationship between the pathological manifestations recognized on the roof and the semicircular shape of the building, assessing the state of conservation through the use of damage maps as an analysis tool. The article is based on a field survey using aerophotogrammetry with a drone, the application of vector drawing software for graphic representation and discussion of the possible causes, agents and mechanisms of degradation at work. The results show the importance of mechanical protection for the good performance of the waterproofing system, as well as the need for correct sizing of expansion joints in order to absorb and relieve the stresses caused by hygrothermal variations. The methodology incorporated proved to be effective and economical in diagnosing and monitoring pathological manifestations, making it possible to plan maintenance actions that extend the useful life and preserve the intrinsic characteristics of building systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d358036f2846f1223bca27b995346782ed0c45c14f5f481da2cbd0a1e5f3c6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
