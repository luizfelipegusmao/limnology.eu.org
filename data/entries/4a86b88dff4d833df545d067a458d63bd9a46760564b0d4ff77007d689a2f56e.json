{"title":"Comparative plastome and mitogenome analyses indicate that the marine prasinophyte green algae Pycnococcus provasolii and Pseudoscourfieldia marina (Pseudoscourfieldiophyceae class nov., Chlorophyta) represent morphotypes of the same species","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13482?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The marine prasinophyte green algae <i>Pycnococcus provasolii</i> and <i>Pseudoscourfieldia marina</i> represent the only extant genera and known species of the Pycnococcaceae. However, their taxonomic status needs to be reassessed, owing to the very close relationship inferred from previous sequence comparisons of individual genes. Although <i>Py. provasolii</i> and <i>Ps. marina</i> are morphologically different, their plastid <i>rbc</i>L and nuclear small subunit rRNA genes were observed to be nearly or entirely identical in sequence, thus leading to the hypothesis that they represent distinct growth forms or alternate life-cycle stages of the same organism. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used organelle genomes as molecular markers. The plastome and mitogenome of <i>Ps. marina</i> UIO 007 were sequenced and compared with those available for two isolates of <i>Py. provasolii</i> (CCMP 1203 and CCAP 190/2). The <i>Ps. marina</i> organelle genomes proved to be almost identical in size and had the same gene content and gene order as their <i>Py. provasolii</i> counterparts. Single nucleotide substitutions and insertions/deletions were localized using genome-scale sequence alignments. Over 99.70% sequence identities were observed in all pairwise comparisons of plastomes and mitogenomes. Alignments of both organelle genomes revealed that <i>Ps. marina</i> UIO 007 is closer to <i>Py. provasolii</i> CCAP 190/2 than are the two <i>Py. provasolii</i> strains to one another. Therefore, our results are not consistent with the placement of <i>Ps. marina</i> and <i>Py. provasolii</i> strains into distinct genera. We propose a taxonomic revision of the Pycnococcaceae and the erection of a new class of Chlorophyta, the Pseudoscourfieldiophyceae.</p>","author":"Olivier Crépeault, \nChristian Otis, \nJean‐François Pombert, \nMonique Turmel, \nClaude Lemieux","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"4a86b88dff4d833df545d067a458d63bd9a46760564b0d4ff77007d689a2f56e","category":"Environment"}
