Despite official claims that all 77 swine farms treat their wastewater to meet regulatory standards, local non-governmental organizations and villagers have challenged this, though their concerns lack scientific backing. This study evaluates the river's water quality by analyzing samples from upstream (US), midstream (MS), and downstream (DS), and from Parit Cina-Parit Besar, a conduit for untreated swine wastewater. Fourteen parameters were measured against Malaysia's National Water Quality Standards (NWQS). Significant differences were found in six parameters: ammonium nitrogen (AN), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease (OG). While Dunn's post hoc pairwise comparison showed no significant differences among river segments, mean values indicated increased pollution downstream, particularly after the convergence with untreated swine wastewater. River classification worsened, with water quality index dropping from 69.88 ± 11.37 score (Class III) US to 38.49 ± 12.74 and 50.44 ± 3.14 scores (Class IV) MS and downstream, respectively. A significant positive correlation between <i>E. coli</i> and AN (<i>r</i> = 0.71, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) suggests a common point source pollutant, particularly the untreated swine wastewater. The river exhibits low oxygen levels and high organic matter and nutrient concentrations, especially MS and downstream, highlighting substantial ecological and public health risks. Effective enforcement of waste treatment regulations and enhanced monitoring are crucial for mitigating pollution and restoring the river's ecosystem. Collaboration between authorities and pig farmers is essential to improve water quality and maintain the river's ecological balance.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nSevere Kereh River pollution: Untreated swine wastewater from Kampung Selamat pig farms, primarily via Parit Cina-Parit Besar, has degraded the river for over 40 years.\nRegulatory non-compliance: Despite official claims, untreated swine wastewater continues to pollute the river, challenging regulatory standards.\nSignificant pollution indicators: Elevated levels of AN, BOD, COD, DO, TSS, OG, and <i>E. coli</i> signal severe pollution midstream and downstream.\nWater quality index drop: WQI scores classify midstream and downstream sections as polluted, indicating worsening conditions downstream.\nUrgent need for action: Enforcing regulations, improving wastewater treatment, and relocating pig farms are crucial for restoring the Kereh River.\n</p>","author":"Maisarah Nasution Waras, \nMuhammad Azrul Zabidi, \nZikrullah Ismail, \nMageswari Sangaralingam, \nAmirah Mohd Gazzali, \nMohammad Syamsul Reza Harun, \nMohd Yusmaidie Aziz, \nRafeezul Mohamed, \nMohd Nadzri Mohd Najib","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"47ac103527116e5b15a387a034b699f5d8955e1ea13170722a457f08a5071c30","category":"Environment"}
