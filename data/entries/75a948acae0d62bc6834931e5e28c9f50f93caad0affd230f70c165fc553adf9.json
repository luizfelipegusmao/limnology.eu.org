{"title":"Anisotropic Filtering Based on WY Distribution and Multi-scale Energy Concentration Accumulation Method for Dim and Small Target Enhancement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1558/v1","date":1716475970000,"content":"In the ground-based infrared optical remote sensing system, the target signal is very weak due to the dynamic strong light background and the movement of small and small targets. In order to improve the limit detection capability, the background suppression and target enhancement methods are required to be more suitable for this scene. To solve this problem, we first analyze the image features in the current scene, and propose a more perfect point target and noise model. Then, we propose a new WY distribution function based on the Fermi Dirac distribution function, and propose an anisotropic filtering method based on this function, and further suppress the back-ground through the difference results of two steps. Then, based on the distribution function, we further designed an energy concentration accumulation strategy in 9 scale directions, through which the SNR of the target is effectively improved and the suppression ability of the background is enhanced. Through quantitative and qualitative experimental analysis, compared with the same type of algorithms, the proposed method has better robustness against extremely weak targets and dynamic backgrounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75a948acae0d62bc6834931e5e28c9f50f93caad0affd230f70c165fc553adf9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
