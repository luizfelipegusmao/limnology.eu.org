{"title":"An Enhanced Multiple Bit Passive Wireless Sensor Based on UWB Spectral-Temporal Joint Coding and Modulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0019/v1","date":1727934696000,"content":"In this paper, a passive wireless sensor is designed and developed in terms of an enhanced multiple bit application. The proposed sensor is in the formula of UWB working at 3.1GHz~10.6GHz band, and the carrying of multiple bits information is realized by the combination of multiple sensor units operated in the principle of Spectral-Temporal Joint Coding and Modulation. A prototype of the proposed sensor is configured by four UWB sensor units, each is specified by modulation upon the UWB pulse in time domain and, simultaneously, upon the UWB spectrum in frequency domain, jointly coded digitally by 1/0 data delivering totally the enhanced digital capacity up to 8 bits. Simulation and measurement verify the validation of the UWB sensor with effectiveness of data delivery in the scenarios where remote, contactless and battery-free applications are necessary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe65b1b54058a84b5868eb61df5c0abb3b2c63c07c309ff9f26a75dfc7aa965a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
