{"title":"A Study on Graph Optimization Method for GNSS/IMU Integrated Navigation System Based on Virtual Constraints","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1697/v1","date":1716791463000,"content":"In GNSS/IMU integrated navigation systems, factors such as satellite occlusion and non-line-of-sight conditions can lead to degradation of satellite positioning results, Subsequently affecting the overall accuracy of the integrated navigation system. To address this issue and ef-fectively utilize historical pseudorange information from satellites, this paper proposes a graph optimization-based GNSS/IMU model with virtual constraints. These virtual constraints are con-structed using satellite â€˜s position from previous time step, the rate of change of pseudoranges, and ephemeris data. This virtual constraint can serve as an alternative solution for individual satellites in case of signal anomalies, ensuring the integrity and continuity of the graph optimi-zation model. Additionally, this paper conducts an analysis of the graph optimization model constructed using these virtual constraints, comparing it with traditional integrated navigation graph optimization model, and analyzes and reconstructs the marginalization process based on these virtual constraints. The experimental results, compared with tightly coupled Kalman fil-tering and the original graph optimization method on a set of real-world data, demonstrate that the introduction of virtual pseudoranges maintains high positioning accuracy. The RMSE error between it and the original graph optimization remains within 5%, affirming the high feasibility of this approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09d6297da782f58f63302dfcf879de6c58330b71d2d48fa04c722539846957c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
