{"title":"In Silico Search for Drug Candidates Targeting the PAX8&ndash;PPAR&gamma; Fusion Protein in Thyroid Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0199/v1","date":1712121856000,"content":"The PAX8/PPARγ rearrangement, producing the PAX8–PPARγ fusion protein (PPFP), is thought to play an essential role in the oncogenesis of thyroid follicular tumors. To identify PPFP-targeted drug candidates and establish an early standard of care for thyroid tumors, we performed ensemble docking-based compound screening. Specifically, we investigated which pocket structure should be adopted to search for a promising ligand compound for the PPFP; the position of the ligand binding pocket on the PPARγ side of the PPFP is common to that of PPARγ; however, the shape is slightly different between them due to environmental factors. We developed a method for selecting a PPFP structure with a relevant pocket and high prediction accuracy for ligand binding. This method was validated using PPARγ, whose structure and activity values are known for many compounds. Then, we performed docking calculations to PPFP for 97 drug or drug-like compounds with a thiazolidine backbone, which is one of the characteristics of ligands that bind well to PPARγ, registered in the DrugBank database. Furthermore, the binding affinities of promising ligand candidates were estimated more reliably using the molecular mechanics-Poisson–Boltzmann surface area method. Thus, we propose promising drug candidates for the PPFP with a thiazolidine backbone.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f9f613c8db14d0ac15a32fe4e975f5d017d117c4e3ceb9946fcae4e7fdd2038","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
