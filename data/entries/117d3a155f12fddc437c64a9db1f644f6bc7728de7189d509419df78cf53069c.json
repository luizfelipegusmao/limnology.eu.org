{"title":"Morphological, histological and phylogenetic identification of three species of Myxobolus (Myxosporea: Myxobolidae) infecting different carp lineages in China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13861?af=R","date":1696046788000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The global cultivation of common carp <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> is developed primarily for either food or recreational purposes and myxosporean infections causing significant economic losses are regularly troublesome for carp farmers. However, most myxosporean species are poorly characterized, making it difficult to correctly elaborate on their parasitism mode and determine pathogenicity. Here, based on an integrative approach, we supplemented fundamental information on three <i>Myxobolus</i> species infecting different carp lineages in China. <i>Myxobolus elliptoides</i> Wu et Chen, 1987; Nine new species of Myxosporida from freshwater fish of Wuhu lake, Hubei, China. <i>Acta Hydrobiologica Sinica</i>, <b>11</b>, 161 formed yellowish pseudocysts in the anal fin of common carp and were observed with ellipsoidal myxospores and two polar capsules of distinct dimensions. The dermal tissue within the fin ray was regarded as the type site for growing plasmodia of <i>M</i>. <i>elliptoides</i>. <i>Myxobolus basilamellaris</i> Lom et Molnar, 1983; <i>Myxobolus basilamellaris</i> sp. n. (myxozoa, Myxosporea), a parasite of the gills of common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i> L.). <i>Folia Parasitologica</i>, <b>30</b>, 1 aggregated ellipsoidal myxospores at the base of the gill filaments of koi carp juvenile, causing significant tissue damage. <i>Myxobolus artus</i> Achmerov, 1960, enwrapped in diffuse pseudocysts, was observed throughout the trunk muscle of mirror carp. Its oblate myxospores were asymmetrical and contained two unequal-sized polar capsules. According to the localization of large plasmodia, inter- and intramuscular preferences were displayed by <i>M</i>. <i>artus</i>. For precise species identification, we provided the SSU rDNA sequences for each species of <i>Myxobolus</i>. Among them, <i>M</i>. <i>elliptoides</i> was molecularly characterized for the first time, showing the highest 94.21% identity to <i>Thelohanellus sinensis</i> (KY469292). Phylogenetically, the affinity of both <i>M</i>. <i>artus</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>basilamellaris</i> to their conspecific species derived from different carp lineages was highly supported. Moreover, the intermixed cluster of <i>Myxobolus</i> species, including <i>M</i>. <i>elliptoides</i>, with those of <i>Thelohanellus</i> species provided evidence for querying the monophyletic evolution history of these taxa. This work updates the appreciation of the concerned species and enhances our understanding of the parasite fauna of common carp.</p>","author":"Bo Zhang, \nXiao Tu, \nZemao Gu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"117d3a155f12fddc437c64a9db1f644f6bc7728de7189d509419df78cf53069c","category":"Environment"}
