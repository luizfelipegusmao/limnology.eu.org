{"title":"The Latest Innovations in the Flexural Capacity of Castellated Beams with Hexagonal Stiffener Variations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0201/v1","date":1722606964000,"content":"This research evaluates the effect of varying hexagonal opening angles on the flexural and shear capacity of castellated beams. This study is conducted through experimental and numerical approaches using WF 150.75.5.7 steel profiles. The hexagonal opening angles are varied to 20°, 30°, 45°, 55°, and 60°. Experimental testing results show that beams with a 20° opening angle have higher flexural and shear capacities compared to larger opening angles. Numerical testing results are consistent with experimental results, showing more uniform deformation patterns and stress distribution at smaller opening angles. These findings contribute significantly to the design of more efficient and effective castellated beams in modern structural applications, particularly in constructions requiring high flexural and shear capacities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7c0eceabc41b3b00e9d6867871aba6221bd4d94c92f83b8fa914940cf6d9545","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
