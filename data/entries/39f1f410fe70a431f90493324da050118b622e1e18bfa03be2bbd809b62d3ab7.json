{"title":"Development of Urban Flood Forecasting System for Dhaka City Using MIKE+","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0203/v1","date":1725418255000,"content":"Dhaka one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world is increasingly vulnerable to urban flooding due to rapid urbanization, inadequate drainage infrastructure, and climate change-induced extreme weather events. This study presents the development of an urban flood forecasting system for Dhaka City using the MIKE+ hydrodynamic modeling software. The system integrates detailed hydrological and hydraulic models to simulate urban flooding scenarios, accounting for complex drainage networks and catchment characteristics. Real-time data from river gauges, rainfall stations, and drainage systems are incorporated to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts. The model's predictive capability is validated against historical flood events, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting flood extents, depths, and durations in critical areas of the city. This system serves as a valuable tool for city planners, emergency response teams, and decision-makers, enabling proactive flood management and risk mitigation. The study underscores the importance of such advanced modeling tools in safeguarding urban populations and infrastructures from the increasing threat of urban floods in Dhaka and similar rapidly urbanizing cities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39f1f410fe70a431f90493324da050118b622e1e18bfa03be2bbd809b62d3ab7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
