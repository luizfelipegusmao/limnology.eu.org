Prediction of reccurence and metastases development poses a significant challenge for oncologists, needing markers for prediction of adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of pathohistologically detected EMVI in untreated rectal cancer and its implications in separate reporting. Methods: We examined 100 untreated RC patients who underwent curative resection from January 2016 to June 2018 with follow up of 5 years. Patients were divided in equal EMVI- and EMVI+ groups based on histological re-examination of H&amp;E stained postoperative surgical samples. Results: The presence of EMVI within the selected cohort was significantly associated with female gender, T3/T4 and N1/N2 post-operative stages, positive lymph nodes, lymph node ratio LNR2 and LNR3 groups, abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, positive lympho-vascular invasion (LVI), perineural (PNI), and circumferential resection margin (CRM) (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92f99094f0f3fa1ad4e2abd3a8578b9cd6aad469496c2ff63c21ce2ad88ed511","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
