The thermal radiation models were evaluated by comparing the numerical results with experimental data at representative points in the CSG. For indoor rear wall, the indoor soil and indoor air, the models showed good agreement between the experimental data and the simulated results correspond to P1, S2S and DO respectively. This work provides information for simulate greenhouse temperature and use specific radiation models for the most suitable thermal environment for crop growth.","author":"Wenhe Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"65418b9b2f2a4ab83fbd20b5aa73468dd7ce0a4367e56ee9fc4b985534ef842d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
