{"title":"Effect of Bee-Borne Entomopathogenic Fungi and Essential Oils in Controlling Cyclamen Mite on Strawberries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0225/v1","date":1722916895000,"content":"The cyclamen mite, Phytonemus pallidus, is one of the important pests in strawberry cultivation in Canada. This insect pest hides on young strawberry leaves that have not yet opened, which limits their control. In addition, the fight against the latter involves the use of synthetic chemicals that are not without effect on the environment, human health and beneficial organisms. We hypothesized that vectorization by bees could reduce the number of applications, product runoff and provide targeted control of these pathogens. To do this, field trials were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of bumblebees Bombus terrestris in propagating Beauveria bassiana to control this pest. Our results showed that bumblebees were able to disseminate the inoculum on strawberry plants. Also, all the products used (B. bassiana and neem oil) were effective on P. pallidus. It should be noted that high mortality has been noted on this pest thanks to the application of this entomopathogen by spraying. In addition, neither of the two products tested had a significant effect on lady beetles C. septempunctata. These results therefore suggest the use of bee vectoring and neem essential oils in the sustainable management of strawberry mites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"701ddebafe07316351d62b505167c0b6bd332b042b6585cea46d1d23669f315e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
