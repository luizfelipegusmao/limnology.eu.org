This study quantifies the environmental life cycle impact of adopting agriculture water reuse systems using case study data to estimate operating and building infrastructure impacts and spatial–temporal modeling to quantify resource trade-offs. Water reuse system benefits are highly dependent on supply–storage–demand dynamics. The relative size of irrigated agricultural land to the lagoon size was the most significant factor influencing site water application rates. The benefits are sensitive to changes in air emissions occurring from the agricultural land and further emphasize the importance of proper fertilizer management when adopting water reuse systems. Wastewater reuse from complete retention lagoons reduce life cycle GHG emissions, primarily through excavation reductions, offset fertilizer use, and especially from increased crop yields from wastewater reuse at previously rainfed sites.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nSeven case studies and spatial–temporal modeling quantified resource trade-offs for water reuse to reduce lagoon size.\nExcavation reductions and offset fertilizer compensated for emissions from electricity and construction.\nCrop yield increases were the largest environmental benefit of adopting water reuse.\nSystem benefits are highly dependent on supply–storage–demand dynamics.\nDesigners should use climatic data to help estimate potential variability in available water for reuse and associated energy and crop production.\n</p>","author":"Matthew Thompson, \nBruce Dvorak","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"608e8453b5621f892cb42b7beb96e8082121d7b5a994dfaa26256c5b044fb428","category":"Environment"}
