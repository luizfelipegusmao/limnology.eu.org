{"title":"WH-In Situ in Islands. A Semantic Analysis Based on Corpus Data.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0815/v1","date":1718183771000,"content":"This paper deals with wh-in situ elements (i.e. wh-elements that stay in the argument position) in islands such as adverbial clauses, conditionals, relative clauses, complement clauses, etc. extracted from corpora of Italian and Spanish. I will show that there are two types of wh-in situ embedded inside an island in these languages. One type is a real genuine question. Another type is an echo question. There are several approaches that convincingly account for the insensitivity of echo questions to islands. The genuine question type is still a puzzle for semantic and syntactic approaches. It turns out that wh-in situ questions with a genuine question interpretation are only possible inside islands that are not marked for sentence type and do not contain any operator that could block the question interpretation of the wh-in situ. This way question alternatives can be passed higher up the clause until they meet a question operator in the matrix clause that interprets them. Consequently, the question is well-formed and interpreted without any problem. Real islands contain semantic operators or quantifiers that interpret question alternatives triggered by wh-in situ until they reach the question morpheme to be interpreted as question alternatives. The result is that the derivation crashes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b90923aa14930cf152309e1ec7ab08051b8bc410e210858328166222adfde9cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
