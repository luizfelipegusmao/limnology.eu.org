{"title":"Pathpoint® ePOA: Revolutionizing Preoperative Care – A Literature Review and Clinical Evaluation of Digital Assessment Tools","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1290/v2","date":1721198286000,"content":"Preoperative assessment is crucial in surgical care, traditionally relying on physical examinations and paper-based questionnaires. The emergence of digital tools like Pathpoint® ePOA represents a significant advancement, aiming to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and standardisation of preoperative evaluations. Pathpoint® ePOA is a cloud-based platform designed to integrate seamlessly with Electronic Health Records (EHRs), providing a comprehensive, data-driven approach to preoperative assessments. It supports improved risk stratification, optimised resource allocation, and enhanced patient engagement through features such as customisable templates and real-time data integration.Current research highlights that digital preoperative tools like ePOA offer notable advantages, including increased clinical capacity, better complexity stratification, and improved patient follow-up. Despite these benefits, gaps remain in comparative studies, detailed clinical outcomes, and patient engagement strategies, indicating areas for further exploration. Pathpoint® ePOA adheres to rigorous safety standards and risk management protocols, ensuring reliability and data security while contributing to improved surgical outcomes. The benefit-risk ratio for ePOA is favourable, underscoring its potential to advance preoperative care by optimising clinical workflows and enhancing patient safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6e3b2ec155447bc095a25fe485472d5b2fa4350fe79c46afac6ef76cf269ce6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
