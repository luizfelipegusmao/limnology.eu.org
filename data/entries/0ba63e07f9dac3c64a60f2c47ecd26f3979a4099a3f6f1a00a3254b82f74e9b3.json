{"title":"Evaluation of Mechanical Wood Properties of Silver Birch (Betula pendula L. Roth.) of Half-Sib Genetic Families","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1764/v1","date":1714128556000,"content":"The study findings revealed significant variability in various wood properties among different genetic families, although the static modulus of elasticity did not exhibit significant differences between the chosen genetic families. All measured wood properties decreased from the bottom to the top of the model trees. Wood hardness displayed a moderately negative correlation with wood density and weak correlations with MOE and MOR. Given the weak correlations between wood hardness and other wood mechanical properties, it is suggested that the MOEdyn would be a more suitable trait for genetic studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ba63e07f9dac3c64a60f2c47ecd26f3979a4099a3f6f1a00a3254b82f74e9b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
