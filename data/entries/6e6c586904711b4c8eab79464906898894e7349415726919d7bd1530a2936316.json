{"title":"Magnetic Hopfions: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2084/v1","date":1727346200000,"content":"Recent advances in the research area of 3D magnetic topological solitons (hopfions) in restricted geometries are reviewed. The description of the magnetic solitons is based on macroscopic micromagnetic approach and the Landau-Lifshitz equation of the magnetization motion. The concepts of the gauge emergent vector potential and emergent magnetic field are widely used to calculate 3D topological charge (the Hopf index) of magnetic textures. The relation of the magnetic hopfions with classical field theory is demonstrated and a special role of the curvilinear toroidal coordinates in description of the hopfions is underlined. The hopfion stability and dynamics in ferromagnetic films and dots are considered. Some critical discussion of calculations of the magnetization emergent magnetic field and the Hopf index of the toroidal magnetic hopfions in restricted geometries is presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e6c586904711b4c8eab79464906898894e7349415726919d7bd1530a2936316","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
