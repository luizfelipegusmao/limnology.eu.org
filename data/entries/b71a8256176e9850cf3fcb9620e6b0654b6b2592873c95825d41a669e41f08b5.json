{"title":"The Effects of Auxin Transport Inhibition on the Formation of Various Leaf and Vein Patterns","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1148/v1","date":1723725120000,"content":"Polar auxin transport (PAT) and auxin efflux carriers are known components controlling leaf complexity and venation patterns in some model plant species. Evidence indicates that PAT generates auxin converge points (CPs) that in turn lead to local leaf formation and internally into major vein formation. However, the role of PAT in more diverse leaf arrangements and vein patterns is largely unknown. We used pharmacological inhibition of PAT in developing pinnate tomato, trifoliate clover, palmate lupin, and bipinnate carrot leaves and observed dosage-dependent reduction to simple leaves in these eudicots. Leaf venation patterns changed from craspedodromous (clover, carrot), semi-craspedodromous (tomato) and brochidodromous (lupin) to more parallel patterning with PAT inhibition. The visualization of auxin responses in transgenic tomato plants showed that discrete and separate CPs in control plants were replaced by diffuse convergence areas near the margin. These effects indicate that PAT plays a universal role in the formation of different leaf and vein patterns in eudicot species via a mechanism that depends on the generation as well as separation of auxin CPs. Computer simulations indicate that variations in PAT can alter the number of CPs, corresponding leaf lobe formation and position of major leaf veins along the leaf margin in support of experimental results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b71a8256176e9850cf3fcb9620e6b0654b6b2592873c95825d41a669e41f08b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
