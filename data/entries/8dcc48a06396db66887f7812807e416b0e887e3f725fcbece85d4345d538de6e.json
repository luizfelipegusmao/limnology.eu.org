{"title":"Screening and the Production of Myxopyronin A Antibiotic from different Soil Environments in Egypt","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0343/v1","date":1715068881000,"content":"Background: Antibiotic resistance is an overwhelming serious difficulty globally. This necessitates the exploration of novel sources of antibiotics to overcome this challenge. Aim of the study: Bacterial Myxopyronin A production from various soil environments Egypt; as well as testing its antimicrobial activity in preclinical animal testing and randomized human clinical trials phases 1/2. Type of the study: Screening experimental study. Methodology: Different soil environments in Egypt were screened for the growth of bacterial isolates producing Myxopyronin A as an antimicrobial agent. Purification of Myxopyronin A was performed via reversed-phase HPLC. Paper disc diffusion assay, as well as broth dilution technique, were exploited to assess the invitro antimicrobial and minimum inhibitory concentration( MIC) of the test antibiotic. Furthermore, in vivo antimicrobial spectrum, adverse drug reactions, and pharmacokinetics were detected during animal model testing stages and human randomized clinical trials phases 1/2. Results: From the culture supernatant of the Myxobacterium Myxococcus fulvus 124B02 which was the predominant soil bacterial isolate grown on the Casein yeast peptone plate, Myxopyronin A was produced. The test antibiotic blocked the growth of many Gram +ve bacteria with MICs less than 100 mcg/ ml; whereas it inhibited the growth of a few Gram -ve bacteria such as Escherichia coli at MICs greater than 100 mcg/ ml. On the other hand, Eukaryotic cells such as fungal and human cells were not affected. Prokaryotic DNA-dependant-RNA polymerase( RNLP) was noticed to be inhibited via the test antibiotic suggesting its bactericidal action. Cmax was 7-8 mcg/ ml at Tmax 2 hours when 600 mg dose was orally administered in randomized human clinical trials phases 1/2; as well as T1/2 reached 2.5 hours following first-order kinetics of elimination. The duration of its action was nearly 12 hours after oral administration. Rare toxicity was detected during preclinical and randomized human clinical trials phases 1/2 in the form of mild diarrhea and cholestatic jaundice in less than 5 % of experimental candidates. Conclusion: The present study was promising due to the production of the bactericidal antibiotic Myxopyronin A from Myxococcus fulvus 124B02 isolated from different soil environments in Egypt.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8dcc48a06396db66887f7812807e416b0e887e3f725fcbece85d4345d538de6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
