{"title":"Effect of Total Nitrogen Once Applied at Different Leaf Age Stages on Yield Traits of Dense Planted Dry Direct Seeding Rice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0577/v1","date":1725858093000,"content":"Accordingly, a lot of dry direct seeding rice would be dense planted, that the initial seedling quantity could approach or even exceed the targeted effective panicle number. While limit information is available to evaluate the effects of involved novel nitrogen application methods, that total nitrogen once applied at a determined leaf age stage, on the yield formation traits of such dense planted dry direct seeding rice. The two-year experiments with total 180 kg ha-1 nitrogen once applied time treatments at sixth (L6), seventh (L7), eighth (L8), ninth (L9) and tenth (L10) leaf age stages were carried out. Results showed that the above-ground dry matter weight at maturity and grain yield of L8 was 2.1% ~ 11.8% and 4.0% ~ 9.9% higher than those of other treatments. Compared to other treatments, the higher above-ground dry matter weight after heading stage, bigger mean leaf area index with higher leaf area index at heading stage, increased leaf area duration, crop growth rate and net assimilation rate from jointing to heading period were important traits of higher grain yield formation of L8. In addition, the L8 had relative higher grain-leaf ratio traits than other treatments. Overall, a total 180 kg ha-1 nitrogen with mixed urea and compound fertilizer once applied at eighth leaf age stage would be suggest a useful high yield cultivation method for dense planted dry direct seeding rice in rice-wheat rotation system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a6244e91b0aaabfff987daba4a8876934d3c94fc9a518e318d08a570ca63141","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
