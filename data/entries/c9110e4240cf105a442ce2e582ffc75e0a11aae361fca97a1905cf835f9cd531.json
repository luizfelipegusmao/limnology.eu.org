However, some systems are not amenable to generating edited clones due to genomic complexity and/or difficulty in establishing clonal lines. For example, <span>Drosophila</span> Schneider 2 (S2) cells possess a segmental aneuploid genome and are challenging to single-cell select. Here, we describe a streamlined CRISPR/Cas9 methodology for knock-in and knock-out experiments in S2 cells, whereby an antibiotic resistance gene is inserted in-frame with the coding region of a gene-of-interest. By using selectable markers, we have improved the ease and efficiency for the positive selection of null cells using antibiotic selection in feeder layers followed by cell expansion to generate clonal lines. Using this method, we generated the first acentrosomal S2 cell lines by knocking-out centriole genes Polo-like Kinase 4/Plk4 or Ana2 as proof of concept. These strategies for generating gene-edited clonal lines will add to the collection of CRISPR tools available for cultured <span>Drosophila</span> cells by making CRISPR more practical and therefore improving gene function studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"c9110e4240cf105a442ce2e582ffc75e0a11aae361fca97a1905cf835f9cd531","category":"Environment"}
