{"title":"Instant One-Pot Green Synthesis of Functional Ultra-Stable Gold Nanoparticles: Vaginal Candidiasis Point-of-Care Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1467/v1","date":1716451464000,"content":"The green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is an emerging and promising field owing to its environmentally friendly nature and diverse applications. In this article, a new technology for the green synthesis of functional ultrastable biopolymer gold nanoparticles is introduced. This approach employs thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA-SH) aptamers instead of conventional self-assembled monolayers, resulting in the production of highly stable aptamer-tagged gold-core-shell nanoparticles. A comprehensive discussion on the use of glucose as a simple reducing agent for the green synthesis of Au nanoparticles and the utilization of ssDNA-SH aptamers as smart and biologically functional capping agents is provided. The potential of this innovative approach for the green synthesis of nanoparticles is demonstrated through a case study involving the use of the naked eye for qualitative detection of human fungal infections caused by Candida albicans for women's health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63b642914bd9c151a648ec0490b8250008ab39f441d330b4dc02b9a620e62a1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
