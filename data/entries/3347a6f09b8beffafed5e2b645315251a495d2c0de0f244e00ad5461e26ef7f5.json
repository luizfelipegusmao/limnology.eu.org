They are a phenotypically diverse group of phytoplankton, morphologically categorized into the round centric diatoms and elongated pennate diatoms (<a href=\"#kiae133-B2\">Alverson et al. 2006</a>). Diatoms formed through secondary endosymbiosis, with their chloroplasts originating from red algae. As such, their chloroplasts have 4 membranes (<a href=\"#kiae133-F1\">Fig. A</a>): the chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum, periplastidal membrane, outer chloroplast envelope, and inner chloroplast envelope. Thylakoid membranes sit within the chloroplast stroma, consisting of the girdle lamella and stroma thylakoid. At the center lies the pyrenoid, a membraneless organelle providing a CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism (CCM), crossed by the pyrenoid-penetrating thylakoid (PPT).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3347a6f09b8beffafed5e2b645315251a495d2c0de0f244e00ad5461e26ef7f5","category":"Environment"}
