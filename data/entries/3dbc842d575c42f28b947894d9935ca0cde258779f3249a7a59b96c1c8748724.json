{"title":"Enhanced Mapping for Ecosystem Management: Evaluating the Accuracy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data Fusion Compared to Sole Sentinel-2 Using Random Forest Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1033/v1","date":1723683600000,"content":"Recent advances in satellite technology have brought enormous potential to ecosystem mapping, which is one of the fundamental components of environmental studies. In this paper, a Random Forest classifier is applied for the strict assessment of the efficiency of ecosystem mapping through a detailed comparative analysis between combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and stand-alone Sentinel-2 imagery over three priority ecosystems, including wetlands, riverine areas, and mangroves in Bangladesh. The collocated images, based on the integration of Sentinel-1 data with Sentinel-2 data, would do better than Sentinel-2 imagery alone over various ecosystems. Particularly, in this study, attention focused on the Hakaluki Haor area for the wetlands, the Padma-Jamuna River confluence for the riverine ecosystem, and the Sundarban forest for mangroves. By leveraging Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in C-band dual-polarization from Sentinel-1 and four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared) from Sentinel-2, the study analyzes imagery from December 2022 to February 2023. A 5% cloud masking filter is applied to optical data to enhance accuracy. In this methodology, 70% of the total signature values are used for training the classification model and the remaining 30% for testing. It can be noticed from the results that with the use of fused data, remarkably high accuracy in classification has been improved, such as overall accuracies of 94.17% for mangroves, 87.30% for riverine, and 85.96% for wetland ecosystems. In contrast, the use of singular Sentinel-2 imagery yields lower accuracies of 91.56%, 85.21%, and 82.51% for the respective ecosystems. The integration of radar data is shown to provide critical information, especially in environments with dense vegetation or cloud cover, where optical data alone may be insufficient. The findings of this study underline the limitations of relying on Sentinel-2 imagery to capture complex details of diverse ecosystems and highlight the need to include Sentinel-1 data for a more holistic analysis. This fusion allows improved accuracy to be achieved, which not only brings in more depth of ecological knowledge but also underpins more effective conservation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dbc842d575c42f28b947894d9935ca0cde258779f3249a7a59b96c1c8748724","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
