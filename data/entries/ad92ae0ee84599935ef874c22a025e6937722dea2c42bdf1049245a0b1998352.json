This highlights the suitability of this genus as a model system for studying the ecology and evolution of adhesive toepads as well as being a promising candidate for research on adaptive radiations.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/05/16/toepads-evolved-repeatedly-in-geckos-independently-transitioning-to-climbing-trees-but-less-frequently-in-those-transitioning-to-climbing-on-rocks/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Jendrian Riedel, \nKatrin Eisele, \nMariam Gabelaia, \nTimothy E.
