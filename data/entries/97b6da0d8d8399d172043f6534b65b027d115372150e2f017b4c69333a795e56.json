{"title":"Fucoxanthin induces human melanoma cytotoxicity by thwarting the JAK2/STAT3/BCL‐xL signaling axis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24193?af=R","date":1709708345000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Melanoma is the most lethal skin malignancy. Fucoxanthin is a marine carotenoid with significant anticancer activities. Intriguingly, Fucoxanthin's impact on human melanoma remains elusive. Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) represents a promising target in cancer therapy due to its persistent activation in various cancers, including melanoma. Herein, we revealed that Fucoxanthin is cytotoxic to human melanoma cell lines A2758 and A375 while showing limited cytotoxicity to normal human melanocytes. Apoptosis is a primary reason for Fucoxanthin's melanoma cytotoxicity, as the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk drastically abrogated Fucoxanthin-elicited clonogenicity blockage. Besides, Fucoxanthin downregulated tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3 (Y705)), either inherently present in melanoma cells or inducible by interleukin 6 (IL-6) stimulation. Notably, ectopic expression of STAT3-C, a dominant-active STAT3 mutant, abolished Fucoxanthin-elicited melanoma cell apoptosis and clonogenicity inhibition, supporting the pivotal role of STAT3 blockage in Fucoxanthin's melanoma cytotoxicity. Moreover, Fucoxanthin lowered BCL-xL levels by blocking STAT3 activation, while ectopic BCL-xL expression rescued melanoma cells from Fucoxanthin-induced killing. Lastly, Fucoxanthin was found to diminish the levels of JAK2 with dual phosphorylation at tyrosine residues 1007 and 1008 in melanoma cells, suggesting that Fucoxanthin impairs STAT3 signaling by blocking JAK2 activation. Collectively, we present the first evidence that Fucoxanthin is cytotoxic selectively against human melanoma cells while sparing normal melanocytes. Mechanistically, Fucoxanthin targets the JAK2/STAT3/BCL-xL antiapoptotic axis to provoke melanoma cell death. This discovery implicates the potential application of Fucoxanthin as a chemopreventive or therapeutic strategy for melanoma management.</p>","author":"Min‐Yung Kuo, \nWen‐Chyi Dai, \nJie‐Li Chang, \nJo‐Shu Chang, \nTse‐Min Lee, \nChia‐Che Chang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"97b6da0d8d8399d172043f6534b65b027d115372150e2f017b4c69333a795e56","category":"Environment"}
