{"title":"Manufacturing and Functional Characterization of Graphite/Metal Composite Materials for High Voltage Electric Motors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1955/v1","date":1724806594000,"content":"Current paper is aiming to show the obtained results in manufacturing and characterization of graphite-based and metal composite materials suitable to be used in high voltage applications of automotive and/or aviation field. Thus, 4 types of materials have been processed and tested in order to assess their suitability to be used as current collector material for electric engines. The novelty of this work is the presentation of the new innovative technological process for obtaining the carbon/metal composite material used in the manufacture of sliding contacts for current collector heads, as well as the characteristics obtained for this material. All 4 obtained materials have been characterized from structural, mechanical and functional point of view and the most suitable of them has been chosen to be further developed by the end beneficiary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a251310d3b13e6eae52d375d570088fea54a5e09c041ffc3a43b6707aeaf4047","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
