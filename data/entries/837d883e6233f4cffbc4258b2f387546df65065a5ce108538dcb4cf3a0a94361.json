The study utilizes a case-control design to examine potential risk factors for MetS, categorizing participants as MetS+ considered as “Cases” and MetS- considered as “Controls” matched by sex and age. The evaluation of factors such as MetS, lifestyle habits, and environmental influences is conducted at two time points, T0 and T3, after 3 months. Subsequently, the project aims to assess body parameters, including physical examinations, and blood, and stool sample collection, to evaluate metabolic markers and the impact of SGAs. The analysis includes pharmacological treatment data and genetic variability. Behavioural markers related to lifestyle, eating behaviour, PA, and mood are assessed at both T0 and T3 using interviews, accelerometers, and a mobile app. The study aims to improve mental and physical well-being in SGA-treated individuals, establish a biobank for MetS research, build an evidence base for physical health programs, and develop preventive strategies for SGA-related comorbidities.</p> Conclusions <p>This project innovates MetS monitoring in psychiatry by using intensive digital phenotyping, identifying biochemical markers, assessing familial risks, and including genetically similar healthy controls.</p> Study registration number <p>\r\nISRCTN18419418 at www.isrctn.com.</p>","author":"Giovanni de Girolamo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"837d883e6233f4cffbc4258b2f387546df65065a5ce108538dcb4cf3a0a94361","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
