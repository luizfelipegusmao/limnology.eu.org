{"title":"Characterization of Biofilm Formation by Staphylococcus aureus Depending on NaCl Concentration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1116/v1","date":1726296250000,"content":"Staphylococcus aureus, found in the oral cavity as an opportunistic bacterium, has been reported as a cause of infective endocarditis and pneumonia. Salt is an essential mineral component for maintaining human body cells and has attracted attention as a promoter of S. aureus biofilms. This study was conducted to clarify how salt affects biofilm formation by S. aureus and S. mutans, which is a pathogen implicated in the dental caries. Bacteria were cultivated with various concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) in Toryptic Soy Broth with 0.25% sucrose and 0.25% glucose (TSBs and TSBg) for 16 hours. Contribution of GTF on the membrane vesicles (MVs) from S. mutans and extracellular DNA (eDNA) was also analyzed in the biofilm formation. S. aureus biofilms were induced by the addition of 0.004â€“0.25 M NaCl but decreased by NaCl concentrations greater than 0.25 M, in TSBs. The biofilm formation of mixed bacteria (S. aureus and S. mutans) gradually increased in a NaCl concentration-dependent manner in TSBs and TSBg. Moreover, the biofilm was dependent on glucan formation by GTF in MVs at high salinity. The mixed-species biofilm of S. aureus and S. mutans was upregulated by the collaboration of eDNA and MVs. Therefore, eDNA and MVs are developmental factors for S. aureus biofilm formation under harsh conditions. The intake of sucrose and glucose may be a risk factor for infection by opportunistic pathogens such as S. aureus in persons who consume high concentrations of salt in foods and drinks in custom-type foods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d44a370eed0d7da4fd6cf8b42b4d917da9b5c5efc25d2c7a14829628fbb3c9aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
