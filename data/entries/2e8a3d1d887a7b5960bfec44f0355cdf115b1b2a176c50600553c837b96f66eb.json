{"title":"Sustainable Electromagnetic Prototype to Detect Interior Deterioration of Building Facades","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1853/v1","date":1716899535000,"content":"In the provinces of the region, empirical constructions reached maximum points with these practices. The effects and pathologies appear as physical, chemical and mechanical failures in pillars, walls and roofs, generating uncertainty for the user. The current powerful design can detect the interior deterioration of coatings in adobe, brick and concrete constructions, and prevent collapses, material and economic losses. Experimental methods performed affirm the serious validity. The accuracy of the simulation and design provide a pre-test reliability of 95%. Five piles constructed of various materials participate in the prototype performance test, there is a correlation (R=0.9997) between the magnetic field range \"B\" (cm) and density \"ρ\" (g/cm³), also by increasing the current (i) in transit Q1 and coil L1, the induction of the \"B\" increases proportionally until penetrating the density of the wall of the building, having 5% reading error.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e8a3d1d887a7b5960bfec44f0355cdf115b1b2a176c50600553c837b96f66eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
