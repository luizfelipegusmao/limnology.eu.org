{"title":"Market Crisis Management Strategy Based on Predicting Loyal Customers Using Deep Meta-Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0868/v1","date":1720684375000,"content":"Market crises pose significant challenges for businesses, emphasizing the importance of effective crisis management strategies. Central to these strategies is the ability to identify and retain loyal customers, who often serve as the bedrock of stability during tumultuous times. This paper investigates the application of deep meta-learning analysis to predict loyal customers as a cornerstone of market crisis management. Drawing upon an extensive literature review, the study explores previous research on market crises, customer loyalty, and the evolution of deep learning and meta-learning in crisis management contexts. Methodologically, the paper outlines data collection, model development, and evaluation procedures tailored for deep meta-learning-based customer prediction. In results, the overall accuracy of model 85%, a precision 0.88, recall 0.82, and F1-score 0.85 were obtained. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of deep meta-learning models in accurately identifying loyal customers during market crises, offering insights into their performance and applicability compared to traditional methods. Practical implications include potential applications in crisis management for businesses and considerations for real-world implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af54163923d18f5a3848adb16257f7d27be9622cf271546ab36617a1d7d5c335","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
