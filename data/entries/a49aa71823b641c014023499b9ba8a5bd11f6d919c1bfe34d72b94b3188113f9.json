{"title":"Cross-informant ratings on emotional and behavioral problems in Nepali adolescents: A comparison of adolescents’ self-reports with parents’ and teachers’ reports","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303673","date":1715868000000,"content":"<p>by Sirjana Adhikari, Jasmine Ma, Suraj Shakya, Per Håkan Brøndbo, Bjørn Helge Handegård, Anne Cecilie Javo</p>\r\nBackground <p>Studies on cross-informant agreement on adolescents’ emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs) are sparse in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to assess parent-adolescent and teacher-adolescent agreement on EBPs and associated factors in Nepal.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional survey included 1904 school-going adolescents aged 11–18, enrolled in government and private schools located in sixteen districts of Nepal. The Nepali versions of the Youth Self Report, Child Behavior Checklist, and Teacher’s Report Form were administered to assess EBPs reported by adolescents, their parents, and teachers, respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to assess mean differences in problem scores. Pearson’s correlation was used to assess cross-informant agreement. Linear regression analysis was used to explore factors associated with cross-informant discrepancies in EBPs.</p> Results <p>Adolescents reported significantly more problems than their parents and teachers. Mean Total Problem scores for the 90 common items in the adolescents’ self-reports, parent reports, and teacher reports were 34.5 (standard deviation [SD]: 21.4), 24.1 (SD = 19.2), and 20.2 (SD = 17.5) respectively. Parent-adolescent agreement on Total Problems was moderate, whereas teacher-adolescent agreement was low. The parent-adolescent agreement was moderate to low for the two broadband scales and all syndrome scales, whereas the teacher-adolescent agreement was low for all scales. Female gender and ethnic minority status impacted both parent-adolescent and teacher-adolescent discrepancies. Family stress/conflicts impacted parent-adolescent discrepancies, while academic performance impacted teacher-adolescent discrepancies.</p> Conclusions <p>Nepali adolescents reported more EBPs than their parents and teachers. The agreement between adolescents’ self-reports and reports by their parents and teachers was moderate to low. Gender, caste/ethnicity, family stress/conflicts, and academic performance were associated with cross-informant discrepancies. It is crucial to collect information from different sources, consider context-specific needs, and discern factors influencing cross-informant discrepancies to accurately assess adolescents’ EBPs and develop personalized approaches to treatment planning.</p>","author":"Sirjana Adhikari","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a49aa71823b641c014023499b9ba8a5bd11f6d919c1bfe34d72b94b3188113f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
