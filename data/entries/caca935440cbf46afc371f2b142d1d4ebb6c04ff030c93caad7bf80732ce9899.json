{"title":"Grow with the flow: Is phenotypic plasticity across hydrodynamic gradients common in seaweeds?","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13503?af=R","date":1729597128000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Seaweeds are widely assumed to be phenotypically plastic across hydrodynamic gradients, yet while many marine macroalgae exhibit intraspecific phenotypic variation that correlates with flow, researchers often fail to test whether such variation is due to plasticity or another mechanism, such as local adaptation. In this minireview, we considered mechanisms for sensing flow in seaweeds that could facilitate adaptive phenotypic plasticity across hydrodynamic gradients. We then reviewed the literature from 1900 to 2024 to see how often phenotypic variation and plasticity across hydrodynamic gradients had been observed and demonstrated in different groups of seaweeds. In the last 124â€‰years, phenotypic variation and plasticity in response to flow have been well documented in brown algae but scarcely documented in red and green algae. This could suggest that brown algae are better able to sense and respond to flow than red and green algae, perhaps due to the intercalary meristem of many brown algae, including most kelps. However, this skewed distribution could also be the result of publication bias, as most studies involving flow have been conducted on brown algae. Only 30% of 141 papers specifically investigated if observations of phenotypic variation along hydrodynamic gradients were due to plasticity. To date, phenotypic plasticity in response to flow has been demonstrated in 20 brown algal species, five red algal species, and two green algal species. Thus, the assumption that phenotypic plasticity to flow is common across seaweeds is not particularly well supported by the literature. Mechanisms underlying plasticity to flow are poorly understood and remain a critical avenue for future research.</p>","author":"Liam J. M. Coleman, \nPatrick T.
