{"title":"Volatile Compounds Emitted by Plant Growth–Promoting Fungus Tolypocladium inflatum GT22 Alleviate Copper and Pathogen Stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/2/199/7319538?rss=1","date":1697500800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Previous studies on the intricate interactions between plants and microorganisms have revealed that fungal volatile compounds (VCs) can affect plant growth and development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these actions remain to be delineated. In this study, we discovered that VCs from the soilborne fungus <span>Tolypocladium inflatum</span> GT22 enhance the growth of <span>Arabidopsis</span>. Remarkably, priming <span>Arabidopsis</span> with GT22 VCs caused the plant to display an enhanced immune response and mitigated the detrimental effects of both pathogenic infections and copper stress. Transcriptomic analyses of <span>Arabidopsis</span> seedlings treated with GT22 VCs for 3, 24 and 48 h revealed that 90, 83 and 137 genes were differentially expressed, respectively. The responsive genes are known to be involved in growth, hormone regulation, defense mechanisms and signaling pathways. Furthermore, we observed the induction of genes related to innate immunity, hypoxia, salicylic acid biosynthesis and camalexin biosynthesis by GT22 VCs. Among the VCs emitted by GT22, exposure of <span>Arabidopsis</span> seedlings to limonene promoted plant growth and attenuated copper stress. Thus, limonene appears to be a key mediator of the interaction between GT22 and plants. Overall, our findings provide evidence that fungal VCs can promote plant growth and enhance both biotic and abiotic tolerance. As such, our study suggests that exposure of seedlings to <span>T. inflatum</span> GT22 VCs may be a means of improving crop productivity. This study describes a beneficial interaction between <span>T. inflatun</span> GT22 and <span>Arabidopsis</span>. Our investigation of microorganism function in terms of VC activities allowed us to overcome the limitations of traditional microbial application methods. The importance of this study lies in the discovery of <span>T. inflatun</span> GT22 as a beneficial microorganism. This soilborne fungus emits VCs with plant growth–promoting effects and the ability to alleviate both copper and pathogenic stress. Furthermore, our study offers a valuable approach to tracking the activities of fungal VC components via transcriptomic analysis and sheds light on the mechanisms through which VCs promote plant growth and induce resistance. This research significantly advances our knowledge of VC applications and provides an example for further investigations within this field.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"f5cf130db82cd4ae2e723768f2d03a562a0dd681be3f9b65d0e262feec36aeac","category":"Environment"}
