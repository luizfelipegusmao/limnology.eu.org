{"title":"Late Age- and Dose-Related Effects on the Proteome of Thyroid Tissue in Rats after 131I Exposure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1345/v1","date":1711085591000,"content":"The physiological process of iodine uptake in the thyroid is used for 131I treatment of thyroid diseases. Children are more sensitive to radiation compared to adults and may react differently to 131I exposure. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects on thyroid protein expression in young and adult rats one year after 131I injection, and identify potential biomarkers related to 131I exposure, absorbed dose, and age. Twelve Sprague Dawley Rats (young and adults) were i.v. injected with 50 kBq or 500 kBq 131I and were killed twelve months later. Twelve untreated rats were used as age-matched controls. Quantitative proteomics, statistical analysis and evaluation of biological effects was performed. The effects of irradiation were most prominent in young rats. \nProtein biomarker candidates were proposed related to age, absorbed dose, thyroid function and cancer and a panel was proposed for 131I exposure. In conclusion, the proteome of rat thyroid was differentially regulated twelve months after low-intermediate dose exposure to 131I in both young and adult rats. Several biomarker candidates are proposed for 131I exposure, age, and many of them are known to be related to thyroid function or thyroid cancer. Further research on human samples are needed for validation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ced8a2bf0162164e50aae0e212f8aa2906857a79dc532c56be13727c7f816f73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
