DNA virus infections generally inflict stress responses and cause structural aberration of the nucleus and the nucleolus. Here, we applied a complementary approach combining correlative soft x-ray tomography, EM, and expansion microscopy to study the effects of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) lytic infection on the nucleolar structure, organization, and nucleolar protein content. Soft-x-ray tomography was correlated with structure illumination microscopy to study the viral replication center. During infection, nucleoli were visibly affected by the stress brought up by the infection. Nucleolar proteins were redistributed, and in late infection, the remains of the nucleoli were pushed to the nuclear periphery together with the marginalized chromatin. The 3D organization of the chromatin around the nucleoli underwent extensive changes. The virus-induced alterations to the nucleolar structure were accompanied by changes in the rRNA production and processing. Altogether, this shows that HSV-1 infection targets the nucleolus, affecting its structure and organization, which leads to the redistribution of nucleolar proteins that most likely result in the modified rRNA processing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2ed46accaa59821aa271fec58cf1e1b07fe3b56fd7751e7a8136c574abd001d5","category":"Environment"}
