{"title":"Polymerase I as a Target for Treating Neurodegenerative Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0322/v1","date":1712239009000,"content":"Polymerase I (Pol I) is at the epicenter of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis.  Pol I is a target for treatment of cancer.  Given the many cellular commonalities between cancer and neurodegeneration (i.e., different faces of the same coin) it seems rational to consider targeting of Pol I or, more generally, rRNA synthesis for treatment of disorders associated with the death of terminally differentiated neurons.  Principally, ribosomes synthesize proteins and, accordingly, Pol I can be considered the starting point for protein synthesis.  Given that cellular accumulation of abnormal proteins such as α-synuclein and tau is an essential feature of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease and fronto-temporal dementia, reduction of protein production is now considered as a viable target for treatment of these and closely related neurodegenerative disorders.  Abnormalities in polymerase I activity and rRNA production may also be associated with nuclear and nucleolar stress, DNA damage, and childhood onset neuronal death as is the case for the UBTF E210K neuroregression syndrome.   Moreover, restraining the activity of Pol I may be a viable strategy to slow aging.  Before starting down the road of Pol I inhibition for treating non-cancerous disorders of the nervous system, many questions must be answered.   First, how much Pol I inhibition can neurons tolerate and for how long?  Should inhibition of Pol I be continuous or pulsed?  Will cells compensate for Pol I inhibition by upregulating the number of active rDNAs?  At present, we have no effective and safe disease modulatory treatments for Alzheimer disease, α-synucleinopathies, or tauopathies, and novel therapeutic targets and approaches must be explored.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4262114168e6d69e6e0a1136637c08a1813f70ff578fbf1063f29e09ed4b4c9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
