{"title":"Populus euphratica CPK21 Interact with NF-YC3 to Enhance Cadmium Tolerance in Arabidopsis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0108/v1","date":1714636183000,"content":"The toxic cadmium (Cd) poses a serious threat to plant growth and human health. Populus euphratica CPK21 has previously been shown to attenuate Cd toxicity by reducing Cd accumulation, enhancing antioxidant defense and improving water balance in transgenic Arabidopsis. Here, we confirmed a protein-protein interaction between PeCPK21 and AtNF-YC3 by yeast two-hybrid, HaloTag pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. AtNF-YC3 was induced by Cd and strongly expressed in PeCPK21-overexpressed plants. Overexpression of AtNF-YC3 in Arabidopsis reduced salt inhibition of root length, fresh weight and membrane stability under Cd stress conditions (100 ÂµM, 7 d), suggesting that AtNF-YC3 appears to contribute to the improvement of Cd stress tolerance. AtNF-YC3 improved Cd tolerance by limiting Cd uptake and accumulation, activating antioxidant enzymes, and reducing H2O2 production under Cd stress. We conclude that PeCPK21 interacts with AtNF-YC3 to limit Cd accumulation, enhance the ROS scavenging system, and thereby positively regulate plant adaptation to Cd environments. This study highlights the interaction between PeCPK21 and AtNF-YC3 under Cd stress conditions, which can be utilized to improve Cd tolerance in higher plants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"628c6936e2d5b38058ac6c7b545481fc1dadf953101b76c1f12d037296a9241c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
