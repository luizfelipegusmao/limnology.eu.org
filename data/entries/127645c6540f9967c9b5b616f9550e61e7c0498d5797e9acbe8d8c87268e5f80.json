{"title":"Effects of the Quantum Vacuum at a Cosmic Scale and Dark Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0889/v1","date":1728645892000,"content":"Einstein equation approximated to second order in Newton constant G is quantized and applied to a large region of the universe. The two-point correlations of the vacuum energy density and pressure are included and the resulting metric agrees with the one derived from the $\\Lambda CDM$ cosmological model plus an additional contribution of the quantum vacuum. The conclusion is that at least a part of the acceleration in the expansion of the universe is due to the vacuum fluctuations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"127645c6540f9967c9b5b616f9550e61e7c0498d5797e9acbe8d8c87268e5f80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
