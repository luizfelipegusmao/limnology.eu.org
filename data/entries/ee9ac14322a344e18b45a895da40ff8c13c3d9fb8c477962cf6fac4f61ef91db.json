{"title":"The Number of Health-Promoting Substances That All Edible Vascular Plants Contain Compared to the Total Number of Health-Promoting Substances of Five Wild Edible Plants (WEPs)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1307/v1","date":1729128279000,"content":"In Åhlberg (2021, 2022b), I presented evidence for 57 health-promoting substances that all green vascular WEPs contain. I continued searching for health-promoting substances in the plant cells' basic structures and processes. While reading research reports of five invasive species, I found eight more health-promoting substances all green vascular wild edible plants have. This article adds eight new substances to the earlier 57, bringing the total to 65. This is a novel finding for which I provide research evidence. I present the latest research on five invasive wild edible plants (WEPs) species. Each contains at least the same 65 health-promoting substances and a varying number of species-specific health-promoting substances. Each WEP has 1) shared health-promoting substances that all green vascular plants have and 2) species-specific health-promoting substances. I also present how many of these substances prevent Alzheimer’s disease, according to experimental research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee9ac14322a344e18b45a895da40ff8c13c3d9fb8c477962cf6fac4f61ef91db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
