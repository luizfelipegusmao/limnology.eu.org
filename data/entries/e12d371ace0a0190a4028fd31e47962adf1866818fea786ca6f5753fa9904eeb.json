{"title":"Application of Cystoseira myrica phycosynthesized selenium nanoparticles incorporated with nano‐chitosan to control aflatoxigenic fungi in fish feed","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13604?af=R","date":1716382996000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The recurrent contaminations of feed materials with mycotoxigenic fungi can endanger both farmed animals and humans. Biosynthesized nanomaterials are assumingly the ideal agents to overcome fungal invasion in feed/foodstuffs, especially when utilizing sustainable sources for synthesis. Herein, the phycosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) was targeted using <i>Cystoseira myrica</i> algal extract (CE), and the conjugation of CE/SeNPs with chitosan nanoparticles (NCt) to produce potential antifungal nanocomposites for controlling <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> isolates in fish feed.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The phycosynthesis of SeNPs with CE was effectually carried out and validated using visible/UV analysis, X-ray diffraction and transmission microscopy; CE/SeNPs had diameters of 8.7 nm and spherical shapes. NCt/CE/SeNPs nanocomposite (173.3 nm mean diameter) was achieved and the component interactions were validated via infrared spectroscopic analysis. The antifungal assessment of screened nanomaterials against three <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> strains indicated that NCt/CE/SeNPs exceeded the fluconazole action using qualitative/quantitative assays. Severe alteration/distortions in <i>A. flavus</i> mycelial structure and morphology were microscopically observed within 48 h of NCt/CE/SeNPs treatment. The treatment of feed ingredients (crushed corn and feed powder) by blending with nanomaterials (NCt, CE/SeNPs and NCt/CE/SeNPs) led to significant reduction in <i>A. flavus</i> count/growth after storage for 7 days; NCt/CE/SeNPs could completely inhibit any fungal growth in feed material.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The pioneering phycosynthesis of CE/SeNPs and their nanoconjugation with NCt generated bioactive antifungal agents to control <i>A. flavus</i> strains. The innovatively constructed NCt/CE/SeNPs nanocomposite is advised for application as an effectual, biosafe and natural fungicidal conjugate for the protection of fish feed from mycotoxigenic fungi. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ahmed A Tayel, \nKarima M El‐madawy, \nShaaban H Moussa, \nMona A Assas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e12d371ace0a0190a4028fd31e47962adf1866818fea786ca6f5753fa9904eeb","category":"Environment"}
