{"title":"Joint Metabolomic and Transcriptomic Analysis Identify Unique Phenolic Acid and Flavonoid Compounds Associated with Resistance to Fusarium wilt in Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0738/v1","date":1712747213000,"content":"Fusarium wilt (FW) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cucumerinum (Foc) of cucumber is a destructive soil-borne disease in cucumber (Cucumis sativus.L). There is limited knowledge on molecular mechanisms to FW resistance-mediated defense responses in cucumber. In this study, metabolome and transcriptome profiling were carried out in two FW, resistant (NR) and susceptible (NS), near isogenic lines (NILs) before and after Foc inoculation. The NILs showed consistent and stable FW resistances in multiple greenhouse and laboratory screening tests. Widely targeted metabolomic analysis identified differentially accumulated metabolites (DMAs) with significantly more accumulation in NR in response to Foc infection including many phenolic acid and flavonoid compounds from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the NILs upon Foc inoculation including genes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis in or transcription factor genes regulating the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Joint analysis of the metabolomic and transcriptomic data identified DAMs and DEGs closely associated with biosynthesis of phenolic acid and flavonoid DAMs. The association of these compounds with NR-conferred FW resistance was exemplified by in vivo assays in which two phenolic acid compounds, bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and diisooctyl phthalate, and the flavonoid compound gallocatechin 3-O-gallate were shown to have significant inhibitory effect on Foc growth. The antifungal effect of three compounds seems to be a novel finding. We conclude that phenolic acids and flavonoids play an important role in NR mediated FW resistance in cucumber.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc6074a6a3ca4ee1c40f8d88b7141cfaed07add3895fc1c7ac4bc027173995f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
