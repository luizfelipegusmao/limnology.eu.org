{"title":"Treatment with Ascorbyl Glucoside Arginine Complex Ameliorates Solar Lentigos","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0561/v1","date":1723112890000,"content":"Lotions with or without 28% ascorbyl glucoside arginine complex (AGAC) were applied twice daily for 24 weeks in a double‐blind half‐face study of 27 Japanese females with solar lentigos (SLs). Pigmentation scores were evaluated using a photo‐scale and skin colors were assessed using a color difference meter and a Mexameter. Treatment with the test lotion elicited a significant decrease in pigment scores at 24 weeks compared to week 0; with a significant decrease in pigment scores at 24 weeks compared to the placebo lotion‐treated SLs. In the test lotion‐treated SLs; the L values and melanin index (MI) significantly (p&lt;0.0001) increased and decreased; respectively; at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment compared to week 0. Comparisons of increased L (△L) values or decreased MI (△MI) values between test and placebo lotion‐treated SLs demonstrated that the test lotion‐treated SLs had significantly higher △L or △MI values than the placebo lotion‐treated SLs both at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The sum of our results strongly indicates that AGAC is distinctly effective in ameliorating the hyperpigmentation levels of SLs at a visibly recognizable level by the subjects without any hypo‐pigmenting effects or skin irritation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"994861aa445e074cbe10401d1e1fd05f760450408310e613dcd080a019ee2daf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
