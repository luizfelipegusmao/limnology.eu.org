{"title":"The ZmNF-YC1–ZmAPRG pathway modulates low phosphorus tolerance in maize","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2867/7613260?rss=1","date":1708646400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and yield. Low phosphate use efficiency makes it important to clarify the molecular mechanism of low P stress. In our previous studies, a P efficiency gene <span>ZmAPRG</span> was identified. Here, we further screened the upstream regulator ZmNF-YC1 of <span>ZmAPRG</span> by yeast one hybrid (Y1H) assay, and found it was a low inorganic phosphorus (Pi)-inducible gene. The results of dual luciferase assays, expression analysis, and ChIP-qPCR assays showed that ZmNF-YC1 is a positive regulator of <span>ZmAPRG</span>. Overexpression of <span>ZmNF-YC1</span> improved low P tolerance, whereas knockout of <span>ZmNF-YC1</span> decreased low P tolerance in maize. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), yeast two hybrid (Y2H) assay, and yeast three hybrid (Y3H) assay further showed that ZmNF-YC1 can interact with ZmNF-YB14, and recruit ZmNF-YA4/10 to form NF-Y complexes. Transcriptional activation assay confirmed that the NF-Y complexes can activate the promoters of <span>ZmAPRG</span>. Meanwhile, transcriptome and metabolome analyses indicated that overexpression of <span>ZmAPRG</span> improves low P tolerance by regulating lipid composition and photosynthetic capacity, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters provided evidence in support of this hypothesis. Furthermore, overexpression of <span>ZmAPRG</span> increased grain yield in inbred and hybrid maize under low P conditions. Taken together, our research revealed a low P tolerance mechanism of the ZmNF-YC1–ZmAPRG pathway.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"15eccce0927535beb50120823042cbd8a1a637e73d52d427e6b2301dec8064fe","category":"Environment"}
