{"title":"Water Resources of the Belarusian Polesie under the Influence of Anthropogenic Factors Using the Example of the Lan River","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1824/v1","date":1721750776000,"content":"The work is devoted to assessing changes in the water regime of the Lan River in modern conditions and the near future with the aim of developing a strategy for the rational use of the water potential of small rivers in the Belarusian Polesie region. There was a tendency towards an increase in annual runoff at the Loktyshi and Mokrovo gauging stations during the study period from 1948 to 2015, which was caused by anthropogenic factors in the form of amelioration measures. Testing the hypothesis about the homogeneity of the runoff series under consideration for periods with different averaging intervals has showed heterogeneity for some types of runoff. This was caused by intensive economic activity, which significantly disrupts the natural hydrological regime. A runoff forecast was made for the Lan River at the Mokrovo gauging station for the period up to 2035 based on archive of meteorological data using a multi-model ensemble of four CMIP5 scenarios. A slight decrease in runoff was predicted, caused by additional evaporation from the water surface of the reservoir due to increased air temperature, as well as a slight shift in the peak of the spring flood to March. Results of calculating of permissible withdrawal of surface water from the Lan River for the needs of the Loktyshi fish farm have shown great influence of the fish farm on the river runoff volume that requires strict adherence to scientifically based regimes for managing the water regime of the Loktyshi Reservoir and the Loktyshi fish farm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a1295164156b309284c8b63b3afff0b9c636c213a65d2cc86ee0da5212d6661","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
