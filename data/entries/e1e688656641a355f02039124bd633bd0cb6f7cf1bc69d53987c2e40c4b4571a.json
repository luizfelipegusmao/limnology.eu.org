We propose training an ensemble of small neural networks to fuse demographics and biometrics inputs. The categorical outputs of the networks are then turned into a multi-dimensional risk map, which associates diverse inputs with stratified, output health risk. Our ensemble model is optimized and validated on disjoint subsets of nationally representative data (N~100,000) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). To broaden applicability of the proposed method, we consider only non-invasive inputs that can be easily measured through modern devices. Our results show that: (a) neural networks can predict individual conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) or the union of multiple (e.g., nine) health conditions; (b) Softmax model outputs can be used to stratify individual- or any-condition risk; (c) ensembles of neural networks improve generalizability; (d) multiple-input models outperform BMI (e.g., 75.1% area under the receiver operator curve for eight-input, any-condition models compared to 64.2% for BMI); (e) small neural networks are as effective as larger ones for the inference tasks considered; the proposed models are small enough that they can be expressed as human-readable equations, and they can be adapted to clinical settings to identify high-risk, undiagnosed populations.","author":"Brandon M.
