{"title":"Impact of Buriti Oil from Mauritia flexuosa Palm Tree on the Rheological, Thermal, and Mechanical Properties of Linear Low-Density Polyethylene for Improved Sustainability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2332/v1","date":1727604395000,"content":"Recent advancements highlight the utilization of vegetable oils as additives in polymeric materials, particularly for replacing conventional plasticizers. Buriti oil (BO), extracted from the Amazon's Mauritia flexuosa palm tree fruit, boasts an impressive profile of vitamins, minerals, proteins, carotenoids, and tocopherol. This study investigates the impact of incorporating buriti oil as a plasticizer in linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) matrices. The aim of this research was to evaluate how buriti oil, a bioactive compound, influences the thermal and rheological properties of LLDPE. Compositions of buriti oil\\LLDPE were prepared via melt intercalation techniques, and the resulting materials were characterized through Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mechanical property testing, and contact angle measurement. The addition of buriti oil was found to act as a processing aid and plasticizer, enhancing the fluidity of LLDPE polymer chains. TGA revealed distinct thermal stabilities for buriti oil/LLDPE under different degradation conditions Notably, buriti oil exhibited an initial weight loss temperature at 402°C, whereas LLDPE at 466.4°C. This indicated a minor reduction in the thermal stability of buriti oil/LLDPE compositions. The thermal stability, as observed through DSC displayed a nuanced response to the oil's incorporation, suggesting a complex interaction between the oil and polymer matrix. Detailed mechanical testing indicated a marked increase in tensile strength and elongation at break, especially at optimal concentrations of buriti oil. SEM analysis showcased a more uniform and less brittle microstructure, correlating with the enhanced mechanical properties. Contact angle measurements revealed a notable shift in surface hydrophobicity, indicating a change in the surface chemistry. This study demonstrates that buriti oil can positively influence the processability and thermal properties of LLDPE contributing to expand its potential applications as an effective plasticizer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8459e6f0e4af690f4fe88f677d77b4c212cf247e7b73369f241a2561dfe23c59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
