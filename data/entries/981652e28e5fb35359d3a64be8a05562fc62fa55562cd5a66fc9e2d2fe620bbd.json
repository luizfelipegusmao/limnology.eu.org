{"title":"Fractional Operators and Fractionally Integrated Random Fields on Z","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1180/v1","date":1716280488000,"content":"We consider fractional integral operators $(I-T)^d, d \\in (-1,1)$ acting on functions $g: \\mathbb{Z}^{\\nu} \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\nu \\ge 1 $, where $T $  is the transition operator of a random walk on \n$\\mathbb{Z}^{\\nu}$. We obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence, invertibility and square summability of kernels $\\tau (\\mathbf{s}; d), \\mathmb{s} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{\\nu}$   of $(I-T)^d $. Asymptotic behavior of $\\tau (\\mathbf{s}; d)$ as $|\\mathbf{s}| \\to \\infty$ is identified following local limit theorem for random walk.\nA class of fractionally integrated random fields $X$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^{\\nu}$ solving the difference equation $(I-T)^d X = \\varepsilon$ with white noise on the right-hand side is discussed, and their scaling\nlimits. Several examples  including fractional  lattice Laplace and heat operators are studied in detail.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"981652e28e5fb35359d3a64be8a05562fc62fa55562cd5a66fc9e2d2fe620bbd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
