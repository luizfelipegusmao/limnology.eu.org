{"title":"A transposable element prevents severe hemophilia B and provides insights into the evolution of new- and old world primates","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312303","date":1729260000000,"content":"<p>by Johannes Kopp, Alice Rovai, Michael Ott, Heiner Wedemeyer, Andreas Tiede, Hans Jürgen Böhmer, Tomas Marques, Jörg Langemeier, Jens Bohne, Simon Alexander Krooss</p>\r\n\r\nAlu-elements comprise a large part of the human genome and some insertions have been shown to cause diseases. Here, we illuminate the protective role of an Alu-element in the 3’UTR of the human Factor 9 gene and its ability to ameliorate a poly(A) site mutation in a hemophilia B patient, preventing him from developing a severe disease. Using a minigene, we examined the disease-causing mutation and the modifying effect of the transposon <i>in cellulo</i>. Further, we simulated evolutionary scenarios regarding alternative polyadenylation before and after Alu insertion. A sequence analysis revealed that Old World monkeys displayed a highly conserved polyadenylation sites in this Alu-element, whereas New World monkeys lacked this motif, indicating a selective pressure. We conclude that this transposon has inserted shortly before the separation of Old and New World monkeys and thus also serves as a molecular landmark in primate evolution.","author":"Johannes Kopp","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e63944064e2f799a32d4a4e9fc74fae2afe557c0043605fd32ed27683464d9ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
