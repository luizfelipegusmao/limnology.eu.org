{"title":"Characterization and application of Bacillus velezensis D6 co‐producing α‐amylase and protease","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13786?af=R","date":1722511692000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Research on the co-production of multiple enzymes by <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> as a novel species is still a topic that needs to be studied. This study aimed to investigate the fermentation characteristics of <i>B. velezensis</i> D6 co-producing α-amylase and protease and to explore their enzymatic properties and applications in fermentation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The maximum co-production of α-amylase and protease reached 13.13 ± 0.72 and 2106.63 ± 64.42 U mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, under the optimal fermented conditions (nutrients: 20.0 g L<sup>−1</sup> urea, 20.0 g L<sup>−1</sup> glucose, 0.7 g L<sup>−1</sup> MnCl<sub>2</sub>; incubation conditions: initial pH 7.0, temperature 41 °C, 8% inoculation size and 30% working volume). Moreover, the genetic co-expression of α-amylase and protease increased from 0 to 24 h and then decreased after 36 h at the transcriptional level, which coincided with the growth trend of <i>B. velezensis</i> D6. The optimal reaction temperature of α-amylase was 55–60 °C, while that of protease was 35–40 °C. The activities of α-amylase and protease were retained by over 80% after thermal treatment (90 °C, 1 h), which indicated that two enzymes co-produced by <i>B. velezensis</i> D6 demonstrated excellent thermal stability. Moreover, the two enzymes were stable over a wide pH range (pH 4.0–8.0 for α-amylase; pH 4.0–9.0 for protease). Finally, the degrees of hydrolysis of corn, rice, sorghum and soybeans by α-amylase from <i>B. velezensis</i> D6 reached 44.95 ± 2.95%, 57.16 ± 2.75%, 52.53 ± 4.01% and 20.53 ± 2.42%, respectively, suggesting an excellent hydrolysis effect on starchy raw materials. The hydrolysis degrees of mackerel heads and soybeans by protease were 43.93 ± 2.19% and 26.38 ± 1.72%, respectively, which suggested that the protease from <i>B. velezensis</i> D6 preferentially hydrolyzed animal-based protein.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This is a systematic study on the co-production of α-amylase and protease by <i>B. velezensis</i> D6, which is crucial in widening the understanding of this species co-producing multi-enzymes and in exploring its potential application. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zong‐Min Wang, \nShuang Wang, \nHua Bai, \nLan‐Lan Zhu, \nHong‐Bo Yan, \nLin Peng, \nYan‐Bo Wang, \nHe Li, \nYue‐Dong Song, \nJi‐Zhou Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"79803bd34a57f352253c7538351f693ce3512415c403b8ccd0a58fb7389c95bd","category":"Environment"}
