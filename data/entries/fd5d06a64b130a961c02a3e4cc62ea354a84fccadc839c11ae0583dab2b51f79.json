{"title":"Unveiling the Role of Angiosperm Pollen Morphology in Attachment to the Moth (Lepidoptera) Proboscides","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1134/S1062359024608322","date":1727740800000,"content":"<span>\n                      <h3>Abstract</h3>\n                      <p>The current study aims to understand the role of various morphological features of pollen grains in attachment with moth proboscides. To test the hypothesis, moth samples are collected from 11 sites in three districts of Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal, North East India. Pollen of 18 angiosperm families are isolated from the proboscides of 16 moth species in four families. We selected proboscides for the isolation of pollen because it is the most important organ of moths which interacts with flowers during moth visitation. The isolated pollen is studied for various morphological characters like pollen shape, unit, exine ornamentation, thickness, aperture numbers, and aperture types along with specialized structures i.e., viscin thread and pollenkitt, and analyzed for their attachment on the proboscides. The present study revealed the significant role of pollen shape, unit, exine characters, viscin thread, and pollenkitt in attachment with proboscides. Whereas, the aperture numbers and aperture types are found insignificant in the process of pollen attachment. Studies on the formation of viscin thread and pollenkitt may be established as an important tool to understand the specialized and generalized interactions between moths and angiosperms. The present study will open up a new horizon in pollination ecology.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"fd5d06a64b130a961c02a3e4cc62ea354a84fccadc839c11ae0583dab2b51f79","category":"Environment"}
