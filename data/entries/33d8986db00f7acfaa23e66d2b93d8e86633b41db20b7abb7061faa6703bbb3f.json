{"title":"RADseq data reveal widespread historical introgression in four familiar North American songbirds","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/5/860/7590634?rss=1","date":1706313600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Population genetic structure is influenced by a combination of contemporary and historical events; however, this structure can be complicated by ongoing gene flow. While it is well known that contemporary hybridization occurs frequently among many closely related species, it often remains uncertain as to which populations are involved in introgression events, and this can be even more difficult to infer when introgression is historical. Here we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing to look at the level of introgression among four species of songbirds in North America: the black-capped, mountain, boreal, and chestnut-backed chickadee. Samples from both sympatric and allopatric sites across the speciesâ€™ ranges supported limited ongoing mixing among the four species with Bayesian clustering and principal component analyses. In contrast, f4-statistics and admixture graphs revealed extensive historical introgression among geographically structured populations. Almost all historical admixture events were among populations west of the Rocky Mountains, and almost all populations west of the Rocky Mountains, excluding island and coastal populations, showed evidence of historical admixture. The inclusion of all four chickadee species proved crucial in differentiating which species were involved in hybridization events to avoid erroneous conclusions. Taken together, the results suggest a complex pattern of divergence with gene flow.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"33d8986db00f7acfaa23e66d2b93d8e86633b41db20b7abb7061faa6703bbb3f","category":"Environment"}
