{"title":"A Review on Research Progress of Corrosion Resistance of Alkali-activated Slag Cement Concrete","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2074/v1","date":1724904787000,"content":"Portland cement emits large amounts of CO2 in production. Given proposals for \"carbon peaking and carbon neutralization\" studying alternative low-carbon cementitious materials to reduce emissions is extremely important. Alkali-activated slag (AAS) cement, a new green cementitious material, has high application potential. The chemical corrosion resistance of AAS concrete is important for ensuring durability and prolonging service life. Studying the chemical corrosion mechanism of AAS concrete and understanding its influence on performance provides important theoretical foundations for application in different environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef1093a95ac7633332f6eb25053150866871f821cbff31443b42df0a3aaf0c1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
