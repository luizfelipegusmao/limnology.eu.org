{"title":"The Optimal Model of E-commerce of Fresh (Raw) Food Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1073/v1","date":1718603839000,"content":"E-commerce is the general concept of using new technologies to establish chain communication between producers, sellers, suppliers, generally providers of goods and services on the one hand and buyers, consumers or customers in general on the other hand, in order to make a decision. The best ways are to optimize goods and services, reduce costs and open new channels. This article tried to propose an e-commerce model for fresh agricultural products, which can not only maximize producer and consumer satisfaction, but also reduce waste, increase marketing efficiency, and provide environmental protection and sustainable development. The proposed model is based on a coherent and real-time monitoring system, designed by managers and clarification for producers and consumers. The components of this system are manufacturers, retailers, banks, sales and purchase brokers, logistics systems, supervisors and management of the e-commerce system. This system manages information flow, money flow and goods flow accurately and transparently. In this presented model, the duties of each member and how they work were explained, and its implementation requirements were also specified. This model paves the way for the future of sustainable food and preserving the environment with two functions, reducing waste and increasing consumer satisfaction through the supply of unprocessed and fresh products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44d18a97f8b507fb16eefc769c4e4abf92146e1bd499d34c0b847734cdeab9a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
