This realisation has led researchers to hypothesise that animal-associated microbial communities may boost the capacity of their hosts to acclimatise and adapt to environmental changes, two eco-evolutionary processes with significant applied relevance. Aiming to assess the importance of microorganisms for wild vertebrate conservation, we conducted a quantitative systematic review to evaluate the scientific evidence for the contribution of gut microorganisms to the acclimation and adaptation capacity of wild vertebrate hosts. After screening 1974 publications, we scrutinised the 109 studies that met the inclusion criteria based on 10 metrics encompassing study design, methodology and reproducibility. We found that the studies published so far were not able to resolve the contribution of gut microorganisms due to insufficient study design and research methods for addressing the hypothesis. Our findings underscore the limited application to date of microbiome knowledge in vertebrate conservation and management, highlighting the need for a paradigm shift in research approaches. Considering these results, we advocate for a shift from observational studies to experimental manipulations, where fitness or related indicators are measured, coupled with an update in molecular techniques used to analyse microbial functions. In addition, closer collaboration with conservation managers and practitioners from the inception of the project is needed to encourage meaningful application of microbiome knowledge in adaptive wildlife conservation management.</p>","author":"Garazi Martin Bideguren, \nOrly Razgour, \nAntton Alberdi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"60a873a48c19dd251d794d273471a3faf66569a9cb6058f8a6897be8e81f7236","category":"Environment"}
