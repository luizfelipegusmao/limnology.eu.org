{"title":"Characteristics of inclusions in chang 7 member and shale oil accumulation stages in Zhijing-Ansai area, Ordos Basin","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302468","date":1714658400000,"content":"<p>by Wenjie Wu, Jian Wang, Nan Wu, Yong Feng, Yilin Liang, Yulin Chen</p>\r\n\r\nIn order to further clarify the shale oil accumulation period of the Chang 7 member of the Mesozoic Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Zhijing-Ansai area of the central Ordos Basin, Using fluid inclusion petrography analysis, microscopic temperature measurement, salinity analysis and fluorescence spectrum analysis methods, combined with the burial history-thermal history recovery in the area, the oil and gas accumulation period of the Chang 7 member of the Yanchang Formation in the Zhijing-Ansai area was comprehensively analyzed. Sixteen shale oil reservoir samples of the Mesozoic Triassic Yanchang Formation in seven typical wells in the study area were selected.The results show that the fluid inclusions in the Chang 7 member of Yanchang Formation can be divided into two stages. The first stage inclusions mainly develop liquid hydrocarbon inclusions and a large number of associated brine inclusions, which are mainly beaded in fracture-filled quartz and fracture-filled calcite. The fluorescence color is blue and blue-green, and the homogenization temperature of the associated brine inclusions is between 90–110°C. The second stage inclusions are mainly gas-liquid two-phase hydrocarbon inclusions, gas inclusions and asphalt inclusions. Most of them are distributed in the fracture-filled quartz, and the temperature of the associated brine inclusions is between 120–130°C. Fluid inclusions in Chang 7 member of the Yanchang Formation can be divided into two stages. The CO<sub>2</sub> inclusions and high temperature inclusions in the Chang 7 member of the Yanchang Formation are mainly derived from deep volcanic activity in the crust.","author":"Wenjie Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8f5552fb887652f024421970ff4a4562f90b99b9ad742fd3c4750649c6a54409","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
