{"title":"Malaria Prevention for Pregnant Women and Under-Five Children in 10 Sub-Saharan Africa Countries: Socioeconomic and Temporal Inequality Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1740/v1","date":1729757103000,"content":"Malaria remains a public health challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite gains from strategies like Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and Intermittent Preventive Treatment during pregnancy (IPTp), significant socioeconomic inequalities persist, particularly among pregnant women and children under five. This study analysed temporal and socioeconomic inequalities in malaria prevention in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: Nationally representative Demographic Health Surveys from 10 SSA countries were used, comparing two time periods. Changes in ITN use by pregnant women and children under five, as well as IPTp coverage, were assessed. Inequalities based on socioeconomic status (SES) and residence were analysed using the Erreygers Normalized Concentration Index and Theil index.. Results: Results revealed significant variability in ITN use and IPTp coverage between and within countries. Eight countries showed improvements in ITN use during pregnancy, with Nigeria seeing a 173.9% increase over five years. Burkina Faso and Tanzania consistently reported high ITN use (~87%) in children under five. IPTp coverage increased in all countries except Kenya. Decomposition using the Theil index indicated that within-group inequalities, particularly based on SES and residence, were the primary drivers of disparities. Conclusion: To ensure progress toward universal health coverage, malaria prevention programs must prioritize vulnerable populations and be continuously evaluated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb1c400368cec9584089a868892ec9f684156dbe1fa74189276cae1508f9fd64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
