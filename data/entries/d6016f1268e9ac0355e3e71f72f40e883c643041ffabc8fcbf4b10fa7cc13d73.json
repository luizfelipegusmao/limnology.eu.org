{"title":"NIR-mediated Deformation from a CNT-based Bilayer Hydrogel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0974/v1","date":1710750527000,"content":"Shape-shifting polymers are widely used in various fields such as intelligent switches, soft robots and sensors, which require both multiple stimulus response functions and qualified mechanical strength. In this study, a novel near infrared light (NIR) responsible shape-shifting hydrogel system was designed and fabricated, through embedding vinylsilane modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into particle-double network (P-DN) hydrogels by micellar copolymerization. The dispersed brittle Poly(sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane-1-sulfonate) (PNaAMPS) network of the microgels can serves as sacrificial bonds to toughen the hydrogels, and the CNTs endow it NIR photothermal conversion ability. The results show that the CNTs embedded P-DN hydrogels present excellent mechanical strength, i. e. fracture strength of 312 kPa and fracture strain of 357%. Moreover, an asymmetric bilayer hydrogel, where the active layer contains CNTs, can achieve 0°–110° bending deformation within 10 min under NIR irradiation and can realise complex deformation movement. This study provides a theoretical and experimental basis for the design and manufacture of photoresponsive soft actuators.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6016f1268e9ac0355e3e71f72f40e883c643041ffabc8fcbf4b10fa7cc13d73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
