{"title":"Looking Back for the Future: The Ecology of Terrestrial Communities Through the Lens of Conservation Paleobiology","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110421-101343?TRACK=RSS","date":1698883200000,"content":"<div><p>Terrestrial ecosystems encompass a vast and vital component of Earth's biodiversity and ecosystem services. The effect of increased anthropogenic dominance on terrestrial communities defines major challenges for ecosystem conservation, including habitat destruction and fragmentation, climate change, species invasions and extinctions, and disease spread. Here, we integrate fossil, historical, and present-day organismal and ecological data to investigate how conservation paleobiology provides deep-time perspectives on terrestrial organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems impacted by anthropogenic processes. We relate research tools to conservation outputs and highlight gaps that currently limit conservation paleobiology from reaching its full impact on conservation practice and management. In doing so, we also highlight how the colonial legacies of conservation biology and paleobiology confound our understanding of present-day biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and conservation outlooks, and we make recommendations for more inclusive and ethical practices moving forward.</p></div>","author":"Melissa E.
