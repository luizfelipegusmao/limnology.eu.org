Three species of local microalgae—<i>Rhodomonas</i> sp., <i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp. and <i>Pseudanabaena</i> sp.—were isolated from waters off the coast of Ghana, West Africa, following a serial dilution technique. The growth performance of the isolates was assessed in the laboratory through daily estimation of cell density until the stationary phase was observed. Characterisation of the microalgal isolates was carried out by estimation of their biovolume, carbon content and energy content. Biovolumes of the microalgae were calculated from the estimated equivalent spherical diameters using proposed geometric shapes and formulae. Carbon weight and carbon energy content were subsequently calculated using derived conversions. The three microalgal isolates showed potential for large-scale cultivation in the laboratory with marked differences in daily increases in cell densities. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp. and <i>Rhodomonas</i> sp. recorded the highest and the lowest peak densities of 2.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cell mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, from an initial inoculating cell density of 1.05 × 10<sup>5</sup> cell mL<sup>−1</sup>. The estimated mean biovolumes of <i>Rhodomonas</i> sp., <i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp. and <i>Pseudanabaena</i> sp. were 238.9, 8.182 and 42.42 µm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, and the corresponding derived carbon energy contents were 1.7 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, 7.13 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and 1.05 × 10<sup>−7</sup> J, respectively. Results from a laboratory rearing experiment indicated that the individual microalgal isolates supported the growth and survival of oyster larvae at different scales, but a mixed diet of the three promoted superior growth and survival of <i>C. tulipa</i> larvae. The three local microalgal isolates- <i>Rhodomonas</i> sp., <i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp., and <i>Pseudanabaena</i> sp.- were well adapted to laboratory culture conditions, and the observed differences in growth and survival of the oyster larvae fed on these algal diets could be due to the differences in diet properties and biochemical compositions of the different species. A combination of the three algal diets, however, provided complementaery nutrients for the optimal growth and survival of <i>C. tulipa</i> larvae. The outcome of this study shows that local microalgal isolates have the potential to support hatchery rearing of <i>C. tulipa</i>, which is essential for the development of commercial mangrove oyster aquaculture in West Africa.</p>","author":"Eric Appiah Krampah, \nPaul Kojo Mensah, \nEmmanuel Acheampong, \nEdward Adzesiwor Obodai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture, Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be1e788988f9ff9949a6f7f759773ae166678ee7c383b954a977541fbea3ff","entryHash":"79d9468d1c52d99e4d13470e24c71a4746a1ad51b2664edb0452207495c5cdfb","category":"Environment"}
