{"title":"In Situ Heating Technique with the FIB-TEM Compatible MEMS Specimen Holder","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.821/7720130?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Characterization of nano composite materials under diverse circumstances is crucial for advancing material development. One of the most effective methods for this study is <span>in-situ</span> TEM observation. For this purpose, we have developed <span>in-situ</span> TEM observation technique of composite nanoparticles, such as catalyst particles [<a href=\"#ozae044.821-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.821-B2\">2</a>]. On the other hand, there are also needs for the <span>in-situ</span> TEM observation of the specific region in the composite bulk material. For this study, FIB milling technique is essential. Several attempts have been made to observe a FIB-milled specimen with <span>in-situ</span> heating TEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.821-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.821-B4\">4</a>]. Recently, dedicated stubs have been developed to install a FIB specimen to a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) heating chip. However, there are many challenges in existing method, including the potential risk of specimen damage due to the procedure of thinning the specimen, mounting the specimen to the MEMS chip, and mounting to the TEM specimen holder [<a href=\"#ozae044.821-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.821-B6\">6</a>]. To solve these problems, we have developed a FIB-TEM compatible specimen heating holder. It uses a MEMS heating chip specifically designed for FIB-milled specimens [<a href=\"#ozae044.821-B7\">7</a>]. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a tip of FIB-TEM compatible MEMS heating holder. It supports attaching to the FIB device at a 90Â° different angle to the TEM, enabling FIB specimen preparation, further milling and the <span>in-situ</span> heating observation of a desired area without removing specimen. Therefore, it is feasible to eliminate the risk of the specimen damage when removing or replacing the specimen.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0686d0010e94bbe85e604cf937d9d3930c20d4ab23a92b8c02b63789874edb74","category":"Environment"}
