{"title":"Young Adults&rsquo; Perceptions of the Role of Trust in the Impact of Self-Reliance on Help-Seeking for Mental Health Problems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1756/v1","date":1724425441000,"content":"Many young people are reluctant to seek support for mental health concerns and a preference for self-reliance has been identified as a key barrier. Yet, the conceptualisation and measurement of self-reliance is not well understood. This study examines the meaning of self-reliance as it affects young peopleâ€™s help-seeking, with an emphasis on the role of trust (both in self and in others). 30 Australian young people aged 18-25 years were interviewed. Reflexive thematic analysis, using both inductive and deductive approaches, was used to construct themes about the relationships between trust, self-reliance, and help-seeking for young people. Participants identified that both self-reliance and help-seeking exist on a continuum from insufficient self-reliance to extreme self-reliance and excessive help-seeking to unwillingness to seek help. Trust was a key component of self-reliance, and a balance between trust in self and trust in others is necessary for self-reliance to be adaptive and appropriate help-seeking to occur. To maintain this balance, young people felt that a level of self-awareness was necessary. A high level of trust in self is considered to increase self-reliance, whereas a high level of trust in others increases help-seeking behaviours. Understanding the role of trust in self-reliance informs developmentally appropriate ways to address self-reliance as a barrier to mental health help-seeking for young people.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4597e9fbc207e55b9e4a68746943280a8ceff91885f0c99c11cf9f728108967","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
