{"title":"Amino Acid Content of Fallow Deer (Dama dama) Muscles from Organic and Conventional Feeding Grounds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2454/v1","date":1727764796000,"content":"The study aimed to determine the protein content and amino acid profile of the longissimus lumborum and the semiomembranosus muscles of fallow deer originating from an organic feeding ground (OFG) and a conventional feeding ground (CFG). The amino acid content was determined using the ion-exchange chromatography method in accordance with AOAC. The present study provides the first published data on the nutritional value of fallow deer meat proteins. An analysis of the results revealed significant differences between the essential (EAA) and non-essential amino acid (NEAA) contents, depending on the feeding ground. A higher nutritional value was noted for the OFG fallow deer muscles, as indicated by the higher EAA and NEAA amino acid contents, a higher EAA proportion, a higher chemical score (CS) value, and the calculated expected protein efficiency ratio (PER) and biological value (BV). A significant effect of the muscle type on the histidine content and the feeding ground x muscle interaction for glycine was noted. All fallow deer muscle samples exhibited a complete profile of essential amino acids and a high-quality protein profile. The data presented in this overview show that the nutritional value of fallow deer meat represents an excellent source of proteins for humans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ab7fe8c4f7f137b25bc33bb9025bc387a1535b266b09b25ff0230063b4c5f6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
