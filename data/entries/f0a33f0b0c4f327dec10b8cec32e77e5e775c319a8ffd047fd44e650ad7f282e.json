This qualitative research explores the intricate dynamics of SRM in e-commerce, focusing on strategic alignment, technological integration, trust, collaboration, and risk management as key determinants of delivery reliability. Through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis, the study reveals that strategic alignment of supplier capabilities with firm objectives is fundamental for maintaining a responsive and synchronized supply chain. Technological integration, including AI-driven analytics and blockchain applications, emerges as critical for real-time monitoring and adaptive decision-making, thereby improving delivery accuracy and efficiency. Trust and collaboration are identified as essential pillars for building resilient supplier relationships, fostering transparent communication and joint problem-solving. Effective risk management practices, such as supplier diversification and contingency planning, mitigate disruptions and ensure consistent delivery performance. Despite these benefits, challenges such as technological adoption barriers, cultural differences, communication complexities, resource constraints, and supplier reliability issues persist, necessitating strategic interventions. Recommendations include investing in advanced SRM technologies, promoting cultural understanding, enhancing communication protocols, allocating adequate resources, and fostering collaborative initiatives with suppliers. These strategies aim to overcome challenges and optimize SRM practices, ultimately enhancing delivery performance and competitiveness in the e-commerce landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0a33f0b0c4f327dec10b8cec32e77e5e775c319a8ffd047fd44e650ad7f282e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
