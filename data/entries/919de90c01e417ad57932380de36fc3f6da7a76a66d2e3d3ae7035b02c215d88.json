{"title":"The use of Kudoh method for culture of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium africanum</i> in The Gambia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300042","date":1711548000000,"content":"<p>by Tijan Jobarteh, Jacob Otu, Ensa Gitteh, Francis S.

Tuberculosis remains a great public health problem in developing countries like The Gambia, as most of the methods currently used for bacterial isolation are either time-consuming or costly.</p> Objective <p>To evaluate the Kudoh swab method in a West African setting in Gambia, with a particular focus on the method’s performance when culturing <i>Mycobacterium africanum</i> West Africa 2 (MAF2) isolates.</p> Method <p>75 sputum samples were collected in the Greater Banjul Area and decontaminated in parallel with both the standard N-acetyl-L-Cysteine-NaOH (NALC-NaOH) and the Kudoh swab method in the TB diagnostics laboratory in the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia between 30<sup>th</sup> December 2017 and 25<sup>th</sup> February 2018. These samples were subsequently cultured on standard Löwenstein-Jensen and Modified Ogawa media respectively and incubated at 37°C for mycobacterial growth. Spoligotyping was done to determine if the decontamination and culture methods compared could equally detect <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, <i>Mycobacterium africanum</i> West Africa 1 and <i>Mycobacterium africanum</i> West Africa 2.</p> Result <p>Among the 50 smear positives, 35 (70%) were culture-positive with Kudoh and 32 (64%) were culture positive with NALC-NaOH, whilst 7(28%) of the 25 smear negative samples were culture positive with both methods (Table 2). There was no significant difference in recovery between both methods (McNemar’s test, p-value = 0.7003), suggesting that the overall positivity rate between the two methods is comparable. There were no differences in time-to-positivity or contamination rate between the methods. However, Kudoh yielded positive cultures that were negative on LJ and vice versa. All findings were irrespective of mycobacterial lineages.</p> Conclusion <p>The Kudoh method has comparable sensitivity to the NALC-NaOH method for detecting <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex isolates. It is easy to perform and could be an add on option for mycobacterial culture in the field in The Gambia, since it requires less biosafety equipment.</p>","author":"Tijan Jobarteh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"919de90c01e417ad57932380de36fc3f6da7a76a66d2e3d3ae7035b02c215d88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
