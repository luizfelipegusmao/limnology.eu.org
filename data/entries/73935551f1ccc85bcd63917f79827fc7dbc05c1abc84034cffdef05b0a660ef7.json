Data were analyzed for 277 patients (87 with COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis): 67.55 +/- 15.714 years aged; predominance of male gender (54.02%), 200.67+/118.582 minutes of surgery, Likert Scale punctuation 1.55+/-1.461; 4.63+/-3.233 hours in severe pain; minimum pain intensity of 1.11+/-1.582 and maximum of 5.68+/-2.166; interference with sleep quality 4.45 +/-2.867; 0-10); anxiety of 4.83 +/-3.175; need for help 3.83 +/-3.100; nausea 1.75 +/- 2.469; drowsiness of 3.70+/-2.694; itching of 2.80+/-2.102; dizziness of 3.78+/-2.347; perception of care of 51.75+/-28.315; pain relief of 6.65+/-2.477, participation of 7.27+/-2.892; satisfaction of 79.84 +/-17.459, and information received of 81.75 +/-17.647. Postoperative mortality one month after surgery was recorded at 25.3% in COVID-19. Significant differences were found in postoperative pain intensity (p=0.019), time with severe pain (p&amp;lt;0.01), lower sleep quality (p&amp;lt;0.01); and better outcomes in functional Ã­tems (p&amp;gt;0.01), more side effects and satisfaction with pain relief (p&amp;lt;0.01) in Covid-patients than no COVID-19 patients.
