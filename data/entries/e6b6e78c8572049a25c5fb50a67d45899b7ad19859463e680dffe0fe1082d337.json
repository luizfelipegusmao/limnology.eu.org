{"title":"Single‐cell and bulk RNA‐sequencing reveal SPP1 and CXCL12 as cell‐to‐cell communication markers to predict prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24297?af=R","date":1726225515000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) generally presents as an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The characteristics of cell-to-cell communication in the LUAD microenvironment has been unclear. In this study, the LUAD bulk RNA-seq data and single-cell RNA-seq data were retrieved from public dataset. Differential expression genes (DEGs) between LUAD tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were calculated by limma algorithm, and then detected by PPI, KEGG, and GO analysis. Cell–cell interactions were explored using the single-cell RNA-seq data. Finally, the first 15 CytoHubba genes were used to establish related pathways and these pathways were used to characterize the immune-related ligands and their receptors in LUAD. Our analyses showed that monocytes or macrophages interact with tissue stem cells and NK cells via SPP1 signaling pathway and tissue stem cells interact with T and B cells via CXCL signaling pathway in different states. Hub genes of SPP1 participated in SPP1 signaling pathway, which was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell. The expression of SPP1 in LUAD tumor tissues was negatively correlated with the prognosis. While CXCL12 participated in CXCL signaling pathway, which was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell. The role of CXCL12 in LUAD tumor tissues exhibits an opposite effect to that of SPP1. This study reveals that tumor-associated monocytes or macrophages may affect tumor progression. Moreover, the SPP1 and CXCL12 may be the critic genes of cell-to-cell communication in LUAD, and targeting these pathways may provide a new molecular mechanism for the treatment of LUAD.</p>","author":"Zengtuan Xiao, \nZhe Nian, \nMengzhe Zhang, \nZuo Liu, \nPengpeng Zhang, \nZhenfa Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"e6b6e78c8572049a25c5fb50a67d45899b7ad19859463e680dffe0fe1082d337","category":"Environment"}
