In this study, Fenton (Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and a Fenton-like (Fe<sup>2+</sup>/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2−</sup>) processes were tested for the removal of AB 113 from water. Three different Fe<sup>2+</sup> doses were adjusted by the following Dye:Fe<sup>2+</sup>:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Dye:Fe<sup>2+</sup>:S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2−</sup> molar ratios: 10:1:5; 10:5:5 and 10:10:5. It was observed that under 10:1:5 and 10:5:5 molar ratios, Fenton process resulted with better AB113 removal where 42% and 45% absorbance removal were recorded, respectively. On the other hand, Fe<sup>2+</sup>:S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2−</sup> process efficiency was 13% and 38%, under these doses. When the molar ratio 10:10:5 was used, both processes ended up with similar maximum removal which was 69%. Increasing oxidant concentration (molar doses of 10:10:10 and 10:10:50) caused no significant removal increase. The degradation curves were best fitted to first order kinetics. Under 10:1:5 molar ratio Fenton process was five times faster (observed reaction rate constant, k = 0.010 min<sup>−1</sup>) than (Fe<sup>2+</sup>/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2−</sup>) process (observed reaction rate constant, k = 0.002 min<sup>−1</sup>). When the molar ratio has increased the speed of the reactions become almost the same where under 10:10:5 molar ratio it was calculated as 0.15 and 0.13 min<sup>−1</sup> for Fe<sup>2+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>/S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2−</sup> processes, respectively.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"d6766c1b1c25a8fa1518fb46df8a3b3cfe370b74424339a08520cc15c7081905","category":"Environment"}
