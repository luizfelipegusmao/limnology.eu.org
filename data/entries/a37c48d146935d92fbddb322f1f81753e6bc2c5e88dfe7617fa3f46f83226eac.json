{"title":"Multidimensional Ptychography and 4D STEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.944/7720236?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has found extensive application in the imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy of materials, achieving atomic resolution for structural analysis across the physical, chemical, and biological sciences over the past several decades. With the recent development of high-acquisition-speed pixelated detectors and advanced computational methodologies, 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) is progressively transforming into a standardized modality in high-resolution electron microscopy. This evolution encompasses a spectrum of techniques, including orientation mapping, strain quantification, and measurements of sample thickness. 4D-STEM operates as a versatile and comprehensive approach that provides local information on materials that are challenging to extract from bulk techniques. Furthermore, it transcends the boundaries of conventional STEM imaging to include super-resolution techniques and to provide phase-based imaging, such as ptychography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a37c48d146935d92fbddb322f1f81753e6bc2c5e88dfe7617fa3f46f83226eac","category":"Environment"}
