{"title":"An Empirical Investigation of Sustainability in Finance: Exploring Determinants and Sustainability Performance in the Banking Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1711/v1","date":1716796789000,"content":"Sustainability experienced significant global momentum in recent decades. The emergence of the sustainability movement in the Financial Sector was prompted by the increasing global climate change resulting from environmental deterioration. Primarily associated with the Financial Sector, it has increasingly been recognised that Financial Institutions are significant contributors to global climate change, both via direct and indirect means. This has resulted in a heightened emphasis and demand from stakeholders for the implementation of Sustainability Principles on a worldwide scale. This study presents a methodology that utilises the various dimensions of Sustainable Finance through the concept of Triple Bottom Line to determine the factors influencing the Sustainability Performance of Financial Institutions. The suggested approach is grounded and supported by the current body of literature. The study presents a hypothesis to investigate the correlation between factors of Green Finance Practices and Sustainability Performance of Banking Sector. The suggested framework can be utilised by regulatory bodies and individual financial institution of a country to identify the elements that influence the Sustainability Performance of Banking Sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c939744fc8b4f8a8396707c6d675938f6e7be73b586d13b97b835665a2307dcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
