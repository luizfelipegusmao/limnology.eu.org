{"title":"The Relationship between Sense of Presence, Emotional Response, and Clinical Outcomes in Virtual Reality-Based Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia: A Correlational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0198/v1","date":1714978035000,"content":"Avatar therapy (AT) is a novel virtual reality-based psychotherapy that has been developed to treat auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients. Various psychotherapeutic components, such as emotions and sense of presence, could contribute to clinical outcomes. However, the interplay between sense of presence, emotions and clinical response has seldom been investigated. This study aimed to explore the relations between sense of presence, emotions, and clinical outcomes in AT. To conduct this investigation, data from previous and ongoing AT trials were used. Sense of presence and emotions were assessed using standardized questionnaires. AVH were evaluated using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales. While sense of presence was positively associated with positive emotions such as control and serenity, no significant associations were found for negative emotions. Moreover, a higher level of sense of presence was associated with a bigger decrease in AVH. Overall, positive emotions seem to be associated with sense of presence in AT. Sense of presence also seems to be involved in the therapeutic outcome, thereby suggesting that this could be an important component related to clinical response. More studies are needed to confirm these trends, which could be generalized to other virtual reality-based psychotherapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70c8bb05c86d9850380ffbe3c1f86e61cd0686837383996f5f6691d22301b595","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
