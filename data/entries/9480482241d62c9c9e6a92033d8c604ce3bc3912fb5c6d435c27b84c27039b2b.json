A Semtex charge has also been developed to repair rock massifs, which reliably disconnects borehole exchanger pipes without severely harming the surrounding rock environment or buildings. The resulting hole can then be used for regrouting, thus preventing undesirable vertical water flow through the borehole.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"9480482241d62c9c9e6a92033d8c604ce3bc3912fb5c6d435c27b84c27039b2b","category":"Environment"}
