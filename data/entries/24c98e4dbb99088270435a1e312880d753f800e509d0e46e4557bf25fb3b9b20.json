Methods: This study analyzed the changes in RANKL, OPG and 25(OH)D levels, the RANKL/OPG ratio, and other bone turnover markers (BTM) from diagnosis to complete remission in children with acute lym-phoblastic leukemia (ALL). This is a prospective observational cohort study. This study was carried out in the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Mexico City. Thirty-three patients (4-17 years) with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL were included. The patients were treated with the HP09 chemotherapy protocol. Children who had previously been treated with corticosteroids were excluded. A pe-ripheral blood sample at diagnosis and remission was collected to determine the 25(OH)D and BTM concentrations. Results: Increased RANKL (p=0.001) and osteocalcin (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24c98e4dbb99088270435a1e312880d753f800e509d0e46e4557bf25fb3b9b20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
