{"title":"Phase Transition Oxide-Based Terahertz Metamaterials for Non-Contact Temperature Sensor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0719/v1","date":1728539878000,"content":"The temperature sensors play important roles in wide spreading human activities. Non-contact method has great advantages, but the detection precision encounters big challenge. In this work, a double-layer asymmetric terahertz (THz) metamaterial combined with phase transition oxide was proposed to realize non-contact temperature sensor with high sensitivity. The metamaterial exhibits band-stop filtering effects in the simulated transmission spectra. Temperature changes induce a reversible phase transition in VO2, resulting in altered conductivity. Numerical results indicate that the S21 parameter increases from -44.33 dB to -4.78 dB at a frequency of 1.22 THz as the conductivity of the VOâ‚‚ film increases from 10 to 5000 S/m, achieving a modulation depth of 89%. This work provide a great insights for the development of metamaterials based high-precision temperature measurement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9a6c3997e773f6cf8a99e1580c5e076d9447d0187cd2d0ae8cebc140d0735e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
