{"title":"Comparation of CALPUFF and CFD Modeling of Toxic Gas Dispersion in Mountainous Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1350/v1","date":1726654274000,"content":"Real-time simulation of toxic gas dispersion is critical for emergency management in high-sulphur gas fields. The CALPUFF (California Puff model) gas dispersion model, a Lagrangian Gaussian Puff model, is often used in mountainous environments due to its ability to handle complex terrain and weather conditions. Verifying the accuracy of toxic gas dispersion simulations under mountainous conditions is vital for emergency response and rescue. In this article, CALPUFF and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) gas dispersion modeling are compared, studying emissions from a hypothetical pipeline breakout accident in a mountainous area, focusing on range of Semi-Lethal Concentration (LC$_{50}$), Immediate Danger to Life and Health  Concentration(IDLH). Thirteen groups of simulation conditions are set up for the experiment, including static wind and winds from the east(E), south(S), west(W), and north(N) at speeds of 1, 2, and 3$m/s$. Comparative experiments between CALPUFF and CFD models show consistent results, confirming the feasibility of CALPUFF for near-field moutainous applications. The overall dispersion range deviation between two methods under calm or light wind of N, E and W is about 300$m$. However,the simulation results of the CALPUFF model and the CFD model show significant differences in S wind. In CALPUFF simulation that the toxic gases are channeled by the valleys, while in the CFD model the toxic gases climb over the mountain top and continue to spread and extend towards the northern valley. The evaluation of CALPUFFâ€™s suitability for applications in near-field mountainous environments indicates its potential use for high-sulfur gas fields and gas dispersion simulations in emergency scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0f349e8feb41d65985acba1824f7e33238378aef0d7e6ef070007a1aa3179f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
