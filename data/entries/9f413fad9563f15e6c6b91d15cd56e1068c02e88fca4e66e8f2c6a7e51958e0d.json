{"title":"Stratigraphy and OSL chronology of the Middle–Upper Pleistocene sedimentary sequence and vegetation history during Late MIS6–MIS5e in the Neva Lowland (St. Petersburg region, Russia)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3618?af=R","date":1720420898000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The quarry of the Sverdlov (Etalon) Factory stands out as a unique site in the northwest of the East European Plain since it exposes an almost complete Upper Pleistocene stratigraphic succession. Previous investigations have revealed a sequence of marine sediments deposited during the whole Mikulino Interglacial [Eemian, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS)5e], but the chronology of the Late Pleistocene deposits remains incomplete and requires further update. We present a study of the Middle–Upper Pleistocene units exposed in the Sverdlov Factory quarry by using geological methods, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and pollen analysis. The lower part of the Sverdlov Factory section comprises glaciomarine/glaciolacustrine varves, which accumulated during degradation of the Late Moscow (Late Saalian, Late MIS6) glaciation and correspond to pollen zone M<sub>1</sub> (lower peak of <i>Picea</i>). They are covered by interglacial marine clayey silt that includes all Mikulino regional pollen zones M<sub>2</sub>–M<sub>8</sub>. According to a Bayesian model based on K-rich feldspar luminescence ages, the interglacial marine deposition started 133 ± 8 ka ago and ended 109 ± 7 ka ago. The marine sediments are overlain by lacustrine silt with a K-rich feldspar age of 119 ± 7 ka, lacustrine/alluvial sand with plant detritus formed 47–41 ka ago, and lacustrine sand and silt without organic matter accumulated ~39 ka ago. The upper part of the section is composed of subglacial till formed during the Late Valdai (Late Weichselian, MIS2) under the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and glaciolacustrine varved deposits of the Baltic Ice Lake. Two ages were acquired using quartz OSL from these varves, 16.9 ± 1.6 and 15.7 ± 1.0 ka, which are assumed to slightly overestimate the true age.</p>","author":"Maksim V. Ruchkin, \nEkaterina S.
