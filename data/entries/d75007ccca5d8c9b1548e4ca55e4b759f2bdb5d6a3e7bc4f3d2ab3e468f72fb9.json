{"title":"Facial Temple-subunit reconstruction using Lateral Arm Free flap after Malignant Skin Cancer Ablation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0388/v1","date":1715082121000,"content":"(1) Background: The lateral arm flap has been the very useful choice in the reconstruction of small- to medium-sized defects like hand, extremity, oral head and neck area reconstructions. Its versatile characteristics and surgical feasibility allow this flap to be widely applied, but the reconstructive potential in facial subunit after tumor ablative procedures has never been reported. In this study, we aimed to utilize the advantages of the flap to treat facial temple subunit defect reconstruction. (2) Methods: Between 2020 and 2023, 12 patients underwent temple reconstruction with lateral arm free flaps after malignant tumor wide excision. There were 7 women and 5 men, and the mean patient age was 60.6 years old. Among the patients with cancer, 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 5 had basal cell carcinoma and 1 had myxofibrosarcoma. All the flaps were elevated under general anesthesia. Aloprostadil(PGE1, Eglandin®) were administered postoperatively. (3) Results: All the flap types were fasciocutaneous type with varied sizes from 3 × 4 to 5 × 7 cm (Average size of flap 22.7cm2) were utilized. The average pedicle length was 6.1cm. The versatility of the lateral arm flap enabled successful coverage of all cases with no specific complications. Good functional outcome and range of motion in the recipient arm were obtained after surgery. (4) Conclusion: The authors successfully verified the advantages of lateral arm flaps in the treatment of medium sized facial subunt temple defect reconstruction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d75007ccca5d8c9b1548e4ca55e4b759f2bdb5d6a3e7bc4f3d2ab3e468f72fb9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
