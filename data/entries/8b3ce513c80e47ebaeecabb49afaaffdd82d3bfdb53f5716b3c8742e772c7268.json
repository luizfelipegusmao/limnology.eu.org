{"title":"Aflatoxin Contamination Association with Seed Coat Biochemical Markers in Peanut under Intermittent Drought","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0411/v2","date":1723181381000,"content":": Aflatoxin contamination (AC) increases as the severity of drought stress increase in peanut. Identifying drought-tolerant (DT) genotypes with resistance to Aspergillus. flavus in semi-arid tropics may aid in development of peanuts that minimizing aflatoxin contamination. The goal is to identify the DT genotypes and resistant to aflatoxin contamination. The experiments curried out at ICRISAT Sahelian Center on fifty-five genotypes assessed in adjacent intermittent water-stressed (WS) from 60th day after sowing to maturity and well-watered (WW) conditions in a randomized complete block design. The yields and components, incidence of A. flavus colonisation, aflatoxin contamination and the seed coat total pthe olyphenol (SCTPP) were estimated. Water deficit reduced pod yield, seed yield, and haulm yield up to 19.49%, 27.24% and 22.07% respectively and increased the immature pods plant-1, (IMPN) and aflatoxin contamination up to 67.16% and 54.95%. The genotypes ICG 2106, ICG 311, ICG 4684, ICG 4543, and ICG 1415 maintained high yield under WS, less of IMPN and the lowest AC variation between WW and WS. The drought tolerant genotypes showed the relationship with aflatoxin resistance and SCTPP (r2=0.80; r2=0.82) under WW and WS. These findings can be used to select the genotype that combine drought tolerance and minimizing aflatoxin contamination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b3ce513c80e47ebaeecabb49afaaffdd82d3bfdb53f5716b3c8742e772c7268","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
