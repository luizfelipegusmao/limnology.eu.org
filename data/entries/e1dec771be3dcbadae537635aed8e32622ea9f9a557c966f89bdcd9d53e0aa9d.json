{"title":"Ponto-Caspian amphipod co-location with zebra mussel beds (Dreissena polymorpha) is influenced by substrate size and population source","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05515-4","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The global spread of non-native species is leading to an increasing frequency of multiple co-occurring non-native species. We examined the co-occurrence of the bivalve mollusc <em>Dreissena polymorpha</em> (zebra mussel) with three Ponto-Caspian amphipods (<em>Dikerogammarus villosus</em>, <em>Dikerogammarus haemobaphes</em>, and <em>Chelicorophium curvispinum</em>) across England and Wales in association with in-situ substrate size. For all three amphipod species, substrate grain size where amphipods co-occurred with <em>D. polymorpha</em> was significantly finer than when recorded in isolation. Subsequently, we confirmed this via aquarium experiments. We examined the occurrence of <em>D. villosus</em> with <em>D. polymorpha</em> when present with cobbles, gravel, or sand from three population sources (co-location with abundant <em>D. polymorpha</em> populations, co-location with low populations, and naïve). Experiments demonstrated that <em>D. villosus</em> actively sought shelter on or near <em>D. polymorpha,</em> with their co-location being significantly more prevalent in finer grained substrates (sand &gt; gravel &gt; cobble). The strength of this co-location differed by population source, with those co-located with high <em>D. polymorpha</em> densities demonstrating a greater association. Our analyses and experiments indicate that <em>D. polymorpha</em> may facilitate Ponto-Caspian amphipod establishment in otherwise suboptimal locations, whereby mussel shells provide favourable structural habitat for the amphipods, analogous to the presence of coarse-grained benthic sediment.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e1dec771be3dcbadae537635aed8e32622ea9f9a557c966f89bdcd9d53e0aa9d","category":"Environment"}
