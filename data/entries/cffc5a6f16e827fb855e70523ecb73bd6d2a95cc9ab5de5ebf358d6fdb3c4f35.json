{"title":"Successful Diagnosis and Treatment of Borrelia miyamotoi in a Patient with Joint and Muscle Pains, ME/CFS, and Cognitive Dysfunction following Tick Bites: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1562/v1","date":1724301675000,"content":"Introduction: Diagnosing and managing Borrelia miyamotoi disease (BMD) is challenging due to its symptom overlap with Lyme disease (LD) and the lack of reliable laboratory diagnostics for BMD. This case study demonstrates the use of phage-based PCR (phb-PCR) to identify B. miyamotoi in a patient who had been bitten by ticks.  Case presentation: A female patient aged 46 presented with joint and muscle pain, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and cognitive impairment after multiple tick bites in Europe. The patient was assessed for LD at the National Reference Centre in Strasbourg using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot. Additional diagnostics involved screening for Bartonella and Anaplasma antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence, and tests for antinuclear antibodies to check for autoimmune conditions. All serological and immunological tests yielded negative results. However, the phb-PCR identified B. miyamotoi.  Consequently, the patient received treatment for BMD with a regimen of intravenous ceftriaxone, oral azithromycin, and additional intravenous vitamin and mineral therapy. Post-treatment evaluations showed significant improvements in pain levels, cognitive abilities, and fatigue. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of direct diagnostic methods like phb-PCR for identifying BMD when serological tests fail. Clinicians should consider B. miyamotoi testing for accurate and timely management of complex TBDs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cffc5a6f16e827fb855e70523ecb73bd6d2a95cc9ab5de5ebf358d6fdb3c4f35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
