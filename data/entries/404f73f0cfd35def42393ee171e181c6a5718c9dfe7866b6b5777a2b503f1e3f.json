{"title":"A Holistic Approach Tackling E-waste Management Using Ontology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0918/v1","date":1723547836000,"content":"Electronic waste generation has been following a continuously rising trend. With electronics containing a myriad of materials some of which are hazardous, toxic, extremely rare or precious combined with more stringent legislative laws which encourage the reuse and optimised recycling of the materials included in e-waste, the need for a holistic approach is inevitable. Such an approach should not only identify the materials found in the various types of e-waste and their respective quantities but also needs to highlight the possible handling techniques and their respective impacts and associated hazards whether to the environment or human health. Performing such a task manually would be exasperating and costly while requiring extensive resources which might not be met with a justifiable economic gain; thus, the use of the advancement in computational sustainability to draw a complete picture and aid in an informed decision-making process is crucial. The e-waste ontology developed in this paper is one way of addressing the problem since it covers the treatment domain, the hazard and the materials contained within the different types of e-waste. The ontology developed can be used directly from the protégé software or by embedding it into a developed Decision Support System.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"404f73f0cfd35def42393ee171e181c6a5718c9dfe7866b6b5777a2b503f1e3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
