Generalizations and Applications to a PMSM Drive Control System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0516/v1","date":1728315661000,"content":"This paper presents a new means to control the processes, which involve the electric energy conversion. Electric machines fed by electronic converters provide the useful power defined by the inner product of two generalized energetic variables: the effort and the speed. The novelty of the paper idea is to control the desired energetics variables by a direct Data Driven Control (DDC) law in terms of the pair effort, speed and corresponding voltage controls of the electronic converter. It must be mentioned that the same desired useful power might be obtained with different controls at different efficiencies. The regularization problem was solved by selecting from a knowledge database, the maximum efficiency operation points. Knowing a reasonable number of optimal efficiency operation points, an interpolative Radial Base Function (RBF) control was built up. The RBF algorithm can find by interpolation the optimal controls for any admissible operation points of the process. The control scheme developed for this purpose has an inner DDC loop, that perform the converter control based on measured speed and demanded torque by the outer loop which handles the speed. A comparison of the DDC with the Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemas highlights the advantages of the new proposed control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e44cc6771d7cccda4f1d78552e0eede1bf59718a7c8c51feadae761d31d1790","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
