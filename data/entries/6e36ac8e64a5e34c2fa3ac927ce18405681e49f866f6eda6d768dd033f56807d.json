This opens the opportunity for large area fabrication of Josephson junctions (JJ) with potentially lower defects densities in comparison to amorphous and polycrystalline materials. Understanding the defects or inhomogeneous phases present is key to eliminating undesired energy levels and improving quantum coherence in superconducting qubits beyond what is possible today.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6e36ac8e64a5e34c2fa3ac927ce18405681e49f866f6eda6d768dd033f56807d","category":"Environment"}
