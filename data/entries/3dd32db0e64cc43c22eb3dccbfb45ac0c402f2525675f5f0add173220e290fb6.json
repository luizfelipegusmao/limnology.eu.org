{"title":"The Adsorption and Conductivity of Silicon in Elastic Polymers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1567/v1","date":1721375255000,"content":"Silicon (Si) is the major material of semiconductor element. For semiconductor element producing, Si need to refined into high-purity silicon crystals, which has the approximate characteristics of intrinsic semiconductor, then doping 13th group or 15th group trace element. Producing the high-purity silicon crystals with well-lattice structure need a lot of energy and highly cost. Besides, the high-purity silicon is very hard and fragile which limits the scope of application. For this reason, this study added low-grade non-complete lattice silicon in the elastic polymer, and then doped with high concentrations of fine carbon powder. This material can be conductive by physisorption;therefore, it can be used to making semiconductors.\nUsing this material to produce electronic components can significantly reduce the cost of purification and crystallization, saving energy at the same time. Moreover, because this elastic polymer materials containing silicon, which has soft, warm, and durable physical properties. With those properties, the design of the device could be more flex, full scalability and close to the skin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dd32db0e64cc43c22eb3dccbfb45ac0c402f2525675f5f0add173220e290fb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
