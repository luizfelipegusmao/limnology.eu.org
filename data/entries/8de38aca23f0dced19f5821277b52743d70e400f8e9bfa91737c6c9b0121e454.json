{"title":"Cross-sectional evaluation of the multidimensional indicators of psychosocial functioning and its sociodemographic correlates among Indian adults: WHO SAGE Study (2007–2010)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003102","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Apurva Barve, Courney S.

Data (N = 11,230) for this study came from the World Health Organization’s SAGE (Longitudinal Study of Global Aging and Adult Health) Wave 1 2007–2010. First, multivariable regression analyses (logistic or linear regression depending on the outcome variable) were run to evaluate whether PF indicators varied by gender after controlling other sociodemographic characteristics. Next, the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and PF indicators was examined using ordinary least square regression (OLS) models and logistic regression models, separately for men and women. Specifically, the PF indicators, including social indicators of interpersonal relationship difficulty, social connectedness, and personal indicators of sleep, affect, perceived quality of life, and cognition were each regressed on sociodemographic factors. All analyses in the study were cross-sectional in nature and conducted using STATA version 15.1. Overall, the study found significant sociodemographic differences in PF among Indian adults that also varied by gender. As such, social and/or economic disadvantage was associated with poorer PF. However, the results demonstrated that socioeconomic patterns in PF were much more nuanced among women than among men. This study adds to previous research on PF in India and provides new insights into how sociodemographic characteristics shape it. A major research implication of this finding is that inconsistent with assumptions of previous research, an increase in SES is not always linked to proportionate increases in PF among women. The study also makes a compelling case for separately examining multiple non-clinical outcomes of psychosocial health.","author":"Apurva Barve","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"8de38aca23f0dced19f5821277b52743d70e400f8e9bfa91737c6c9b0121e454","category":"Environment"}
