{"title":"Tolerance of juvenile lumpfish (Cyclopterus Lumpus) to high rearing densities","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13089?af=R","date":1722318261000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>) are raised as cleaner fish for controlling sea lice. Intensive rearing is complicated by fin nipping that occurs between juvenile conspecifics. Lumpfish density-dependent interactions are not well understood; therefore, the effects of rearing density for different fish size classes warranted evaluation. Two size classes (2- and 13-g) of juvenile lumpfish were stocked at four different rearing densities (40, 60, 70, and 90 g/L) with growth, survival, and fish aggression assessed over 8 weeks. Mean weight gain and specific growth rates ranged from 170% to 307% and 1.77% to 2.50%, respectively, depending on density treatments, for the 2-g fish, and from 286% to 471% and 2.42% to 3.10% for the 13-g fish. Growth was negatively correlated with density, with faster growth linked to lower densities. No mortality occurred in any treatment and significant fish aggression only occurred among the larger lumpfish in the higher rearing densities. Based on these findings, growth of 2-g lumpfish can be increased if reared at 40 g/L or slowed at 70 g/L without impacting aggression. For grow out of 13-g fish to ~70 g with minimal aggression, a 40 g/L rearing density is recommended for faster growth and 60 g/L for slower growth.</p>","author":"Nathaniel N. Spada, \nElizabeth A.
