{"title":"Hematological and biochemical parameters of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in captive and semi-natural environments","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coad083/7608674?rss=1","date":1707955200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Physiological indexes like blood parameters have been widely used to monitor the health of free-roaming animals. Attempts to reintroduce one of China’s most endangered species, the giant panda (<span>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</span>), have been hampered by a lack of data on its ecology and physiology. We examined three giant pandas’ hematological and blood chemistry parameters in a soft release program and 30 captive giant pandas as controls and determined the reference intervals (RIs) for those blood parameters in the captive animals. Elevation, captivity status and the interaction of those factors were statistically significant for hematologic measures. Release pandas had significantly higher hemoglobin and hematocrit values after they moved to high elevation locations. We also found significant difference in the enzyme parameters between high and low elevation pandas such as higher aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, amylase and lower lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Release pandas also had higher nutrition parameter values such as higher albumin, globulin and creatinine. The RI for blood parameters in our study provides a baseline to monitor the health of captive animals and forms the basis for assessing the health of free-roaming giant pandas in future reintroduction efforts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"81dd78331c470bc7414fab15a09ddc8e0c897435fcf2f15e538c3a8f41af4848","category":"Environment"}
