{"title":"From the Gut to the Brain: Is Microbiome a New Paradigm in Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Treatment?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1341/v1","date":1713533334000,"content":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized as the second most prevalent primary chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Clinically, PD is characterized as a movement disorder, exhibiting an incidence and mortality rate that is increasing faster than any other neurological condition. In recent years, there has been a growing interest concerning the role of the gut microbiome in the etiology and pathophysiology of PD. The establishment of a brain-gut microbiome axis is now real, with evidence denoting a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota through metabolic, immune, neuronal, and endocrine mechanisms and pathways. Among these, the vagus nerve represents the most direct form of communication between the brain and the gut. Given the potential interactions between bacteria and drugs, it has been observed that the therapies for PD can have an impact on the composition of the microbiome. Therefore, in the scope of the present review, we will discuss the current understanding of gut microbiome on PD and whether this may be a new paradigm for treating this devastating disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84a83fb92a659255e50d2feb2ab15f4b6530345aec93e46ec426a57d3c2c54df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
