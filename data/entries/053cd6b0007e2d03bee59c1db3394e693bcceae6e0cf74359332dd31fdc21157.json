{"title":"Tracing the Paths of Resilience: Longitudinal Studies on Overcoming Early-Life Adversity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1759/v1","date":1714287582000,"content":"Early-life adversity can profoundly impact individual development, yet some demonstrate resilience. Longitudinal studies tracking individuals over extended periods have aided our understanding of resilience and growth following adverse childhood experiences. This paper reviews insights from influential studies like the Kauai Longitudinal Study, the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study, and the Dunedin Study. It explores key findings on risk and protective factors, adaptation trajectories, and long-term outcomes associated with resilience. Theoretical frameworks and methodological considerations are discussed. The paper examines how this research informs interventions, policies, and support systems for fostering resilience. It highlights the need for diverse samples, integrating biological and environmental factors, and investigating intergenerational impacts. By synthesizing longitudinal research, this paper elucidates complex pathways to resilience and positive development despite early adversity, offering insights for research and supporting vulnerable populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"053cd6b0007e2d03bee59c1db3394e693bcceae6e0cf74359332dd31fdc21157","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
