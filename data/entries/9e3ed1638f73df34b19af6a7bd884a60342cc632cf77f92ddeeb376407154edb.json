{"title":"How Do Flemish Laying Hen Farmers and Private Bird Keepers Comply with and Think about Measures to Control Avian Influenza?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1617/v1","date":1721401163000,"content":"Competent authorities of many countries, including Belgium, impose control measures (preventing wild bird access to feeders and water facilities, indoor confinement of captive birds, or fencing off outdoor ranges with nets) to professional and non-professional keepers of birds to prevent the spread of avian influenza (AI). Flemish laying hen farmers (FAR, n = 33) and private keepers of captive birds (PRI, n = 263) were surveyed about their opinion on, and compliance with, AI-measures legally imposed during the most recent high-risk period before this survey in 2021. Participants answered questions on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = the worst, 3 = neutral, and 5 = the best). FAR indicated better compliance with the AI-measures compared to PRI, except for confinement with nets. PRI and FAR perceived the level of compliance with AI-measures by other private bird keepers to be lower compared to themselves. FAR regarded the AI-measures as more effective than PRI. To prevent the spread of AI more effectively, national authorities could focus on information campaigns explaining to private bird keepers, in particular, the need for the various control measures that they impose, implement alternative control measures that have broader support or implement stricter enforcement of the control measures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e3ed1638f73df34b19af6a7bd884a60342cc632cf77f92ddeeb376407154edb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
