{"title":"Machine Learning Applications for Fault Tracing and Localization in Optical Fiber Communication Networks: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1285/v1","date":1716203183000,"content":"The review aims to assess fifteen (15) academic literature sources, highlighting the application of machine learning algorithms in the maintenance operations of optical fiber networks. It exhibits the collection of data using PRISMA methodology—Preferred Reporting Item for Systems Review and Meta-Analyses. The application, results, and performance metrics are discussed based on the collected observations, computations, and statistics in the studies, which revealed records of high accuracy degrees ranging from 86% to 98% on average and quality ML models including Neural Networks (NNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and LSTM, as well as deep learning models that disclosed effective results of determining challenges and problems within the optical fiber lines. The review mainly centralized on superior machine learning technologies that surpass traditional techniques in fault detection and localization for improved optical fiber networks’ operations while providing insights into the limitations and challenges encountered in real-world applications of these models, offering a comprehensive perspective on the optical fiber network’s domain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44ffc2060a5d7a60030d17cd9e370554ae3ff7c054ddc178428bc58249ce8a2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
