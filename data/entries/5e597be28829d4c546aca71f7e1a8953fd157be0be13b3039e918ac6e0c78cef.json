{"title":"Vehicle Stock Numbers and Survival Functions for On-road Exhaust Emissions Analysis in India: 1993-2018","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1393/v1","date":1716331689000,"content":"In air quality management, at urban and regional levels, road transport remains the cornerstone of residential, commercial, and industrial activities, and the vehicle exhaust emissions maintain the position of one of the key contributing sources. In Indian cities, big and small, vehicle exhaust emissions and dust from vehicle movement on the roads, contribute to as much as 50% of particulate matter pollution in a year. So, having access to a vehicle exhaust emissions inventory that is reliable and replicable is critical for air quality management and this exercise starts with access to vehicle stock numbers. These numbers are typically obtained from vehicle registration databases, traffic surveys, and other governmental records, and often require time consuming data cleaning protocols before they can used for emissions and pollution baseline analysis. This paper provides a cleaned and open-access vehicle stock database, as registered and in-use fleet, for the period covering 1993 and 2018, for all India and states, along with an estimate of age-mix of the vehicles using survival functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e597be28829d4c546aca71f7e1a8953fd157be0be13b3039e918ac6e0c78cef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
