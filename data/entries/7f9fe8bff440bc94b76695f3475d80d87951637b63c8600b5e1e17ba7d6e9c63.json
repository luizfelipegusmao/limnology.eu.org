{"title":"Reconstruction of Cenozoic δ11Bsw Using a Gaussian Process","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023PA004769?af=R","date":1717572861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The boron isotope ratio of seawater (<i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub>) is a parameter which must be known to reconstruct palaeo pH and CO<sub>2</sub> from boron isotope measurements of marine carbonates. Beyond a few million years ago, <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub> is likely to have been different to modern. Palaeo <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub> can be estimated by simultaneously constraining the vertical gradients in foraminiferal <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B (Δ<i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B) and pH (ΔpH). A number of subtly different techniques have been used to estimate ΔpH in the past, all broadly based on assumptions about vertical gradients in oxygen, and/or carbon, or other carbonate system constraints. In this work we pull together existing data from previous studies, alongside a constraint on the rate of change of <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub> from modeling. We combine this information in an overarching statistical framework called a Gaussian Process. The Gaussian Process technique allows us to bring together data and constraints on the rate of change in <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub> to generate random plausible evolutions of <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub>. We reconstruct <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub>, and by extension palaeo pH, across the last 65Myr using this novel methodology. Reconstructed <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub> is compared to other seawater isotope ratios, namely Sr87/86 ${}^{87/86}\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{r}$, Os187/188 ${}^{187/188}\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{s}$, and <i>δ</i>\n<sup>7</sup>Li, which we also reconstruct with Gaussian Processes. Our method provides a template for incorporation of future <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub> constraints, and a mechanism for propagation of uncertainty in <i>δ</i>\n<sup>11</sup>B<sub>sw</sub> into future studies.</p>","author":"Ross Whiteford, \nTimothy J.
