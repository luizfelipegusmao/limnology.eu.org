Sixty amateur runners (30 in the knee pain group, 30 in the control group) underwent measurements of hip abduction strength, knee extension strength, and knee flexion strength. Additionally, the hamstring/quadriceps ratio and limb strength symmetry index were calculated for all participants. Statistical analyses were conducted using linear mixed models. The hip abduction and knee extensors strength of amateur runners with PFP was significantly lower than that of the control group. The hamstring/quadriceps ratio was significantly higher in the male knee pain group compared to the control group, while no significant difference was found between the female knee pain group and the control group. Furthermore, both the hip abduction strength symmetry index and knee extensors symmetry index were significantly lower in the knee pain group compared to the control group. Amateur runners with PFP exhibit distinct lower limb strength characteristics compared to non-knee pain runners. Additionally, differences in lower limb strength characteristics between male and female amateur runners with PFP were observed. These findings emphasize the importance of considering functional and gender differences in PFP rehabilitation training.","author":"Gangrui Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dea4cbdc31551d40e118526883171b73dea8e6cf82a1fea86007fc5824cfda65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
