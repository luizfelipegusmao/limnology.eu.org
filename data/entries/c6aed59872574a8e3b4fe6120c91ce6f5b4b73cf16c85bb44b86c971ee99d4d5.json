{"title":"Extracts from Artemisia annua Linne&rsquo; Regulate the Translocation of p53 to Mitochondria and Induce Apoptotic Effects on LS174T Colon Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0404/v1","date":1715088903000,"content":"Plant-derived compounds have been historically used for the treatment of various diseases and an important source of several clinically useful anti-cancer agents. The Artemisia annua is known as a medicinal herb that is effective against cancer. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether ethanol extracts of Artemisia annua could increase an anti-cancer effect against LS174T cells. Our results show that Artemisia annua extracts (AAE) induces apoptosis through the regulation of mitochondria outer membrane potential. We demonstrate that apoptosis is induced by p53-dependent manner when cells were treated with Nutlin-3 (MDM2 inhibitor) and LY294002 (Akt inhibitor). In addition, the apoptotic effect was also observed in the p53-independent manner through pifithrin-α (p53 inhibitor) and celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) treatment. As in in vitro, AAE induced apoptotic effects and regulated apoptosis-related proteins in LS174T xenograft model. Taken together, these results suggest that Artemisia annua extracts exerts an anti-cancer effect through p53-independent manner, as well as p53-dependent manner by p53´ translocation in LS174T colon cancer cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6aed59872574a8e3b4fe6120c91ce6f5b4b73cf16c85bb44b86c971ee99d4d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
