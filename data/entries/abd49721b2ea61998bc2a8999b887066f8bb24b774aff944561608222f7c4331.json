{"title":"271 Does social buffering amongst familiar weaned beef calves mitigate castration stressors?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/7/7757095?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Co-mingling of beef feeder calves from multiple sources results in biological and behavioral stressors. This study is part of a project exploring social relationships between individual beef cattle and potential benefits of social buffering during stress events. Here, the specific objective was to explore whether feeder calves form preferential relationships which buffer them from surgical castration pain. Within the experiment, two treatment groups were established: Familiar calves were defined as calves who shared a source farm with two other calves in the pen, and Unfamiliar calves were defined as calves who did not share a source with any other pen-mates. It was hypothesized that Familiar calves would exhibit more lying, fewer pain-related behaviors, and fewer agonistic interactions following surgical castration than Unfamiliar pen-mates. Weaned beef bull calves [n = 102, body weight (BW) range ± SD = 112.95 to 370.10 ± 67.8 kg] from 23 source farms were randomly assigned to home pens, each comprised of three Familiar calves and three Unfamiliar calves. Cameras placed above the pens recorded video from which postural (standing and lying), social (agonistic and bunk displacements) and pain-related behaviors (wound checking and hind leg stamping) were quantified. Cattle were handled through a hydraulic squeeze chute once weekly over four consecutive weeks for data collection and standard processing procedures. On d 14 relative to arrival, calves were surgically castrated with multimodal pain mitigation. During all processing events, calves were marked with livestock paint for behavioral observations. Behavior was observed continuously for 15 min at five different time points (0 h, 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, 48 h) relative to when the last calf returned to the home pen after processing, and researchers were blind to treatment allocation. These time periods corresponded to expected periods when pain was absent and present based on duration of local anesthesia and systemic pain relief. Calf was the experimental unit. For the purpose of this abstract, data from the 48 h periods following d 7 and 14 were analyzed using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure of SAS; the model included treatment (Familiar, Unfamiliar) by week interaction. A <span>P</span>-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significantly different. Regardless of treatment, preliminary analyses identified decreased lying (<span>P &lt;</span> 0.02) and increased wound checking (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) 48h following castration (d 14) when compared with the previous week (d 7). There were no observed differences for hindleg stamping (<span>P</span> = 0.2), agonistic behaviors (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.06) or bunk displacement (<span>P</span> = 0.09). Based on preliminary analyses, we did not observe evidence of social buffering effects on castration stress during the immediate post-surgical period.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"abd49721b2ea61998bc2a8999b887066f8bb24b774aff944561608222f7c4331","category":"Environment"}
