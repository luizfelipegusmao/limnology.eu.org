To prevent these, it is essential to know the teamwork-related stressors and resources in firefighting operations. A measurement tool is needed to evaluate these stressors and resources. A successive instrument development process was conducted to identify the relevant teamwork-related stressors and resources in firefighting operations. First, interviews with experienced firefighters, and second, a document analysis were conducted and evaluated to provide an overview of the teamwork-related stressors and resources. Thereupon, a questionnaire, the REST-Q Fire, was developed asking about the experienced frequency and intensity of the identified teamwork-related stressors and resources in firefighting operations. Afterwards, an online study with firefighters was conducted (<i>N</i> = 491). CFAs confirmed the assumed structure of the REST-Q Fire and a positive correlation of the intensity of stressors with stress was shown (<i>r</i> = .19 - .27). Further, the resources were overall more frequently and intensively perceived than the stressors. The most important stressors were ‘behavior of leaders’ (<i>M (SD)</i><sub>frequency</sub> = 2.80 (0.83), <i>M (SD)</i><sub>intensity</sub> = 3.59 (1.12)), and ‘behavior of team members’ (<i>M (SD)</i><sub>frequency</sub> = 2.77 (0.75), <i>M (SD)</i><sub>intensity</sub> = 3.59 (1.05)). The most important resources, on the other hand, were ‘knowledge about skills and behavior of team members’ (<i>M (SD)</i><sub>frequency</sub> = 3.96 (0.63), <i>M (SD)</i><sub>intensity</sub> = 4.24 (0.78)), ‘watch out for/ check on each other’ (<i>M (SD)</i><sub>frequency</sub> = 3.96 (0.70), <i>M (SD)</i><sub>intensity</sub> = 4.20 (0.80)), and ‘reliability of team members’ (<i>M (SD)</i><sub>frequency</sub> = 3.96 (0.51), <i>M (SD)</i><sub>intensity</sub> = 4.16 (0.73)). As a result, training needs for trainees in the fire service and experienced firefighters were derived.","author":"Lena Heinemann","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3a9a16b54260d42bef50d4d3689e2271eb3d4653485910b945f0437c19dcfbab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
