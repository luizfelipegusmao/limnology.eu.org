While various studies advocate restricting anthropogenic food as a suitable management approach, a significant knowledge gap persists regarding how these species interact and respond to such an intervention. Here, we evaluate whether limiting a shared food resource may affect their abundances similarly and assess whether such limitations influence their niche dynamics.\n\nIn Singapore, open food centres for people, colloquially known as hawker centres, serve as key food sources for three highly adapted urban birds: feral pigeons, Javan mynas and house crows. We counted these three species across 63 hawker centres and analysed their niche dynamics across different phases—before, during COVID-19 social restrictions when dining-in was prohibited, and during an enforcement phase mandating the return of crockery. We modelled their counts, diet niche widths and niche overlaps, considering predictors which include the sampling phases, food availability, structural characteristics of hawker centres and spatial attributes such as distance to public housing.\n\nDuring social restrictions, feral pigeon and Javan myna counts showed a significant decline, while the count proportions of the three species compared to each other remained relatively stable. Hawker centres closer to bridges and public housing, and those that structurally more open, attracted more birds.\n\nThe niche widths of feral pigeons and Javan mynas significantly narrowed during social restrictions due to reduced food availability. However, their niche overlaps remained consistent across sampling phases, indicating resource partitioning strategies to cope with extreme food shortages—feral pigeons adapted by foraging more on grass verges outside, while Javan mynas frequented tray return stations. This resilience in maintaining species proportions and the absence of significant niche overlap suggested the existence of an ecological balance despite substantial reductions in available food.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Our study underscores the importance of controlling human-provided food to collectively manage dominant urban bird commensals. Beyond the two social restriction phases, curbing the availability of anthropogenic food through enforcement also kept nuisance birds away, validating a cost-effective approach in reducing their counts.\n</p>","author":"Malcolm C.
