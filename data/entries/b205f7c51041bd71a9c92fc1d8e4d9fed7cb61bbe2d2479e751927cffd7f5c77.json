{"title":"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Mutations on the Conformational Landscape of the Spike Protein","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.412/7720056?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) contains a receptor-binding S1 subunit and a fusion-promoting S2 subunit that are separated by a protease cleavage site. The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant accumulated ∼30 mutations in its S protein and showed dramatic shifts in immunogenicity and fusogenicity compared to previous variants [<a href=\"#ozae044.412-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.412-B2\">2</a>]. Cryo-EM studies have reported altered Omicron S architecture and varied presentation of its receptor binding domain (RBD) compared to previous variants. Omicron RBD mutations have been shown to stabilize the RBD “down” state that is inaccessible to the ACE2 receptor [<a href=\"#ozae044.412-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.412-B4\">4</a>], although the specific contributions of these mutations as well as of others that occur in different regions of the S protein in modulating S protein conformation remain unclear. Here we parse the effects of individual mutations or sets of mutations and investigate their respective effects on the S protein conformational landscape.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b205f7c51041bd71a9c92fc1d8e4d9fed7cb61bbe2d2479e751927cffd7f5c77","category":"Environment"}
