{"title":"Analysis of CD1a-Positive Dendritic Cells in the Regional Lymph Nodes of Patients with Gallbladder Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1808/v1","date":1724667121000,"content":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are known as major antigen-presenting cells, and lymph nodes (LNs) play an important role in the DC-mediated immune response. This study focused on infiltration of CD1a-positive DCs (CD1a-DCs) in regional LNs in 70 cases of gallbladder cancer (GBC). The results showed that LNs infiltration by CD1a-DCs was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with GBC in univariate analyses, but all cases categorized as CD1a-DCs high group at regional LNs had nodal metastasis. Therefore, LNs infiltration by CD1a-DCs was not an independent prognostic factor identified by multivariate analyses. The subgroup analyses in cases with LN metastasis group (n = 32), significant impact of CD1a-DCs infiltration into metastatic LNs was not observed. In contrast, CD1a-DCs infiltration into primary tumor had a significant impact on surgical outcomes. As the results of previous reports that focused on CD1a-DCs infiltration in regional LNs of other organs were varied, the role and significance of CD1a-DCs infiltration in regional LNs may be different according to the tumor histology or primary site. Accumulation of further studies is needed to clarify the role and significance of CD1a-DCs infiltration into regional LNs of solid cancers","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f14178a8c2a0a23df0f523b9abc41e1037951427444df442e0bef79b5debced","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
