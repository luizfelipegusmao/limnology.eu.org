The classical plant breeding approach harnesses the advantages of meiotic recombination or crossing over (CO) for crop development and trait improvement. During meiotic recombination, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic segments through pairing, synapsis, and recombination to generate genetic diversity. Several CO protein complexes and families like ZMM complex (Zipper 1-4, Mut S homolog 4-5, and meiotic recombination 3), MutLÎ³ protein family (MLH1 and MLH3), and others ensure the error-free meiosis and uniform chromosome distribution in daughter cells without genetic anomalies (<a href=\"#kiae266-B8\">Wang and Copenhaver 2018</a>) (<a href=\"#kiae266-F1\">Fig. A</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"34963604f269a8cfcfb15b8e02baa553ee698e40507d834a89101debb9b066fd","category":"Environment"}
