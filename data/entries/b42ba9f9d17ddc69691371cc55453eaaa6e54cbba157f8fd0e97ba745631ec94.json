{"title":"Sustainability of Lolium multiflorum L. &ldquo;Ecotype Cajamarquino&rdquo;, Associated with Trifolium repens L., at Three Harvest Times in the Northern Highlands of Peru","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1079/v1","date":1715853290000,"content":"Livestock in the northern highlands of Peru is fed on the association of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) ecotype cajamarquino - white clover (Trifolium repens L.) Ladino variety constantly varies in its agronomic characteristics and nutritional value due to management considerations and its association with the soil and the animal. The objective was to evaluate yield, plant height, growth rate, number of tillers, spikelets, basal diameter in ryegrass, elongation rate, internode length, and decrease points in clover over one year. Nutritional value was represented by crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDDM) and metabolisable energy (ME) at three cutting frequencies. Better yield (5588 kg DM ha) and plant height (47.1 cm) showed the 60-day cutting frequency; however, there was no difference (p&amp;gt;0.05) among the three cutting frequencies in annual yield. There was no difference between number of tillers and basal diameter. Clover height, elongation rate and internode length were higher at 60 days. The highest CP concentration and lowest NDF value (p&amp;lt;0.05) were achieved by clover at 30 and 45 days. The producers should consider the findings obtained to decide the time of use of this association in dairy cattle feeding.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b42ba9f9d17ddc69691371cc55453eaaa6e54cbba157f8fd0e97ba745631ec94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
