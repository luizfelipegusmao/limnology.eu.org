{"title":"Analysis of PM10 Substances via Intuitionistic Fuzzy Decision-Making and Statistical Evaluation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0583/v1","date":1715243889000,"content":"Air pollution is a situation that negatively affects the health of humans and all living things in nature and causes financial damage to the environment. In the case of air pollution, harmful and foreign substances in the air reach an amount and density above normal values. Air pollution also causes climate change, which affects global warming. Particulate matter is a harmful substance that harms the health of humans and other living things, causes air pollution, increases radiation, and negatively affects cloud formation. Particulate matter is extremely small solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. PM10, which is less than 10 microns in diameter, is defined as small particles that can remain in the air for a long time and settle in the respiratory tract, damaging the lungs. Many criteria affect PM10 density and changes in density. The main criteria are vehicle traffic and fuel consumption, industrialization, coal, fuel oil and wood-burning heaters, greenhouse gas impact, and unregulated urbanization. It is important to identify the underlying causes of air pollution caused by PM10. In this context, these criteria need to be evaluated to minimize the negative effects of PM10. In the study, monthly average PM10 data between 2019 and 2023 obtained from the Air Monitoring Station in Kocaeli, TÃ¼rkiye are used. After determining the criteria affecting PM10, the criteria are prioritized with the Intuitionistic Fuzzy AHP (IF-AHP) method by taking expert decision-maker opinions. The proposed decision-making model aims to guide obtaining the important causes of PM10 emission in terms of danger and focusing on these causes. Additionally, PM10 data is analyzed in the context of Covid-19 and a statistical analysis is made. One-way ANOVA is used to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in the average monthly data over the years. Games-Howell test, one of the post-hoc tests, is used for differences between groups (years). The study is important in that it provides a focus on the criteria affecting PM10 with an intuitive fuzzy perspective, along with statistical analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2b0ef6e716b5471bf007c0feba16c524aca2e4eb36b97dec2edcf218e74bd00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
