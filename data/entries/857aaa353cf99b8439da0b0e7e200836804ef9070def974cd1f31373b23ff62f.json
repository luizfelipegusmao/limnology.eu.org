{"title":"Diversity, Composition and Distribution Patterns of Spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) in Sand Forest, South Africa","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aje.13334?af=R","date":1729237683000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Spiders are the dominant representative of the top predator guild in many terrestrial ecosystems, but their diversity and distribution in forests in South Africa are still understudied. This study aimed to determine ground-dwelling spider diversity, composition and distribution patterns in both sand forest and savanna (and their ecotone) using pitfall traps and to provide a spider species checklist for these three habitats in Phinda Private Game Reserve. A total of 410 individuals from 64 species and 21 families were recorded from the three habitat types. The Lycosidae family and <i>Pardosa crassipalpis</i> were the most dominant family and species. Spider abundances were similar between sand forest and the ecotone, but lower in savanna. However, species richness was similar across habitats. Spider species assemblages were similar between sand forest and the ecotone, but differed from the species assemblages in savanna. Spiders play an important role in food webs both below- and aboveground. Therefore, determining their diversity and distribution contributes to the overall understanding of the ecosystem in addition to promoting conservation efforts of key habitats such as the critically endangered sand forest.</p>","author":"Zabentungwa Thakasile Hlongwane, \nThinandavha Caswell Munyai, \nOlwethu Majola, \nAnna Sophia Dippenaar‐Schoeman, \nD. D. Georgette Lagendijk","siteTitle":"Wiley: African Journal of Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0a8ec0da97c05188d45f40eaa6dd19ed9528e14fad92d29cce59e67ce4030364","entryHash":"857aaa353cf99b8439da0b0e7e200836804ef9070def974cd1f31373b23ff62f","category":"Environment"}
