{"title":"Robust Algorithms for the Analysis of Fast Field Cycling Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Dispersion Curves","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1055/v1","date":1713275545000,"content":"Fast Field-Cycling (FFC) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxometry is a powerful non-destructive magnetic resonance technique that enables, among other things,  the investigation of slow molecular dynamics at low magnetic field intensities. FFC-NMR relaxometry measurements provide insight into molecular motion across various timescales within a single experiment. \nThis study focuses on a \\textit{model-free}  approach,  representing the NMRD profile $R_1$ as a linear combination of Lorentzian functions, thereby addressing the challenges of fitting data within an ill-conditioned linear least-squares framework.\nTackling this problem, we present a comprehensive review and experimental validation of three regularization approaches to implement the model-free approach to analysing NMRD profiles. \nThese include: (1) \\nameUpe, utilizing locally adapted $L_2$ regularization; (2) \\nameL, based on $L_1$ penalties; and (3) a hybrid approach combining locally adapted $L_2$ and global $L_1$ penalties. Each method's regularization parameters are determined automatically, according to the Balancing and Uniform Penalty principles. \n%\nOur contributions include the implementation and experimental validation of the \\nameUpe{} and \\nameUp{} algorithms, and the development of a \"dispersion analysis\" technique to assess  the existence  range of the  estimated parameters. The objective of this work is to delineate the variance in fit quality and correlation time distribution yielded by each algorithm, thus broadening the set  of software tools for  the analysis of sample structures in FFC-NMR studies. The findings underline the efficacy and applicability of these algorithms in the analysis of  NMRD profiles from samples representing different potential scenarios.\n1","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed671e92c8b9ab0e04134b25d485ff8d3713c7315d53f6801732adb5107121b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
