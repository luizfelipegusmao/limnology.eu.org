{"title":"Comprehensive Analysis and Large-Scale Screening of Binding Interactions Between PFAS and Their Mixtures with Nuclear Receptors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1286/v1","date":1716217456000,"content":"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants of emerging concern, recognized for their toxicity and potential carcinogenic properties. PFAS chemicals are reported to act as endocrine disruptors through their interactions with various nuclear receptors (NRs). Despite their significant impact, comprehensive screenings and detailed analyses of PFAS binding strengths at both the orthosteric and allosteric sites of NRs are currently lacking in the literature. Our study addresses this gap by focusing on the binding interaction analysis of both common and uncommon PFAS with key nuclear receptors such as the vitamin D receptor (VDR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). We used advanced docking simulations to screen 9,507 PFAS chemicals at the orthosteric and allosteric sites of the PPARγ, PXR, VDR, and ERα. We verified the accuracy of our docking protocol through multiple docking procedures and validations. The python code used for PFAS chemical screening is deposited in the supplementary file. Among the PFAS assessed at the orthosteric site of the VDR, 21 demonstrated similar binding affinities compared to the calcitriol, while 130 PFAS, exhibited stronger binding affinities than calcitriol. At the VDR allosteric site, where lithocholic acid (LCA) natively binds, 412 PFAS matched the binding energies of LCA, and 2,229 showed even greater binding energies. Similar testing on the PXR, PPARγ, and ERα revealed that the orthosteric site of PPARγ had 1,863 PFAS binding with a higher affinity than native ligand ET1 and 693 PFAS binding at the allosteric site with greater affinity than T35 native ligand. At the PXR orthosteric site, 650 PFAS bound with a greater affinity than native ligand 4WH, while at the allosteric site, 9,148 PFAS demonstrated a greater binding affinity than the known allosetric ligand glycerol. At the orthosteric site of ERα, 40 PFAS displayed binding with a greater affinity than the native ligand estradiol and at the allosteric site, only 8 PFAS exhibited greater binding affinity than coactivator ligand SRC-1. Further, our mixture modeling analysis indicates that PFAS can bind in various combinations with themselves and with endogenous or native ligands simultaneously, to disrupt the endocrine system and cause carcinogenic responses. These findings reveal that PFAS can interfere with nuclear receptor activity by displacing endogenous or native ligands by binding to the orthosteric and allosteric sites. This study elucidates the mechanisms through which PFAS exert their endocrine-disrupting effects, potentially leading to more targeted environmental regulations and therapeutic strategies. Importantly, this study is the first to explore the binding of PFAS at allosteric sites and to model PFAS mixtures at nuclear receptors. Given the high concentration and persistence of PFAS in humans, this study called for the urgent need for further research into the carcinogenic mechanisms of PFAS and the development of intervention strategies that target nuclear receptors. Our ongoing studies extend these findings by further investigating the interactions of PFAS and co-exposed chemicals with nuclear receptors. These investigations are supported by experimental verification, which will enhance our understanding of PFAS broad effects and aid in the design of effective mitigation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29e24d30aa6a419f052d12e4cdd19a647908c9729fad7eedc108aa14195c6102","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
