{"title":"Four-channel integrated high-voltage power supply for dielectric elastomer actuators","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0528/v1","date":1725613030000,"content":"Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) are emerging as promising candidates for various applica-tions in robotics and optical devices due to their lightweight, miniaturization potential, high en-ergy density, simple structure, and low power consumption. However, their effective actuation always demands sophisticated high-voltage driving circuits that are compact and responsive. DEAs need to be capable of generating intricate high-voltage waveforms or simultaneously con-trolling multiple channels with distinct high-voltage levels. This paper proposes a high-voltage power supply for DEAs, featuring a four-channel high-voltage driving circuit. The circuit is ca-pable of independently generating high-voltage signals ranging from 100 V to 6000 V and can be programmed to produce arbitrary waveforms with adjustable frequencies. The independent op-eration of channels without crosstalk showcases the system's integration and potential for cross-disciplinary applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78df9101d6216ba7327b4111ea0843a24a656b920cbbb89bd8fb50517bfb7cd0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
