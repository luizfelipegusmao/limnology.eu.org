{"title":"The Wicked and the Complex: A New Paradigm for Societal Problem-Solving","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1438/v2","date":1721285851000,"content":"Wicked problems, such as climate change, systemic poverty, and healthcare inequalities, rep- resent the most pressing and intractable challenges facing society today. We propose a novel approach that leverages complex systems theory as a comprehensive framework for understanding and tackling these challenges. By applying concepts such as state space analysis, attractors, and nonlinear dynamics, we offer a sophisticated toolkit for mapping the intricate web of interactions defining wicked problems and exploring potential interventions. Our approach moves beyond tradi- tional reductionist methods, embracing the inherent complexity and dynamism of these issues. We demonstrate how this framework can lead to more nuanced, adaptive, and effective strategies for addressing persistent societal problems. Despite the prevalence of wicked problems and the avail- ability of complex systems theory, practical applications of this approach remain uncommon. This paper aims to bridge this gap, illustrating the potential of complex systems theory to transform our engagement with intractable problems and pave the way for more robust, holistic solutions. By synthesizing insights from mathematics, physics, and social sciences, we present a transdisci- plinary approach that promises to revolutionize how we conceptualize and address societyâ€™s most challenging issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9056cbcc79d8e878f27998dae74b841874d3580f3eb7fa5a9932d9776136345e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
