{"title":"Effects of removing phytic acid on the bioaccessibility of Ca/Fe/Zn and protein digestion in soymilk","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13367?af=R","date":1708614024000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Soymilk is a high-quality source of protein and minerals, such as calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn). However, phytic acid in soymilk restricts mineral and protein availability. We here investigated the effects of removing phytic acid on the physicochemical properties, mineral (Ca, Fe, and Zn) bioaccessibility, and protein digestibility of soymilk.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Physicochemical property analysis revealed that the removal of phytic acid reduced protein accumulation at the gastric stage, thereby facilitating soymilk matrix digestion. The removal of phytic acid significantly increased Zn bioaccessibility by 18.19% in low-protein soymilk and Ca and Fe bioaccessibility by 31.20% and 30.03%, respectively, in high-protein soymilk.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Removing phytic acid was beneficial for the hydrolysis of high-molecular-weight proteins and increased the soluble protein content in soymilk, which was conducive to protein digestion. This study offers a feasible guide for developing plant-based milk with high nutrient bioaccessibility.
