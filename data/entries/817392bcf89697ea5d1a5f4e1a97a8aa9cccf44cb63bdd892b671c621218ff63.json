{"title":"Ganoderma pfeifferi Bres. 1889 and Ganoderma resinaceum Boud. 1889 as Potential Therapeutic Agents: A Comparative Study on Antiproliferative and Lipid-Lowering Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1364/v1","date":1718796064000,"content":"Medicinal mushrooms, especially Ganoderma species hold immense promise for production of a wide range of bioactive compounds with various effects. The biochemical potential of indigenous fungal strains, specific to a region, could play a critical role in the continuous search for novel strains with superior activities on a global scale. This research focused on the ethanolic (EtOH) and hot-water (H2O) extracts of fruiting bodies of two wild-growing Ganoderma species: G. pfeifferi and G. resinaceum with an aim to assess its nutritional (total carbohydrate content-TCC), and mineral composition in relation to bioactive properties: antioxidant, antiproliferative and lipid-lowering. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) revealed that G. pfeifferi is a promising source of minerals that are essential for numerous physiological functions in the human body like bone health and muscle and nerve function, with calcium (Ca 4.55 ± 0.41 mg/g d.w.) and magnesium (Mg 1.33 ± 0.09 mg/g d.w.), being the most abundant macro element present. Zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and chromium (Cr) were particularly notable, with concentrations ranging from 21.49 to 41.70 mg/kg d.w. \nThe EtOH extract of G. pfeifferi demonstrated significantly elevated levels of TCC, essential macromolecules for energy and structural functions in the body, with higher quantities of all three standard carbohydrates detected in this type of extract. Similar to revealed composition the same species, G. pfeifferi stood out as the most prominent antioxidant agent, with H2O extract being stronger than EtOH in ABTS assay (86.85 ± 0.67 mg TE/g d.w.), while EtOH extract displayed the highest anti OH• radical scavenging ability (IC50 = 0.18 ± 0.05 μg/mL) as well as the most notable reducing potential among all. The highest antiproliferative effect against the breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), demonstrated the H2O extracts from G. resinaceum with the most pronounced activity after 24 hours (IC50 = 4.88 ± 0.50 μg/mL) which surpasses that of the standard compound, ellagic acid (IC50 = 33.94 ± 3.69 μg/mL). Administration of both Ganoderma extracts mitigated diabetic lipid disturbances and exhibited potential renal and hepatic protection in vivo on white Wistar rats by preservation of kidney function parameters in G. resinaceum H2O pre-treatment (urea: 6.27 ± 0.64 mmol/L, creatinine: 50.00 ± 6.45 mmol/L) and the reduction of ALT levels (17.83 ± 3.25 U/L) com-pared to diabetic control groups treated with saline (urea: 46.98 ± 6.01 mmol/L, creatinine: 289.25 ± 73.87 mmol/L, and ALT: 60.17 ± 9.64 U/L). These results suggest that pre-treatment with G. resinaceum H2O extracts may have potential antidiabetic properties.\nIn summary, detected microelements are vital for maintaining overall health, supporting metabolic processes, and protecting against various chronic diseases. Further research and dietary assessments could help determine the full potential and applications of two underexplored Ganoderma species native to Serbia in nutrition and health supplements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"817392bcf89697ea5d1a5f4e1a97a8aa9cccf44cb63bdd892b671c621218ff63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
