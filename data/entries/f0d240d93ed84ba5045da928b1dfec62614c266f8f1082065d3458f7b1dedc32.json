These small RNAs fall into three major classes based on their function and mechanisms of biogenesis—microRNAs, heterochromatic small interfering RNAs, and secondary small interfering RNAs—plus several other less well-characterized categories. Biogenesis of each small RNA class requires a pathway of factors, some specific to each pathway and others involved in multiple pathways. Diverse sequenced plant genomes, along with rapid developments in sequencing, imaging, and genetic transformation techniques, have enabled significant progress in understanding the biogenesis, functions, and evolution of plant small RNAs, including those that had been poorly characterized because they were absent or had low representation in <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Here, we review recent findings about plant small RNAs and discuss our current understanding of their biogenesis mechanisms, targets, modes of action, mobility, and functions in <span>Arabidopsis</span> and other plant species, including economically important crops.</p></div>","author":"Junpeng Zhan and Blake C.
