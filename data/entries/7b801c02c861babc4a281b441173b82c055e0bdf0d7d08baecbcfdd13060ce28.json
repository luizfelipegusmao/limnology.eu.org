{"title":"Sewage Sludge in Agricultural Lands. The Legislative Framework in EU-28.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1537/v1","date":1729504935000,"content":"Incorporating sewage sludge (SS) into soils presents a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option compared to conventional farming practices. However, SS could be perceived as a double-edged sword, as it may contain a broad spectrum of contaminants, posing threats to soil, underground waters, food chains and human health. Even from an epidemiology perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic has instigated debates regarding the potential health risks associated with SS. \nThe handling of SS is emerging as a significant issue in the European Union (EU), primarily due to its increasing utilization and the presence of contaminants such as heavy metals (HMs), microplastics (MPs), Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PIE), and personal care products (PSPs). The Council Directive 86/278/EEC governs the limits of HMs when SS is utilized in agriculture. However, the Directive is enacted diversely throughout EU member states (MS), with their national legislations highlighting differences, gaps and various approaches in implementing the Council Directive. The Directive, which has been in force since 1986, has not undergone any significant revisions until the recent disclosure of a revised version in May 2023. The executive summary of the evaluation of the Council Directive 86/278/EEC (SWD-2023) â€“ {final 158} specifies maximum concentrations of six HMs in SS among its regulatory measures.\nThis article delves into capturing the current legal framework that defines and delimits the processes and obligations of EU MS regarding SS's management, treatment, and agriculture amendment. The primary objective is to explore the qualitative and quantitative differences/discrepancies between the MS National legislation and point out discontinuities and gaps, thus setting forward a cohesive step for future revisions and updates of the relevant legislation.\nPart of the article's results reflect the different approaches to permissible limits of HMs concentrations in the EU MS and between international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Moreover, the total absence of MPs and other Common Soil Pollutants (antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, etc.) limit values are evidence of the gaps in the current legislative framework.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b801c02c861babc4a281b441173b82c055e0bdf0d7d08baecbcfdd13060ce28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
