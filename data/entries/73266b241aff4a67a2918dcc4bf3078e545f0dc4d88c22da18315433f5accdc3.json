{"title":"R2R3 MYB Transcription Factor GhMYB201 Promotes Cotton Fiber Elongation via Cell Wall Loosening and Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acid Synthesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1531/v1","date":1724292545000,"content":"Cotton fiber is the leading natural textile material, and fiber elongation plays an essential role in the formation of cotton yield and quality. Although a wealth of components in the molecular network controlling cotton fiber elongation have been reported, a lot of players still need to be functionally dissected to understand the regulatory mechanism of fiber elongation comprehensively. In the present study, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene, GhMYB201, was characterized and functionally verified via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing. GhMYB201 was homologous to Arabidopsis AtMYB60, and both coding genes (GhMYB201At and Dt) were preferentially expressed in elongating cotton fibers. Knocking-out of GhMYB201 significantly reduced the rate and duration of fiber elongation, resulting in shorter and coarser mature fibers. It was found that GhMYB201 could bind and activate the transcription of cell wall loosening genes (GhRDLs), and also Î²-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (GhKCSs) genes to enhance very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels in elongating fibers. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the transcription factor GhMYB201s play essential roles in promoting fiber elongation via activating genes related to cell wall loosening and VLCFA biosynthesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73266b241aff4a67a2918dcc4bf3078e545f0dc4d88c22da18315433f5accdc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
