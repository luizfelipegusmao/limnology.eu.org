Road networks suffered extensive damage, with 55 roadside landslides exacerbating the disruption. Preliminary mapping identified over 3,239 landslides with sizes ranging from 62 to 524,113 m<sup>2</sup>, primarily clustered in areas experiencing peak ground acceleration exceeding 250 cm/s<sup>2</sup>. Four landslide dams were formed post-event, including one near a hydropower station. The following impacts heighten concerns about hazards such as frequent unstable slope failures, debris flows caused by intense rainfall, and subsequent coseismic rockfalls occur due to strong aftershocks.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"b401f312f8d420dd010aedb67a33f38f95f47c50ebaa088e0f5b18f0d1b3cd54","category":"Environment"}
