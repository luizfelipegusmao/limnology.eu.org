{"title":"PSV-12 Evaluating the effect of lyoprotectants in preserving community structure and bacterial viability in the lyophilized fecal community of pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/511/7757791?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) stands as a potential method for enhancing pig health. FMT has progressed from the basic delivery of fresh stool, to lyophilized preparations which is beneficial for sample storage, but can damage bacterial cells. This has necessitated the need for lyoprotectants to preserve bacterial viability. However, the ideal lyoprotectant for retaining community structure and viability remains unclear. Furthermore, DNA-based microbial profiling methods such as 16S rRNA and metagenomics sequencing do not distinguish live and dead bacteria, prompting the need for other methods of distinguishing live and dead members of the bacterial community after lyophilization. PMA-seq (propidium monoazide treatment followed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) has been shown to differentiate between live and dead bacteria in microbial communities. To refine FMT in pigs, we sought to ascertain the impact of four lyoprotectants on bacterial viability and fecal microbiome structure. Fecal samples from six pigs were treated with mannitol, maltodextrin, trehalose, maltodextrin-trehalose mix (2.5% each) as lyoprotectants or left untreated. Lyophilized fecal samples underwent PMA treatment prior to 16S rRNA sequencing to capture the active community, and total and viable bacterial cells number were quantified. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze total and viable bacterial cells, and richness, while PERMANOVA was used to compare beta diversity. Results revealed no initial differences in total, viable bacteria, or community structure (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). However, untreated, and mannitol-treated groups showed significantly reduced total and viable bacterial cells post-lyophilization (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), unlike the other lyoprotectants (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). Mannitol and the untreated group also displayed decreased richness and beta diversity shifts (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Overall, lyophilization with mannitol or no lyoprotectant notably impacted pig fecal microbiota community structure, while maltodextrin, trehalose, and maltodextrin-trehalose effectively preserved bacterial viability and structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"72ef3b21f5cdaeead3c4380aeee8f8c1da8b53964d54094c5ff3e320376439a3","category":"Environment"}
