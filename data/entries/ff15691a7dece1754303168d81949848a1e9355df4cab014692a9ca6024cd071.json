{"title":"Effectiveness of Social Technical Assistance (STA) Program for Vulnerable Beneficiaries: Evidence from Nepal’s Post-Earthquake Reconstruction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1657/v1","date":1719220102000,"content":"This research assesses the effectiveness of the Socio-Technical Assistance (STA) program combined with Owner-Driven Housing Reconstruction for rural private housing recovery after Nepal’s 2015 earthquake, particularly targeting vulnerable households. Through a quantitative 304-questionnaire survey, the study reveals that 96% of households credited STA activities for accelerating reconstruction, with 95% acknowledging its significance and 78% emphasizing its necessity. Notably,89% expressed dependency on STA for reconstruction, and 85% believed it heightened disaster risk reduction awareness. In conclusion, the study establishes that STA activities significantly contributed to the successful reconstruction of vulnerable households, addressing critical aspects such as financial support, technical assistance, housing accessibility, earthquake-resilient construction, improved livelihoods, and safety enhancements.\n\nThe field study presents crucial recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of Socio-Technical Assistance (STA) activities in post-earthquake rural private housing reconstruction. Emphasizing the need for tailored, demand-driven interventions, the study cautions against relying solely on an Owner-driven Reconstruction model, challenging the one-size-fits-all strategy. The study proposes integrating tailored interventions into overarching recovery strategies, advocating for coordinated efforts to enhance Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) awareness and cultivate resilient communities in particularly vulnerable households. Aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11, which focuses on sustainable cities and communities. This research aims to enhance the literature on post-disaster humanitarian shelter and settlement by emphasizing the significance of inclusive and comprehensive approaches to recovery and reconstruction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff15691a7dece1754303168d81949848a1e9355df4cab014692a9ca6024cd071","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
