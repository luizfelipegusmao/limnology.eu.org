Following precise taxonomic identification, total length and weight of each individual for each by-catch species were measured and the relationship parameters estimated. Slope or exponent of the relations ranged from 2.456 to 3.394, with coefficient of determination ≥0.90. Present information on length-weight relationship parameters is virgin globally for <i>Leiodon cutcutia</i> and <i>Uranoscopus archionema</i>; and for <i>Jaydia lineata</i>, <i>Drepane punctata</i>, <i>Grammoplites scaber</i> and <i>Thryssa setirostris</i>; they are first records from northern Indian Ocean.</p>","author":"Ghosh Shubhadeep, \nEdward Loveson, \nMenon Muktha, \nDivipala Indira, \nPralaya Ranjan Behera, \nFelix Jasmin, \nHoshalli Munivenkatappa Manas, \nPattnaik Phalguni, \nDas Madhumita, \nRao Gourisankar, \nMamidi Satishkumar, \nAayathan Puthiyapurayil Dineshbabu, \nAchamveetil Gopalakrishnan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"1b6b9966f3d94ac2414e2415a5fb51076dfc873f21957723f9682e384f1d6c9f","category":"Environment"}
