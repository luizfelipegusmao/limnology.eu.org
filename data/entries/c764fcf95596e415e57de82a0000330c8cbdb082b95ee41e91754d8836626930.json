{"title":"Friedmann Type Equations in Thermodynamic Form Lead to Much Tighter Constraints on the Critical Density of the Universe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1241/v2","date":1711446687000,"content":"Based on recent progress in cosmological thermodynamics, we present a new thermody- namic formulation of the Friedmann equations in the new Haug-Tatum cosmology model, as well as for other similar models put forward in the literature from different solutions to Einsteinâ€™s field equation. Since the CMB temperature has been measured much more accu- rately than the Hubble constant, we demonstrate that our thermodynamic formulation of the Friedmann equation dramatically narrows the acceptable range for the critical density of the universe. Furthermore, we show how our thermodynamic formulation leads to a more precise cosmological constant estimate.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c764fcf95596e415e57de82a0000330c8cbdb082b95ee41e91754d8836626930","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
