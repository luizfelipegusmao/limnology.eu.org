{"title":"Local and Global Public Health Consequences of Emissions from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in the US: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1709/v1","date":1719326261000,"content":"More than 400 million tons of livestock waste are generated annually by approximately 25,000 concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) located in the United States (US). These operations give rise to externalities, including adverse local and global health impacts from CAFO waste emissions, which can potentially outweigh their economic viability. However, a shortage of evidence synthesis research on US-based CAFO emissions may hinder effective policy development. This scoping review (ScR) study, conducted following guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute, searched databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and Embase in May 2020, yielding ten publications meeting inclusion criteria. Results suggest possible CAFO worker exposures to multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA), campylobacteriosis and cryptosporidiosis. Communities near CAFOs experienced higher rates of adverse health impacts compared to those in non-CAFO areas, with patterns suggesting proximity may correlate with increased odds of detrimental health effects. Implicit global health threats include Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), MDRSA, campylobacteriosis, tuberculosis, and cryptosporidiosis. These studies provide foundational insights into CAFO proximity, density patterns, and adverse public health effects, indicating a need for evidence-informed environmental health policies to minimize local and global risks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71dc8357b3b62c542b99f65139d807330e5629d7b7f7ac280d96267030c816ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
