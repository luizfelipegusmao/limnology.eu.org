{"title":"An Analogical JV Case Study on NUMMI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1043/v1","date":1713255403000,"content":"NUMMI was one of the most analyzed case studies in terms of joint ventures, management dysfunction, and international globalization. NUMMI is an acronym for New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. This manufacturer was a joint venture between automotive US titan GM and Toyota of Japan. GM wanted to further monetize its Fremont factory, but also had limited opportunities during a US economical recession. Toyota wanted to expand manufacturing operations in the US for the very first time, creating an intriguing collaborative partnership between the two. However, various problems lead to dysfunction through cultural, organizational, or managerial differences. This case study is analyzed through its historical analogical scope, ultimately leading to hypothesizing remediation through an ethical data-driven and total quality management (TQM) approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c4048249928cf8de45e41a270c04b7531ba4a63e96d050c5532e07527cd9b5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
