{"title":"Variable Concentration of Ferritin in Meconium in Relation to the Iron Regulatory Proteins and Newborn Body Size","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2596/v1","date":1722591658000,"content":"Ferritin is an indirect marker for total body iron stores. Comparison of the ferritin concentrations in the meconium with the concentrations of proteins regulating iron metabolism could aid better understanding of principles behind the adjustment between the fetal iron pool and newborn body size. Ferritin, transferrin, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, lactoferrin, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and calprotectin concentrations were measured by ELISA in meconium samples from 122 neonates. The neonates were classified according to the meconium ferritin tertiles and the values were collated with the meconium concentrations of other proteins and newborn body weight and length measurements. Increasing ferritin concentrations in meconium in consecutive tertiles (p &lt; 0.05) were parallel to increased NGAL concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). The interrelationships between the meconium concentrations of transferrin, haptoglobin and NGAL as well as between myeloperoxidase, calprotectin and lactoferrin are maintained in all subsequent tertiles of ferritin concentrations, (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast to ferritin, increasing meconium NGAL concentrations in consecutive tertiles were linked to increased concentrations of transferrin, haptoglobin, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase (p &lt; 0.05) and of calprotectin, ferritin and ceruloplasmin (p &lt; 0.1). Meconium ceruloplasmin concentrations correlate exclusively with neutrophil granule proteins, i.e. myeloperoxidase, NGAL, lactoferrin and calprotectin (p &lt; 0.05). Meconium ferritin concentrations negatively correlates with birth weight (r= -0.20) and length (r= -0.31) of neonates, whereas NGAL concentrations just with birth length (r= -0.26). The remaining proteins did not show such relationships with the size of the newborn. High meconium concentrations of both ferritin and NGAL may specifically characterize neonates of smaller size. High meconium concentrations of both ferritin and NGAL may specifically characterize neonates with lower body measurements. Correlations between meconium transferrin, haptoglobin and NGAL may confirm the interrelationships of these proteins for proper iron control and transport in the intrauterine environment. Meconium ceruloplasmin concentrations may reflect the control of neutrophil activity in utero.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cb32e21b81f154423d74f6c7350e8db51079182f236ebced95c1092f81efe16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
