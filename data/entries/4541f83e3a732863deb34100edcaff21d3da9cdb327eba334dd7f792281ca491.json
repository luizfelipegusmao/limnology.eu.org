{"title":"ZIF‐8 decorated FeMo nanoparticles: H2 Production from the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia‐borane","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14439?af=R","date":1726641668000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Ammonia-Borane (AB) is considered a promising solid hydrogen storage material due to its high hydrogen content (19.6 wt%) and its use for safe hydrogen transport. The most effective way to produce H<sub>2</sub> from AB is to perform the hydrolysis reaction in the presence of a suitable catalyst. In this study, Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub>/ZIF-8 nanocatalyst was synthesized in two steps: <i>(i)</i> synthesis by following the colloidal synthesis technique by thermal decomposition of Mo(CO)<sub>6</sub> and Fe(acac)<sub>3</sub> in the presence of OM and ODE at high temperatures, and <i>(ii)</i> the resulting colloidal Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub> NPs were decorated into ZIF-8. The as-prepared Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub>/ZIF-8 catalyst was identified using advanced characterization techniques such as ICP-OES, P-XRD, SEM, SEM–EDX, TEM, TEM-EDX, XPS, and BET. The catalytic activities of the Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub>/ZIF-8 catalyst in the hydrolysis of AB were investigated in different parameters (temperature, catalyst [Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub>] and substrate [H<sub>3</sub>NBH<sub>3</sub>] concentration, and recyclability). The results show that high crystallinity Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub> NPs with a uniform 1.31 ± 0.13 nm distribution were formed on the ZIF-8 surface. Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub>/ZIF-8 catalyst provides a maximum H<sub>2</sub> generation rate of 184.2 mLH<sub>2</sub> (g catalyst)<sup>−1</sup> (min)<sup>−1</sup> at 343 K. This uniquely cost-effective, active and durable Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub>/ZIF-8 catalyst has strong potential for H<sub>2</sub>-based fuel cell (PEM: Proton Exchange Membrane) applications where AB is a suitable H<sub>2</sub> carrier.</p>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<p>\nFeMo NPs were synthesized by a colloidal synthesis method and decorated into ZIF-8.\nFeMo/ZIF-8 catalyst is an active catalyst in the hydrolysis of AB.\nFeMo/ZIF-8 catalyst showed an initial TOF value of 449.85 mol(H<sub>2</sub>)·molFe<sub>0.2</sub>Mo<sub>0.8</sub>\n<sup>−1</sup>·h<sup>−1</sup> in the AB hydrolysis at 338 K.\n</p>","author":"Can Yılmaz, \nHüseyin Ali Yıldırım, \nTuba Top, \nMehmet Yurderi, \nMehmet Zahmakıran","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"4541f83e3a732863deb34100edcaff21d3da9cdb327eba334dd7f792281ca491","category":"Environment"}
