{"title":"Monitoring the Net Primary Productivity of Togo&#039;s Ecosystems in Relation to Changes in Precipitation and Temperature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1746/v1","date":1724663140000,"content":"Climate variability influences plant growth. With the variation in atmospheric CO2 concentration leading to global warming, it is urgent to monitor the performance of plant ecosystems for optimal carbon sequestration. Net primary productivity (NPP) is the perfect measurement tool as it measures the net carbon flux between the atmosphere and green plants and the factors that affect it. This study applied remote sensing techniques, specifically one of the radiation use efficiency models; the CASA model (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach) to assess the spatio-temporal dy-namics of NPP in Togo from 1987 to 2022 and the climatic parameters that influence it. The annual average NPP over the 36 years of the study is 4565.31 Kg C ha⁻¹. Variability is observed over the years with extremes in 2017 (6312.26 Kg C ha⁻¹) and 1996 (3394.29 Kg C ha⁻¹). Natural formations identified as high-production areas saw their productivity increase between 2000 and 2022. The interaction between climate change and land use changes negatively influences the variation of Total Production (PT) between 2000 and 2022, while individually, these parameters positively influence the variation of NPP (58.28% and 188.63%). The correlation result is positive and higher between NPP and light use efficiency (LUE) (r² = 0.75). Actual evapotranspiration also shows a positive correlation with NPP (r² = 0.43). A positive but weak correlation is observed between NPP and precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (r² = 0.20; 0.10 respectively). Temperatures have almost no correlation with NPP (r² = 0.5). Climatic parameters as a whole under the LUE banner influence NPP more. This study helps understand ecosystem performance in the context of To-go's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"098c8baf721f53a65959b5bf53eff51df1d65647b9c3f1987726d7e8d16f362e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
