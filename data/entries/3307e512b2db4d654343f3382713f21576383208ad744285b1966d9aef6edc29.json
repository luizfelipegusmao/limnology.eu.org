{"title":"Enhancing Cyber Defense Strategies with Discrete Multidimensional Z-Numbers: A Multi-Attribute Decision-Making Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0282/v1","date":1719996017000,"content":"With the rapid development of intelligent logistics and network environment, it has become an urgent problem to efficiently and accurately handle and analyse the huge amount of uncertain decision information. Traditional decision making methods often fail to make the best use of complex and incomplete information, especially in the field of cyber defence. To address these problems, this paper introduces a new mathematical tool, discrete multidimensional Z-numbers (MZs), for expressing and dealing with uncertainty and reliability in network defence decisions. In this paper, we first introduce the synthesis method of discrete multidimensional Z-numbers, which allows us to consider the uncertainty and reliability of multi-source information in network defence strategy. Then, the hidden probability of MZs is calculated by using the hidden probability model, and the multidimensional Z+âˆ’number is proposed, which improves the expressiveness of the model in dealing with information uncertainty. Based on MZs, we define a variety of utility functions and build a multi-attribute group decision framework for network defence around these functions. The MZs provides a novel perspective for analysing and designing response strategies, especially against highly adaptive and covert attacks. The method in this paper is verified by a case of network security assessment of an intelligent logistics company. The results show that this method can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of decision making, demonstrating its unique advantages and wide application potential in network defence. This integrated discrete multidimensional Z-number group decision method is not only suitable for intelligent logistics decision making, but also provides an efficient decision support tool for network defence, which helps to improve the intelligence and adaptability of network security defence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3307e512b2db4d654343f3382713f21576383208ad744285b1966d9aef6edc29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
