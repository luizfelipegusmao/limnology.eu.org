{"title":"A Mathematical Model of Stochastic Synaptic Noise Dynamics Based Spontaneous Action Potential in Non-neural Cell","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0581/v1","date":1710188245000,"content":"The main sources of intrinsic noise in excitable cells at the microcircuit and network levels are the stochastic characteristics of ion channel gating and activation of the synaptic conductance. Studies using in vivo, in vitro, and in silico methods to examine the effects of synaptic background activity were not adequately investigated in non-neuronal excitatory cells, where neurotransmitter-based innervation also occurs. We created a mathematical model to replicate the background synaptic noise dynamics in a non-neuronal cell. We utilized the stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to represent excitatory synaptic conductance, which was incorporated into a whole-cell model to produce spontaneous and evoked cellular electrical activities. The single-cell model includes many biophysically detailed ion channels represented by a set of ordinary differential equations in Hodgkin-Huxley and Markov formalisms. This paradigm effectively induced irregular spontaneous depolarizations (SDs) and spontaneous action potential (sAP) resembling in vitro-like electrical activity in the cells. The input resistance decreased by multiple factors, and the spontaneous action potential firing rate elevated. The potential to reach the action potential threshold is altered. Background synaptic activity can alter the input/output characteristics of non-neuronal excitatory cells. Suppressing these baseline activities would facilitate the discovery of new pharmaceutical targets for different clinical diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1712dce2f57b9a4086e6448458efc1bac7307b018b1719533c1600426834d4e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
