{"title":"Digest: Evaluating sexual conflict in the genome","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/10/1748/7727476?rss=1","date":1722816000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><a href=\"#CIT0001\">Audet et al. (2024)</a> investigate the genomic basis of sexual conflict in response to sexually discordant size selection in <span>Drosophila melanogaster</span>. They report interesting morphological changes in sexual dimorphism and multivariate allometry. Although they do not find any genetic variants that individually show a strong effect on these traits, as expected for a polygenic trait such as body size, they do find a region on chromosome 3L showing signs of sexually discordant selection (i.e., conflict between males and females). This study highlights potential genomic regions involved in sexual conflict, offering insights into sex-specific adaptations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"001bbdff43a92826942d986d6dede3c0ec178ac5e0f0ee742ae3bb65a4dd84cb","category":"Environment"}
