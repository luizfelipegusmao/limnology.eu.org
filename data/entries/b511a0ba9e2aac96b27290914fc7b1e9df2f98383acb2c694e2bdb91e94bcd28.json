{"title":"Co-infection in the Tick Microbiome and in Humans as a Natural Process of Co-cultivation of Tick-Borne Pathogens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0269/v1","date":1712126252000,"content":"The identification of a new virus Kiparis-144 (KiparisV) in a half-fed tick I persulcatus, removed from a person in the south of the Russian Far East, determined the goal of further research - to study its role in human pathology and the characteristics of its behavior in the tick microbiome. An ELISA study of 439 blood samples from people affected by tick bites indicated a fairly frequent (up to 16.4Â±1.7%) encounter of people with the KiparisV virus in the territory of natural foci of the Primorsky Territory. It has been shown that this virus, when mono-infected, can cause clinical symptoms characteristic of acute respiratory diseases. During co-infection under the influence of the KiparisV, there was an increase in the activity of Borrelia spp. with the constant production of antibodies to them only of the IgM class and clinical symptoms of Lyme disease for one year (observation period). Electron microscopy of the KiparisV found in a tick removed from a patient showed a picture of the relationship of the KiparisV (up to 100 nm in size) with unknown representatives of the tick microbiome - pathogens of a viral or bacterial nature. In a comparative aspect, a similar electron microscopic picture of the interaction of the KiparisV virus with a known pathogen of viral nature, the ectromelia virus (ECTV), is presented. The importance of the electron microscopy method in describing the tick microbiome is shown.  Thus, it has been established that when co-cultivated in the system the helper-virus KiparisV probably tends to use another pathogen of the tick microbiome for its reproduction, influencing its pathogenicity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b511a0ba9e2aac96b27290914fc7b1e9df2f98383acb2c694e2bdb91e94bcd28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
