{"title":"Effects of a Bank Plant on the Control of Rice Planthoppers: A Field Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1333/v1","date":1716259682000,"content":"Utilizing ecological engineering to manage pests by enhancing the biological control function of natural predators through the selection of high-efficiency bank plants and the establishment of bank plant systems within agricultural ecosystems is an optimal strategy. While bank plant systems have found widespread use in greenhouse crop cultivation, their application in rice fields remains limited. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of Leersia sayanuka as a bank plant for controlling planthoppers and to explore the potential of sesame as a complementary plant to enhance the effectiveness of the bank plant system through field trials. The findings revealed that planting a strip of L. sayanuka, at least 50 cm wide and extending over 1 m in length, had a notable impact on planthopper control in paddy fields. Moreover, the incorporation of Sesamum indicum, a nectar plant, into the bank plant system consisting of L. sayanuka, Nilaparvata muiri, and Anagrus nilaparvatae, led to a significant increase in the population of Anagrus spp. in rice fields. This increase was accompanied by a rise in the egg parasitism rate targeting rice planthoppers, resulting in a marked improvement in overall rice planthopper control in paddy fields. Thus, the combined system demonstrated efficiency as an effective bank plant system for managing rice planthoppers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0136d751239adeec3b18e5578eadfc9ce4a24f7994d66810bd473409ca88c613","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
