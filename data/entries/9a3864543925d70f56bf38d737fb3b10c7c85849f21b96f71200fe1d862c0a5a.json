{"title":"Perspectives on Evaluation of Food Banks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0218/v1","date":1725347167000,"content":"(1) Food banks have played an important role in reducing food losses and waste and improving the food insecurity situation of vulnerable people. This study aims to conduct a systematic review of food bank evaluation studies and bring new perspectives for future research and decision-making. (2) 58 articles were selected and analyzed from a survey on the Web of Science and Science Direct Platforms. Bibliometric analyses and analyses of the evaluation methodologies used were presented. (3) The bibliometric results indicate an internationalization of the studies since 2013, with a focus on developed countries, and a direct relationship between the location of the research institutes and the location of the organizations studied. Analysis of evaluation methodologies showed that the main aspects evaluated are related to long-term impact, short-term impact and results, indicating less interest in the internal processes and activities of organizations. This result raises important questions for researchers and decision-makers: to what extent evaluation studies reflect the reality and context of a given country or region and to what extent evaluation studies reflect the management processes of food banks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a3864543925d70f56bf38d737fb3b10c7c85849f21b96f71200fe1d862c0a5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
