The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanics and neurophysiology of swallowing between healthy volunteers (HVs) and patients with dysphagia as a consequence of aging (OOD), post-stroke (PSOD), Parkinson's disease (POD), or dementia (DOD). A retrospective study including 35 HVs and 109 OOD, 195 PSOD, 78 POD, and 143 DOD patients was performed. Videofluoroscopic data of signs of impaired efficacy and safety, penetration–aspiration scale (PAS) score, and the biomechanics of laryngeal vestibule closure (LVC) and opening (LVO) and of upper esophageal sphincter opening (UESO) were collected. Neurophysiology was assessed with pharyngeal sensory evoked potentials and neurotopography maps. All OD phenotypes showed signs of impaired efficacy and safety of swallowing, increased PAS score (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and delayed time to LVC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). OOD (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), PSOD (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and POD (<i>p</i> = 0.0065) patients also had delayed time to LVO, and OOD (<i>p</i> = 0.0062) and DOD (<i>p</i> = 0.0016) patients to UESO. Regarding neurophysiology, all phenotypes presented impaired pharyngeal sensitivity, a significant reduction in cortical activation, and impaired sensory input integration. Additionally, only PSOD was associated with impaired conduction of sensory stimuli. In conclusion, we found common but also specific pathophysiological elements. These results improve our understanding of OD pathophysiology and may help pave the way for phenotype-specific treatments.</p>","author":"Noemí Tomsen, \nOmar Ortega, \nPere Clavé","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: Table of Contents","siteHash":"98c7119f6adff358c1cf3a15f5efdc68ead59681d375d3da00900b474221c3c5","entryHash":"a792009eb2270332f91542b23739575db828a2bcfcad0820156d1869ed040011","category":"Environment"}
