{"title":"Relationship of SOD-1 Activity in Metabolic Syndrome and/or Frailty Elderly Individuals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0380/v1","date":1722920094000,"content":"Introduction: Although aging is a natural phenomenon, in recent years it has accelerated. One key factor implicated in the aging process is oxidative stress. Oxidative stress play also role in frailty (frail) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: 66 elderly persons (65 years old and older) with no acute or severe chronic disorders were assessed: waist circumference (WC), arterial blood pressure, glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma lipids and activity of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD-1). Patients were classified as NonMetS-Nonfrail (n=19), NonMetS-frail (n=20), MetS-Nonfrail (n=17), and MetS-frail (n=10). Results: There were no significant differences in superoxide dismutase activity among investigated elderly groups. However, the data suggests that MetS individuals, both frail and nonfrail, have higher risk factors for cardiovascular disease compared to NonMetS individuals. The correlations analyses of SOD-1 and other metabolic indices suggest that SOD-1 levels may be influenced by age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose levels in certain groups of seniors. Conclusions: Aging is associated with decreased antioxidant enzyme SOD-1 activity with glucose alteration in frailty syndrome as well as with lipids disturbances in metabolic syndrome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6416e2944174cca90c6a2634cdbeb333d3a581db2c00351fd2f50c0270e231ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
