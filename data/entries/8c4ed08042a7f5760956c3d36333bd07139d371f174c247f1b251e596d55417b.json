{"title":"An evolutionary view of the function of CC-type glutaredoxins in plant development and adaptation to the environment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4287/7681747?rss=1","date":1716508800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Land plants have to face an oxidizing, heterogeneous, and fast changing environment. Redox-dependent post-translational modifications emerge as a critical component of plant responses to stresses. Among the thiol oxidoreductase superfamily, class III CC-type glutaredoxins (called ROXYs) are land plant specific, and their evolutionary history is highly dynamic. Angiosperms encode many isoforms, classified into five subgroups (Aα, Aβ, Bα, Bβ, Bγ) that probably evolved from five common ancestral ROXYs, with higher evolutionary dynamics in the Bγ subgroup compared with the other subgroups. ROXYs can modulate the transcriptional activity of TGA transcription factor target genes, although their biochemical function is still debated. ROXYs participate in the control of proper plant development and reproduction, and are mainly negative regulators of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. This suggests that most ROXYs could play essential and conserved functions in resetting redox-dependent changes in transcriptional activity upon stress signaling to ensure the responsiveness of the system and/or avoid exaggerated responses that could lead to major defects in plant growth and reproduction. In Arabidopsis Bγ members acquired important functions in responses to nitrogen availability and endogenous status, but the rapid and independent evolution of this subclass might suggest that this function results from neofunctionalization, specifically observed in core eudicots.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8c4ed08042a7f5760956c3d36333bd07139d371f174c247f1b251e596d55417b","category":"Environment"}
