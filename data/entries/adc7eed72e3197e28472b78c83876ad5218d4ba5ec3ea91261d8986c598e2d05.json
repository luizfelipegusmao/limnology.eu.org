{"title":"Education on the Challenges of Recognizing Pain in Cognitive Impairment, Especially in Dementia, and Training on the Use of the PAIC15 Observational Scale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1209/v1","date":1721046885000,"content":"Detecting and evaluating pain in people with cognitive impairment, especially dementia, is a challenge. Their ability to accurately report pain and comprehend related questions decreases the reliability of their self-report. This has contributed to the fact that pain is underdiagnosed and undertreated in this population, which can lead to involuntary ageism. The design and assessment of this training capsule under the context of the European COST-Action TD1005 responds to the need for education and training in \"Pain Assessment In Cognitive Impairment, especially dementia\" and the development of the internationally agreed observational PAIC15 scale. The 3-hour capsule, intended for healthcare workers and caregivers, consists of theoretical-practical levels: 1) basic concepts and challenges in pain in aging, cognitive impairment/dementia, 2) available scales and PAIC15, 3) video presentation of clinical cases illustrating a 3Ã—2 matrix of situations (rest, transfer and experimental pain) and stages of disease (mild and moderate). The objectives focused on training the ability to observe, detect, and assess the signs of pain using PAIC15 and its feasibility. The pre-post analysis in a Master educational setting showed agreement with the results obtained in the Spanish national survey on 1) scarce knowledge of observational tools and their use, and 2) uncertainty in the identification of signs of pain and feasibility in moderate/severe scenarios. The capsule improved the ability to identify and evaluate the pain items, especially facial expressions, and their confidence on observational tools. Debriefings highlighted the relevance of observational scales in dementia and the gain obtained using the new observational instrument.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"adc7eed72e3197e28472b78c83876ad5218d4ba5ec3ea91261d8986c598e2d05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
