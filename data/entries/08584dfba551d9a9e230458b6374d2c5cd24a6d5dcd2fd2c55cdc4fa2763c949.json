{"title":"Detecting Trace Boron Doped in Tungsten Plates Using ToF-SIMS, Raman, and SEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.084/7719452?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Doping a small amount of boron (B) can reduce recrystallization of tungsten (W) effectively [<a href=\"#ozae044.084-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.084-B2\">2</a>]; and it is beneficial for additive manufacturing (AM) of W by reducing the embrittling behavior at grain boundaries [<a href=\"#ozae044.084-B3\">3</a>]. Therefore, B-doping can potentially offer benefits to a plasma facing component (PFC) performance when materials are applied in an extreme high temperature, high neutron irradiation conditions. However, determination of B in W can be challenging when only trace amount of B is used. In this work, we study 1) if B was incorporated into W plates using hot rolling; and 2) determine the quantity of B. Two plates are the subject of study, nominally having 0.1 at%B and 0.01 at%B, respectively. A control W plate with B was used as a reference.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"08584dfba551d9a9e230458b6374d2c5cd24a6d5dcd2fd2c55cdc4fa2763c949","category":"Environment"}
