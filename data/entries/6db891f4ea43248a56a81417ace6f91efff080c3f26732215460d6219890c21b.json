{"title":"Impact of the Deletion of Genes of the Nitrogen Metabolism on Triacylglycerol, Cardiolipin and Actinorhodin Biosynthesis in Streptomyces Coelicolor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1620/v1","date":1721392844000,"content":"In order to assess the impact of nitrogen availability on lipid metabolism of Streptomyces coelicolor, we first assessed the global lipid content of 21 strains derived from S. coelicolor M145 deleted for at least one gene involved in nitrogen metabolism. This study revealed that only 7 strains deleted either for genes encoding, proteins involved in polyamine (GlnA2/SCO2241, GlnA3/SCO6962, GlnA4/SCO1613) or protein (Pup/SCO1646) degradation, for the global regulator DasR/SCO5231 that controls negatively the degradation of N acetylglucosamine, a constituant of peptidoglycan, or for two proteins involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism, GlnE/SCO2234 and GlnK/SCO5584, had a higher triacylglycerol content than the original strain whereas 5 of these strains (with the exception of glnA2 and pup mutant strains) had a lower cardiolipin content than the original strain. Furthermore, the determination of the level of production of the blue polyketide, actinorhodin (ACT), of these 7 strains grown either in phosphate (Pi) limitation or proficiency, revealed that ACT production was totally abolished in the dasR mutant in both Pi conditions whereas the deletion of pup, glnA2, glnA3 and glnA4 was correlated with a significant increase of total ACT production, in Pi limitation. However, in Pi proficiency, ACT production was only slightly enhanced in the pup, glnA2 and glnA4 mutants and was strongly reduced in the glnA3 mutant. Altogether our data suggest that high TAG and ACT biosynthesis and low cardiolipin biosynthesis might all contribute to the lowering of oxidative stress resulting from nitrogen limitation or from other causes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6db891f4ea43248a56a81417ace6f91efff080c3f26732215460d6219890c21b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
