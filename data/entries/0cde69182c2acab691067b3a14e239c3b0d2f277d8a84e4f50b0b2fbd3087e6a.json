{"title":"Research Review on Synthesis of Biowaste Graphene Quantum Dots for Supercapacitor Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1363/v1","date":1716276016000,"content":"This research review explores the synthesis of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) from biowaste for supercapacitor applications, driven by the need for sustainable and efficient energy storage technologies. GQDs, with their unique properties like high surface area and excellent conductivity, hold promise for enhancing supercapacitor performance. Various synthesis methods, including hydrothermal/solvothermal processes, chemical exfoliation, carbonization/pyrolysis, and microwave-assisted synthesis, are discussed alongside characterization techniques to evaluate GQD properties. Biowaste-derived GQDs demonstrate significant potential by improving specific capacitance and cycling stability in supercapacitor electrodes. Challenges such as scalability and material purity are identified, with future directions focusing on enhancing energy density, cycle life, and cost-effectiveness to propel the adoption of biowaste-derived GQDs in commercial energy storage applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cde69182c2acab691067b3a14e239c3b0d2f277d8a84e4f50b0b2fbd3087e6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
