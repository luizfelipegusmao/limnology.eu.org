{"title":"Propensity-Matched Comparison of Percutaneous Versus Surgical Access for Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0452/v1","date":1723083455000,"content":"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a proven treatment for severe aortic stenosis (AS). Transfemoral access is the most prevalent method, achieved either surgically or percutaneously. This study compares in-hospital outcomes and length of stay between surgical cut-down and fully percutaneous approaches. Methods: This retrospective, propensity-matched study analyzed medical records of all patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR at our center from January 2019 to December 2023. Outcomes were assessed based on Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) consensus criteria. Results: 251 TAVR patients (77 propensity score matching pairs) were included (55% female) with a median (IQR) age of 80 (11) years. Surgical cut-down showed fewer vascular complications, bleeding, and transfusions. No death, stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), or need for pacemaker was reported in this group. Fewer mean hospitali-zation days were observed in the total cohort over the years (p&lt; 0.001). This reduction was more pronounced after 2021 when the surgical approach was adopted. Mean hospitalization days were 6.40 ±6.46 for percutaneous and 4.34 ±1.61 for surgical groups (p&lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Surgical cut-down for TAVR femoral access yields superior outcomes and shorter hospital stays compared to fully percutaneous methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ed8c0a3a05830621a5b33e71a3876a0d6b731ddf0a666d522e21d42241871c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
