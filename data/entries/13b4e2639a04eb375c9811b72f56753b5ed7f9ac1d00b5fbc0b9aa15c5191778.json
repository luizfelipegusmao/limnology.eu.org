However, unlike a conventional insulator, these energy bands are “twisted”, and as a result when transitioning to a normal insulator – these energy bands need to become “untwisted.” As a result, the interface between a topological and a conventional insulator becomes conducting as the conducting and insulating bands overlap. Since air or even vacuum are conventional insulators – the surface of a topological insulator is conducting, while the bulk of the material remains an insulator. Additionally, since the twisted energy bands are a global property of the material, this surface conducting state is insensitive to surface defects and inhomogeneities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"13b4e2639a04eb375c9811b72f56753b5ed7f9ac1d00b5fbc0b9aa15c5191778","category":"Environment"}
