{"title":"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Nivolumab in Metastatic Lung Cancer Among Patients Aged 65 and Older","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0812/v1","date":1725966741000,"content":"Background: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, predo-minantly affecting older individuals. Despite the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like nivolumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the efficacy and safety in elderly pa-tients, particularly those aged 65 and above, remain underexplored due to their underrepresenta-tion in clinical trials. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from 60 elderly patients (â‰¥65 years) with metastatic NSCLC who received nivolumab as second-line or later therapy between January 2020 and May 2023.  Results: The median age was 67 years, with a predominance of males (78%). Nivolumab was administered for a median of 8 cycles, with 33.3% of patients recei-ving 15 or more cycles. The median OS was 23 months, and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 93.3%, 54.1%, and 18.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified adenocarcinoma histology, fewer than 15 cycles of nivolumab, and non-response to prior therapies as independent predictors of poor OS. Nivolumab treatment was generally well-tolerated, with 45% of patients experiencing at least grade 1 toxicity.  Conclusion: Nivolumab is effective and well-tolerated in elderly patients with metastatic NSCLC, providing survival benefits comparable to those observed in younger populations. The number of treatment cycles and initial response to therapy are key determinants of survival, underscoring the importance of continued treatment in this age group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02f99fcaef09583b0129c954784a8f1fe46423b80f5c1f8c9487512a8a6126ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
