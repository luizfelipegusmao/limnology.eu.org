{"title":"A Channel State Information and Geomagnetic Fused Fingerprint Localization Algorithm Based on Multi-Input CNN","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202306.0882/v2","date":1726567306000,"content":"With the urgent need of precise positioning faced by internet of things (IoT) applications, the universality and cost of indoor positioning devices become key factors. Since the 5G network has been widely deployed, new opportunity is brought by tightly fusing the traditional low-cost sensors, i.e., the magnetometer. In this study, using 5G channel state information (CSI) and geomagnetic data, a multi-input convolutional neural network (CNN) localization system was proposed. First, to generate a data tensor that is easy for CNN processing, the raw data was reconstructed individually. Then, to comprehensively incorporate the features of 5G CSI and geomagnetic strength data, the ReLU function was chosen as the activation function of the convolutional layer. After that, a multi-input CNN was trained using the incorporated geomagnetic strength and CSI amplitude in the off-line side, and the trained CNN was recorded as a location fingerprint, which can be used for the user position prediction. Finally, in the online side and using a multi-input CNN, the 2-D coordinates are estimated and tested indoors in a typical conference room scenario. The results showed that longer sampling time of fingerprint data result in better uniqueness of the reference point, while the data collection time of locating points does not need to be long. Taking the positioning efficiency and accuracy into consideration, a sampling time of 3s at the reference point and 0.2s at the locating point are recommended. The positioning accuracy using the proposed method was 1.41 m, with an improvement of 22.9% compared with the 5G positioning, and an improvement of 18.0% compared with the 5G and geomagnetic fusing positioning using single CNN.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1660785683ab787ef49d60086d15d7187485d485313790631c4bf3f8445ba99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
