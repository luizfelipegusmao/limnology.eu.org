{"title":"Arabidopsis G-protein β subunit AGB1 represses abscisic acid signaling via attenuation of the MPK3–VIP1 phosphorylation cascade","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1615/7439670?rss=1","date":1700438400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Heterotrimeric G proteins play key roles in cellular processes. Although phenotypic analyses of Arabidopsis Gβ (<span>AGB1</span>) mutants have implicated G proteins in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, the AGB1-mediated modules involved in ABA responses remain unclear. We found that a partial AGB1 protein was localized to the nucleus where it interacted with ABA-activated VirE2-interacting protein 1 (VIP1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MPK3). AGB1 acts as an upstream negative regulator of VIP1 activity by initiating responses to ABA and drought stress, and VIP1 regulates the ABA signaling pathway in an MPK3-dependent manner in Arabidopsis. AGB1 outcompeted VIP1 for interaction with the C-terminus of MPK3, and prevented phosphorylation of VIP1 by MPK3. Importantly, ABA treatment reduced <span>AGB1</span> expression in the wild type, but increased in <span>vip1</span> and <span>mpk3</span> mutants. VIP1 associates with ABA response elements present in the <span>AGB1</span> promoter, forming a negative feedback regulatory loop. Thus, our study defines a new mechanism for fine-tuning ABA signaling through the interplay between AGB1 and MPK3–VIP1. Furthermore, it suggests a common G protein mechanism to receive and transduce signals from the external environment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"c7193ba0bc5573731df9913518390cafff0b1340ddc8116866e19b17edf01fdf","category":"Environment"}
