{"title":"Novel combinatorial approach: Harnessing HIV protease inhibitors to enhance amphotericin B’s antifungal efficacy in cryptococcosis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308216","date":1722520800000,"content":"<p>by Nour M. Alkashef, Mohamed N. Seleem</p>\r\n\r\nCryptococcosis is a fungal infection that is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, particularly among individuals with compromised immune systems, such as HIV patients. Amphotericin B (AmB) is the first-line treatment mainly combined with flucytosine. The scarcity and the prohibitive cost of this regimen urge the use of fluconazole as an alternative, leading to increased rates of treatment failure and relapses. Therefore, there is a critical need for efficient and cost-effective therapy to enhance the efficacy of AmB. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) to synergize the activity of AmB in the treatment of cryptococcosis. Five PIs (ritonavir, atazanavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, and nelfinavir) were found to synergistically potentiate the killing activity of AmB against <i>Cryptococcus</i> strains with ƩFICI ranging between 0.09 and 0.5 against 20 clinical isolates. This synergistic activity was further confirmed in a time-kill assay, where different AmB/PIs combinations exhibited fungicidal activity within 24 hrs. Additionally, PIs in combination with AmB exhibited an extended post-antifungal effect on treated cryptococcal cells for approximately 10 hrs compared to 4 hours with AmB alone. This promising activity against cryptococcal cells did not exhibit increased cytotoxicity towards treated kidney cells, ruling out the risk of drug combination-induced nephrotoxicity. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of AmB/PIs combinations in the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model of cryptococcosis, where these combinations significantly reduced the fungal burden of the treated nematodes by approximately 2.44 Log10 CFU (92.4%) compared to the untreated worms and 1.40 Log10 ((39.4%) compared to AmB alone. The cost-effectiveness and accessibility of PIs in resource-limited geographical areas compared to other antifungal agents, such as flucytosine, make them an appealing choice for combination therapy.","author":"Nour M.
