{"title":"Shaping scientists: How faculty values influence graduate student recruitment and diversity, equity, and inclusion","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/6/369/7698192?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Recruitment is central to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within higher education, but how faculty recruit their graduate students and consider DEI in this context remains unknown. We surveyed environmental science faculty across the United States, aiming to better understand what faculty value when recruiting, as well as when, how, and why they consider DEI. We show that faculty valued applicant character traits highest, followed by soft skills and relevant technical experience. DEI-related criteria were of low to medium importance and were generally rated lower by faculty who were White, male, and at R1 institutions, although there were nuances related to applicant degree (MS versus PhD), whether we were asking about the applicant’s commitment to DEI or their demographic identity, and the stage of the recruitment process. We identified opportunities for more inclusive graduate recruitment, including higher pay, more objective evaluation strategies, and a need for institutions to incentivize productivity without undermining the faculty’s ability to attract diverse graduate students.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"fe5d03f8d7f16a0715618db5dc3e93a384ac93ba9d3580873f197906d091a78d","category":"Environment"}
