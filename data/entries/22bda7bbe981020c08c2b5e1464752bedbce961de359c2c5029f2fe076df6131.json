{"title":"Hidden species diversity in the Enteromius Cope, 1867 (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) from the Aruwimi basin (Middle Congo) in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Democratic Republic of the Congo)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15883?af=R","date":1728282876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Two new African minnow species, <i>Enteromius cerinus</i> sp. nov. and <i>Enteromius ruforum</i> sp. nov., are described for science from the Angadiko River, a left-bank sub-affluent of first order of the Nepoko River, draining the north-eastern part of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (OWR). Both new species belong to the group of <i>Enteromius</i> for which the last unbranched dorsal-fin ray is flexible and underrated. Within this morphological group, both are most similar to <i>Enteromius kamolondoensis</i>, especially in life colour pattern characteristics. However, <i>Enteromius cerinus</i> sp. nov. differs from <i>E. kamolondoensis</i> by its low number of circumpeduncular scales, 10–11 (vs. 12), low maximum body depth, 22.8%–25.7% standard length (<i>L</i>\n<sub>s</sub>) (vs. 26.1%–30.0%), and long anterior and posterior barbel lengths, 32.6%–35.3% head length (<i>L</i>\n<sub>H</sub>) (vs. 23.6%–27.2%) and 41.6%–43.9% <i>L</i>\n<sub>H</sub> (vs. 30.3%–34.9%), respectively. Further, <i>E. ruforum</i> sp. nov. is also easily distinguished from <i>E. kamolondoensis</i> by its high maximum body depth, 30.6%–33.3% <i>L</i>\n<sub>s</sub> (vs. 26.1%–30.0%), and small, isometric, eye diameter, 26.2%–28.0% <i>L</i>\n<sub>H</sub> (vs. 29.1%–31.9%). A barcoding study (mtDNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit I [<i>COI</i>]) revealed that specimens of both new species form lineages well differentiated from those of other available species. As such, (i) <i>E. cerinus</i> sp. nov. diverges from <i>E. kamolondoensis</i> by a K2P genetic distance (GD) of 10.3% and (ii) <i>E. ruforum</i> sp. nov. by a K2P GD of 11.2%. To the present day, the fish fauna of the left-bank sub-affluents of the Nepoko River, in general, remains poorly known or undocumented. Unfortunately, at the same time, multiple anthropogenic impacts are affecting this fauna, such as (i) the destruction of habitats along the river banks for agriculture and fishing and (ii) the use of illegal fishing practices, such as fishing with plant-based ichthyotoxins during ecopage, which is combined with dam building. As a result of the demographic growth, this ecopage results in overfishing and thus is threatening both new species in particular, but all other co-occurring fish species as well. Both new species, <i>E. cerinus</i> sp. nov. and <i>E. ruforum</i> sp. nov., should thus be considered Vulnerable (VU) according to IUCN criterion D2. It is therefore hoped that their discovery highlights the urgent need for a better protection and further in situ exploration of the reserve's freshwater (fish) biodiversity, in general, and that of those small sub-affluents, in particular.</p>","author":"Wilson Mayo Ilodiri, \nCharlotte E.
