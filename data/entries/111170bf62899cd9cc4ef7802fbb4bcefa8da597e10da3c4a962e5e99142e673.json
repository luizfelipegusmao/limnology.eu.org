{"title":"Parrots in the wild in Polish cities","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304484","date":1718892000000,"content":"<p>by Agnieszka Ważna, Mateusz Ciepliński, Weronika Ratajczak, Jacek Bojarski, Jan Cichocki</p>\r\n\r\nAmateur breeding of parrots as pets has contributed to many species being found in areas where they never occurred in the wild, particularly in warmer regions, but also in the temperate climates of North America and Europe. Climate change is likely to exacerbate this process. We hypothesised that parrots occurred in the wild in the cities of Poland, especially the rose-ringed parakeet, as there are reports of breeding sites in the literature. Using information on lost, found and sighted parrots posted on social media, we have analysed the extent of parrot emergence in Poland. In a period of less than two years (from October 2018, through 2019 and from June to the end of December 2021), 2,675 parrot specimens of 49 species were found in the wild. The most frequently observed species were cockatiel <i>Nymphicus hollandicus</i> (N = 962), budgerigar <i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i> (N = 884) and rose-ringed parakeet <i>Psittacula krameri</i> (N = 182). Parrots were most frequently observed in urban areas, in regions characterized by a higher population size, a higher income and a higher proportion of people with a university degree. Our study shows that the occurrence of parrots, especially rose-ringed parakeets in the wild, needs to be monitored as new breeding sites may appear.","author":"Agnieszka Ważna","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"111170bf62899cd9cc4ef7802fbb4bcefa8da597e10da3c4a962e5e99142e673","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
