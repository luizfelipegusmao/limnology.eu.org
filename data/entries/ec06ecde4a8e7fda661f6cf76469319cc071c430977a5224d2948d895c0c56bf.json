{"title":"Detection of Mesothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition-Derived Carcinoma-Associated Fibroblasts in Primary Ovarian Carcinomas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2094/v1","date":1717135816000,"content":": Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are highly accumulated in the tumor surrounding stroma of primary epithelial ovarian cancer (OC). CAFs exert important functions for the vascularization, growth and progression of ovarian tumor cells. However, no attention has been shown to their origin so far. It has been mainly assumed that CAFs in primary OC arise from the activation of resident fibroblasts. Here, we compare CAFs with ovarian location to CAFs found in peritoneal implants from patients with advanced OC. Our findings show that CAFs from primary tumors and peritoneal metastases share the expression of mesothelial-related markers. Therefore, as in peritoneal carcinomatosis, CAFs in primary ovarian carcinomas could be originated via a mesothelia-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) process. The detection of mesothelial-derived CAFs in tumors confined to the ovary and associated biomarkers could be the key to early detection of peritoneal spread in affected patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec06ecde4a8e7fda661f6cf76469319cc071c430977a5224d2948d895c0c56bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
