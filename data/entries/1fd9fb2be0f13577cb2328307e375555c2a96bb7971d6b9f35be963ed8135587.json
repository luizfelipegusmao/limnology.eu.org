In this paper, we propose a multi-scale UAV aerial image detection method based on adaptive feature fusion for solving the problem of detecting small target objects in UAV aerial images. This method automatically adjusts the convolution kernel receptive field and reduces the redundant background of the image by adding an adaptive feature extraction module (AFEM) to the backbone network. This enables it to obtain more accurately and effectively small target feature information. In addition, we design an adaptive feature weighted fusion network (SBiFPN) to effectively enhance the representation of shallow feature information of small targets. Finally, we add an additional small target detection scale to the original network to expand the receptive field of the network and strengthen the detection of small target objects. The training and testing are carried out on the VisDrone public dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 38.5% mAP, which is 2.0% higher than the baseline network YOLOv5s, and can still detect the UAV aerial image well in complex scenes.","author":"Siqi Tan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1fd9fb2be0f13577cb2328307e375555c2a96bb7971d6b9f35be963ed8135587","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
