{"title":"AI Use in the Diagnosis of Mammography for Metachronous Contralateral Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2456/v1","date":1722408661000,"content":"Background: Although several studies have been conducted on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mammography (MG), research focusing on the diagnosis of metachronous bilateral breast cancer (BC), which is typically more challenging to diagnose, remains limited. This study assessed whether AI could enhance the detection of BC, achieving earlier or more accurate diagnoses than radiologists in cases of metachronous contralateral BC. Methods: The study included patients who underwent unilateral BC surgery and subsequently developed contralateral BC during follow-up. We evaluated the capability of the AI-supported MG diagnostic system FxMammoâ„¢ (FathomX Pte Ltd, Singapore) to diagnose BC more accurately or earlier than radiologists' assessments. This evaluation was supplemented by reviewing MG readings by radiologists. Results: Out of 1,101 patients who underwent surgery, 10 patients who had initially received a partial mastectomy and later developed contralateral BC were analyzed. The AI system identified malignancies in 6 cases (60%), while radiologists identified 5 cases (50%). Notably, two cases (20%) were diagnosed solely by the AI system. Additionally, for these cases, the AI system had identified malignancies a year prior to the conventional diagnosis. Conclusions: This study highlights the AI system's effectiveness in diagnosing metachronous contralateral BC via MG. In some cases, the AI system consistently diagnosed cancer at earlier than radiological assessments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dfa0a2660d7837fefd4f66855420c3c55ff3a36aeca55951b2ab4529ca25c8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
