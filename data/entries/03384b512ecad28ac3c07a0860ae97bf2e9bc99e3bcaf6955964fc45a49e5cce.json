The male gametes, also called sperm cells, will subsequently fertilize the female gametes, the egg cell and central cell, which is followed by embryogenesis (<a href=\"#kiae247-B3\">Hafidh and Honys 2021</a>). One of the essential processes for sexual reproduction is meiosis, 1 round of DNA replication followed by 2 rounds of chromosome segregation. Fundamental during meiosis is the exchange of genetic information, which occurs through meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes (homologs). In addition, the formation of at least 1 crossover, the product of meiotic recombination, between the homologs is required for proper chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#kiae247-B12\">Zickler and Kleckner 2023</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"03384b512ecad28ac3c07a0860ae97bf2e9bc99e3bcaf6955964fc45a49e5cce","category":"Environment"}
