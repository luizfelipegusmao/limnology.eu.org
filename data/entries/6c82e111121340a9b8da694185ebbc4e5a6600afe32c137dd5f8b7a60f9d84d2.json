Now we have passed the two-year anniversary of the new-look iMac, we’re hoping Apple will update it sometime in 2023 with a new chip – which would be fitting with this year marking 25 since Apple introduced the original G3 iMac – but the wait could be even longer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is well into the launch of the second generation of Apple silicon, with the M2 arriving in June 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1483233/m2-pro-vs-m2-max-cpu-gpu-memory-performance.html\">M2 Pro and M2 Max</a> coming in January 2023, and the M2 Ultra arriving in June. That makes the 24-inch iMac one of the few remaining M1 Macs. Can we expect Apple to introduce an M2 variant of the iMac soon? Read on to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Update July 18: There could be an M3 iMac by the end 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New 24-inch iMac: Release date </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per a June 2023 newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman believes that Apple is preparing two new 24-inch iMacs for release in late 2023 or early 2024. Gurman indicates that a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">replacement for the iMac Pro</a> is also in the works and that it will have a 30-inch display, however, this larger iMac probably won’t arrive until much later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple introduced the M2 chip in the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro over a year ago in the summer of 2022, so it makes sense that Apple will soon update the iMac with an M2 chip.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, rumors suggest that Apple will skip the M2 and move straight to the M3 for the next iMac. It’s the decision to move straight to the M3 chips that is causing the delay. The M3 isn’t expected until late 2023 or early 2024 due to manufacturing delays. A 2024 date looks more likely based on reports that the A17 chip being used in the 2023 iPhone 15 is taking precedence over the M3, both of which will use the new 3nm chip-making process. Chip manufacturer TSMC is unable to meet Apple’s demand “due to yield issues”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could be waiting until 2024 for the new iMac. But there is a possibility of an October 2023 launch. In a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-05/when-is-apple-aapl-releasing-new-mac-pro-15-inch-macbook-air-new-imac-m3-levgn4yc&amp;xcust=1-1-1484743-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">March 2023 newsletter</a>, Gurman claimed that the new M3-powered Macs were “at an advanced stage of development”. At that time he suggested that the iMac was “not expected to go into mass production for at least three months” and indicated that it “won’t ship until the second half of the year at the earliest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By July 2023 Gurman seemed a little more confident. In a newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1996129/m3-imac-macbook-air-pro-launch-2023-fall-event.html\">Gurman indicated that Apple will launch an M3 iMac</a>, as well as an M3 MacBook Pro and MacBook Air in the fall of 2023. The unveiling would happen at a second <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple event</a> in October, following the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">release of the iPhone 15</a> in September. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New 24-inch iMac: Price </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple introduced new pricing for iMac in 2021, with the entry-level model costing $1,299. If Apple was to keep on an M1 iMac it could sell an iMac for less than $1,000. If it does that the starting price of the M3-powered range could actually increase, although, unless there’s a significant redesign like the MacBook Air–which isn’t anticipated–we expect the next model to cost the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple added the M2 Pro and M2 Max processors to MacBook Pro and Mac mini in January 2023, it also bumped pricing for the existing iMacs in countries outside the U.S. For example, in the U.K., each iMac model <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1358386/apple-ripping-off-rest-of-world-high-prices.html\">now costs £150 more</a> even though it hasn’t been updated.  Since Apple has adjusted prices in line with exchange rate fluctuations we don’t expect the pricing to increase again.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3810227/oferta-previa-black-friday_imac-24.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iMac Pink\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>New 24-inch iMac: Design </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple introduced the new look iMac in 2021, it ramped up the all-in-one design with a collection of duo-color options and a larger 24-inch screen that was even thinner than before at 11.5mm (0.45 inches). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are features we’d like to see, such as a height-adjustable stand and smaller chin, we don’t expect much to change about the design, with the possible exception of new color options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his March 5 newsletter, Gurman suggested that little will change for the outward design of the iMac. He stated that it will be the same screen size and the same colors as it is currently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Gurman did suggest that there will be design-related changes on the inside with some “internal components relocated and redesigned…” he also revealed that “the manufacturing process for attaching the iMac’s stand is different,” according to his information. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New 24-inch iMac: Display </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24-inch iMac has a 4.5K Retina display with 500 nits of brightness, anti‑reflective coating, and True Tone. Even though the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros introduced a better screen with miniLED and ProMotion technology, we doubt the iMac display will change much with the second generation. We’d love to see ProMotion to the iMac, but as more of a high-end feature, we’ll likely have to wait for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">larger iMac or iMac Pro</a>, if it ever materializes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are reports that a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">new iMac with a larger display</a> could be coming in the future. That mark the return of the 27-inch iMac, but it could offer a 30-inch, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1986404/apple-giant-32-inch-imac-testing.html\">32-inch</a>, or even a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1795989/oled-display-ipad-macbook-32-42-inch-imac.html\">42-inch iMac</a>, according to predictions from David Hsieh of Omdia. Hsieh believes we could be waiting until 2027 for this 42-inch model though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How about a projector instead of a display?  A patent has been granted to Apple describing an i<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1793199/a-future-imac-may-be-able-to-use-your-wall-as-a-second-display.html\">Mac with a built-in projector</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may see a slight increase in screen size if Apple puts the FaceTime camera into a notch, as it has with the MacBooks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New 24-inch iMac: Processor and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman has repeatedly claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1433162/macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-m3-processor.html\">Apple will bypass the M2 and move straight to the M3 </a>chip for the next generation of the 24-inch iMac. Rumors claim that the new chips will be built using a new 3nm manufacturing process that will improve performance and power efficiency. By skipping a generation, the next iMac will represent a significant bump over the current model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what the current M1 and M2 chips offer. Based on the specs of the existing chips, and information based on what is suspected to be an M3 Pro spotted in testing, we can predict what can be expected from the M3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 offers an 8-core CPU and up to 8-core GPU and up to 16GB RAM. The M1 Pro offered up to 10‑core CPU, up to 16‑core GPU, and up to 32GB RAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 offers an 8-core CPU and up to 10-core GPU and up to 24GB RAM. The M2 Pro offers 10-core or 12‑core CPU, up to 19‑core GPU, and up to 32GB RAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1916549/apple-silicon-m3-pro-max-processor-mac-sales.html\">M3 Pro has been spotted in testing</a>, via Mark Gurman, is said to offer a 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU and 36GB RAM (up from 32GB). Based on this we can assume that the M3 could offer up to 12-core CPU, 12-core GPU and max out at more than 24GB RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iMac includes a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, but Apple has since introduced the 12MP Ultra Wide camera with 122-degree field of view in the Studio Display. That’s likely to make its way into the new iMac along with Center Stage, the feature that keeps you centered as you move. Apple has taken criticism for the quality of the Studio Display camera, so we assume it will correct those issues with the M3 chip’s image signal processor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New 24-inch iMac: Ports </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry level iMac comes with two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack built into the side, while the higher-end models have two additional USB 3 ports. There’s also a Gigabit ethernet jack built into the power adapter on the higher end models, which costs an extra $30 on the entry levle model. With such a thin frame, it’s unlikely that we’ll get HDMI or an SDXC card slot like on the MacBook Pros and Mac Studio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest Macs all offer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, which we expect to arrive in the iMac. On the audio side, the iMac already has a six-speaker sound system that supports spatial audio, so we don’t expect an upgrade there, though it could gain dynamic head tracking when using AirPods (3rd generation), AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max.</p>\n\niMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6c82e111121340a9b8da694185ebbc4e5a6600afe32c137dd5f8b7a60f9d84d2","category":"Apple"}
