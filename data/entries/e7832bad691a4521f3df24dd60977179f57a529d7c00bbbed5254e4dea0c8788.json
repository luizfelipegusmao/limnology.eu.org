Islets were isolated for whole transcriptome sequencing to identify differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, miRNAs, IncRNAs, and circRNAs. Regulatory networks involving miRNA–mRNA, lncRNA–mRNA, and lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA were constructed and functions were assessed through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses.</p> Results <p>Despite compensatory hyperinsulinemia and a significant increase in β-cell mass with a slow rate of proliferation, HFD mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance. In isolated islets, insulin secretion in response to glucose and palmitic acid deteriorated after 24 weeks of HFD. Whole transcriptomic sequencing identified a total of 1324 DE mRNAs, 14 DE miRNAs, 179 DE lncRNAs, and 680 DE circRNAs. Our transcriptomic dataset unveiled several core regulatory axes involved in the impaired insulin secretion in HFD mice, such as miR-6948-5p/<i>Cacna1c</i>, miR-6964-3p/<i>Cacna1b</i>, miR-3572-5p/<i>Hk2</i>, miR-3572-5p/<i>Cckar</i> and miR-677-5p/<i>Camk2d</i>. Additionally, proliferative and apoptotic targets, including miR-216a-3p/<i>FKBP5</i>, miR-670-3p/<i>Foxo3</i>, miR-677-5p/<i>RIPK1</i>, miR-802-3p/<i>Smad2</i> and ENSMUST00000176781/<i>Caspase9</i> possibly contribute to the increased β-cell mass in HFD islets. Furthermore, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) regulatory network involving 7 DE miRNAs, 15 DE lncRNAs and 38 DE mRNAs might also participate in the development of HFD-induced diabetes.</p> Conclusions <p>The comprehensive whole transcriptomic sequencing revealed novel non-coding RNA-mRNA regulatory networks associated with impaired insulin secretion and increased β-cell mass in obesity-related diabetes.</p>","author":"Jinfang Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e7832bad691a4521f3df24dd60977179f57a529d7c00bbbed5254e4dea0c8788","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
