{"title":"Possible Influence of Cortical Neuronal Circuits on Each Other: A Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1224/v1","date":1716201451000,"content":"The interaction between electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and biological systems has been a subject of intense research and debate. This study explores the potential influence of magnetic fields on neural circuits, which are the building blocks of the human brain. By developing a mathematical model and conducting computational simulations, we investigate how magnetic fields can affect the transmission of electrical signals within neural circuits. The results suggest that magnetic fields can alter the speed and direction of signal propagation, offering potential applications in medical treatments and brain-machine interfaces. However, the study also highlights the need for more comprehensive models that consider the complexity of real-world neural circuits and the multifaceted nature of magnetic fields. The interaction between EMFs and neural circuits is a rich and complex subject that requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining physics, biology, mathematics, and computer science. While this study provides valuable insights, further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this interaction and to realize its potential applications in medicine, neuroscience, and technology. The findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge that bridges the gap between physics and neuroscience, opening new horizons for understanding the human mind and its connection to the physical world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1ec270ae23b29415bb480d7e46f655a8ed51ac5b2f6fec0d67be37456fc9f45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
