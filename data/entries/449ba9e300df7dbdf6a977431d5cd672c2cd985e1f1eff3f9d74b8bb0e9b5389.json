{"title":"Applications of Synthetic Pentatricopeptide Repeat Proteins","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/503/7456307?rss=1","date":1701302400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>RNA-binding proteins play integral roles in the regulation of essential processes in cells and as such are attractive targets for engineering to manipulate gene expression at the RNA level. Expression of transcripts in chloroplasts and mitochondria is heavily regulated by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. The diverse roles of PPR proteins and their naturally modular architecture make them ideal candidates for engineering. Synthetic PPR proteins are showing great potential to become valuable tools for controlling the expression of plastid and mitochondrial transcripts. In this review, by ‘synthetic’, we mean both rationally modified natural PPR proteins and completely novel proteins designed using the principles learned from their natural counterparts. We focus on the many different applications of synthetic PPR proteins, covering both their use in basic research to learn more about protein–RNA interactions and their use to achieve specific outcomes in RNA processing and the control of gene expression. We describe the challenges associated with the design, construction and deployment of synthetic PPR proteins and provide perspectives on how they might be assembled and used in future biotechnology applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"449ba9e300df7dbdf6a977431d5cd672c2cd985e1f1eff3f9d74b8bb0e9b5389","category":"Environment"}
