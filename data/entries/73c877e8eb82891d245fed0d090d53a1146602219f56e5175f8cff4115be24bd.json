{"title":"Bio-Inspired Energy Efficient Cluster-based Routing Protocol for IoT in Disaster Scenarios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0341/v1","date":1720045206000,"content":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising technology for sensing and monitoring the environment to reduce disaster impact. Energy is one of the major concerns for IoT devices, as sensors used in IoT devices are battery-operated. Thus, it is important to reduce energy consumption, especially during data transmission in disaster-adverse situations. Clustering-based communication helps reduce a node’s energy decay during data transmission and enhances the network’s lifetime. Many hybrid combination algorithms are proposed for clustering and the routing protocol to improve the network lifetime in disaster scenarios. However, the performance of these protocols is widely varied based on the underlying network configuration and the optimisation parameters considered. In this research, we have used the clustering parameters that are most relevant to disaster scenarios, such as the node’s residual energy, distance to sink, and network coverage. Then, we proposed a bio-inspired hybrid (BAO-PSO) algorithm where the Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm (BOA) is used for clustering and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is used for the routing protocol. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the benchmark protocols LEACH, DEEC, PSO, PSO-GA, and PSO-HAS. Residual energy, network throughput, and network lifetime are considered performance matrices. The simulation result showed that the proposed algorithm increases network lifetime by 10%-20% by comparison with the benchmark algorithm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73c877e8eb82891d245fed0d090d53a1146602219f56e5175f8cff4115be24bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
