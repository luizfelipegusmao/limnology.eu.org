{"title":"Between Populism and Emotion: How Social Media Shapes Youth Politics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1652/v1","date":1729595208000,"content":"Is the existence of populist sentiments linked to greater affective polarization? Is there a relationship between these two factors (populist sentiments and affective polarization) and the endorsement of far-right ideologies? Are there differences in the types of media prioritized by individuals with varying levels of affective polarization? This exploratory study, conducted in the context of the early legislative elections in Portugal in April 2024, analyzes data from a sample of 130 first-time young voters. It suggests an association between the defense of far-right arguments, the possession of populist sentiments, and levels of affective polarization. The study also found variations in affective polarization among young people who prioritized different types of social media to inform themselves on political issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"541b72691023aaec2471705249f021b827d5b1b6beb91858442d02d045a6f05e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
