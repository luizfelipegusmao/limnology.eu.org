This CO molecule serves as a molecular probe, enabling the direct probing of atomic/subatomic features of the specimen in real space. As of now, CO tip AFM has achieved numerous accomplishments, such as imaging complex molecular [<a href=\"#ozae044.812-B1\">1</a>] and surface structures [<a href=\"#ozae044.812-B2\">2</a>], distinguishing bond orders [<a href=\"#ozae044.812-B3\">3</a>], and identifying different functional groups [<a href=\"#ozae044.812-B4\">4</a>] or atomic species [<a href=\"#ozae044.812-B5\">5</a>]. Our recent work has also achieved the controlled manipulation of a single chemical bond [<a href=\"#ozae044.812-B6\">6</a>] and the direct observation of electron orbital signatures [<a href=\"#ozae044.812-B7\">7</a>]. Despite the significant achievements of CO tip AFM, a fundamental question remains unresolved â€“ determining the absolute height between the CO tip and the sample during imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6c1694ef5252cbcc867639bcb98fe6d3308d682db94737d1853bbd0d6ccd74ba","category":"Environment"}
