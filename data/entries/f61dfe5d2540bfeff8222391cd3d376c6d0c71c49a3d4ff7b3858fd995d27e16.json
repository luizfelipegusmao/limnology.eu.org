{"title":"Responses of Soil Enzymes Activities to Sprinkler Irrigation and Differentiated Nitrogen Fertilization in Barley Cultivation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1952/v1","date":1719493351000,"content":"Our study aimed to assess sprinkler irrigation's impact on the activity of selected soil enzymes concerning nitrogen metabolism and oxidation-reduction processes in the soil with different doses of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. The soil Alfisol was sampled from the experimental field of spring barley in the University Research Center in the central part of Poland in the moderate transitory climate during the growing seasons 2015â€“2017. The index resistance (RS) was derived to recognise the resistance enzymes of drought. In the maturity phase, nitrate reductase activity was at an 18% higher level in irrigated soils and the activity of other enzymes was higher in no-irrigated treatments by 25% in dehydrogenase, 22% in peroxydase 33% in catalase and 17% in urease case. The development stage of barley influenced nitrate reductase activity. Enzymatic activity has been changing in the examined years of the research, depending on the weather conditions. During the maturity stage, the soil's lower ammonium nitrogen content resulted from higher spring barley uptake due to drought stress. Irrigation probably contributes to increased leaching of nitrate in soil. The highest index of resilience was presented in the soil catalase activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f61dfe5d2540bfeff8222391cd3d376c6d0c71c49a3d4ff7b3858fd995d27e16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
