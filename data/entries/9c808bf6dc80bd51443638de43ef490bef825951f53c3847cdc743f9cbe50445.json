{"title":"Village Organization and Sustainable Growth of Farmers&#039; Income: An Empirical Study Based on Dynamic Survey Data of Labor Force in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1560/v1","date":1726757319000,"content":"Common prosperity is the core goal of rural revitalization, and sustainable growth of farmers' income is an inevitable requirement. This study uses CLDS2016-2020 village and family level questionnaire data to reveal how the degree of village organization affects the sustainable growth of farmers' income, thus providing reference and decision-making for the local government to promote the increase of farmers' income and narrow the gap from the village level. The results show that the degree of village organization can significantly affect farmers' income, and the analysis results of the degree of formal organization are consistent with them. Specifically, for every 1% increase in the degree of village organization, the per capita household income will increase by 32.4%, among which the wage income will increase by 22.6%, the operational income will increase by 5%, the property income will increase by 0.8%, and the transfer income will increase by 4.2%. The estimation results through instrumental variables are consistent, and the results are robust. At the same time, improving the degree of village organization can also significantly increase the proportion of farmers' non-agricultural income and narrow the income gap among farmers. On the impact of heterogeneity, it is found that the geographical distance between villages and county and township governments, as well as the political identity and education level of farmers will affect the role of the degree of organization. The results of mechanism analysis show that improving the degree of village organization is mainly through promoting the circulation of agricultural land, socialized service of agricultural machinery and industrial and commercial capital to the countryside to increase farmers' income. The research revealed that the modernization of rural governance should be accelerated, and the degree of village organization should be improved, especially the degree of formal organization, so as to build a benign trust and cooperation relationship between the two village committees and the villagers, and implement policies and measures to improve the income of farmers according to local conditions. At the same time, strengthen the publicity and education in party member to improve the proportion of rural party member and the education level of farmers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c808bf6dc80bd51443638de43ef490bef825951f53c3847cdc743f9cbe50445","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
