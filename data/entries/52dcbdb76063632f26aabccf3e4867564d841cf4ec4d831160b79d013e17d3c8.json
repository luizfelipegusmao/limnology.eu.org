{"title":"Application of Artificial Intelligence in Shoulder Pathology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0581/v1","date":1712581504000,"content":"The artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines for imitating and expanding human intelligence. Given the ongoing evolution of the multidisciplinary integration trend in modern medicine, numerous studies have investigated the power of AI to address orthopaedic-specific problems. One particular area of investigation focuses on the shoulder pathology, which is a range of disorders or abnormalities of shoulder joint, causing pain, inflammation, stiffness, weakness, and reduced range of motion. There has not yet been a comprehensive review of the recent advancements in this field. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to evaluate the current AI applications in the shoulder pathology. This review mainly summarizes several crucial stages of the clinical practice, including predictive models and prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, and physical therapy. In addition, the challenges and future development of AI are also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52dcbdb76063632f26aabccf3e4867564d841cf4ec4d831160b79d013e17d3c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
