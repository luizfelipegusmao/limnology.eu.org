{"title":"Key Points in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1977/v4","date":1720511506000,"content":"Our target point within this following steps, is prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is classified structurally,  by its Gleason Score. Phosphatases are implicated in differents cell alterations, including proliferation, differentiation and carcinogenesis.  In specific  life circumstances, proteins are regulators  with implications in  intracellular signaling pathways. Alterations in phosphatases functionality  represent a key point in malignancy development. We try within our description, to focus on an important process refering to  dysregulation of  phosphatase activity.  More than, we will discuss therapeutic key points refering to compounds that inhibits  phosphatase proteins with implications in carcinogenesis. Researchers try to investigate and to conclude on prostate cancer using  also genomic analyses, clinically useful biomarkers and imagistic methods. So finally after folowing describtion steps, purposed aim is to conclude on prostate cancer and different key points abordation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccb258e0f0cc2c919fd201b57a2d3b9569a404f4c90de8042da3e2405c66ea10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
