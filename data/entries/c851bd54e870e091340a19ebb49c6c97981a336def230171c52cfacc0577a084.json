Conventional electromagnetic coil magnetic lenses have existed in condition to commercialize mass production throughout a century of evolution. Despite the crucial role of magnetic lens design in electron optics, the current commercial landscape is characterized by an oligopoly controlled by a few well-known companies [<a href=\"#ozae044.509-B2\">2</a>]. However, several simulation software packages exist [<a href=\"#ozae044.509-B3\">3-7</a>], which allow researchers to model and evaluate potential lens designs rapidly and inexpensively computationally. In this manuscript's scope, numerical simulation software capabilities have been thoroughly utilized.
