{"title":"A Carrier Manifolds Framework for AGI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1164/v1","date":1715938613000,"content":"This paper integrates carrier manifolds from control theory and hybrid systems modeling to develop a novel mathematical framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Carrier manifolds represent the state space of complex AGI systems, while hybrid systems model discrete and continuous dynamics together. The proposed architecture embeds carrier manifold into GPTProX, a hybrid AI solver combining conversational AI, logic programming, and optimization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65c29f79b775034e6ed30f94354889cefce7d174aa3ec1b54d43d25527861f63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
