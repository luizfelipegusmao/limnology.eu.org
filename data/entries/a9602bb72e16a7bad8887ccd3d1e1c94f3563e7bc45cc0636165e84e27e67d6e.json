{"title":"Cell-Free Analysis Reveals the Role of RG/RGG Motifs in DDX3X Phase Separation and Their Potential Link to Cancer Pathogenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0106/v1","date":1714629813000,"content":"The DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X is a multifunctional protein involved in RNA metabolism and stress responses. In this study, we investigated the role of RG/RGG motifs in the dynamic process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of DDX3X using cell-free assays and explored their potential link to cancer development through bioinformatic analysis. Our results demonstrate that the number, location, and composition of RG/RGG motifs significantly influence the ability of DDX3X to undergo phase separation and form self-aggregates. Mutational analysis revealed that the spacing between RG/RGG motifs and the number of glycine residues within each motif are critical factors in determining the extent of phase separation. Bioinformatic analysis of cancer genomic datasets uncovered a significant enrichment of DDX3X mutations in RG/RGG motifs across multiple cancer types, particularly in the N-terminal region of the protein. Furthermore, we found that DDX3X is co-expressed with the stress granule protein G3BP1 in several cancer types and can undergo co-phase separation with G3BP1 in a cell-free system, suggesting a potential functional interaction between these proteins in phase-separated structures. DDX3X and G3BP1 may interact through their RG/RGG domains and subsequently exert important cellular functions under stress situation. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the role of RG/RGG motifs in modulating DDX3X phase separation and their potential contribution to cancer pathogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9602bb72e16a7bad8887ccd3d1e1c94f3563e7bc45cc0636165e84e27e67d6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
