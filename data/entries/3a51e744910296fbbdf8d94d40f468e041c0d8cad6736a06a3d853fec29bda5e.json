{"title":"Effect of Asian Diet on Human Gut Microbiome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1720/v1","date":1727084832000,"content":"The gut microbiome known as the “hidden organ” in humans has received wide attention due to its pivotal role in human health, influencing various physiological functions and metabolic processes. Multiple factors influence the gut microbiome and diet emerging as a prominent determinant. Increasing evidence verifies different dietary patterns modulate gut microbial composition and its functionality. Asia, home to the world's largest population, showcases immense diversity, reflected in its complex dietary patterns influenced by tradition and modernization. A plethora of research evidence proves Asian diet confers beneficial effects on maintaining and improving health through favorable alteration of gut microbiome. Yet up to date, no comprehensive review exists on the influence of the Asian diet on gut microbiome. This review critically examines published data on dietary components from Eastern, Southeastern, Southern, Western and Central Asian diet and their interaction with the human gut microbiome across healthy and diseased states. It identifies strengths and limitations in Asian gut microbiome research. Asia experiences rapid dietary transitions demanding further investigation into their effects on the gut microbiota. However, evidence proves traditional Asian diets hold promise for developing personalized dietary interventions and therapeutics to promote gut health and prevent chronic diseases by modulating gut microbiome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a51e744910296fbbdf8d94d40f468e041c0d8cad6736a06a3d853fec29bda5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
