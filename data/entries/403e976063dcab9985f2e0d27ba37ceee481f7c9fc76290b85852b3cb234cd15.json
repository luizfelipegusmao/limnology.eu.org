{"title":"Anti-Obesity Medication and Household Food Waste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2067/v1","date":1724869228000,"content":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are gaining attention as a potential treatment for obesity. While studies have shown that these medications greatly impact dietary habits, their relationship to consumer food waste is unexplored. We analyzed data from 505 U.S. consumers who self-report GLP-1 medication use and found that 25% agree that they waste more food since beginning the medication with 61% disagreeing with this statement. Respondents are less likely to agree with this statement if they have been on the medication a longer time and more likely to agree if they report experiencing nausea since beginning the medication. Several dietary changes are also significantly associated with self-reported changes in food waste since starting the medication. With previous literature finding GLP-1â€™s significant impact on individual food consumption and dietary choices, our findings suggest that the effects of this novel class of anti-obesity medications may cast a significant impact on food waste patterns. With the potential for widespread adoption of these medications, and given that approximately one-third of food in the United States is wasted by consumers, understanding the interaction of these two consumer trends is critical for projecting their joint impact on the food system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"403e976063dcab9985f2e0d27ba37ceee481f7c9fc76290b85852b3cb234cd15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
