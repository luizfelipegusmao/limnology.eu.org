{"title":"Theranostics of Neuroendocrine Tumors: Bibliometric Study Based on Web of Science Database","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0201/v1","date":1725343524000,"content":"Compared to agonists, radiolabeled somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonists have advantages in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Articles on radiolabeled somatostatin receptor agonists or antagonists in NETs were included by searching the Web of Science (WoS) database. The included literature has been subjected to data collection and bibliometric study. A detailed analysis of the included clinical articles was also performed. 123 publications were identified for biblio-metric analysis. The number of publications on radiolabeled somatostatin receptor agonists and antagonists in the theranostics of NETs has increased significantly after 2014, with Germany publishing the most papers (39), followed by the United States (33) and Switzerland (28). The Swiss paper was cited the most, with 1783 quotations, followed by the USA (1338) and Germany (1330). The most common keywords were NETs (89), Peptide receptor-mediated radionuclide therapy (PRRT) (62), and antagonists (53). Antagonists had lower uptake in normal tissue and higher uptake in tumor tissue compared to agonists, with a high tumor-to-liver ratio. Research on radiolabeled somatostatin receptor agonists and antagonists in theranostics of NETs is increasing, with significant contributions from Europe and the United States. Radiolabeled somatostatin receptor antagonists are likely to be a hot topic in NETs theranostics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65f46cb10fae68a8bd34cb9bf05e669641cae2d1e0cd0fdf8be3a3011c8efc15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
