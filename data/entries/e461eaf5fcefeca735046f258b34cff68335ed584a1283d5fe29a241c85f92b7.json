{"title":"A Dataset of Visible Light and Thermal Infrared Images for Health Monitoring of Caged Laying Hens in Large-scale Farming","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1494/v1","date":1724226246000,"content":"Considering animal welfare, the free-range laying hen farming model is increasingly gaining attention. However, in some countries, large-scale farming still relies on the cage-rearing model, making the focus on the welfare of caged laying hens equally important. To evaluate the health status of caged laying hens, a dataset comprising visible light and thermal infrared images was established for analyses, including morphological, thermographic, comb, and behavioural as-sessments, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the hens' health, behaviour, and population counts. To address the issue of insufficient data samples in the health detection process for indi-vidual and group hens, a dataset named BClayinghens was constructed containing 61,133 images of visible light and thermal infrared images. The BClayinghens dataset was completed using three types of devices: smartphones, visible light cameras, and infrared thermal cameras. All thermal infrared images correspond to visible light images and have achieved positional alignment through coordinate correction. Additionally, the visible light images were annotated with chicken head labels, obtaining 63,693 chicken head labels, which can be directly used for training deep learning models for chicken head object detection and combined with corresponding thermal infrared data to analyze the temperature of the chicken heads. To enable the constructed deep-learning object detection and recognition models to adapt to different breeding environ-ments, various data enhancement methods such as rotation, shearing, colour enhancement, and noise addition were used for image processing. The BClayinghens dataset is important for ap-plying visible light images and corresponding thermal infrared images in the health detection, behavioural analysis, and counting of caged laying hens under large-scale farming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e461eaf5fcefeca735046f258b34cff68335ed584a1283d5fe29a241c85f92b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
