{"title":"Reducing Ammonia Emissions in Polish Agriculture, in the Implementation of the NEC Directive &ndash; Pilot Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0351/v1","date":1720054733000,"content":"One of the important air pollutants is ammonia, which is mainly emitted from the agriculture sector. This sector is responsible for over 81% of global ammonia emissions. The main threat related to ammonia emissions is water eutrophication and soil acidification. The aim of the research was a preliminary assessment of the implementation status of methods for reducing ammonia emissions on farms and to learn the views and awareness of agricultural producers on reducing emissions of pollutants into the air. The research was conducted using a survey questionnaire that was made available to farmers in various ways. Based on the results of pilot surveys, it can be concluded that farmers have general knowledge of environmental protection and generally agree that people have an impact on the state of the environment. Low-emission practices to reduce ammonia emissions from agricultural sources are not widely used. The best situation is regarding reduction practices in the storage of natural fertilizers and the use of low-emission fertilizer application techniques. Some reduction activities are not obligatory, therefore it is difficult to determine the scope of application of these practices. Therefore, such periodic research will allow monitoring the activity of agricultural producers in implementing reduction methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81c994f8c8aa1624e6aef72d318800eb3587b7778c7d631ad5352ac39d361b0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
