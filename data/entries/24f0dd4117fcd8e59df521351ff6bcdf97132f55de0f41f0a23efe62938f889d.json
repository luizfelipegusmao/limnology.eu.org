{"title":"Partial Replacement of Fish Meal with an Aquatic Macrophyte, Ceratophyllum demersum in the Diet of Common Carp, Cyprinus carpio var. communis Fingerlings","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/9925913?af=R","date":1704268800000,"content":"<p>A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the nutrient utilization, growth performance, and hematological indices of <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> var. <i>communis</i> fingerlings fed diets based on aquatic macrophyte, <i>Ceratophyllum demersum</i> as a replacement of fish meal (FM). Six isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets containing graded levels of <i>C. demersum</i> 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, as replacer of FM were formulated. Total of 360 fingerlings with an initial weight of 3.65 ± 0.98 g were randomly stocked in 70 L plastic tanks water volume 60 L connected with a continuous flow-through system (1–1.5 L/min) for each treatment and were run in triplicate having 20 fish in each tank. At the end of the feeding trial, it was observed that the <i>C. carpio</i> var. <i>communis</i> fingerlings receiving 5% and 10% <i>C. demersum</i> in the diet showed improvements in live weight gain (LWG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and protein efficiency rate (PER). While further addition of <i>C. demersum</i> as a replacement of FM from 15% to 25% led to the progressive decline in the values of LWG, SGR, FCR, and PER. Hematological data also exhibited a linear declining trend beyond the 10% <i>C. demersum</i> replacement level. The fish fed with higher inclusions of <i>C. demersum</i> in each diet significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) affected whole body composition with the lowest protein and fat amounts recorded at higher replacement levels significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The highest protein and fat contents were observed at 5% and 10% diets. Except serum glucose, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), the other serum indices exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing inclusion of <i>C. demersum</i> in the diet. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that the inclusion of 10% <i>C. demersum</i> did not affect the growth and other parameters of <i>C. carpio</i> var. <i>communis</i> fingerlings compared to the 50% FM diet. However, it is recommended that 10% FM can be substituted without compromising the growth and nutritional quality of fish.</p>","author":"Imtiaz Ahmed, \nAnzar Lateef, \nKousar Jan, \nYounis Mohd Khan, \nFemi Fawole","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"24f0dd4117fcd8e59df521351ff6bcdf97132f55de0f41f0a23efe62938f889d","category":"Environment"}
