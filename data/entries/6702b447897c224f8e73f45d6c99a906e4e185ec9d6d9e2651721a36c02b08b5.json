{"title":"Advanced image generation for cancer using diffusion models","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae062/7739892?rss=1","date":1724371200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Deep neural networks have significantly advanced the field of medical image analysis, yet their full potential is often limited by relatively small dataset sizes. Generative modeling, particularly through diffusion models, has unlocked remarkable capabilities in synthesizing photorealistic images, thereby broadening the scope of their application in medical imaging. This study specifically investigates the use of diffusion models to generate high-quality brain MRI scans, including those depicting low-grade gliomas, as well as contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) and chest and lung X-ray images. By leveraging the DreamBooth platform, we have successfully trained stable diffusion models utilizing text prompts alongside class and instance images to generate diverse medical images. This approach not only preserves patient anonymity but also substantially mitigates the risk of patient re-identification during data exchange for research purposes. To evaluate the quality of our synthesized images, we used the Fr√©chet inception distance metric, demonstrating high fidelity between the synthesized and real images. Our application of diffusion models effectively captures oncology-specific attributes across different imaging modalities, establishing a robust framework that integrates artificial intelligence in the generation of oncological medical imagery.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"6702b447897c224f8e73f45d6c99a906e4e185ec9d6d9e2651721a36c02b08b5","category":"Environment"}
