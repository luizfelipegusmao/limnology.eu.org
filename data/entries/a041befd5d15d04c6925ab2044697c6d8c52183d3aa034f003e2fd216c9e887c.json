{"title":"Comparing the Efficacy of Manual Therapy and Exercise to Synchronized Telerehabilitation with Self-Manual Therapy and Exercise in Treating Subacromial Pain Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0879/v2","date":1715358036000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise versus synchronized telerehabilitation with self-manual therapy and exercise in treating Subacromial Pain Syndrome (SAPS). Sixty individuals diagnosed with SPS, aged 18-50 years, were randomly assigned to home exercise (HE), manual therapy (MT), and telerehabilitation (TR) groups. Treatment protocols were administered over 8 weeks and included specific exercises and therapy interventions. Out-come measures included Visual Pain Scale (VAS), shoulder range of motion (ROM) via gonio-metric measurements, Quick Disability Arm-Shoulder-Hand Problems Survey (Q-DASH), and patient satisfaction. Results revealed that both MT and TR groups exhibited reduced pain, in-creased ROM, lower Q-DASH scores, and higher patient satisfaction compared to the HE group. However, no significant differences were found between MT and TR groups in pain levels, ROM, Q-DASH scores, or patient satisfaction. The study concludes that both telerehabilitation and manual therapy effectively alleviate pain and are well-received by patients with SPS. Addition-ally, manual therapy demonstrates superiority in enhancing functional levels compared to exer-cise-based interventions.
