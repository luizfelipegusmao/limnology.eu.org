{"title":"Intratumoral Microbiome: Foe or Friend in Reshaping Tumor Microenvironment Landscape?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0399/v1","date":1717722120000,"content":"The role of the microbiome in cancer and its crosstalk with the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been extensively studied and characterized. An emerging field in the cancer microbiome research is the concept of the intratumoral microbiome, which refers to the microbiome residing within the tumor. This microbiome primarily originates from the local microbiome of the tu-mor-bearing tissue or from translocating microbiome from distant sites, such as the gut. Despite the increasing number of studies on intratumoral microbiome, it remains unclear whether it is a driver or a bystander of oncogenesis and tumor progression. This review aims to elucidate the intricate role of the intratumoral microbiome in tumor development by exploring its effects on reshaping the multi-leveled ecosystem in which tumors thrive, the TME. To dissect the complexity and the multitude of layers within the TME, we distinguish six specialized tumor microenvironments, namely the immune, metabolic, hypoxic, acidic, mechanical and innervated microenvironments. Accordingly, we attempt to decipher the effects of the intratumoral microbiome on each specialized microenvironment and ultimately decode its tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive impact. Additionally, we portray the intratumoral microbiome as an orchestrator in the tumor milieu, fine-tuning the responses in distinct, specialized microenvironments and remodeling the TME in a multi-leveled and multi-faceted manner.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75d5c9319d2fa90250691318d7b1fccf60548d825babf54322a18e3ab590c944","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
