{"title":"The Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Turkish Cypriot Parents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0716/v1","date":1720507043000,"content":"Although WHO declared the end of the pandemic based on the report by International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on May 4th 2023 the health authorities stresses that COVID-19 is still an ongoing health issue and especially the populations in the high-priority  risk need booster doses to sustain the gains. However  the vaccination rates decrease all around the world according to  WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Expert’s on Immunization (SAGE). One of the main reasons of this dramatic decrease can be vaccine hesitancy or refusal. \nVaccine hesitancy is defined as refusal or delay in vaccination, although there is a sufficient supply available (SAGE working group, 2014). MacDonald (2015) stated that vaccine hesitancy is higher among the people who has lack of confidence or trust both to the vaccines themselves and health authorities within the country. However hesitancy can be towards specific vaccines  or selective. One of the most salient selective vaccine hesitancy is the childhood vaccine hesitancy. In the current study we examined the predictors of vaccine hesitancy for children and their parents. \nA total of 199 parents (age range: 26-58; Mean Age: 35) have been recruited by using an online survey. Seventy six percent of the parents who responded were mothers. Education level of the sample was relatively high; 48% of the participants had bachelor degree while %32 had postgraduate degrees.  \nResults indicated that ruminative thinking about Covid-19  was the strongest predictor and decreased the risk for childhood vaccine hesitancy.  Surprisingly, lower poor supervision predicted higher vaccine hesitancy/refusal for children. On the other hand conspiracy thoughts about the pandemic  increased the refusal of COVID-19 vaccines three times. \nFor parents conspiracy thoughts and ruminative thinking predicted vaccine hesitancy/refusal similar to the previous model. Positive parenting was found to be negatively related with vaccine hesitancy/refusal for the parents themselves. One unit increase in this variable decreased the  vaccine hesitancy/refusal for almost five-folds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbf6ebcd3dea7a7ba74d8e38b08b19febe08b4d53ac45fd347d628b99a8d87f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
