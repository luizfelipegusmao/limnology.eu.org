{"title":"Development of The Tabletop Hologram for Spatial Visualization: Application in The Field of Architectural and Urban Design","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0798/v1","date":1718178176000,"content":"In the history, architects, engineers or artists traditionally visualized architectural, urban planning, urban design, or landscape design projects with physical models in a smaller scale to represent their ideas. The biggest problems of traditional materialistic models are the long production time and limitation of mobility. Thanks to advancements in digital technology, 3D models can now be generated easily from 2D blueprints using computer software. However, eventually the digitalized approach could not replace the whole industry of making physical models, because of a lack of stereoscopic 3D imaging of space and structures. In this study, we discuss two points: the normal procedure of visualizing 3D models in urbanism and architecture design projects; and proposal of the stereographic hologram visualization for 3D models created with CHIMERA hologram printer as a new approach to solve all the problems in spatial projects visualization of both digitalized and physical models. The experiment's results indicate that tabletop holograms' visualization quality can potentially replace traditional methods in the near future. Moreover, the input data for this method can be seamlessly integrated into current architectural and urban design workflows, making holograms a promising approach for 3D immersive content in this field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3f49678ee62363237a4ce4726abfb63e0b75e1d7d0195630216992238a3a0fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
