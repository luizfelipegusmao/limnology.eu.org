{"title":"Educational Matheticism and Traditional Apprehension","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1784/v1","date":1727147239000,"content":"Within education, we make assumptions the correct manner of teaching a student, and with that, we assume further that regardless of the intellectual content that a student should engage with, the acculturation for the customary (and always rather traditional) means of religious apprehension for the purpose of an assumedly universal and beneficial role.  This article instead promotes the view that such determinations are (1) unsuitable for modern society and (2) causal to a disjunction with a truly proper manner of education in the form of the matheticism â€“ a term rather unfortunately applied in educational theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d10434fcdf0a9d60adefcf5854e5e968e6146488a4889c1d46cd63f8beaaa764","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
