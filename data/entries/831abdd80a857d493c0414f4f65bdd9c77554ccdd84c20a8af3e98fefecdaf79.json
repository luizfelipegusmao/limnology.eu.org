{"title":"Proteomics analysis of enzyme systems and pathways change during the moromi fermentation of soy sauce mash","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13398?af=R","date":1709642652000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>During the brewing of soy sauce, the conversion of multiple substances was driven by various microorganisms and their secreted enzyme systems. The soy sauce mash was an important source of enzyme systems during moromi fermentation, but the changes of enzyme systems in soy sauce mash during moromi fermentation were poorly understood. In order to explore the predominated enzyme systems existing during the moromi fermentation and to explain the characteristics of the enzyme system changes, the enzymatic activities assay and 4D-label free proteomics analyze were conducted on soy sauce mash at different stages of fermentation.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The activities of hydrolytic enzymes in soy sauce mash decreased continuously throughout the fermentation process, while most of the characteristic physicochemical substances in soy sauce mash supernatant had already accumulated at the early stage of fermentation. Four hydrolytic enzymes were found to be positively correlated with important physicochemical indexes by PCA and Pearson correlation analysis. The proteomics analysis revealed three highly upregulated enzymes and two enzymes that were present in important metabolic pathways throughout the fermentation process. Furthermore, it was found that <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i> was able to accumulate various nutrients in the soy sauce mash by downregulating most of its metabolic pathways.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The enzymes present with excellent property during the moromi fermentation period could be obtained from these results. Meanwhile, the characterization of the metabolic pathways of microorganisms during the moromi fermentation period was revealed. It provides a scientific basis for more scientific and purposeful improvement of moromi fermentation in the future.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
