Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> has been studied extensively for various applications such as lithium-ion batteries and electrochemical hydrogenation catalysts [<a href=\"#ozae044.577-B1\">1-3</a>]. Among various polymorphs, <span>T-</span>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> has attracted much interests due to its capability of fast ion conduction along the 4g atomic layer channels [<a href=\"#ozae044.577-B4\">4</a>]. In view from the crystal structure, it is expected that the 4g atomic layers are oriented straight vertically when <span>T-</span>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> phase is grown along the [180] direction. Recently, a (180)-oriented epitaxial <span>T-</span>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> film has been grown successfully and demonstrated to exhibit nonvolatile electronic properties during reversible ionic gating [<a href=\"#ozae044.577-B5\">5</a>]. In this regard, a (180)-oriented single domain<span>T-</span>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> film can serve as a good model system to study fundamental Li ion transport mechanisms but has not been reported yet.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f51563c71b5afa71aef75c5f8c878acf10996840bb5b95bf1c900ffdc4b90ee4","category":"Environment"}
