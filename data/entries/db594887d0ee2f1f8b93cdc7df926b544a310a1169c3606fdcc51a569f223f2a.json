{"title":"Predicting Flood Event Class Using a Novel Class Membership Function and Hydrological Modeling","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004081?af=R","date":1718866800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Predicting flood event classes aids in the comprehensive investigation of flood behavior dynamics and supports flood early warning and emergency plan development. Existing studies have mainly focused on historical flood event classification and the prediction of flood hydrographs or certain metrics (e.g., magnitude and timing) but have not focused on predicting flood event classes. Our study proposes a new approach for predicting flood event classes based on the class membership functions of flood regime metrics and hydrological modeling. The approach is validated using 1446 unimpacted flood events in 68 headstream catchments widely distributed across China. The new approach performs well, with class hit rates of 68.3% ± 0.4% for all events; 65.8% ± 0.6%, 56.8% ± 0.9%, and 69.5% ± 0.9% for the small, moderate and high spike flood event classes, respectively; and 82.5% ± 1.2% and 75.4% ± 1.1% for the moderate and high dumpy flood event classes, respectively. Furthermore, it performs better in the basins of northern China than in those of southern China, particularly for the small spike flood event class in the Songliao and Yellow River Basins, with hit rates of 80.0% ± 3.2% and 78.8% ± 3.2%, respectively. Our results indicate that the new approach will help improve the prediction performance of flood events and their corresponding classes, and provide deep insights into the comprehensive dynamic patterns of flood events for early warning and control management.</p>","author":"Yongyong Zhang, \nYongqiang Zhang, \nXiaoyan Zhai, \nJun Xia, \nQiuhong Tang, \nTongtiegang Zhao, \nWei Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"db594887d0ee2f1f8b93cdc7df926b544a310a1169c3606fdcc51a569f223f2a","category":"Environment"}
