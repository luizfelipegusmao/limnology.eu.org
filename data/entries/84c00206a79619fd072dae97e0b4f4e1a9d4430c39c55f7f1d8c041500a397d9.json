{"title":"Nestling size and ornamentation interact to shape early development in house sparrow families","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/142/4/410/7631695?rss=1","date":1710806400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In many nuclear families, dependent offspring receive unequal shares of parental investment. Initial overproduction can be adaptive from the perspective of parents, but parents must be able to identify appropriate candidates for favourite status. We studied early nestling development in house sparrows (<span>Passer domesticus</span>), a species in which the loss of some brood members is common, testing the prediction that body mass and carotenoid-rich flange colours are important to nestling success. There was substantial variation in both traits within broods, even only 1 day after hatching. Nestlings low in the within-brood mass hierarchy gained more mass if they displayed more carotenoid-rich flanges than broodmates. Position in the colour hierarchy did not, however, predict mass gain for individuals that were heavier than their broodmates. Nestlings that were heavier or had more carotenoid-rich mouths were also less likely to be the victim of brood reduction. Our results suggest that house sparrow parents use both nestling body size and mouth colour when making allocation decisions. Understanding both how and when offspring traits and parental preferences function is key to understanding how selective pressures act on offspringâ€“parent communication.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"84c00206a79619fd072dae97e0b4f4e1a9d4430c39c55f7f1d8c041500a397d9","category":"Environment"}
