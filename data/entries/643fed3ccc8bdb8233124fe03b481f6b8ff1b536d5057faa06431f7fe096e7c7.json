Potential plasticity in sexual behavior has recently been reported in various teleost fish. To examine behavioral plasticity in parental care, we conducted aquarium experiments to explore the potential for egg-guarding care in the female damselfish, <i>Dascyllus reticulatus</i>. After initial caretaking, males were removed from the mating nests, and cohabiting females frequently exhibited egg predation on the same day. However, we confirmed that females showed significantly decreased egg-predation frequencies on the following day and showed egg-caring behaviors. All experimental females guarded their eggs until they hatched. Females subsequently spawned eggs as females even after performing parental care behaviors, indicating no progression of sex change into males. Molecular analysis of select pituitary gland hormones indicated that egg-caring females and males showed high expression levels of prolactin, suggesting its involvement in the development of parental care behaviors. The cryptic possession of caretaking ability in females may be a tactical response to the need for temporary replacement of the care roles in cases where caretaking males are removed, for example, through predation, in damselfish species living in sexually cohabiting groups.</p>","author":"Yoichi Sakai, \nYu Muranaka, \nHiromi Nakayama, \nKoji Baba, \nKazuya Matsushita, \nHiroyuki Kuwahara, \nHisato Kuniyoshi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"643fed3ccc8bdb8233124fe03b481f6b8ff1b536d5057faa06431f7fe096e7c7","category":"Environment"}
