{"title":"Assessing Industrial Past and Cultural Change over Industrial Lands along Hangzhou Section of Chinese Grand Canal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0421/v1","date":1715093681000,"content":"Few studies have paid attention to the industrial lands along the Chinese Grand Canal from a cultural per-spective, but cities along the route like Hangzhou have relied on the Canal system to promote industrializa-tion over the past hundred years, and relocated, transformed, or demolished the factories to construct cul-tural space or products mostly after industrial recession at the beginning of 21st century. To deeply analyze this process is quite helpful to understand the typical cultural change and its gain and loss along the Canal especially after cultural and creative industries have been established as the pillar industries of China's na-tional economy. Therefore, along the Hangzhou section of the Canal, we dynamically monitored the land use of the selected 10 industrial lands, with the analysis of high-resolution satellite imageries and the in-dustrial past, the areas of different uses in 2022 were compared. Meanwhile, along with archival data, fieldwork, and expertsâ€™ consultation, we designed a mark sheet with factors and scores to comprehensively assess cultural changes over those lands, and its reasons and influence also have been argued, and the prob-lems and suggestions have been offered. This study can contribute to a better understanding of public poli-cy choices in China regarding cities along the Grand Canal after the industrial decline, and provide new perspectives for cultural research, heritage conservation, and urban planning of canals or waterfront spaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d27e8616e6457bb96fb9264264d19e3c6825d480b974f28869e100cabd3a08b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
