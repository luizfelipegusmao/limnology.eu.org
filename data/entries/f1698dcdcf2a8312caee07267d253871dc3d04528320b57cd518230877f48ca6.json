This study aims to understand better the factors that impact the spread of new technologies, the effectiveness of social media advertising, and the longevity of businesses. The study used a quantitative strategy based on partial least squares structural equation modeling to learn about the phenomenon of interest as much as possible. Dhaka, Bangladesh, small and medium-sized businesses participated in the survey. According to the findings, the popularity of internet and e-business technologies may be attributed to their apparent usefulness and ease of use. It is connecting internet/e-business technology, social media marketing, and the long-term success of small and medium-sized enterprises. Still, the expense factor was insufficient to prove that SMEs engage in social media advertising. Mediating effects between components may be better understood via internet/e-business technology and social media marketing, as shown by this study. This study is the first of its kind in Bangladesh and sheds light on the resilience of SMEs in the face of the Covivirus-19 pandemic, notwithstanding its focus on the capital city of Dhaka.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1698dcdcf2a8312caee07267d253871dc3d04528320b57cd518230877f48ca6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
