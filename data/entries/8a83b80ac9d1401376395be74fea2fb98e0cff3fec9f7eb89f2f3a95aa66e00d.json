{"title":"Nutrient limitation dampens the response of a harmful algae to a marine heatwave in an upwelling system","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12604?af=R","date":1719510542000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Harmful algal blooms caused by toxin-producing species of the diatom genus <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> have been linked to anomalously warm ocean conditions in the Northern California Current System. This study compares summertime concentrations of <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. and the toxin they produce, domoic acid, during a marine heatwave year (2019) and a climatologically neutral year (2021). An Imaging FlowCytobot was installed on a fishery survey vessel alongside environmental sensors to continuously sample phytoplankton and oceanographic parameters. This was paired with targeted manual sample collections for nutrients, chlorophyll, and domoic acid. Accumulations of <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. were associated with upwelling zones and established hotspot regions: the Juan de Fuca Eddy, Heceta Bank, and Trinidad Head. Overall, however, <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. and domoic acid concentrations were low during both summers and appear to have been limited by nitrate. Nutrient availability may therefore modulate the response of <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. to warm anomalies. Comparison of these results with 2015, another marine heatwave year but one that produced record concentrations of <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. and domoic acid, suggests that the timing of marine heatwave conditions in the nearshore relative to seasonal upwelling plays a key role in determining whether a <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> spp. harmful algal bloom will occur.</p>","author":"Alexis D.
