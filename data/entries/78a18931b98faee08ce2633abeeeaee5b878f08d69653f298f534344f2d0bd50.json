The data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire from 342 business graduates from different universities in a developing country like Pakistan. The findings revealed that the respondents have a no-to-low understanding of SF, FI, and the role or importance of these in achieving the 17 SDGs. The findings suggest major revisions in the structure and contents of different business degrees in Pakistan. Overall, the study opens new avenues for research and provides important insights for all the key stakeholders, including universities, higher education institutions (HEIs), the Higher Education Commission (HEC), students, and parents. The study also has social and practical implications for various stakeholders in the HEIs.</p>","author":"Muhammad Faheem, \nMuhammad Zahid, \nHaseeb Ur Rahman, \nAmin Jan, \nSyed Emad Azhar Ali","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"78a18931b98faee08ce2633abeeeaee5b878f08d69653f298f534344f2d0bd50","category":"Environment"}
