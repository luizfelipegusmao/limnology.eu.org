This notion is investigated here for Lessepsian realized niche during invasions. We found that thermal niche shift estimation is influenced by the temporal averaging method.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nIn this study, we estimate the niche overlap between native and invaded ranges of 36 Lessepsian fish, focusing on how this estimate might vary in relation to the temporal resolution of sea surface temperature and salinity, which are the main niche axes determining their distribution. Specifically, we wanted to address the following questions: (i) Does the choice of temporal averaging method of variables influence the estimation of niche overlap for individual variables? (ii) Does this temporal resolution effect persist when conducting bivariate niche estimations?\n\nNiches overlap was estimated by calculating two indices and these analyses were repeated at two temporal resolutions, matching observations to the classic ‘multidecadal’ average of environmental conditions and to the corresponding annual average of records. Results are compared with verify whether differences can be detected in the magnitude of niche commonality measured at annual or multidecadal temporal resolution.\n\nThe findings show that the temporal resolution of the data significantly influences estimates of overlap in the thermal niche. Specifically, our analysis indicates a considerable disparity between native and invasive niche regions for most species, particularly when evaluated over multidecadal periods compared with matching occurrence data to the annual mean values of years the occurrence was observed, that is matching occurrence data to a common average of ‘present’ conditions or to the annual mean values of years of observation. In particular, the largest overlaps between native and invaded niches occur along the salinity axis, regardless of temporal resolution. When considering both temperature and salinity together, the results remain unaffected by the temporal resolution of the environmental data. Almost 30% of the species show a different niche in their introduced range, and for the other species, the overlap between native and invaded ranges was reduced with respect to the univariate analyses.\n</p>","author":"Manuela D'Amen, \nNico Bonora, \nErnesto Azzurro","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"b2922f10cf4201a56f0316f689e3dfb9ad1e3c27395fe6de77ba0a694de6123c","category":"Environment"}
