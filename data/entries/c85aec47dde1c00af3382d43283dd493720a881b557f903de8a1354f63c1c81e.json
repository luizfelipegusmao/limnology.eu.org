{"title":"App-Assisted TF-CBT-Based Intervention as Add-On to Inpatient Treatment Reduces Children&rsquo;s Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms and Post-traumatic Cognitions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0033/v1","date":1711961970000,"content":"Previous studies suggested that trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) is effective in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in children and adolescents. However, the effects of app-assisted TF-CBT-based interventions in psychiatric clinics compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) are under-explored. The purpose of this study was to reveal the added value of the app-assisted TF-CBT-based intervention as an add-on to TAU. The digitalized measures of the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS), The Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale (A-DES), Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), and Children's Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI) were applied at baseline and post-treatment. The app-assisted TF-CBT-based group participants started with higher levels of negative alterations in cognition and mood compared to TAU participants but at post-treatment, no significant differences were observed between the app-assisted TF-CBT and TAU groups. Within the app-assisted TF-CBT group, post-treatment scores were significantly lower in post-traumatic stress symptoms, intrusion symptoms, alterations in arousal and reactivity, overall post-traumatic cognitions, and belief in being \"a fragile person in a scary world‚Äù. Within the TAU group, post-treatment scores were notably lower just in dissociation and intrusion symptoms. The study suggests that app-assisted TF-CBT-based intervention can be effective in addressing specific trauma-related symptoms. The findings imply the necessity for screening for traumatic experiences, incorporating trauma-informed care, implementation of TF-CBT into treatment protocols, utilization of app-assisted interventions, tailoring interventions to individual needs, and comprehensive assessment and monitoring of treatment progress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c85aec47dde1c00af3382d43283dd493720a881b557f903de8a1354f63c1c81e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
