{"title":"Understanding Tree Mortality Patterns: A Comprehensive Review of Remote Sensing and Ground-Based Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0269/v2","date":1720420516000,"content":"Land degradation, desertification and tree mortality related to global climate change are in the spotlight of Remote Sensing research in recent decades, since extreme climatic events could affect the composition, structure and biogeography of forests. However, the complexity of tree mortality processes requires a holistic approach. Herein, we present the first global assessment and a historical perspective of tree mortality by reviewing both Remote Sensing and ground-based studies. We compiled 254 papers on tree mortality that make use of remotely sensed products, ground-based monitoring and climatic drivers, focusing on their spatial and temporal patterns, in the methods applied, while highlighting research gaps. Forested ecosystems, especially in the Mediterranean area, appear to have experienced often climatic-induced physiological stress under extreme droughts and warming, raising concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to tree mortality. Our core results indicated that international publications on tree mortality are on the increase with the main hotspots being North America (39%) and Europe (26%). Wetness indicators appear as the barometer in explaining tree mortality on a local scale, while vegetation indicators derived from multispectral optical sensors are promising for large scale assessment. We observed that almost all of the studies we have reviewed were based on less than 25 years of data and were of local scale. Longer timeframes and regional scale investigations that will include multiple tree species analysis could have a significant impact on future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e06bdf38f4079bd0af7acc097e00b2a031bcdb48cec5add44a3f2958462075ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
