Weissgerber</p>\r\n\r\nDetailed method descriptions are essential for reproducibility, research evaluation, and effective data reuse. We summarize the key recommendations for life sciences researchers and research institutions described in the European Commission PRO-MaP report.\r\n\r\nEssential details about study methods are often missing from academic research papers in the life sciences, which can adversely affect reproducibility, undermine trust and impair researchers’ ability to reuse methods and data. This Perspective article describes PRO-MaP (Promoting Reusable and Open Methods And Protocols), which aims to increase and improve the reporting of detailed, structured and open methods and reusable step-by-step protocols in the life sciences.","author":"Sofia Batista Leite","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"f0a5a7d59882d273dfecc0a0dff1d701ffb01246a3def3594389c8638c0884f1","category":"Environment"}
