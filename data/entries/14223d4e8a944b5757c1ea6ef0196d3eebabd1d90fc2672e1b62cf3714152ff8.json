Our results show that repeated, targeted bush clearing can increase soil moisture, grass biomass, and preferred ungulate habitat in semi-arid savannas. Mopane shrubs were resilient to clearing, and results suggest repeated removal for many years is required to induce significant shrub mortality and mitigate the negative impacts of bush encroachment over the long-term.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nMany savannas are experiencing increased cover of trees and shrubs, resulting in reduced herbaceous productivity, shifts in savanna functional structure and potential reductions in ecotourism. Clearing woody plants has been suggested as an effective management strategy to mitigate these effects and restore these systems to an open state with higher rates of grass production and herbivory. This study investigated the effectiveness of repeated shrub clearing as a tool to mitigate bush encroachment in a semi-arid savanna in southern Africa.\n\nWe present data from a 7-year experiment in the Mthimkhulu Game Reserve bordering Kruger National Park, South Africa. <i>Colophospermum mopane</i> stems and resprouting shoots were basally cut 2–3 times per year (2015–2022) in three pairs of treatment and control plots of 60 × 60 m. We monitored changes in soil moisture, grass biomass and herbivore activity via dung counts. We assessed <i>C. mopane</i> physiological responses to repeated cutting using non-structural carbohydrates and stable water isotopes to infer changes to energy storage and functional rooting depth, respectively.\n\nThe cleared treatment had higher soil moisture and grass biomass than the control treatment. Dung counts showed impala and buffalo visited the cleared treatment more frequently than the control treatment.\n\nRepeated cutting had limited effects on <i>C. mopane</i> survival in the first 2–3 years after initial clearing, but 80% of individuals were dead after 7 years. Repeatedly cut <i>C. mopane</i> had lower belowground starch concentrations and used water from shallower soil depths than <i>C. mopane</i> in control plots.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Repeated cutting increased soil moisture availability and grass biomass, and attracted charismatic grazing herbivores. While more costly than once-off clearing methods, this practice created more employment opportunities for a neighbouring rural community. Transforming portions of the ecosystem to a grass-dominated state may increase ecotourism potential through improved game viewing in open systems.\n</p>","author":"Emily R. Wedel, \nJesse B.
