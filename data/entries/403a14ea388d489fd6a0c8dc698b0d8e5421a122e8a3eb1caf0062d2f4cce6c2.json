{"title":"The Effectiveness of a Single Hyaluronic Acid Injection in Improving Symptoms and Muscular Strength in Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis: A Multicenter, Restrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0423/v1","date":1720096920000,"content":"Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a progressive and multifactorial disease that leads to joint pain, muscle weakness, physical disability, and decreased quality of life. In KOA, hyaluronic acid (HA) quantity and molecular weight (MW) are decreased, leading to joint pain due to increased wear of the knee articular cartilage. Arthrogenic muscle inhibition, which is usually found in patients with KOA, is associated with joint inflammation, pain, and swelling, also causing muscle atrophy, primarily of the anterior thigh muscles, and hindering the rehabilitation process. The aim of our work was to determine if a single HA infiltration could minimize the effects of arthrogenic muscle inhibition in patients with KOA in the short term, using isokinetic dynamometry to evaluate the strength of the knee extensor and flexor muscles of the thigh. Thirty patients with KOA who underwent both clinical and isokinetic assessment, and that received a single injection of HA, were retrospectively included. Our results showed that a single intra-articular injection of HA significantly reduces pain and improves joint function at four weeks, while non-statistically significant improvements were observed for the reference isokinetic parameter (maximum torque) at both 90°/s and 180°/s. Further high-quality studies are necessary to confirm the results of our study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"403a14ea388d489fd6a0c8dc698b0d8e5421a122e8a3eb1caf0062d2f4cce6c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
