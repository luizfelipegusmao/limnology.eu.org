This paper looks at the different major divisions of our population and then; 1) develops a framework for understanding which groups are affected by the differences in medical access and outcomes, 2) attempts to document some of the reasons for these differences, and 3) offers some conclusions and possible first steps to improve the health of these groups and our society’s ability to provide care for the entire population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f71e2a17f915e224b2f224035cdfc513c5388d1192c066e329f3a39cd45634a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
