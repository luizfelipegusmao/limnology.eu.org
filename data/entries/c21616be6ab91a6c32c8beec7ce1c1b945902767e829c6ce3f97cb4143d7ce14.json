C57BL/6J mice received HF diet supplemented with 26g% WHR, 26g% WLD, or 13g% WHR+13g% WLD (WTWD) for 12 weeks. The levels of fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokines and monocyte adhesion were lower, and the abundances of fecal Lactobacillus gasseri species bacteria and propionic acid were higher in HF+WLD diet-fed mice compared to HF+WHR diet-fed mice (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c21616be6ab91a6c32c8beec7ce1c1b945902767e829c6ce3f97cb4143d7ce14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
