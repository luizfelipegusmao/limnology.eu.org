{"title":"Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Myopathy and Thromboembolism: The Additive Value of Echocardiography and Possible New Horizons for Risk Stratification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1134/v1","date":1713338760000,"content":"This article explores the emerging concept of atrial myopathy (AM) and its potential role as a risk factor for stroke and dementia, both independently and in association with atrial fibrillation (AF). AM refers to structural and functional abnormalities of the atria, potentially causing blood clots formation and their subsequent embolization even in patients without AF. Echocardiography, particularly Left Atrial (LA) strain analysis, is a promising non-invasive tool for AM evaluation and might offer additional risk stratification beyond the established CHADS2-VASc score, potentially impacting anticoagulation decisions. By understanding AM and utilizing advanced imaging techniques like LA strain, clinicians can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of thromboembolic risk in specific patient groups. Integrating LA strain analysis into routine clinical practice holds promise for improved patient management and targeted therapies, allowing for better risk stratification in AF patients. However, standardized definitions and diagnostic criteria for AM are essential for consistent evaluation and research. Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in AM patients without AF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9af99dd6c13217cbc320f2e273d7ad5d67aed381bf71f1d4191d69ab7bceb1cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
