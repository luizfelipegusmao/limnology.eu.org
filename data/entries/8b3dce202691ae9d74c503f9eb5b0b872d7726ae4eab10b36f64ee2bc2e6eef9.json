The platform of VAMAS (Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards [<a href=\"#ozae044.319-B1\">1</a>]) supports advanced materials technologies, through international collaborative projects aimed at providing the technical basis for harmonized measurements, testing, specifications, and international standards. Currently, there are several projects in progress involving ILCs on the measurement of NP size and shape distribution and NP (relative) concentration mainly by imaging methods, i.e. electron microscopy (in different operating modes, TEM, SEM, STEM-in-SEM) and AFM.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8b3dce202691ae9d74c503f9eb5b0b872d7726ae4eab10b36f64ee2bc2e6eef9","category":"Environment"}
