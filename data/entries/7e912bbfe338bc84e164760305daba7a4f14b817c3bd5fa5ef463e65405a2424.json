{"title":"Aerosolized Harmful Algal Bloom Toxin Microcystin-LR Induces Type 1/Type 17 Inflammation of Murine Airways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0463/v1","date":1728293307000,"content":"Harmful algal blooms are increasing globally and pose serious health concerns releasing cyanotoxins. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), one of the most frequently produced cyanotoxins, has recently been detected in aerosols generated by the normal motions of affected bodies of water. MC-LR aerosol exposure has been linked to a pro-inflammatory influence on the airways of mice, however little is understood about the underlying mechanism or the potential consequences. This study aimed to investigate the pro-inflammatory effects of aerosolized MC-LR on murine airways. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were exposed to MC-LR aerosols, as these strains are predisposed to type 1/type 17 and type 2 immune responses, respectively. Exposure to MC-LR induced granulocytic inflammation in C57BL/6 but not BALB/c mice, as observed by increased expression of cytokines MIP-1Î±, CXCL1, CCL2, and GM-CSF compared with their respective vehicle controls. Furthermore, the upregulation of interleukins IL-17A and IL-12 is consistent with Th1 and Th17 driven type 1/type 17 inflammation. Histological analysis confirmed inflammation in the C57BL/6 lungs, with elevated neutrophils and macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and increased pro-inflammatory oxidized lipids. In contrast, BALB/c mice showed no significant airway inflammation. These results highlight the ability of aerosolized MC-LR to trigger harmful airway inflammation, requiring further research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e912bbfe338bc84e164760305daba7a4f14b817c3bd5fa5ef463e65405a2424","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
