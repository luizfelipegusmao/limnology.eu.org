{"title":"Determination of Rhodamine 6G with direct immersion single-drop microextraction combined with an optical probe","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309121","date":1724076000000,"content":"<p>by Arina Skok, Andriy Vishnikin, Yaroslav Bazel, Ján Toth</p>\r\n\r\nThe combination of an optical probe and single-drop direct immersion microextraction (DI-SDME-OP) was used for the preconcentration and subsequent spectrophotometric determination of rhodamine 6G (Rh6G). The developed method is based on the formation of an ionic associate between Rh6G and picric acid at pH 3.0 and its extraction with amyl acetate. A microdrop of the organic phase was stably placed in the hole of an optical probe immersed in the sample solution. The absorbance of the extraction phase was monitored at 534 nm. The proposed method combines in a single step several stages of the analytical procedure, such as pre-concentration, phase separation, transfer of the extraction phase to the instrument and online measurement. The sensitivity of the proposed approach is not inferior to existing microextraction methods involving the combination of liquid-phase or solid-phase extraction with spectrophotometry or HPLC with a UV-Vis detector. The evaluation of the greenness of the developed method carried out by the AGREE method (0.58 points) showed that it outperforms other similar existing techniques using this parameter. The calibration plot for the determination of Rh6G by the DI-SDME-OP method was linear over the range of 10–500 nM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9956. The limit of detection was 3.4 nM. The accuracy and applicability of the method were evaluated by the determination of Rh6G in natural waters and lipstick.","author":"Arina Skok","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4744bf15a7cbe043ebda088dc466a909854e27921c01809e51036404fdaa7dc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
