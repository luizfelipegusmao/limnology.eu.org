{"title":"Strong and efficient summertime carbon export driven by aggregation processes in a subarctic coastal ecosystem","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12561?af=R","date":1716913718000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Sinking marine particles, one pathway of the biological carbon pump, transports carbon to the deep ocean from the surface, thereby modulating atmospheric carbon dioxide and supplying benthic food. Few in situ measurements exist of sinking particles in the Northern Gulf of Alaska; therefore, regional carbon flux prediction is poorly constrained. In this study, we (1) characterize the strength and efficiency of the biological carbon pump and (2) identify drivers of carbon flux in the Northern Gulf of Alaska. We deployed up to five inline drifting sediment traps in the upper 150 m to simultaneously collect bulk carbon and intact sinking particles in polyacrylamide gels and measured net primary productivity from deck-board incubations during the summer of 2019. We found high carbon flux magnitude, low attenuation with depth, and high export efficiency. We quantitatively attributed carbon flux between 10 particle types, including various fecal pellet categories, dense detritus, and aggregates using polyacrylamide gels. The contribution of aggregates to total carbon flux (41–93%) and total carbon flux variability (95%) suggest that aggregation processes, not zooplankton repackaging, played a dominant role in carbon export. Furthermore, export efficiency correlated significantly with the proportion of chlorophyll <i>a</i> in the large size fraction (&gt; 20 <i>μ</i>m), total aggregate carbon flux, and contribution of aggregates to total carbon flux. These results suggest that this stratified, small-cell-dominated ecosystem can have sufficient aggregation to allow for a strong and efficient biological carbon pump. This is the first integrative description of the biological carbon pump in this region.</p>","author":"Stephanie H. O'Daly, \nGwenn M. M. Hennon, \nThomas B. Kelly, \nSuzanne L. Strom, \nAndrew M. P.
