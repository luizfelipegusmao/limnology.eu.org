{"title":"The persistent benefits of decreasing default pill counts for postoperative narcotic prescriptions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304100","date":1717509600000,"content":"<p>by Nathan Coppersmith, Joshua Sznol, Andrew Esposito, Emily Flom, Alexander Chiu, Peter Yoo</p>\r\nBackground <p>In 2017, a university-based academic healthcare system changed the opioid default pill count from 30 to 12 pills. Modifying the electronic default pill count influences short-term clinician prescribing practices. We sought to understand the long-term impact on postoperative opioid prescribing habits after an opioid default pill count reduction.</p> Materials and methods <p>A retrospective electronic medical record system (EMRS) review was conducted in a healthcare system comprised of seven affiliated hospitals. Patients who underwent a surgical procedure and were prescribed an opioid on discharge between 2017–2021 were evaluated. All prescriptions were converted into morphine equivalents (MME). Analyses were performed with the chi-square test and Bonferonni adjusted t-test.</p> Results <p>191,379 surgical procedures were studied. The average quantity of opioids prescribed decreased from 32 oxycodone 5 mg tablets in 2017 to 21 oxycodone 5 mg tablets in 2021 (236 MME to 154 MME, p&lt;0.001). The percentage of patients obtaining a refill within 90 days of surgery varied between 18.3% and 19.9% (p&lt;0.001). Patients with a pre-existing opioid prescription and opioid-naïve patients both had significant reductions in prescription quantities above the default MME (79.7% to 60.6% vs. 65.3% to 36.9%, p&lt;0.001). There was no significant change in refills for both groups (pre-existing 36.7% to 38.3% (p = 0.1) vs naïve 15.0% to 15.3% (p = 0.29)).</p> Conclusions <p>The benefits of decreasing the default opioid pill count continue to accumulate long after the original change. Physician uptake of small changes to default EMRS practices represents a sustainable and effective intervention to reduce the quantities of postoperative opioids prescribed without deleterious effects on outpatient opiate requirements.</p>","author":"Nathan Coppersmith","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"139c8928c988bfe33373131df77224c5033c35f0950a51a0af61c472207d6f03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
