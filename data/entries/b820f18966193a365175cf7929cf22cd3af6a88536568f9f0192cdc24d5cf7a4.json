{"title":"Entropy Considerations in Stochastic Electrodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2215/v1","date":1722326198000,"content":"The use of entropy concepts in the field of stochastic electrodynamics is briefly reviewed here.  Entropy calculations to date that have been fully carried out are discussed in two main situations: first, where electric dipole oscillators interact with zero-point, or zero-point plus Planckian, or Rayleigh-Jeans radiation, and second where only these radiation fields exist within a cavity.  The emphasis here will be on the first more difficult situation where both charged particles and radiation fields are present and interacting.  Unlike the usual exposition on entropy in clasical statistical mechanics involving probabilistic notions of phase space occupation, the calculations to date for both particles and fields or for fields alone, follow the caloric entropy method where the notions of heat flow, adiabatic surfaces, and isothermal conditions, are utilized.  Probability notions certainly still enter into the calculations, as the fields and charged particles interact stochastically together, following Maxwellian electrodynamics.  Examples of phase-space calculations for harmonic oscillators and classical hydrogen atoms are carried out, emphasizing how much farther caloric entropy calculations have been successfully utilized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b820f18966193a365175cf7929cf22cd3af6a88536568f9f0192cdc24d5cf7a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
