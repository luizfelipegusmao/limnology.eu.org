{"title":"Evaluation of a Point of Care Gem Premier ChemSTAT Analyzer in Emergency Department: Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy and Optimization of Patient Flow","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0349/v1","date":1725441844000,"content":"Background: Having a laboratory renal profile for medical imaging examinations requiring contrast media (CM) administration is strongly advised. Creatinine helps identify patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). GEM® Premier™ ChemSTAT (Werfen) is a point-of-care (POC) analyzer with 12 emergency parameters including creatinine assay. The aim of this study consists to compare ChemSTAT with the central analytical solution of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand and to evaluate the interest of the POC creatinine in the emergency department (ED) in optimizing the flow of patients, especially if CM used.\nMethods:  More than 200 whole blood (WB) samples from the ED were evaluated on the ChemSTAT analyzer. As comparative methods, the plasma aliquots from the same samples were assayed on an Atellica® CH (Siemens Healthineers). The clinical concordance was assessed ac-cording the decision cut-offs of the French Society of Radiology for the risk of CIN. The availability times of biological results between ChemSTAT and the central laboratory were studied.\nResults:  WB results from ChemSTAT correlated well with those from Atellica® CH, except for tCO2 (known bias between Siemens and Cobas Roche methods predicting ChemSTAT values). The results of creatinine assay allow to have identical medical decisions compared to the renal risk cut-offs. The availability of biological results is reduced by 50 min on average with ChemSTAT vs the central laboratory. Computed tomography was performed for 44.7% of patients including the injection of the CM in 68% of cases. For these patients, the availability of creatinine results relative to imaging time is faster with the ChemSTAT on average of 45.2 min.\nConclusions:  Great analytical and clinical correlations for creatinine assay allow safe iden-tification of patients at risk of CIN and improve patient flow in ED especially for those requiring computed tomography with use of CM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8790c7b58a7e2f223f8a84ea84fc79c3e5109a2a3eb964038ffc361334f45d8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
