{"title":"From colon wall to tumor niche: Unraveling the microbiome’s role in colorectal cancer progression","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311233","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Gissel García Menéndez, Liubov Sichel, Maria del Consuelo López, Yasel Hernández, Ernesto Arteaga, Marisol Rodríguez, Vilma Fleites, Lipsy Teresa Fernández, Raúl De Jesus Cano</p>\r\n\r\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is influenced by perturbations in the colonic microbiota, characterized by an imbalance favoring pathogenic bacteria over beneficial ones. This dysbiosis contributes to CRC initiation and progression through mechanisms such as carcinogenic metabolite production, inflammation induction, DNA damage, and oncogenic signaling activation. Understanding the role of external factors in shaping the colonic microbiota is crucial for mitigating CRC progression. This study aims to elucidate the gut microbiome’s role in CRC progression by analyzing paired tumor and mucosal tissue samples obtained from the colon walls of 17 patients. Through sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, we characterized the tumor microbiome and assessed its association with clinical variables. Our findings revealed a significant reduction in alpha diversity within tumor samples compared to paired colon biopsy samples, indicating a less diverse microbial environment within the tumor microenvironment. While both tissues exhibited dominance of similar bacterial phyla, their relative abundances varied, suggesting potential colon-specific effects. Fusobacteriota enrichment, notably in the right colon, may be linked to MLH1 deficiency. Taxonomy analysis identified diverse bacterial genera, with some primarily associated with the colon wall and others unique to this region. Conversely, several genera were exclusively expressed in tumor tissue. Functional biomarker analysis identified three key genes with differential abundance between tumor microenvironment and colon tissue, indicating distinct metabolic activities. Functional biomarker analysis revealed three key genes with differential abundance: K11076 (putrescine transport system) and K10535 (nitrification) were enriched in the tumor microenvironment, while K11329 (SasA-RpaAB circadian timing mediator) dominated colon tissue. Metabolic pathway analysis linked seven metabolic pathways to the microbiome. Collectively, these findings highlight significant gut microbiome alterations in CRC and strongly suggest that long-term dysbiosis profoundly impacts CRC progression.","author":"Gissel García Menéndez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8fb0fc923c007509a65652b9eace4e25eafd3da1b98844476e2486b29bcef779","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
