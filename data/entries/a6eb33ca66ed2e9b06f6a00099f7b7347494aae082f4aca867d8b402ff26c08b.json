{"title":"Use and Abuse of Antibiotics in Latin American Neonatal Units in the EpicLatino Database. Eight Years of Experience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1381/v1","date":1713774542000,"content":"The use of antibiotics in neonatal units worldwide varies significantly. We included data from 2015-2022 from the EpicLatino database, which comprises a network of 32 units in Latin America and the Caribbean with gestational age at birth (GA) of â‰¤ 32 weeks. A questionnaire was sent to the EpicLatino units, to correlate practice with outcomes. Negative binomial regression with standard errors and confidence intervals computed for incidence-rate ratios (IRRs) was used for comparative statistics on antibiotic days per 1000 patient-days between units. All units that responded had 1-6 differences with the reference unit (Unit 2) with the best results, but there was no clear association with the IRR. Each EpicLatino unit should review its statistics to explore possibilities for reducing antibiotic usage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6eb33ca66ed2e9b06f6a00099f7b7347494aae082f4aca867d8b402ff26c08b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
