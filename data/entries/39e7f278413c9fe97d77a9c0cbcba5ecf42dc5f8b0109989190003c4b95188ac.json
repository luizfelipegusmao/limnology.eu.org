We discovered that the regularized ψ−Hilfer fractional derivative can be represented as the inverse operation of the ψ−Riemann–Liouville fractional integral, and used this property to prove the existence of solutions for linear differential equations with a regularized ψ−Hilfer fractional derivative. Additionally, we applied the Mönch’s fixed-point theorem and knowledge of non-compactness measures to demonstrate the existence of solutions for nonlinear differential equations with a regularized ψ−Hilfer fractional derivative, and further discussed Ulam-Hyers-Rassias stability and semi-Ulam-Hyers-Rassias stability of these solutions. Finally, we illustrated our results through case studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39e7f278413c9fe97d77a9c0cbcba5ecf42dc5f8b0109989190003c4b95188ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
