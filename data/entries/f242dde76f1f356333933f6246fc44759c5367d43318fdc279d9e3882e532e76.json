{"title":"Knowledge, attitude and practice towards antibiotic use and resistance among the veterinarians in Bangladesh","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308324","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Md Samun Sarker, Sanjib Chandra Nath, Iftekhar Ahmed, Nure Alam Siddiky, Shariful Islam, Md Ehsanul Kabir, Zamila Bueaza Bupasha</p>\r\nBackground <p>The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a growing human and animal health concern around the world. When a number of studies have emphasized the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and resistance in humans, little attention has been paid to the veterinary sector. The aim of this study was to understand the KAP towards antibiotic use and resistance among veterinarians in Bangladesh.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional online based questionnaire survey was conducted from August to September 2020 among the registered veterinary practitioners. A self-administered Google form questionnaire consisting of 45 questions on knowledge, attitude and practice regarding antibiotic use and resistance was used. For statistical significance test we used Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact test and logistic regression for factor analysis.</p> Results <p>A total of 208 registered veterinarians participated in this study. The study involved a majority of male participants, constituting 85.1%, while 54.8% of the participants held a Masters degree. Around 52% of the veterinarians were poultry practitioners. All respondents were familiar with antimicrobials. The participants (91.4%) knew that antibiotics cannot cure viral infections, while 97.6% believed that frequent antibiotic prescriptions rendered them less effective. Participants claimed that only they were eligible to prescribe drugs for the treatment of animals, and around 80% disagreed with adding antibiotics with feed/water as a growth promoter in livestock. Of the total participants, 87% believed that a local antimicrobial guideline would be more effective than an international one. A multivariable analysis revealed that male veterinarians have 2.37 times higher knowledge regarding antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (OR = 2.37, CI = 1.01–5.59, <i>p</i> = 0.05). Veterinarians engaged in government services demonstrated a 2.59 times more favorable attitude towards AMU and AMR (OR = 2.59, CI = 0.99–6.73, <i>p</i> = 0.05). Additionally, respondents aged 31–35 were 0.45 times more likely to exhibit good practices (OR = 0.45, CI = 0.2–1.00, <i>p</i> = 0.05). However, gaps in practices were highlighted in our study, suggesting training deficiencies.</p> Conclusion <p>The present study, for the first time conducted in Bangladesh, dictates that future interventions like academic courses, workshops, and seminars on antibiotic usage and resistance are needed to facilitate the knowledge, behavior and practice of veterinarians with regard to the rational use of antibiotics.</p>","author":"Md Samun Sarker","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f242dde76f1f356333933f6246fc44759c5367d43318fdc279d9e3882e532e76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
