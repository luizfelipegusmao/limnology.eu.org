{"title":"Survival of Amalgam and Composite Resin Restorations From Big Data Real-Life Databases in the Era of Restricted Dental Mercury Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1572/v1","date":1711442750000,"content":"Tooth decay, also known as caries, is a significant medical problem that harms teeth. Treatment is based on the removal of the carious material and then filling the cavity left in the tooth, most commonly with amalgam or composite resin. The consequences of filling failure include repeating the filling, or performing another treatment, such as a root canal, or extraction. Dental amalgam contains mercury, and there is a global effort to reduce its use. However, no consensus has been reached using randomized clinical trials, regarding whether amalgam or composite resin materials are more durable, and which is the best restorative material. To determine which material is superior, we performed a retrospective cohort study using a large database where members of the 58 dental clinics with 440 dental units were treated. The number of failures of the amalgam compared to composite resin restorations between 2014 and 2021 were compared. Our data included information from over 650,000 patients. Between 2014 - 2021, 260,905 patients were treated. 19,692 out of 113,281 first amalgam restorations failed (17.49%), whereas significantly fewer composite restorations failed (11.98%) 65,943 out of 555,671. This study indicates that composite is superior to amalgam and therefore it is reasonable to cease using mercury containing amalgam.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe93df60016fd2a9d44f5ef327cbfe88d3fc80b678cd211d4e81395f8acfce2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
