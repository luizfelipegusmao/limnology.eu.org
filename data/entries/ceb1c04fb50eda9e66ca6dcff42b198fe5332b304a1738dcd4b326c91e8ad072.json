{"title":"Integrative taxonomic revision of the Cerurina-Afrocerura genus-pair (Lepidoptera, Noctuoidea, Notodontidae, Cerurinae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/doi/10.1093/isd/ixae029/7822458?rss=1","date":1728950400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Afrotropical Cerurinae (Notodontidae) genera <span>Cerurina</span> Kiriakoff and <span>Afrocerura</span> Kiriakoff are revised. Historically, significant confusion has existed surrounding the identities of members of these 2 closely related genera. Using morphology and genetic data derived from mitochondrial COI barcodes and anchored hybrid enrichment nuclear genomics, we present an integrated taxonomic approach. Upon examining all types, historical material in global collections, and numerous recently collected specimens, we are able to associate available names with the taxa in these genera as well as describe four new species of <span>Afrocerura</span> for which no names were available. Historical misidentifications are also addressed. For nearly all species, both sexes and their genitalia are figured. In total, we recognize one species in <span>Cerurina</span> with 2 subspecies: <span>C. marshalli marshalli</span> Hampson (type species) and <span>C. marshalli cameroona</span> (Bethune-Baker) <strong>comb. n.</strong>, and 8 species in <span>Afrocerura</span>: <span>A. leonensis</span> (Hampson) (type species), <span>A. takanoi</span><strong>sp. n.</strong>, <span>A. bifasciata</span> (Janse), <span>A. inexpectata</span><strong>sp. n.</strong>, <span>A. tanganyikae</span> Kiriakoff <strong>stat. n.</strong>, <span>A. ethiopica</span><strong>sp. n.</strong>, <span>A. thomensis</span> (Talbot) and <span>A. smithi</span><strong>sp. n.</strong> Color photos of <span>C. m. cameroona</span> larvae are presented for the first time and are compared to larvae of <span>C. m. marshalli</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Insect Systematics and Diversity Current Issue","siteHash":"d4d59e2090793e303021830a9c164d689828dc5448b6052be7ec32e87f45cab0","entryHash":"ceb1c04fb50eda9e66ca6dcff42b198fe5332b304a1738dcd4b326c91e8ad072","category":"Environment"}
