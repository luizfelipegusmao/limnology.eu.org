{"title":"Jaya-Based Optimization of Active Elements for Hybrid Relay-Reflecting Intelligent Surface-Assisted Secrecy Wireless Communications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0929/v1","date":1726147820000,"content":"In this work, we investigate how to obtain the optimal active elements in Hybrid Relay-Reflecting Intelligent Surface (HR-RIS) systems while considering enhancing the sum rate of the communication system in the presence of malevolent eavesdropper. Therefore, when dealing with numerous elements in the HR-RIS, the complicated optimization task of activating and deactivating the active elements of RIS renders typical exhaustive search methods impracticable. Standard techniques, such as alternating optimization, often frequently converge and unfortunately become trapped in local optima, leading to less-than-ideal results. To address these issues, we suggest performing the Jaya algorithm, which modifies its search strategy in response to historical data to find a compromise between investigating novel avenues and taking advantage of well-established answers. Our simulation findings demonstrate that this strategy outperforms the most recent techniques, yielding higher sum rates with the best possible user location and robust security against eavesdropping. Itâ€™s interesting to observe that even at lower total power levels, the Jaya algorithm performs incredibly well and efficiently identifies the optimal amount of active elements. This demonstrates how it can decrease interference, increase signal quality, improve Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and increase secrecy rates, opening the door for more efficient and secure wireless communication systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36915834a020f6a94f5ab23cddf55ff90b5ce5757dc87a793bb9c9e7cc09e179","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
