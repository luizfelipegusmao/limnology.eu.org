{"title":"Determination of Ethanol Content in Alcoholic Products by LF-NMR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0209/v1","date":1722665672000,"content":"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a technique used for many years by chemists for elucidation of molecular structure. Technological progress over the years has enabled this technique, making it easier to use. Thus, the LF-NMR (low-field NMR) was introduced as side technique, characterized by low man-agement costs and shorter analysis time than its main counterpart. The application of 1H LF-NMR for the quantification of ethyl alcohol in different alcoholic matrices is herein described, comparing results ob-tained with this technique with those determined by a reference gascromatographic method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61b8e70cd070b3e38e72d2f35a08c491e8d356829aa4183468ef5f7843dc5c3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
