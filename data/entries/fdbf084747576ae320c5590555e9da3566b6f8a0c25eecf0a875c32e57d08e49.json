{"title":"Zooplankton grazing reduces the persistence of an anthropogenic pollution marker in lake water","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12630?af=R","date":1721625501000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Wastewater treatment plant effluents release microbiological pollutants, including the <i>intI</i>1 gene (integrases of class 1 integron), which has been proposed as a target for monitoring anthropogenic pollution in surface waters. This gene correlates with antibiotic resistance genes, making it an important proxy for genetic contamination in aquatic environments. It is currently unclear whether <i>intI</i>1 found in lake water is mainly present due to continuous seeding or if autochthonous bacteria harbor this gene. To better understand the fate and dynamics of class 1 integrons in aquatic systems, we resorted to classical limnological monitoring of <i>intI</i>1 (qPCR) over multiple years in three different size fractions: free-living bacteria, particle-attached bacteria, and zooplankton-attached bacteria. We also conducted experiments to elucidate the impact of grazers on the abundance of <i>intI</i>1. The monitoring of different size fractions of the Lake Maggiore microbial community showed a particle-bound lifestyle for <i>intI</i>1-hosting bacteria. Most of these bacteria originated from both a wastewater effluent that discharges into Lake Maggiore and the lake water itself (amplicon sequencing). We hypothesize that these bacteria grow on particles in open waters, making them particularly vulnerable to grazing by large filter feeders such as <i>Daphnia</i>. Therefore, the presence of <i>Daphnia</i> reduced the abundance of <i>intI</i>1 in lake water, whereas this was not true for other grazers such as <i>Rotaria macrura</i> or <i>Poterioochromonas</i> sp. Our study shows that the food web structure and temporal changes in the lake influence the abundance of <i>intI</i>1 and consequently the assessment of anthropogenic pollution.</p>","author":"Giulia Borgomaneiro, \nAndrea Di Cesare, \nCristiana Callieri, \nGianluca Corno, \nDiego Fontaneto, \nRoberta Piscia, \nEster M.
