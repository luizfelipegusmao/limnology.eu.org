{"title":"Neural Networks through the Lens of Evolutionary Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0506/v1","date":1712549475000,"content":"In this essay, I revisit Neural Networks (NNs) through the lens of evolutionary dynamics. From the two most important features of NNs, I recover the two most general equations of evolutionary dynamics. These two equations may thus serve as a connection between NNs and a body of knowledge that has been built over multiple centuries and has found application across a vast range of disciplines. This connection may therefore also help explain why NNs with the two features in question are applicable across a much broader range of domains than initially envisioned.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e6290856fb94f3c973c382d220e2a06c9b50604827da34bcb158e278e4ebe91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
