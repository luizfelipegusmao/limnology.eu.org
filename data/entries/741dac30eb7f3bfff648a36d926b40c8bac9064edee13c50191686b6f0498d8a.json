{"title":"Frailty prevalence in older adults with atrial fibrillation: A cross-sectional study in a resource-limited setting","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312498","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by José Guillermo Colchado Vallejos, Gonzalo Daniel Quirós López, Tania Tello Rodríguez, Henry Anchante Hernández</p>\r\nBackground/Objectives <p>Frailty is a common condition among older adults and is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including mortality, disability, dysmobility, falls, and hospitalization. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), these risks are further exacerbated. However, evidence linking AF and frailty, particularly in the South American context, is limited. This study aimed to assess frailty and other geriatric conditions in older outpatients with atrial fibrillation in a resource-limited setting in Lima, Peru.</p> Methods <p>In this cross-sectional study, we included adults aged 60 years and older diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who were attending outpatient check-ups. Patients who were hospitalized, receiving chemotherapy induction, or presenting with acute infections or exacerbations were excluded. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess frailty, cognitive impairment, and functional dependence. Statistical analysis was performed using R Studio version 4.3.1, with a significance level set at p &lt; 0.05.</p> Results <p>Among the 200 patients who agreed to participate (mean age 74.76 ± 8.42 years, 41% females), 28.5% exhibited frailty, and 46.5% were classified as prefrail. Frailty and prefrailty were significantly associated with older age (p&lt;0.01), female gender (p = 0.01), illiteracy (p&lt;0.01), heart failure (p&lt;0.01), falls (p&lt;0.05), cognitive impairment (p&lt;0.01), and functional dependence (p&lt;0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between frailty and cognitive impairment (p&lt;0.05), frailty and functional dependence (p&lt;0.05), and cognitive impairment and functional dependence (p&lt;0.05).</p> Conclusions <p>One-third of older outpatients with atrial fibrillation were identified as frail, while half were classified as prefrail. In this population, frailty frequently coexists with cognitive impairment and functional dependence, highlighting the need for timely screening and the implementation of evidence-based interventions for individuals with atrial fibrillation in resource-limited settings.</p>","author":"José Guillermo Colchado Vallejos","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"741dac30eb7f3bfff648a36d926b40c8bac9064edee13c50191686b6f0498d8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
