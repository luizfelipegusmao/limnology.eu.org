{"title":"Expression Profiling of Coding and Noncoding RNAs in the Endometrium of Patients with Endometriosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1609/v1","date":1724400763000,"content":"The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and mRNAs (DEmRNAs) in the endometrium of individuals with and without EMS during the proliferative (P) and secretory (S) phases of the menstrual cycle. Tissues were obtained from 18 control (CT; P-phase [pCT], n=8; S-phase [sCT], n=13) and 23 EMS patients (P-phase [pEMS], n=13; S-phase [sEMS], n=12). DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs were analyzed using total RNA-sequencing. In P-phase, expression of NONHSAG019742.2 and NONHSAT120701.2 was significantly higher in EMS than control patients, that of while NONHSAG048398.2 and NONHSAG016560.2 was lower in EMS patients. In S-phase, expression of NONHSAT000959.2, NONHSAT203423.1, and NONHSAG053769.2 was significantly increased in EMS patients, while that of NONHSAG012105.2 and NONHSAG020839.2 was lower. In addition, the expression of HSD11B2, THBS1, GPX3, and SHISA6 was similar to that of neighboring lncRNAs in both P- and S-phases. In contrast, ELP3 and NR4A1, respectively, were up- or downregulated in pEMS tissues. In sEMS, expression of LAMB3 and HIF1A was increased, while expression of PAM was reduced. Our findings on lncRNAs and mRNAs encourage not only to explore the potential clinical applications of lncRNAs and mRNAs as prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers for EMS but also to gain valuable insights into its pathogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07d6654253d9f6046976203fa52f4a897a5a1263ff2c4cc46aaf3e8194e54c2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
