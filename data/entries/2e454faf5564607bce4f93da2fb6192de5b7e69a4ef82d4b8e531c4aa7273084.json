{"title":"Amphibian Segmentation Clock Models Suggest How Large Genome and Cell Sizes Slow Developmental Rate","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae021/7696341?rss=1","date":1718755200000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Evolutionary increases in genome size, cell volume, and nuclear volume have been observed across the tree of life, with positive correlations documented between all three traits. Developmental tempo slows as genomes, nuclei, and cells increase in size, yet the driving mechanisms are poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we use a mathematical model of the somitogenesis clock to link slowed developmental tempo with changes in intra-cellular gene expression kinetics induced by increasing genome size and nuclear volume. We adapt a well-known somitogenesis clock model to two model amphibian species that vary 10-fold in genome size: <span>Xenopus laevis</span> (3.1 Gb) and <span>Ambystoma mexicanum</span> (32 Gb). Based on simulations and backed by analytical derivations, we identify parameter changes originating from increased genome and nuclear size that slow gene expression kinetics. We simulate biological scenarios for which these parameter changes mathematically recapitulate slowed gene expression in <span>A. mexicanum</span> relative to <span>X. laevis</span>, and we consider scenarios for which additional alterations in gene product stability and chromatin packing are necessary. Results suggest that slowed degradation rates as well as changes induced by increasing nuclear volume and intron length, which remain relatively unexplored, are significant drivers of slowed developmental tempo.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"2e454faf5564607bce4f93da2fb6192de5b7e69a4ef82d4b8e531c4aa7273084","category":"Environment"}
