{"title":"Anti-Aging Integrative Therapy effects: A Clinical Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1110/v1","date":1721012259000,"content":"Telomeres, located at the ends of each chromosome play a vital role in determining cellular fate and aging. Accelerated shortening of telomeres may also result in accelerated aging and occurrence of age-related degenerative diseases. Anti-aging treatments may help in increasing the telomere length along with improving quality of life, reducing dependency for daily life activities, increasing life expectancy and reducing the risks associated with aging.  \nIn this study, we evaluated the effect of anti-aging integrative therapy in 36 individuals. The treatment included a combination of HBOT, ozone therapy, colon hydrotherapy, etc. Telomere length was used as a biomarker for objectively quantifying the outcome of the treatment. The effect of treatment was also assessed on various aging symptoms. \nAt the end of the treatment, it was found that that 97.22% individuals showed an increase in telomere length with an average increase of 0.43 Kbp and 94.44% individuals showed reduced biological age with an average decrease of 3.8 years. These improvements were statistically significant. Improvements were also recorded in the majority of the symptoms. No major adverse events were observed. These results indicate that antiaging integrative therapy has the potential to reverse aging symptoms, cellular aging and improve quality of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4ebc7a72cfc5ce35b7032475243de5b4c24beaffe5ec8e1145fb5b682405691","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
