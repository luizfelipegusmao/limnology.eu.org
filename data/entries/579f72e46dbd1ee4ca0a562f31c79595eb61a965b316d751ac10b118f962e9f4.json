This study evaluates the interaction between silicon sources and 3 rice cultivars (BRS Esmeralda, Canela de Ferro, and IRGA 417) and examines how increasing silicon levels affect the stylet probing behavior of <span>G. spinosa</span>. The experiment was set up in a completely randomized design with a 3 × 3 factorial scheme (silicon sources: calcium silicate, potassium silicate, a control, and 3 rice cultivars). Fertilizing rice plants with Si altered the probing behavior of the stink bug <span>G. spinosa</span>. The cultivar interaction by Si source was significant in a few variables. This was evidenced by longer periods without ingestion, prolonged time to the first stylet probe (initial probing), and less time spent in cellular maceration. This result supports the use of electropenetrography as a tool to evaluate resistance inducers in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"579f72e46dbd1ee4ca0a562f31c79595eb61a965b316d751ac10b118f962e9f4","category":"Environment"}
