{"title":"Elucidating the effect of drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction on insulin signaling and glucose handling in skeletal muscle cell line (C2C12) <i>in vitro</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310406","date":1726581600000,"content":"<p>by Auxiliare Kuretu, Mamosheledi Mothibe, Phikelelani Ngubane, Ntethelelo Sibiya</p>\r\n\r\nEfavirenz, tenofovir, rifampicin, simvastatin, lamotrigine and clarithromycin are known potential mitochondrial toxicants. Mitochondrial toxicity has been reported to disrupt the chain of events in the insulin signalling pathway. Considering the upward trajectory of diabetes mellitus prevalence, studies which seek to uncover probable risk factors for developing diabetes should be encouraged. This study aimed to evaluate the intracellular mechanisms leading to the development of insulin resistance in the presence of various conventional pharmacological agents reported as potential mitochondrial toxicants in skeletal muscle cell line. Differentiated C2C12 preparations were exposed to multiple concentrations of efavirenz, tenofovir, rifampicin, simvastatin, lamotrigine, and clarithromycin, separately. Glucose handling was evaluated by observing the changes in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and assessing the changes in GLUT4 translocation, GLUT4 expression and Akt expression. The changes in mitochondrial function were evaluated by assessing mitochondrial membrane integrity, cellular ATP production, generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, expression of tafazzin and quantification of medium malonaldehyde. Insulin stimulated glucose uptake was perturbed in C2C12 pre-treated with potential mitotoxicants. Additionally, ATP synthesis, alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, excessive accumulation of ROS and malonaldehyde were observed in the presence of potential mitotoxicants. Particularly, we observed suppression of proteins involved in the insulin signalling pathway and maintenance of mitochondrial function namely GLUT4, Akt and tafazzin. Mitochondrial toxicants can potentially induce insulin resistance emanating from mitochondrial dysfunction. These new findings will contribute to the understanding of underlying mechanisms involved in the development of insulin resistance linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.","author":"Auxiliare Kuretu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"295ca3df690e4c1ace2f6f2bf3021474c9c98fb89a908f24580cec5c1d679bab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
