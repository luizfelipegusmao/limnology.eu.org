{"title":"A Topological Representation of Chiral Spin Liquid by Knot Lattice and Thurston Train Track","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2365/v1","date":1722307142000,"content":"A topological representation theory of chiral spin liquid is proposed to unify the integral and fractional quantum Hall fluid based on hyperbolic geometry, knot lattice and Thurston's train track theory. The integral and fractional Hall resistivity obeys an exact unified equation, $R_{xy} = (h/e^2)B_{e}$, $B_{e} = (n+\\nu)^{-1}$, with respect to the bulk energy gap ${\\Delta}E = {\\hbar{e}B_{e}}/{Mc}$. The Wen-Zee matrix formulation of topological fluid for quantum Hall effect is constructed by topological surgery and train track. The chirality of spin liquid is spontaneously distinguished by Jones polynomial. The integral Chern number for Hall conductance is fractionalized by generalizing Thurston's train track to folding laminations in three dimensions, which spontaneously bring fractional quantum Hall fluid and anyons into three dimensions and provided an theoretical explanation on the competing fractional quantum Hall states. The many body system of interacting fermions or bosons are mapped into many interacting liquid droplets that interwind into knot lattice, which provide an effective topological representation for superfluid and superconductor, the strange metal state in superconductor is explained by topological dislocation and topological surgery. The Kauffman decomposition rule in knot theory is extended to describe the topological relations between different two dimensional manifolds, which further reveals the non-trivial relationship between the partition functions of pairing fermions and free electrons. The minimal energy state is the most stable topological state, even thought it maybe shares the same topological number with the excited states. The topological representation theory predicts a circular motion of electrons in hyperbolic space, that is implementable and testable by inhomogeneous magnetic field in three dimensions. The folding lamination representation of topological quantum fluid provides an promising implementation of string theory in high energy physics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dad285b1376721d426a126e5c7398bc01f7e7fa5e2f6732c07ac098d680e131e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
