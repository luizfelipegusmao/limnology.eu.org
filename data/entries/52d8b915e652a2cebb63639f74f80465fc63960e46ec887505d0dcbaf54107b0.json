{"title":"How to achieve high-quality development of SRDI enterprises—A study of the TOE framework-based configuration","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304688","date":1717423200000,"content":"<p>by Zhihong Zhang, Hua Feng, Lulu Wang, Lingyun Yang</p>\r\n\r\nThe high-quality development of SRDI enterprises is crucial for China to overcome critical technological bottlenecks and thereby achieve technological independence and strength. However, the factors driving the high-quality development of SRDI enterprises are not isolated elements, but rather a complex system of interconnected antecedents. This study employs the TOE framework and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) with 141 Chinese SRDI “little giant” listed companies as samples to explore how various factors contribute to their high-quality development. The findings indicate: (1) No single factor is necessary for SRDI enterprises’ high-quality development. (2) It is the synergy of multiple factors, in various combinations, that drives their high-quality development. (3) Technological innovation plays a key role in these pathways; SRDI enterprises should leverage their resources and capabilities for a synergistic technology-organization-environment match, selecting the most suitable development path. The results of this study not only enrich our understanding of the factors influencing SRDI enterprises’ high-quality development but also offer insights for both the enterprises and government policy-making.","author":"Zhihong Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"52d8b915e652a2cebb63639f74f80465fc63960e46ec887505d0dcbaf54107b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
