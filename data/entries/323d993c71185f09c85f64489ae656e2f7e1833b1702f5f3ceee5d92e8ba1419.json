{"title":"Microcystis viridis NIES-102 Algae Lectin MVL Interacts with the COVID-19 Spike Protein RBDs via Protein-Protein Interaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1633/v1","date":1716552722000,"content":"The emergence of the coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) has posed a major challenge to healthcare systems worldwide, especially as COVID-19 mutations complicate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, the search for natural products with broad anti-COVID-19 capabilities is an important option for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Lectins, which are widely recognized as antiviral agents, could contribute to the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. In this study, we evaluated the binding ability of a total of six lectins, including MVL from Microcystis viridis NIES-102, to the spike protein RBD of the original (wild) COVID-19 and itâ€™s three mutants: alpha, delta, and omicron. As a result, two lectins, MVL from Microcystis viridis NIES-102 and jacalin from Artocarpus altilis, showed distinct binding ability to the RBDs of the four COVID-19 strains. The other lectins (DB1, ConA, PHA-M and CSL3) did not show any binding ability. Although the glycan specificities of the two lectins, MVL and Jacalin, were different, they showed the same affinity for the RBDs of the four COVID-19 strains, i.e., alpha &amp;gt; delta &amp;gt; original &amp;gt; omicron. The verification of glycan-specific inhibition revealed that jacalin binds to RBDs by glycan-specific recognition, whereas MVL binds to RBDs by protein-protein interactions in addition to glycan-specific recognition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"323d993c71185f09c85f64489ae656e2f7e1833b1702f5f3ceee5d92e8ba1419","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
