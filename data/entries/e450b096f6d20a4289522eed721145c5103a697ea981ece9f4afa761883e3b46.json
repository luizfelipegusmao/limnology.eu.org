{"title":"Pharmacists&rsquo; Behavioral Change after Attending a Palliative Care Education Program in a Multi-Prefecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0714/v1","date":1712730027000,"content":"Pharmacists must acquire the necessary knowledge to provide better drug therapy to patients. In other words, educational programs need to facilitate behavioral changes among pharmacists. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate how the behavior of pharmacists changed after attending a palliative care educational program. We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey examining the behavior of pharmacists regarding palliative care before participating in the program, two months after participating in the program, and eight months after participating in the program, to determine the behavior and changes over time. For all questions, scores were higher at two and eight months after attending the program than before attending the program (P &amp;lt;0.05). In addition, no significant difference was observed between two and eight months after attending the program for all questions (P =0.504-1.000). The knowledge gained from the educational program was used to repeatedly intervene with patients with cancer, to address the various symptoms they experienced and maintain their behavior. The proven effectiveness of this program serves as a stepping stone for a nationwide rollout across Japanâ€™s 47 prefectures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e450b096f6d20a4289522eed721145c5103a697ea981ece9f4afa761883e3b46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
