{"title":"Effects of Autologous Conditioned Serum on Non-union After Open Reduction Internal Fixation Failure: A Case Series and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0920/v1","date":1723537313000,"content":"Non-union is one of the severe complications of traumatic fracture and still no standard therapeutic recommendations currently. A total of eleven patients were treated on the lesions for non-union, after the failure of open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) or total hip replacement, by autologous conditioned serum (ACS) for one to three times monthly and followed up. Seven patients received ACS three times, three patients received it two times, and the only one who underwent total hip replacement received it once. Ten patients achieved union at the last follow-up visit, indicating the effectiveness of ACS on patients who suffered from non-union after ORIF. ACS has the potential as an alternative or adjective treatment for non-union and is worthy to be investigated further for the benefits of patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50298dc664c2f8fa5e7b96c1fa00ed6ad09dc21fd2a086624183a5a367c80e80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
