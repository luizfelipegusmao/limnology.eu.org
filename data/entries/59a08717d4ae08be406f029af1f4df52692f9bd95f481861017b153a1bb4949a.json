{"title":"Integration of Industry 4.0 with reliability centered maintenance to enhance sustainable manufacturing","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14321?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Achieving sustainability in manufacturing requires optimizing reliability and productivity while reducing environmental impact. This article introduces a novel approach by integrating Industry 4.0 technologies with reliability centered maintenance (RCM) to create a “smart RCM” model. In an era where Industry 4.0 leverages the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber physical systems (CPSs), cloud computing, and cognitive computing, this integration transforms conventional RCM into a data-driven and efficient system. A case study conducted in a cement plant illustrates the benefits of smart RCM implementation. Key performance indicators (KPI), including increased production volume, reduced downtime, enhanced mean time between failures (MTBF), and improved overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), showcase the positive impact of smart RCM. Furthermore, specific environmental performance indicators, such as energy consumption, carbon footprint, and water consumption, exhibit favorable changes, contributing to sustainability. The implementation of smart RCM also presents an attractive payback period, making it an appealing approach for industries looking to optimize maintenance practices and environmental performance. Despite potential challenges in workforce adaptation and resistance, the integration of Industry 4.0 with RCM emerges as a transformative strategy.</p>","author":"Madhab Chandra Jena, \nSarat Kumar Mishra, \nHimanshu Sekhar Moharana","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"59a08717d4ae08be406f029af1f4df52692f9bd95f481861017b153a1bb4949a","category":"Environment"}
