{"title":"Phytochemical, Antioxidant, and Antidiabetic Activity of Centaurium erythraea Rafn. Decoction and Soxhlet Extraction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1374/v1","date":1724077547000,"content":"The medicinal herb Centaurium erythraea is well-known for its natural ability to treat digestive issues like dyspepsia and liver insufficiency by promoting the secretions of the liver and esophagus. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of Centaurium erythraea extracts in treating diabetes. Decoction and Soxhlet procedures were used to examine the extracts, with water serving as the solvent. The extracts were tested for antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial effects, and inhibitory effects on alpha-amylase activity. In comparison to the aqueous extract, the decocted extract had higher levels of polyphenols, total tannins, and anthocyanins, as well as more effective antioxidant capacities. Due to its reduction of alpha-amylase activity and enteric absorption of glucose, Centaurium erythraea has also shown considerable anti-hyperglycemic action.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7e90cb809c2506e7bd4ef3129d36c2cf8bf1f21b894a1f1dba7b4fc6127d223","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
