{"title":"Cold Plasma Gliding Arc Reactor System for Nanoparticles&rsquo; Removal From Diesel Cars Exhaust Gases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1063/v1","date":1720927971000,"content":"The main goal was to investigate the ability of non-thermal plasma reactor with gliding arc discharge to remove the diesel exhaust particulates (DEPs). A conventional knifed-shaped LTP GA reactor was utilized. Three cases were studied: 140 L/min, 70 L/min and 14 L/min of air drawn through the reactor and diesel exhaust fumes were sampled continuously. They were assayed in terms of concentration and number particle size distribution. The higher the residence time’s, the higher the energy input that may be utilized for DEPs’ removal. Reactor’s performance definitely lowered the concentration of DEPs (250 - 580 nm) and altered their number size distribution. There was no effect on the number concentration, nor on the particle size distribution, of DEP particulates of 10 – 250 nm in size. The effectiveness of DEPs’ removal: Decreasing flow rate from 140 L/min to 70 L/min somehow altered the values. Achieving the airflow of 14 L/min led to a substantial improvement (even to a fourfold increase for 300 – 480 nm particles). Non-thermal plasma reactors with gliding arc discharge may be successfully adapted in the process of DEPs’ treatment. Their performance may be optimized by adjusting the airflow at the inlet of reactor to guarantee the longest aerosol residence times and the highest removal efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9153c3332be098af05ddf3bff0515f6f9e0fd6111d986714c30e09577f79597","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
