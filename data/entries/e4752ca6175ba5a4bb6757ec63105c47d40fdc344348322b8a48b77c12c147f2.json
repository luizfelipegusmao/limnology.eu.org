{"title":"Synthesis and Investigation of Biological Activity of a Number of New Betulonic Acid Derivatives Containing 1,2,3-Triazole Fragments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0465/v1","date":1717739843000,"content":"A number of chemical modifications were carried out in order to synthesize new compounds based on the triterpenoid betulonic acid. Triazolation reactions were carried out for the synthesis of new 1,2,3-triazole derivatives based on betulonic acid. Chemical changes were made on the carbonyl group at the C-3 position of the initial molecule and on the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups at the C-28 position. Chromatographic methods were used to separate and purify the formed products. Spectroscopic (NMR-, mass-) methods were used to establish the structure of synthesized compounds. As a result of the chemical transformations carried out, a number of new derivatives of betulonic acid were obtained. All synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. As a result, compounds with pronounced antimicrobial activity were identified.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4752ca6175ba5a4bb6757ec63105c47d40fdc344348322b8a48b77c12c147f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
