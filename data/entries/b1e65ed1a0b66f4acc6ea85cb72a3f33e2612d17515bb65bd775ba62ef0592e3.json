{"title":"Genome-wide association study of the loci and candidate genes associated with agronomic traits in <i>Amomum villosum</i> Lour","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306806","date":1722866400000,"content":"<p>by Wenxiu Li, Ping Luo, Yunfeng Shi, Hualin Zhang, Qing Yan, Yana Ye, Yanli Yao, Junjun He</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Amomum villosum</i> Lour. (<i>A</i>. <i>villosum</i>) is a valuable herbaceous plant that produces the famous traditional Chinese medicine Amori Fructus. Identifying molecular markers associated with the growth of <i>A</i>. <i>villosum</i> can facilitate molecular marker-assisted breeding of the plant. This study employed 75 <i>A</i>. <i>villosum</i> accessions as the test material and utilized 71 pairs of polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers to genotype the population. The study analyzed the association between SSR markers and phenotypic traits through the linkage imbalance and population structure analysis. Candidate genes associated with the molecular markers were also identified. The results showed that the phenotypic diversity index range of the 12 agronomic traits was 4.081â€“4.312 and conformed to a normal distribution. Moreover, 293 allelic variations were detected in the 75 accessions, with an average of 5.32 amplified alleles per loci, ranging from 3 to 8. The maximum number of amplified alleles for AVL12 was 8. The population structure and cluster analysis indicated that the accessions could be divided into two subgroups. Using the mixed linear model (MLM) model of population structure (Q)+kinship matrix (K) for association analysis, three SSR molecular markers significantly associated with the agronomic traits were detected. Fluorescence quantification was used to analyze the expression levels of six candidate genes, and it was found that three of the genes were differentially expressed in phenotypically different accessions. This study is the first to use SSR markers for genome-wide association study (GWAS) mapping and identification of the associated agronomic traits in <i>A</i>. <i>villosum</i>. The results of this study provide a basis for identifying genetic markers for growth traits for marker-assisted breeding in <i>A</i>. <i>villosum</i>.","author":"Wenxiu Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b1e65ed1a0b66f4acc6ea85cb72a3f33e2612d17515bb65bd775ba62ef0592e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
