{"title":"Gaia-X-Med: Experiences with Building Dataspaces for Medical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1403/v1","date":1729162410000,"content":"Gaia-X, a European initiative, aims to create a digital sovereignty framework for service ecosystems in the future internet. Its applicability to the health domain has been explored in the Gaia-X-Med project, which aimed to establish a common dataspace for various medical use cases based on Gaia-X principles. This paper presents the approach to secure authentication and digital contract negotiation central to this endeavour and discusses the challenges that arose during adoption of the Gaia-X framework, in particular relating to the strict requirements of the European healthcare domain with regards to privacy and consent regulations. By exploring the practical implications of Gaia-X in the healthcare context, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions surrounding digital sovereignty of both citizens and corporations, as well as its realization via future internet technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6bc3946af280af8fb9196eeef564a0499ab0f018c0ab26ac49920df158b82be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
