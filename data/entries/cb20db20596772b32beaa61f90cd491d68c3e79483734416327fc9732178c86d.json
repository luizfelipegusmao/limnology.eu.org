{"title":"Mature MUC5AC Expression in Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Predicts the Treatment Response And Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0605/v1","date":1720447961000,"content":"Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has recently gained prominence. We investigated the clinical significance of mucin 5 AC (MUC5AC), which exists in two major glycoforms, a less-glycosylated immature isoform (IM) and a heavi-ly-glycosylated mature isoform (MM), as a biomarker in resected PDA. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 100 resected PDAs to evaluate the expression of IM and MM isoforms of MUC5AC using respective monoclonal antibodies CLH2 (NBP2-44455) and 45M1 (ab3649). MUC5AC localization (cytoplasmic, apical, and extra-cellular, EC) was determined, and H-scores were calculated. Univariate and multivariate (MVA) Cox regression models were used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Of 100 resected PDA patients, 43 received NAT, and 57 were treatment-na√Øve with upfront surgery (UpS). In the study population (N=100), IM expression (objective response vs. no response vs. UpS = H-scores 104 vs. 152 vs. 163, p=0.01) and MM-MUC5AC detection rates (56% vs. 63% vs. 82%, p=0.02) were significantly different. In the NAT-group, MM-MUC5AC-negative patients had significantly better PFS on MVA (Hazard Ratio, 0.2, 95 % CI: 0.059-0.766, p = 0.01). Similar results were noted in a FOLFIRINOX sub-group (N=36). We established an association of MUC5AC expression with treatment response and outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb20db20596772b32beaa61f90cd491d68c3e79483734416327fc9732178c86d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
