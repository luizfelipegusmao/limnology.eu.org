{"title":"Higher Blood Neuropeptide Y Concentration Is Associated with Better Prognosis After Surgery for Colorectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1337/v1","date":1729128506000,"content":"Background: The early identification of patients at risk of peri-procedural complications and poor prognosis is very important. We conducted our study to determine if there are associations between serum orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) concentration and nutritional status, and prognosis among patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC).\nMaterials and Methods: A cohort study with a 3-month follow-up was conducted with 84 consecutive inpatients who underwent elective surgery in one center between 2016 and 2019 for primary CRC. In all patients, clinical characteristics and nutritional status were assessed.  In a long-term follow-up (median; IQR: 1322; 930-1788 days; average 3.6 years), the patients’ survival status was checked during a telephone visit.\nResults: Before CRC surgery, patients with serum NPY concentration equal to or higher than the median value (661.70 pg/ml) had, in comparison to individuals with lower blood NPY concentration, higher scores in Mini Nutritional Assessment, Barthel, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaires, greater handgrip strength, a lower score in the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment, almost a three times lower risk of perioperative complications, as well as, at the 3-month follow-up visit, higher Barthel and IADL scores and larger calf circumference. Higher blood NPY concentration was predictive of a low Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 score at the 3-month visit, and significantly influenced patients’ survival during the 1200 days after CRC surgery. \nConclusions: Higher blood NPY concentration was associated with lower nutritional risk, more favorable patient nutritional and functional status, and better survival during the 1200 days after CRC surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3cb7ef7e7f317ce8aa6a3b95b0ccb1cc73c452a92d14b5eb8a4b166db69825b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
