{"title":"Particulate threats: aryl hydrocarbon receptor, alveolar epithelium, environmentally persistent free radicals, and endothelial dysfunction","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/2/161/7681917?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span>Particulate matter is a criteria air pollutant that is generated primarily by vehicular exhaust, coal-burning power plants, wildfires/woodsmoke, and dust (<a href=\"#kfae036-B4\">Bhatnagar, 2022</a>). Exposure to elevated levels of ambient particulate matter has a multitude of health effects with cardiopulmonary effects being the most prominent in both epidemiological and laboratory studies (<a href=\"#kfae036-B4\">Bhatnagar, 2022</a>; <a href=\"#kfae036-B10\">Thompson, 2018</a>). Particulate matter is known to contain environmentally persistent free radicals which are generated upon chemicals adsorbing onto the metal oxides on the particle surface. Environmentally persistent free radicals are found on a variety of different particulate matter sources and are stable which can augment known health effects including oxidative stress in the lung and systemically (<a href=\"#kfae036-B5\">Dellinger <span>et al.</span>, 2007</a>). However, the mechanism by which inhalation of particulate matter and/or environmentally persistent free radicals leads to systemic health effects including cardiovascular dysfunction remains unclear. This gap in our understanding limits our appreciation for environmentally persistent free radical-mediated toxicity and the development of interventional approaches to address inhalation exposure-induced systemic diseases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"2c883a04fe10d70593b49410475b198ffae814a5a92b65247d3a87acd273131d","category":"Environment"}
