{"title":"Enhancing Prostate Cancer Staging: Association of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Imaging with Histopathological Grading in Treatment-Naive Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2221/v1","date":1727437113000,"content":"Objective: The study aims to evaluate the correlation between 68Ga-PSMA uptake in PSMA PET/CT in primary prostate cancer (PC) and its histopathological grading (Gleason Score and ISUP grade). Additionally, we compared preoperative biopsy histopathological findings with definitive pathology results in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.\nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed 86 patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for primary PC staging, of which 40 patients later underwent radical prostatectomy. PET/CT results, including SUVmax values, were correlated with GS and PSA concentrations. Histopathology reports were analyzed and compared between biopsy and final pathology results following RP.\nResults: A significant positive correlation was observed between SUVmax and ISUP grades (Pearson's ρ = 0.34, p &lt; 0.001), with higher SUVmax values associated with more advanced grades. A cut-off SUVmax value of 5.64 was determined to predict upstaging in patients, yielding a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 60% (AUC = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.94). Additionally, 57.5% of patients experienced a grade shift following RP, with a 35% upgrade and 22.5% downgrade in ISUP grades.\nConclusion: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting high-risk prostate cancer, particularly in patients with GS &gt; 7 or PSA levels ≥ 10 ng/ml. The findings suggest that this imaging modality may be less effective for staging of patients with lower GS or PSA values, that is low-risk PCa. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate these results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c0d7dbec5c5fabd9bbd99954cc752e9596f17b539ff0c8f6dbb78f986bb0fc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
