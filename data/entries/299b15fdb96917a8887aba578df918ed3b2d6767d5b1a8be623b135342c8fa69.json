{"title":"A study of illegal dumping near coastal zones and waterways in Grenada: Advancing waste management solutions and reducing marine litter","link":"https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000175","date":1711980000000,"content":"<p>by Roxanne E.

This study aims to investigate the causes of illegal dumping on the island, as well as potential solutions to mitigate its impact on the environment, public health, and the local economy. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) software, illegal dumpsites were mapped and the Lau, Whyte, and Law (2008) methodology for quantifying waste volume was applied to the study. Data were gathered manually via field work for over two months, including collecting information on illegal dumping sitesâ€™ waste type, quantity in terms of volume, and location, supplemented by photographs. Waste was classified into thirteen primary categories, such as construction and demolition (C&amp;D), derelict vehicles and parts, electronic waste, glass, household/domestic waste, medical, healthcare, hygiene-related waste, metals, organic waste, paper and cardboard, plastics, textiles, used tires, white goods, and treated wood piles. The study estimated a total volume of approximately 35, 000 ft<sup>3</sup> of waste from 29 unauthorized dumpsites. Out of these sites, C&amp;D waste and plastics were the most dominant type of debris. The generated map offers valuable insights for Grenadian authorities to enhance their solid waste management system. It was revealed that rural and agricultural communities are more susceptible to illegal dumping and the underlying reasons for this issue was further investigated. Furthermore, interviews were conducted with key informants in waste management, marine pollution, and environmental and coastal affairs from other English-speaking Windward Islands. This approach facilitated the identification of shared patterns and the development of more effective, collaborative solutions across the country and region. The research findings can inform policy decisions and community-based initiatives aimed at reducing illegal dumping, fostering environmental responsibility, promoting sustainable waste management practices, and safeguarding the health and resilience of small island ecosystems.","author":"Roxanne E.
