Current approach relies on lamella FIB milling to a thickness constrained to around 200 nm to maximize the image contrast and still preserve needed resolution. STEM tomography is advantageous than conventional ET in that it allows for imaging of thick biological samples as depth of focus can be easily adjusted by controlling semi-convergence angle (CA) [<a href=\"#ozae044.380-B1\">1</a>] to adapt to sample thickness. Recently STEM-integrated differential phase contrast imaging method (iDPC) proved to be superior to TEM and STEM annular bright field imaging in terms of contrast and signal-to-noise ratio [<a href=\"#ozae044.380-B2\">2</a>]. Cryo STEM-iDPC was used in single particle analysis on several known test samples and demonstrated comparable resolution to conventional cryo-EM [<a href=\"#ozae044.380-B3\">3</a>]. Although the two above-mentioned work demonstrated STEM-iDPC for imaging thick biological samples, actual optimal imaging conditions, which are critical and sample dependent, have yet been explored and customized for tomography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"26d27552aaae8abc254c794c78c78397bb578ef498f5690170b1ee7694fcf875","category":"Environment"}
