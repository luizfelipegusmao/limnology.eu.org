In this paper, we present innovative application descriptions arising from this technology convergence and its future-generation applications. We found that AI brings strong cyber security, predictive maintenance, and decision-making capabilities to the table due to its advanced algorithms and machine learning models. IoT has the potential to allow businesses to extract and generate big data, automate processes, and monitor in real-time thousands and even millions of businesses at once. For now, we believe some of the possible main conclusions will be that the smart city, stand-alone systems, and user experience will be quite consumer-friendly. Importantly, the study also assessed facets such as data protection, system interoperability, and a few others. Our vision underscores the essential of a strong structure to connect the full latent of AI and IoT, finally aiming to create more capable, protected, and approachable environments. Significant results include achieving 95.8% accuracy in anomaly detection and 93.4% accuracy in predictive maintenance. The showcasing results efficacy of AI models to enhance system reliability as well as operational efficiency. Vigorous encryption protocols performance ensures data security hence addressing issues of privacy. These culminations underscore the transformative potential of AI-IoT integration in next-generation automation and security applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c20b088b187a3ae4d71b8b97355c5e502122b95710dc6e8550cdab3374a4d1fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
