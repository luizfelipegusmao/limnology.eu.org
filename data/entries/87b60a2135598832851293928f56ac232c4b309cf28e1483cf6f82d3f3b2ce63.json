{"title":"Exploring the In Vitro Effects of Zingerone on Differentiation and Signalling Pathways in Bone Cell Lines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1498/v1","date":1729249164000,"content":"Objective: Ensuring bone health is crucial for preventing conditions such as osteoporosis and fractures. Zingerone, a phytochemical compound, has gained attention for its potential benefits in bone health. This study evaluated the osteoprotective potential of zingerone and its effects on differentiation and signalling pathways in vitro using SAOS-2 osteosarcoma and RAW264.7 macrophage cell lines, aiming to elucidate its mechanism of action in bone metabolism. Methods: SAOS-2 osteosarcoma and RAW264.7 macrophage cells were treated with zingerone at concentrations of 0.1-200µM. Osteoblast differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, bone mineralisation via alizarin red S stain and gene expression markers (ALP, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin) via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Osteoclast differentiation was evaluated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, TRAP activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Results: Zingerone at 200µM, did not significantly enhance mineralization in SAOS-2 cells, but upregulated ALP and Runx2 gene expression (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, zingerone significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation in RAW264.7 cells as evidenced by reduced TRAP staining and activity (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The moderate anti-osteoclastic effects of zingerone suggest its potential role in preserving bone mass by reducing bone resorption. This study provides new insights into how zingerone modulates bone cell activity, highlighting its potential as a dietary supplement for bone health. Further research, including its underlying mechanisms for bone-related disorders and in vivo and clinical studies, is needed to fully understand its clinical relevance in bone-related disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87b60a2135598832851293928f56ac232c4b309cf28e1483cf6f82d3f3b2ce63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
