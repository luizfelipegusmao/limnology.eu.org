Psychosocial tests including the Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), College Student Life Satisfaction Scale (CSLSS), General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were completed. Correlations between variables were calculated using Pearson's test. The mediation model was tested using the SPSS 26.0 PROCESS macro and regression bootstrap. \nResults: Physical activity showed a negative correlation with anxiety (β= -0.1617, p &lt; 0.001), life satisfaction and self-efficacy played a role in the relationship between physical activity and anxiety, and, more importantly, physical activity affected anxiety through the parallel mediating effects of life satisfaction and self-efficacy, with a total mediating effect of 55.34%. \nConclusion: By increasing college students' participation in physical activity, it helps to promote the growth of their life satisfaction and self-efficacy, which is the key to reducing anxiety and promoting college students' mental health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b64bc101f482ded024d51a7ca54d1f8d74986e56cd7628ae19d3416c0df27b37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
