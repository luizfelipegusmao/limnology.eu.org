The increase in generalist and/or widespread species was the major cause of biological homogenization and alleviated the negative impact of land use on biodiversity associated with the loss of specialist taxa, but increased the risk of losing functional diversity. Besides colonization ability in human land-use systems, homogenization of prey/host taxa and environmental factors contributed to the biological homogenization of soil protists.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Humans have substantially transformed the global land surface, resulting in the decline in variation in biotic communities across scales, a phenomenon known as “biological homogenization.” However, different biota are affected by biological homogenization to varying degrees, but this variation and the underlying mechanisms remain little studied, particularly in soil systems. To address this topic, we used metabarcoding to investigate the biogeography of soil protists and their prey/hosts (prokaryotes, fungi, and meso- and macrofauna) in three human land-use ecosystem types (farmlands, residential areas, and parks) and natural forest ecosystems across subtropical and temperate regions in China. Our results showed that the degree of community homogenization largely differed between taxa and functional groups of soil protists, and was strongly and positively linked to their colonization ability of human land-use systems. Removal analysis showed that the introduction of widespread, generalist taxa (OTUs, operational taxonomic units) rather than the loss of narrow-ranged, specialist OTUs was the major cause of biological homogenization. This increase in generalist OTUs seemingly alleviated the negative impact of land use on specialist taxa, but carried the risk of losing functional diversity. Finally, homogenization of prey/host biota and environmental conditions were also important drivers of biological homogenization in human land-use systems, with their importance being more pronounced in phagotrophic than parasitic and phototrophic protists. Overall, our study showed that the variation in biological homogenization strongly depends on the colonization ability of taxa in human land-use systems, but is also affected by the homogenization of resources and environmental conditions. Importantly, biological homogenization is not the major cause of the decline in the diversity of soil protists, and conservation and study efforts should target at taxa highly sensitive to local extinction, such as parasites.</p>","author":"Zhi‐Peng Li, \nHua‐Yuan Shangguan, \nHaifeng Yao, \nXiao‐Ru Yang, \nYuri Mazei, \nBiao Zhu, \nStefan Scheu, \nXin Sun","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"86e3bdf2e4bff5f4131e06d3f3e29aeaceb831c2282e3086c6ca3ed3719218e5","category":"Environment"}
