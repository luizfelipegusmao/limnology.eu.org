{"title":"Temperature and body size affect movement of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens) at nearshore nurseries","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15850?af=R","date":1719391511000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Seasonal migrations of marine fish between shallow summer feeding habitats and deep overwintering grounds are driven by fluctuations in the biotic and abiotic environment as well as by changes in the internal state. Ontogenetic shifts in physiology and metabolism affect the response to environmental drivers and may lead to changes in migration timing and propensity. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature and body size on migration timing and depth distribution in acoustically tagged Atlantic cod, <i>Gadus morhua</i>, and saithe, <i>Pollachius virens</i>, during the period of seasonal migration from shallow summer habitats. The results from our study revealed a wide range of horizontal and vertical distribution of age 1 and 2 <i>G. morhua</i> within the fjord. Larger <i>G. morhua</i> inhabited deeper, cooler waters than smaller juveniles, likely reflecting size-dependent thermal preferences and predation pressure. Conversely, juvenile <i>P. virens</i> occupied primarily shallow waters close to land. The variation in depth distribution of <i>G. morhua</i> was mainly explained by body size and not, against our predictions, by water temperature. Conversely, the dispersal from the in-fjord habitats occurred when water temperatures were high, suggesting that seasonal temperature fluctuations can trigger the migration timing of <i>P. virens</i> and larger <i>G. morhua</i> from summer habitats. Partial migration of small juvenile <i>G. morhua</i> from in-fjord foraging grounds, likely influenced by individual body condition, suggested seasonal migration as a flexible strategy that individuals may use to reduce predation and energetic expenditure. Predation mortality rates of tagged juveniles were higher than previously suggested and are the first robust predation mortality rates for juvenile <i>G. morhua</i> and <i>P. virens</i> estimated based on acoustic transmitters with acidity sensors. The results have relevance for climate-informed marine spatial planning as under the scenario of increasing ocean temperatures, increasing summer temperatures may reduce the juveniles' resource utilization in the shallow summer nurseries, resulting in lower growth rates, increased predation pressure, and lower chances of juvenile winter survival.</p>","author":"Anja K.
