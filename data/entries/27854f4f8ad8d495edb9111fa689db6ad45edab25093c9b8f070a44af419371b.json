However, the continental-scale leaf phenology-photosynthesis nexus over TEFs is still poorly understood to date. This knowledge gap hinders most light use efficiency (LUE) models from accurately simulating the GPP seasonality in TEFs. Leaf age is the crucial plant trait to link the dynamics of leaf phenology with GPP seasonality. Thus, here we incorporated the seasonal leaf area index of different leaf age cohorts into a widely used LUE model (i.e., EC-LUE) and proposed a novel leaf age-dependent LUE model (denoted as LA-LUE model). At the site level, the LA-LUE model (average <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = .59, average root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 1.23 gC m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) performs better than the EC-LUE model in simulating the GPP seasonality across the nine TEFs sites (average <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = .18; average RMSE = 1.87 gC m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>). At the continental scale, the monthly GPP estimates from the LA-LUE model are consistent with FLUXCOM GPP data (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = .80; average RMSE = 1.74 gC m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), and satellite-based GPP data retrieved from the global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) product (GOSIF) (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = .64; average RMSE = 1.90 gC m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) and the reconstructed TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument SIF dataset using machine learning algorithms (RTSIF) (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = .78; average RMSE = 1.88 gC m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>). Typically, the estimated monthly GPP not only successfully represents the unimodal GPP seasonality near the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, but also captures well the bimodal GPP seasonality near the Equator. Overall, this study for the first time integrates the leaf age information into the satellite-based LUE model and provides a feasible implementation for mapping the continental-scale GPP seasonality over the entire TEFs.</p>","author":"Jie Tian, \nXueqin Yang, \nWenping Yuan, \nShangrong Lin, \nLiusheng Han, \nYi Zheng, \nXiaosheng Xia, \nLiyang Liu, \nMei Wang, \nWei Zheng, \nLei Fan, \nKai Yan, \nXiuzhi Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"27854f4f8ad8d495edb9111fa689db6ad45edab25093c9b8f070a44af419371b","category":"Environment"}
