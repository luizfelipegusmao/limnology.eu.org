{"title":"Research on Longitudinal Control of Electric Vehicle Platoons Based on Robust UKF-MPC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0432/v1","date":1725516673000,"content":"In a V2V communication environment, the control of electric vehicle platoons faces issues such as random communication delays, packet loss, and external disturbances. To address these issues, a robust UKF-MPC-based longitudinal control algorithm for the platoon is designed. First, a longitudinal kinematic model of the vehicle platoon is constructed, and discrete state-space equations are established. The robust UKF algorithm is derived by enhancing the UKF algorithm with Huber-M estimation. This enhanced algorithm is then used to estimate the state information of the leading vehicle. Based on the vehicle state information obtained from the robust UKF estimation, feedback correction compensation is added to the MPC algorithm to design the robust UKF-MPC longitudinal controller. Finally, The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through CarSim/Simulink joint simulation. Simulation results show that the robust UKF-MPC longitudinal controller performs better compared to the MPC and UKF-MPC longitudinal controllers. When facing the communication delay and packet loss problems, the robust UKF-MPC longitudinal controller has higher control accuracy and less performance degradation. It has strong robustness and stability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dad13878a6fecddcc762e47eedb42d6f95c02ee6faa3501fc5fe30c0c4f9b0f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
