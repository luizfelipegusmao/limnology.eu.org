{"title":"Relative Health Risk Reduction from an Advanced Multi-modal Air Purification System: Evaluation in a Post-surgical Healthcare Setting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1847/v1","date":1716890397000,"content":"Advanced air treatment systems have the potential to reduce airborne infection risk, improve indoor air quality (IAQ) and reduce energy consumption, but few studies reported practical implementation and performance. PlasmaShieldÂ®, an advanced multi-modal HVAC-integrated system was directly compared with a standard MERV-13 system in a post-surgical pediatric healthcare setting. The evaluation entailed monitoring of multi-size airborne particles, bioaerosols and key IAQ parameters. Measurements were made of outside air, recovery room supply air and air in the occupied space for 3 days prior to, and after, installation of the PlasmaShield system. Compared with the existing arrangement, very significant reductions in particle number concentrations were observed in the occupied space, especially with virus-like submicron particles. Significant reductions in airborne culturable bacteria and fungi were observed in the supply air, with more modest reductions in the occupied space. In the case of virus-like particles, there was an 8-fold improvement in equivalent clean air, suggesting a 5-fold infection risk reduction for long range exposure. The data suggest multiple benefits of airborne particle and biaerosol reduction, with applications beyond healthcare. Long term studies are recommended to confirm the combined IAQ, health and energy benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddcd56d6fbe93675e51ff865f9f52beb5e7a2884cfee4e9fa651705df4fa1202","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
