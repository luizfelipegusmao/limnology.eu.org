{"title":"Landau Tidal Damping and Major-Body Clustering in Solar and\nExtrasolar Subsystems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0122/v1","date":1712042285000,"content":"Major (exo)planetary and satellite bodies seem to concentrate at intermediate areas of the radial 1\ndistributions of all the objects orbiting in each (sub)system. We show that angular-momentum transport during secular evolution of (exo)planets and satellites necessarily results in the observed intermediate accumulation of the massive objects. We quantify the ‘middle’ as the mean of mean motions (orbital angular velocities) when three or more massive objects are involved. Radial evolution of the orbits is expected to be halted when the survivors settle near mean-motion resonances and angular-momentum transfer between them ceases (gravitational Landau damping). This dynamical behavior is opposite in direction to what has been theorized for viscous and magnetized accretion disks, in which gas spreads out and away from either side of any conceivable intermediate area. We present angular momentum transfer simulations in few-body systems, and we calculate the tidal dissipation timescales and the physical properties of the mean tidal field in planetary and satellite (sub)systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fff2707294cc439a3b29772f8535dd07ef32fad12df43565239dffacebe7213","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
