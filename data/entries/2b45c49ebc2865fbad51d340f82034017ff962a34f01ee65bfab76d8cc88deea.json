{"title":"Membrane Localization of RNase Y Is Important for Global Gene Expression in Bacillus subtilis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0751/v1","date":1720525491000,"content":"Abstract: RNase Y is an endoribonuclease that governs global mRNA turnover/processing in Ba-cillus subtilis and likely many other bacteria. The enzyme is anchored at the cell membrane, a pseudo-compartmentalization that appears coherent with its task to initiate decay of mRNAs translated predominantly at the cell periphery. However, the reason and consequence for RNase Y attachment to the membrane are largely unknown. We have studied a strain expressing wild-type levels of a cytoplasmic form of RNase Y from the chromosomal locus. This strain exhibits a slow growth phenotype similar to an RNase Y null mutant. Genome-wide data show a significant effect on the expression of hundreds of genes. Certain RNA substrates clearly require RNase Y membrane attachment but others do not. We found no correlation between mRNA stabilization and the cellular location or function of encoded proteins. The Y-complex, an RNase Y specificity factor, appears to also recognize the cytoplasmic form of the enzyme which is able to restore wild-type levels of the corresponding transcripts. We propose that membrane attachment of RNase Y is required for the functional interaction with many coding and non-coding RNAs, for limiting the cleavage of certain substrates and potentially to avoid unfavorable competition between RNase Y and other ribonucleases like RNase J that have a similar evolutionarily conserved cleavage speci-ficity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b45c49ebc2865fbad51d340f82034017ff962a34f01ee65bfab76d8cc88deea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
