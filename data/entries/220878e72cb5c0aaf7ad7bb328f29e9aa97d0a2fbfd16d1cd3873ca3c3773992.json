{"title":"Fast Fashion, Sustainability, and Nudge Theory- Examining the Effects of Choice Architecture on Consumption of Sustainable Fashion, over Fast Fashion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1986/v1","date":1719500181000,"content":"This study considers ways to increase the consumption of sustainable fashion, given the significant environmental and social damages, associated with the industry. A series of experiments were conducted examining the impacts of choice architecture (nudges) under field conditions in collab-oration with one of Israel’s largest shopping centers. The study sought to identify which inter-ventions at the retail level successfully motivate sustainable fashion behavioral change regarding purchases and willingness to pay more, along with agreement with several statements regarding the climate crisis and sustainable fashion. Among the types of nudges examined in this field study were providing information, increasing accessibility to sustainable alternatives and appealing to social identity, in relation to demographics and green self-image. The study found that offering alterna-tives to consumers constitutes the most effective way to “nudge” consumers toward more sus-tainable purchasing behavior. Nonetheless, this does not negate the contribution of providing in-formation and strengthening social norms regarding sustainable fashion. Additionally in all groups, most participants reported that they do not know how to distinguish between sustainable and non-sustainable fashion, nor do they believe that the clothes they purchased were actually sustainable. The findings emphasize the need for policies that will increase the accessibility of sustainable fashion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"220878e72cb5c0aaf7ad7bb328f29e9aa97d0a2fbfd16d1cd3873ca3c3773992","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
