{"title":"Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification According to Changes in Risk Factors in Asymptomatic Individuals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1911/v1","date":1719455219000,"content":"This retrospective study aimed to assess coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression in serial computed tomography measurements according to risk factor changes. In 448 asymptomatic adults who underwent CAC measurements with more than one-year intervals, CAC progression was assessed according to age, sex, variable traditional risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking), and initial CAC score (0, 0.1–100, and &amp;gt;100). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were assessed for independent predictors of rapid CAC progression (△CAC/year&amp;gt;20). During the 3.5-year follow-up, coronary artery calcifications occurred in 43 (12.8%) of 336 individuals with an initial CAC score of zero. Of 112 individuals with initial CAC presence, 60 (53.6%) had △CAC/year&amp;gt;20. Age, male sex, body mass index, and all risk factors were significantly associated with △CAC/year&amp;gt;20, but recently diagnosed hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 11.3) and initial CAC score (OR, 1.05) were significant independent predictors in multivariate regression analyses. CAC progression was affected by demographic and traditional risk factors, but adjusting for these factors, recently diagnosed hypertension and initial CAC score were the most influential factors for rapid CAC progression. These findings suggest that patients with higher initial CAC scores may benefit from more frequent follow-up scans and checks regarding risk factor changes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b615b5770e2839a32c0c2631b6381c7c8994074e1d16a31363d540c934e3f27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
