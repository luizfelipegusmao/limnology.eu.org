{"title":"Factors Associated with Opportunistic Infections Among HIV-Positive Patients: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1493/v1","date":1729245682000,"content":"Background/objective: A retrospective study was conducted to access better understanding of the prevalence and risk factors of OIs in HIV-positive individuals, informing targeted interventions and enhancing overall health outcomes. \nMethods: Medical records 212 of patients (61.79% female, 38.21% male) were accessed to extract relevant information for the study. Fisherâ€™s exact test revealed significant associations between gender, substance abuse, healthy diet practices, and having single or multiple partners with the development of opportunistic infections.\nResults: A total of 212 HIV-positive patients were enrolled, with a majority being female (61.79%) and adults aged between 25 and 65 years (68.87%). Most participants were single (83.02%), unemployed (66.9%), and had a history of substance abuse (61.79%). The prevalence of opportunistic infections was 15.09%, with pulmonary tuberculosis being the most common (75%), followed by extrapulmonary tuberculosis (18.75%) and herpes zoster (6.25%). Females were less likely to develop opportunistic infections compared to males (OR=0.26; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.57; p=0.0007). Patients not using substances were less likely to develop opportunistic infections (OR=0.32; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.82; p=0.0170). Those with unhealthy diet practices were significantly more likely to develop opportunistic infections (OR=8.46; 95% CI: 3.56 to 20.53; p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b750cfd98c65f97690f5826ec021784a967124bf36c1d56fc6d750176eb9a3c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
