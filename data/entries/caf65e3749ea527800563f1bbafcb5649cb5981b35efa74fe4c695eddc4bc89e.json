{"title":"Beyond heat waves: Unlocking epigenetic heat stress memory in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/1934/7329540?rss=1","date":1698192000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants remember their exposure to environmental changes and respond more effectively the next time they encounter a similar change by flexibly altering gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in establishing such memory of environmental changes and fine-tuning gene expression. With the recent advancements in biochemistry and sequencing technologies, it has become possible to characterize the dynamics of epigenetic changes on scales ranging from short term (minutes) to long term (generations). Here, our main focus is on describing the current understanding of the temporal regulation of histone modifications and chromatin changes during exposure to short-term recurring high temperatures and reevaluating them in the context of natural environments. Investigations of the dynamics of histone modifications and chromatin structural changes in <span>Arabidopsis</span> after repeated exposure to heat at short intervals have revealed the detailed molecular mechanisms of short-term heat stress memory, which include histone modification enzymes, chromatin remodelers, and key transcription factors. In addition, we summarize the spatial regulation of heat responses. Based on the natural temperature patterns during summer, we discuss how plants cope with recurring heat stress occurring at various time intervals by utilizing 2 distinct types of heat stress memory mechanisms. We also explore future research directions to provide a more precise understanding of the epigenetic regulation of heat stress memory.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"caf65e3749ea527800563f1bbafcb5649cb5981b35efa74fe4c695eddc4bc89e","category":"Environment"}
