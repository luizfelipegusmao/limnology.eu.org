{"title":"Reactive Oxygen Species Mechanisms That Regulate Protein-Protein Interactions in Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1413/v1","date":1724148255000,"content":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during cellular metabolism and in response to environmental stress. While low levels of ROS play essential physiological roles, excess ROS can damage cellular components, leading to cell death or transformation. ROS can also regulate protein interactions in cancer cells, thereby affecting processes such as cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis. Dysregulated interactions occur via various mechanisms, including amino acid modifications, conformational changes, and alterations in complex stability. Understanding ROS-mediated changes in protein interactions is crucial for targeted cancer therapies. In this review, we examine the role that ROS mechanisms in regulating pathways through protein-protein interactions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5673acd394db323f944d9e75d9c0624306cabb5e1701a2e2268887cf26a6ebe5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
