{"title":"The Effects of Climate on the Death and Growth Decline of Pinus densiflora Siebold &amp; Zucc","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1501/v1","date":1721349177000,"content":"The present study aimed to date the death of Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora Siebold &amp;amp; Zucc.) at Sogwang-ri, where is famous for the Korean red pine forests in Korea, using a dendrochronological method, and to investigate the effect of climatic factors on the death and growth decline of the pine trees. For the study, 51 Korean red pines were selected from three stands (Jungmi-gol A, Jungmi-gol B, and Neonam-gol) in the study area, and for the ring-width measurement the increment cores were extracted from the selected trees. The stand chronologies for the Jungmi-gol and Neonam-gol were established using the mean values of individual time series of the living trees from each site, and the chronologies were further used for cross-dating with individual time series of the dead trees to date their death. The abrupt growth reduction was also investigated based on the consecutive ring-width growth decline trend to know the vitality during the living. Results revealed that the red pines at Jungmi-gol A were dead in 2020, at Jungmi-gol B in 2012 or 2013, and at Neonam-gol in 2019. So, it was verified that the death of the red pines at the study sites occurred from high to low elevations. In the analysis of the role of climate in the annual ring growth, the trees at Jungmi-gol A and B located on the southwest slope showed more ring-width growth when precipitation in April, July, and August were increasing, at Neoman-gol located on the north slope when precipitation only in July was increasing. Although the correlations of the ring-width growths at the sites with temperature and precipitation were somehow different from each other, Drought Stress Index (DSI) from May to September at all sites were all negative. Therefore, water stress caused by increased temperature and decreased precipitation is the most significant climatic parameter for the death or growth decline of the pine trees in the study area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59e51de83ac7594952ab184eaa9a3c7a59f729f7a1ddfa11dcec604829a7513b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
