{"title":"Toward systemic lipofuscin removal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202208.0229/v9","date":1715294976000,"content":"Lipofuscin is indigestible garbage that accumulates in the autophagic vesicles and cytosol of post-mitotic cells with age.  Drs. Brunk and Terman postulated that lipofuscin accumulation is the main or at least a major driving factor in aging.  They even posited that the evolution of memory is the reason why we get lipofuscin at all, as stable synaptic connections must be maintained over time, meaning that the somas of neurons must also remain in the same locale.  In other words, they cannot dilute out their garbage over time through cell division.  Mechanistically, their position certainly makes sense given that rendering a large percentage of a post-mitotic cellâ€™s lysosomes useless must almost certainly negatively affect that cell and the surrounding microenvironment.  It may be the case that lipofuscin accumulation is the main issue with regard to current age-related disease.  Degradation in situ may be an insurmountable task currently.  However, a method of systemic lipofuscin removal is discussed herein.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08768fbf386b28b0f6c93d70d0c1ba9d8b6b51d98e84acaae545be685545efd3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
