{"title":"Beyond the Typology: Linking Composite Sustainability to Urban Fabrics to Assess Spatially-Disaggregate Patterns in Cuenca, Ecuador","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0664/v2","date":1727433084000,"content":"Understanding the relationship between urban fabrics and sustainability is critical for addressing contemporary urban challenges. Urban fabrics contain information that reveals the performance and spatial heterogeneity of urban systems. This study evaluates the variability and spatial patterns of sustainability indicators across different urban fabric typologies in Cuenca, Ecuador. Using a 150-radius hexagonal grid covering the study area, 30 sustainability indicators are assessed in this study, exploring their spatial patterns and relationships with urban fabrics trough spatial and statistical analyses and visualization techniques. Results reveal significant variability among urban fabrics, with built environment indicators playing a dominant role in overall sustainability. There is evidence of marked spatial heterogeneity, with inner-core areas showing higher sustainability, while fringe expansion areas lag, and transitional areas also identified. Spatial clusters of high or low sustainability fabrics tend to be homogeneous, whereas mid-range sustainability fabrics exhibit greater heterogeneity. This quantitative evidence highlights hidden patterns in urban morphology and sustainability, offering valuable insights to support and enhance evidence-based urban planning. The open-source data and tools reported are developed to allow for customisation as well as replication in other urban areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1788b2bd0ae47bc931cf882f9c584e97bd7ae7669c8a26ce17e9c530bc8240ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
