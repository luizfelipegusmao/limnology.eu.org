{"title":"Recent Advancements in Minimally Invasive Surgery for Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0332/v1","date":1715062660000,"content":"Introduction: Lung cancer remains a global health concern, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprising the majority of cases. Early detection of lung cancer has led to an increased number of cases identified in the earlier stages of NSCLC. This required the revaluation of the NSCLC treatment approaches for early-stage NSCLC.\nMethods: We conducted a comprehensive search using multiple databases to identify relevant studies on treatment modalities for early-stage NSCLC. Inclusion criteria prioritized but were not limited to, clinical trials and meta-analyses on surgical approaches to early-stage NSCLC conducted from 2021 onwards.\nDiscussion: Minimally invasive approaches, such as VATS and RATS, along with lung resection techniques, including sublobar resection have emerged as treatments for early-stage NSCLC. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) hve shown prognostic significance, especially when analyzing the consolidation-tumor ratio (CTR). There have also been updates on managing GGOs, including the non-surgical approaches, the extent of lung resection indicated, and the level of lymphadenectomy required. \nConclusion: The management of early-stage NSCLC requires further assessment of treatment strategies. This includes understanding the required extent of surgical resection, interpreting the significance of GGOs (specifically GGOs with a high CTR), and evaluating the efficacy of alternative therapies. Customized treatment involving surgical and non-surgical interventions is essential for advancing patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"283f576dd1f75c5d66006ed1d79b988759c29fcf88588c108cf6f1637807057b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
