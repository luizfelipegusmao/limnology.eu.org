Pt-based nanoalloy catalysts, e.g., Pt- Cu, Zn, Fe, Ga, In, Sn, Co and La, have emerged as promising candidates due to their superior catalytic properties and tunable electronic and geometric structures [<a href=\"#ozae044.828-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.828-B2\">2</a>]. The precise composition of these nanocatalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance, as it directly influences their catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Our preliminary work on industry important PtSn/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocatalysts revealed the presence of compositional variations within individual particles [<a href=\"#ozae044.828-B3\">3</a>], further highlighting the importance of understanding compositional dynamics of nanoalloys. However, the in-situ compositional analysis of these nanoalloys under real reaction conditions remain inadequately explored.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f7331f85e2c46f5eb7b53118dfcc0527bccefca956fcf64a555c923d39e94659","category":"Environment"}
