This qualitative research study explores SRM practices within the context of supply chain dynamics, aiming to understand how organizations manage their supplier relationships to achieve strategic objectives. Through semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and participant observation, key themes emerge, including collaboration, trust, risk management, performance measurement, digital technology integration, sustainability, cultural alignment, supplier development, strategic alignment, emotional intelligence, and marketing perspectives. The findings underscore the importance of collaboration and trust in fostering strategic partnerships with suppliers, mitigating risks, and enhancing supply chain resilience. Effective risk management practices, performance measurement systems, and digital technology integration are essential for improving transparency, efficiency, and responsiveness in SRM. Sustainability considerations highlight the need for aligning SRM practices with corporate social responsibility goals and stakeholder expectations. Cultural alignment, supplier development programs, strategic alignment, emotional intelligence, and marketing perspectives further enrich the understanding of how organizations navigate their supplier relationships. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on SRM by providing empirical insights into the practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with managing supplier relationships in dynamic supply chains. The findings offer valuable guidance for practitioners and policymakers seeking to enhance their SRM practices and achieve competitive advantage in today's complex business landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecada98f2230f7568e3612e94891851d884ff30bca109dd8de246a3f137acb1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
