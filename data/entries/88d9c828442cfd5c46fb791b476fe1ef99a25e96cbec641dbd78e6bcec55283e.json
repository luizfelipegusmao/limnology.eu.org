{"title":"Impact of stakeholder pressure on digital process innovation: An empirical analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307528","date":1721743200000,"content":"<p>by Yi Jin, Xun Yao, Minying Huang</p>\r\n\r\nDigital technologies can bring about fundamental changes in corporate processes, which may result in a shift from process innovation to digital process innovation. However, owing to resource constraints and various stakeholders, digital process implementation is extremely challenging for firms. Based on stakeholder theory, this study explores whether and how stakeholder pressure for digitalization can facilitate corporate digital process innovation and unravels the mediating effect of routine reconfiguration and the moderating effect of strategic flexibility. The findings from a survey of 351 firms prove that stakeholder pressure for digitalization can facilitate corporate digital process innovation via routine reconfiguration. Moreover, this study finds that increased strategic flexibility can strengthen the positive mediating effect of routine reconfiguration. The findings contribute to the deep understanding of digital process innovation and offer a boundary condition for the effectiveness of stakeholder pressure.","author":"Yi Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"88d9c828442cfd5c46fb791b476fe1ef99a25e96cbec641dbd78e6bcec55283e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
