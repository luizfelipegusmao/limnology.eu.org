{"title":"Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide in Cancer Cells: Advancing Therapeutic Approaches for Cancer Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0194/v1","date":1714978033000,"content":"Cancer cells show altered antioxidant defense systems, dysregulated redox signaling, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Targeting cancer cells through ROS-mediated mechanisms has emerged as a significant therapeutic strategy due to its implications in cancer progression, survival, and resistance. Extensive research has focused on selective generation of H2O2 in cancer cells for selective cancer cell killing by employing various strategies such as metal-based prodrugs, photodynamic therapy, enzyme-based systems, nano-particle mediated approaches, chemical modulators, and combination therapies. Many of these H2O2-amplifying approaches have demonstrated promising anticancer effects and selectivity in preclinical investigations. They selectively induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells while sparing normal cells, sensitize resistant cells, and modulate the tumor microenvironment. However, challenges remain in achieving selectivity, addressing tumor heterogeneity, ensuring efficient delivery, and managing safety and toxicity. To address those issues, H2O2-generating agents have been combined with other treatments leading to optimized combination therapies. This review focuses on various chemical agents/approaches that kill cancer cells via H2O2-mediated mechanisms. Different categories of compounds that selectively generate H2O2 in cancer cells are summarized, their underlying mechanisms and function are elucidated, preclinical and clinical studies as well as recent advancements are discussed, and their prospects as targeted therapeutic agents and their therapeutic utility in combination with other treatments are explored. By understanding the potential of these compounds, researchers can pave the way for the development of effective and personalized cancer treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5acb9a97283bc0971fadb38db0731473bd4ecd1316153d1ab1b0e4a3dbf71f95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
