{"title":"Pathways to Progress: Market Regulation Transformation and Social Security Enhancement in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0918/v1","date":1728658550000,"content":"The sustainability of social security is increasingly important to countries worldwide, yet the impact of regulation on social security remains controversial. Most scholars and policymakers focus primarily on the influence of social regulation on social security, while to varying degrees neglecting the effects of market regulation. This study employs data on the relaxation of market regulation (RMR) from the Marketization Index of Chinaâ€™s Report (MICR) and balanced panel data for 31 provinces in China from 2008 to 2019. Using instrumental variable methods to address endogeneity issues in the model, we empirically evaluate the impact of China's RMR on the level of social security (SSL) and its underlying mechanisms. The conclusion indicates that for every standard deviation increase in the intensity of RMR by local governments, there is a 2.25% increase in SSL. The study also found that social security expenditure and efficiency serve as mediating variables for the impact of RMR on SSL, but it did not support the mediating role of social security fairness. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing regulation and social security reform in China, as well as useful references for other emerging market economies in identifying priorities for their coordinated regulatory and social security reform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01cc71495244e9f9c0a3d117d1f52f3909a4065656c4d3f240481d1a0bf604ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
