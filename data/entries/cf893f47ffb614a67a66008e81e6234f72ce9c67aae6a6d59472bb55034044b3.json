This decline is primarily due to reduced soil phosphorus, necessary for microbial biomass synthesis, and enhanced soil enzyme activities that accelerate MNC decomposition. These factors create a disconnect between MNC production and decomposition, leading to decreased MNC accumulation under warming conditions.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Microbial necromass carbon (MNC) accounts for a large fraction of soil organic carbon (SOC) in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet our understanding of the fate of this large carbon pool under long-term warming is uncertain. Here, we show that 14 years of soil warming (+4°C) in a temperate forest resulted in a reduction in MNC by 11% (0–10 cm) and 33% (10–20 cm). Warming caused a decrease in the content of MNC due to a decline in microbial biomass carbon and reduced microbial carbon use efficiency. This reduction was primarily caused by warming-induced limitations in available soil phosphorus, which, in turn, constrained the production of microbial biomass. Conversely, warming increased the activity of soil extracellular enzymes, specifically <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminidase and leucine aminopeptidase, which accelerated the decomposition of MNC. These findings collectively demonstrate that decoupling of MNC formation and decomposition underlie the observed MNC loss under climate warming, which could affect SOC content in temperate forest ecosystems more widespread.</p>","author":"Xiaofei Liu, \nYe Tian, \nJakob Heinzle, \nErika Salas, \nSteve Kwatcho‐Kengdo, \nWerner Borken, \nAndreas Schindlbacher, \nWolfgang Wanek","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"cf893f47ffb614a67a66008e81e6234f72ce9c67aae6a6d59472bb55034044b3","category":"Environment"}
