{"title":"Nutritional Trends in Cystic Fibrosis: Insights from the Italian Cystic Fibrosis Patient Registry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0869/v1","date":1713161235000,"content":"Background: Over the past decades, efforts have been made to improve the nutritional well-being in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Due to the correlation observed between nutritional indices and lung function, prevailing recommendations consistently advocate for BMI percentile goals at or above the 50th percentile in pwCF. Recent global trends show a notable increase in overweight and obese statuses among pwCF. This study aims to explore the nutritional status of Italian pwCF.\nMethods: Data from the Italian CF Patientâ€™s Registry were analysed to assess the proportion of individuals categorized as underweight, target weight, overweight, and obese from 2010 to 2021. Patient-level comparison data from 2021 were also examined to identify potential determinants of overweight and obesity.\nResults: Analysis spanning 2010 to 2021 reveals a decrease of approximately 40% in underweight status among adults, while the proportion of malnourished patients  90, and lower prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization.\nConclusions: Our study confirms the evolving nutritional status landscape among Italian adult pwCF, with a significant shift towards overweight and obesity over the past decade. These trends highlight the need for proactive measures within CF standards of care to adapt and address the changing needs of patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bdbfbc1335bac068bb40476a326af6ea6289cb78cb40f7cb7f42a34b164c297","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
