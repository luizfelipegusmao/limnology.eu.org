{"title":"Isolation and screening of fungi for enhanced agarwood formation in <i>Aquilaria sinensis</i> trees","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304946","date":1718373600000,"content":"<p>by Chuang Liu, Guoying Zhou, Junang Liu</p>\r\n\r\nAgarwood is a resinous heartwood of <i>Aquilaria sinensis</i> that is formed in response to mechanical wounding. In the present study pre-treatment of <i>Aquilaria sinensis</i> was carried out, and then the dominant fungi were isolated and purified from the surface and electroshock holes of trees. The isolated <i>Trichoderma sp</i>. and <i>Neurospora sp</i>. were then screened for resistance against benzyl acetone and then inoculated into healthy <i>Aquilaria sinensis</i> trees. After six months, the agarwood was collected for analysis. The chemical composition of incense was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and 82 chemical constituents were identified. Agarwood products formed by using <i>Trichoderma sp</i>. and <i>Neurospora sp</i>. consisted of 50.22% and 48.71% ether extracts, respectively, which surpassed the 10% threshold specified by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Similarly, relative aromatic contents in the two agarwood products were 30.1% and 32.86%, while proportions of sesquiterpene constituents were 10.21% and 11.19%, respectively. These two agarwood-specific chemical constituents accounted for a large proportion of the total chemical composition, which showed that the generated agarwood was of good quality. The results of the study revealed that both <i>Trichoderma sp</i>. and <i>Neurospora sp</i>. were able to effectively induce agarwood production in <i>Aquilaria sinensis</i> trees in 6 months. This study expands the library of fungi that promote the production of agarwood from <i>Aquilaria sinensis</i> trees.","author":"Chuang Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cf9507ce9e7d5eef798433dec53e38ef456236140da0ac9475845e8b015e09ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
