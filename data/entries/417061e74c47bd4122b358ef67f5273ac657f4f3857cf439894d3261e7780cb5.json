{"title":"Lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) Health Effects &ndash; a Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Human Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2217/v1","date":1722242894000,"content":"This review examines the effects of lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) on general and oral health. The effects of lingonberry are based on the vitamins, minerals, fibers and polyphenolic compounds it contains. Lingonberry's bioactive substances have a diverse range of antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiproteolytic, anticarcinogenic and antioxidant properties. Research results suggest that lingonberries can have a positive effect on human health. Berries, lingonberry juice/lingonberry nectar/fermented lingonberry juice and polyphenol fractions have been used in clinical studies. Lingonberries balance post-meal blood sugar, free fatty acids and insulin levels. Fermented lingonberry juice reduces Streptococcus mutans, Candida and periodontal pathogen counts, but is probiotic because it favors growth of Lactobacilli. In addition, it increases saliva secretion and thus lowers the risk of oral infections. It lowers the clinical parameters of periodontitis and the active matrix metalloprotease-8, reducing the low-grade inflammation associated with periodontal diseases. More studies on humans are needed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"417061e74c47bd4122b358ef67f5273ac657f4f3857cf439894d3261e7780cb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
