{"title":"The Gypsum Influence On The Formation Of Secondary Phases During Autoclave Leaching Of Gold-Bearing Concentrates And The Silver Recovery Using Cyanidation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1616/v1","date":1726823283000,"content":"In this work, studies were carried out on the extraction of silver and gold from cakes of pressure oxidation leaching of sulfide concentrate containing pyrite and arsenopyrite. The addition of gypsum at a consumption of 0.1 g/g of concentrate helps to increase silver extraction from 13.4 to 95â€“98% at the cyanidation stage, with no conditioning operation. Gold recovery was 99%. An increase in gypsum consumption contributes to the formation of BFAS with an increased content of sulfate sulfur, and a decrease in the As/S(sulfate) molar ratio in the cake from 3.7 down to 0.88 contributes to an increase in silver extraction at the cyanidation stage up to 98%, and its further decrease from 0.88 down to 0.58 leads to a gradual reducing silver transfer into solution from 98 down to 75.1% at the cyanidation stage. Basic ferric sulfate (BFS) is not formed in this case, since according to EDS mapping the distribution of arsenic and sulfur over iron-containing particles is uniform. According to TCLP analysis, the cake obtained after pressure oxidation leaching with the addition of gypsum and cyanidation is stable and suitable for disposal, since the final concentration of arsenic in the solution was 0.45 mg/dm3.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8ff83c69a3be6ab8918f9b93ea2648d5ee26c5451e1521c4c5e42483edc14cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
