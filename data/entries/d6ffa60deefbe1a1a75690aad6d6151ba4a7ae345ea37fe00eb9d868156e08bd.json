Resolving the details of biological structures with (sub-)nanometer resolution has become a necessary requirement, along with the need to visualize and understand the dynamics of the (bio)reactions governing different processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.263-B2\">2</a>]. CryoEM and X-ray crystallography have emerged as the “gold standard” techniques in both academic research and in the pharmaceutical industry. These techniques provide structural information with extremely high resolution, however, capturing the process of the reaction in a native environment remains a challenge. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) has emerged as a powerful tool capable of providing unprecedented insights into the dynamics of various processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.263-B3\">3</a>]. However, technical challenges such as liquid thickness and radiational damage make LPTEM experiments complicated, especially for biological objects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d6ffa60deefbe1a1a75690aad6d6151ba4a7ae345ea37fe00eb9d868156e08bd","category":"Environment"}
