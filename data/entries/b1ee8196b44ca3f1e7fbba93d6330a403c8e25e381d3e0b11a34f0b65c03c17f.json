We investigated the effects of artisanal fishing on the distribution of a population of broad-snouted caiman (<i>Caiman latirostris</i>) inhabiting the Tapacurá reservoir, within the highly altered and threatened Atlantic Forest biome.\nWe conducted spotlight surveys to detect caimans and gillnets deployed in the reservoir from April 2015 to June 2022. We evaluated temporal differences in gillnet encounter rates and the relationship between caimans and gillnet distribution.\nGillnet encounter rates remained consistent year-round, while caiman encounter rates were highest near gillnets, especially in the river channel and in forested margins. Caimans are opportunistic predators attracted by tangled fish in gillnets and likely prefer habitats with increased fish abundance.\nFuture research should continue monitoring the interaction between caimans and fishing and include local communities in conservation efforts.\n</p>","author":"Paulo B.
