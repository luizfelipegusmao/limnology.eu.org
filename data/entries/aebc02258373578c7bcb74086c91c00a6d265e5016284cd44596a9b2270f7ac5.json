{"title":"Unraveling Verapamil&#039;s Multidimensional Role in Diabetes Therapy: From β-Cell Regeneration to Cholecystokinin Induction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1681/v1","date":1711538672000,"content":"This study unveils verapamil's compelling cytoprotective and proliferative effects on pancreatic β-cells amidst diabetic stressors, spotlighting its unforeseen role in augmenting cholecystokinin (CCK) expression. Through rigorous investigations employing MIN6 β-cells and zebrafish models under type 1 and type 2 diabetic conditions, we demonstrate verapamil's capacity to significantly boost β-cell proliferation, enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and fortify cellular resil-ience. A pivotal revelation of our research is verapamil's induction of CCK, a peptide hormone known for its role in nutrient digestion and insulin secretion, which signifies a novel pathway through which verapamil exerts its therapeutic effects. Furthermore, our mechanistic insights reveal that verapamil orchestrates a broad spectrum of gene and protein expressions pivotal for β-cell survival and adaptation to immune-metabolic challenges. In vivo validation in a zebrafish larvae model confirms verapamil's efficacy in fostering β-cell recovery post-metronidazole inflic-tion. Collectively, our findings advocate for verapamil's reevaluation as a multifaceted agent in diabetes therapy, highlighting its novel function in CCK upregulation alongside enhancing β-cell proliferation, glucose sensing, and oxidative respiration. This research enriches the therapeutic landscape, proposing verapamil not only as a cytoprotector but also as a promoter of β-cell re-generation, thereby offering fresh avenues for diabetes management strategies aimed at pre-serving and augmenting β-cell functionality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aebc02258373578c7bcb74086c91c00a6d265e5016284cd44596a9b2270f7ac5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
