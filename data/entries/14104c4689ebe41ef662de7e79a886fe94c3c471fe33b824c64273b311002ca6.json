However, traditional statistics of fishery catches or commonly used catch per unit effort (CPUE) metrics cannot accurately capture the complexity of resource abundance in the ocean. To address this issue, we propose here a novel approach that integrates the actual fishery catch from vessel logs with fishing duration obtained through automatic identification system (AIS) positioning. This combined analysis eliminates confounding factors and introduces a novel metric called “catch efficiency (CE)” to evaluate fishing operations more accurately, thereby reflecting resource abundance in a more reasonable way. In this study, we focus on the CE of squid in the Oyashio Extension region in the Northwestern Pacific. Our analysis reveals significant temporal and spatial variations of CE, manifesting in both intensity and distribution patterns. Moreover, our findings establish a close relationship between CE and background water mass distribution, chlorophyll-a concentration, and micronekton biomass. This implies that the resource abundance of squid can be inferred by considering the varying environmental factors within the fishing area.</p>","author":"Zixuan Niu, \nZhaohui Chen, \nWei Yu, \nHaihong Guo, \nRuichen Zhu, \nXiaoyi Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"14104c4689ebe41ef662de7e79a886fe94c3c471fe33b824c64273b311002ca6","category":"Environment"}
