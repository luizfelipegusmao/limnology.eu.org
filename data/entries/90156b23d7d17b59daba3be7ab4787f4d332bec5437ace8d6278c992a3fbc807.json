{"title":"Negotiating familial mental illness stigma: The role of family members of persons living with mental illnesses","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311170","date":1727704800000,"content":"<p>by Joseph Adu, Abram Oudshoorn, Kelly Anderson, Carrie Anne Marshall, Heather Stuart</p>\r\nBackground <p>This study explores how family members of individuals with mental illnesses address potential familial mental illness stigma. Previous studies have concentrated on self, social, and associative stigma and its impacts on families and persons with mental illnesses. Far less work has considered family members as perpetrators of mental illness stigma towards their loved ones with mental illnesses.</p> Methodology/Principal findings <p>We conducted this study with 15 participants who were family members of persons with mental illnesses using semi-structured qualitative interviews. The in-depth interviews were followed by inductive analysis using Braun and Clarke’s technique for thematic analysis. Participants’ views on familial mental illness stigma and ways to reduce this were reported in five key themes. The themes included: (1) layered perspectives of social and family stigma; (2) family-related stigma; (3) complex interplay of family relationships and mental illness; (4) confronting stigma personally; and (5) envisioning a better future. The uncertainties connected with mental illnesses and the increased social stigma were conceptualized as contributors to familial mental illness stigma as ways to prevent potential associative stigma.</p> Conclusion/Significance <p>Participants suggested the need for more social contact-based education and positive media reporting to correct the ongoing fallacies around mental illnesses. This study highlights how higher-order reforms to social systems and services would support both families and those living with mental illnesses to have more positive experiences.</p>","author":"Joseph Adu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"90156b23d7d17b59daba3be7ab4787f4d332bec5437ace8d6278c992a3fbc807","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
