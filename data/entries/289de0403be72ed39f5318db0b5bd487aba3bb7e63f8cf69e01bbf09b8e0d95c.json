{"title":"Partially Saturated Fracture‐Matrix Infiltration in Experiments and Theory","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036323?af=R","date":1721892259000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Fractures provide pathways for preferential flow, whereas porous rock acts as storage that delays fluid propagation through matrix imbibition. These dual-porosity mechanisms are investigated in laboratory experiments of partially saturated fracture infiltration. We analyze flow dynamics in terms of the fluid penetration depth in the fracture and delineate fracture- and matrix-dominated flow regimes at different flow rates. We compare wetting front propagation in fracture and matrix and examine the interference of matrix-wetting fronts with the lateral system boundary. The experimental data are interpreted using the analytical model of Nitao (1991), which accounts for the impact of fracture-matrix interactions on fluid propagation in the fracture. We find that matrix imbibition affects the observed discontinuous, partially saturated fracture flow to behave, on average, like plug flow. Consequently, and within the range of applied flow rates above a critical threshold, the model’s plug flow assumption is not a relevant precondition for its applicability. Fluid propagation in the fracture exhibits three characteristic scaling regimes (FP1-3) corresponding to the matrix imbibition state. Only two scaling regimes are established for flow rates below a critical threshold, hence required to recover bulk infiltration for the chosen geometry. Furthermore, wetting fronts switch from fracture-to matrix-dominated at moderate to high flow rates, indicating a flow-rate-dependent limitation of fracture-dominated infiltration depth. While the scaling regimes agree with experiments for applied flow rates above the critical threshold, the model underestimates the initial penetration depth below. Here, we observe the direct onset of flow regime FP2 and the delayed transition into FP3.</p>","author":"Florian Rüdiger, \nMarco Dentz, \nJannes Kordilla","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"289de0403be72ed39f5318db0b5bd487aba3bb7e63f8cf69e01bbf09b8e0d95c","category":"Environment"}
