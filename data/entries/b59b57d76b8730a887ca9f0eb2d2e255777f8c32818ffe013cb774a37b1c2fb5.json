The mechanical behavior of materials is positively impacted by compressive residual stresses and negatively impacted by tensile residual stresses. Tensile residual stresses, which result from production processes like vigorous grinding that promotes fracture formation, for example, reduce fatigue strength and fatigue failure. The fatigue strength and resistance of stress corrosion cracking are both increased by compressive residual stresses. Remaining tensile stresses can also be decreased by using stress-relief annealing, one of the heat treatment procedures. The sum of all applied service stresses and residual stressors determines a component's total stress. Three distinct residual stresses are recognized [<a href=\"#ozae044.243-B1\">1</a>]. Macro-residual stresses, or type-1 residual stresses, are formed in many grains. Changes in Type-1 residual stress equilibrium will lead to changes in macroscopic dimensions. One grain develops micro-residual strains, which are classified as type-2 residual stresses. They may come in various sizes and grain types. Sub-micro residual stresses formed within a few atomic lengths of the grains are referred to as Type-3 residual stresses. Type-3 stresses occurs in metals because of crystallographic defects such dislocations and vacancies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b59b57d76b8730a887ca9f0eb2d2e255777f8c32818ffe013cb774a37b1c2fb5","category":"Environment"}
