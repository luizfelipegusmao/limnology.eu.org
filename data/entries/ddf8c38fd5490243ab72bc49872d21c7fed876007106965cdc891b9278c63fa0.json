{"title":"A Review of Potential on Possible Greener Production of Slow-Release Nitrogen Fertilizer: From Fundamentals of Plasma and Nanotechnology Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2395/v1","date":1727684071000,"content":"The potential of both plasma and nanotechnology in the production of slow-release fertilizers is immense. These technologies, when combined, may offer green and cheap nitrogen fertilizers, from rich renewable resources available in local areas. Together these technologies may overcome some limitations of conventional synthetic fertilizers which currently are expensive and associated with low nitrogen use efficiency and significant environmental concerns. This review explores how recent advances in plasma and nanotechnology together might be leveraged to formulate new slow-release nitrogen fertilizers. While no attempt has been made so far to produce slow-release nano fertilizers from low-cost liquid nitrate generated by emission-free non-thermal plasma, plasma nitrate has already been reported as effective as a conventional fertilizer for crop production. We propose a more efficient electrocatalytic conversion of plasma nitrate to ammonium salt, followed by coating using plant-based cellulose nanoparticles into a slow-release form. This would synchronize nutrient release with the dynamic N requirements of plants. Formulations using agro-based low-cost cellulose nanomaterials might then replace high-cost carrier hydrogels associated with low mechanical strength. The review also highlights the isolation of nanocellulose from various plant materials and its characterization for use in different formulations of slow-release nano plasma N fertilizer. Additionally, we discuss mechanisms of N loss, slow-release, and retention in the soil. The knowledge from this review has potential to contribute to the production and use of efficient, sustainable fertilizers, to improving food security and, consequently the health of our planet.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddf8c38fd5490243ab72bc49872d21c7fed876007106965cdc891b9278c63fa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
