{"title":"The Sentinel Sleep Theory: The Biological Function of REM Sleep Unveiled","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1867/v1","date":1724757176000,"content":"The biological function of rapid eye movement (or REM) sleep—one of the great mysteries of neuroscience—remains unknown. Here, I demonstrate that the biological function of REM sleep is to heighten brain alertness, significantly reducing the high vulnerability of deep sleep. Every organism with a nervous system must undergo deep sleep: a necessity that comes with substantial vulnerability. Deep sleep, by lowering alertness, compromises the organism's safety, putting its survival at risk. Therefore, REM sleep is a necessary adaptation for any organism that must sleep. My primary goal here is to present a comprehensive conceptual framework—supported by extensive empirical evidence—to connect numerous disparate empirical findings under a unified theory of the biological function of REM sleep. Additionally, I also provide a historical narrative to explain its origin and subsequent evolution. The theory I developed to explain the function of REM sleep is not only widely corroborated but has also resisted numerous attempts at refutation. This allows me to claim that I solved this great enigma of neuroscience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f16068987118d093106148a1537227a954ed77ccc1290f1dc3c578c8e20c09f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
