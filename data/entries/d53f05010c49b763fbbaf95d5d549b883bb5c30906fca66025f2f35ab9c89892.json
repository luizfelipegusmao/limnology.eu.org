{"title":"Comprehensive Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Profiling of bHLH Transcription Factors in Areca catechu under Abiotic Stress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1903/v1","date":1729761671000,"content":"The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family, is the second-largest superfamily in plants after MYB, which plays a significant role in the physiological processes of plant growth, tissue development, and environmental variation. However, the systematized study of the bHLH transcription factor family has not yet been conducted in A. catechu. Herein, we conducted genome genome-wide investigation of AcbHLH genes located on 16 chromosomes of A. catechu. A phylogenic tree was constructed to adjudge their homology of genes, and 24 subgroups were identified. Finally, we analyzed the dynamic changes of gene-expression levels of nine AcbHLH genes in response to drought and salt in leaves and roots. The expression patterns of 9 AcbHLH genes show differences in leaves and roots. Under stress conditions induced by salt and drought, AcbHLH22, AcbHLH62 and AcbHLH45 are significantly upregulated in both leaves and roots. In conclusion, this study will substantially contribute to the foundation for exploring the role of the bHLH superfamily in A.catechu in dealing with abiotic stresses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d53f05010c49b763fbbaf95d5d549b883bb5c30906fca66025f2f35ab9c89892","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
