{"title":"Plastic-Degrading Enzymes from Marine Microorganisms and Their Potential Value in Recycling Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0161/v1","date":1725343011000,"content":"Since the 2005 discovery of the first enzyme capable of depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET), an aromatic polyester once thought to be non-biodegradable, extensive research has been undertaken to identify and engineer new biocatalysts for plastic degradation. This effort was directed towards developing efficient enzymatic recycling technologies that could overcome the limitations of mechanical and chemical methods. These enzymes are versatile molecules obtained from microorganisms living in various environments, including soil, compost, surface seawater, and extreme habitats such as hot springs, hydrothermal vents, deep-sea regions, and Antarctic seawater. Among various plastics, PET and polylactic acid (PLA) have been the primary focus of enzymatic depolymerization research, greatly enhancing our knowledge of enzymes that degrade these specific polymers. They often display unique catalytic properties that reflect their particular ecological niches. This review explores recent advancements in marine-derived enzymes that can depolymerize synthetic plastic polymers, emphasizing their structural and functional features that influence the efficiency of these catalysts in biorecycling processes. Current status and future perspectives of enzymatic plastic depolymerization are also discussed, with a focus on the underexplored marine enzymatic resources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d328a4488e81e3fbe2816a8ba40d6e56f212c6e6cf0846ab71e3c65d8350fc4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
