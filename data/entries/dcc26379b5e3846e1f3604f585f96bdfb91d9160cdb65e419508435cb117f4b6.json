{"title":"Long-Term Focus and Enterprise Strategy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1999/v1","date":1724813951000,"content":"This research investigates the relationship between the long-term orientation of top managers and their strategic decision-making processes, emphasising the comprehensiveness, speed, and inventiveness of decisions. The study employed structural equation modelling to look into the suggested connections using a sample of CEOs. The findings demonstrated a high and positive correlation between long-term orientation and decision comprehensiveness and speed, but not for decision creativity. The study contributes to the growing body of research on how human variations, such as temporal orientation, affect business outcomes and strategic decision-making. Moreover, the fact that a number of the results differed from those of other studies carried out in other contexts highlights how important it is to consider the industry and cultural environment when assessing these connections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcc26379b5e3846e1f3604f585f96bdfb91d9160cdb65e419508435cb117f4b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
