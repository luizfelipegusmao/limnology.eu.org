{"title":"Digital transformation and supply chain efficiency improvement: An empirical study from a-share listed companies in China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302133","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Junbo He, Min Fan, Yaojun Fan</p>\r\n\r\nThis article thoroughly examines the influence of digital transformation on the efficiency of corporate supply chains. As global economic integration accelerates and technological innovations deepen, digital transformation has become key to enhancing core corporate competitiveness. This research, utilizing data from A-share listed companies in China between 2007 and 2022, analyzes how companies improve supply chain efficiency through digital transformation. Furthermore, the study establishes a theoretical framework that demonstrates how digital transformation facilitates supply chain efficiency from the perspectives of internal governance and external competition. The research indicates that digital transformation plays a key role in significantly enhancing supply chain efficiency. Furthermore, the results of the mechanism analysis confirmed that digital transformation contributes to enhancing corporate supply chain efficiency by improving the level of corporate governance and the degree of market competition. The study also finds that the effect of digital transformation on supply chain efficiency varies with different corporate backgrounds, indicating its heterogeneous impact. Lastly, an analysis of economic consequences shows that the increased supply chain efficiency resulting from digital transformation can reduce future external transaction costs, strengthening the companyâ€™s market position and financial performance. This research provides strategic guidance for firms to develop robust strategies amid the digital wave and offers strong policy recommendations for promoting digital supply chain management and enhancing market adaptability.","author":"Junbo He","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"16b5d51d2a66a7fa700ff9b07621460e2b6027132fcfbfaa864e9ce91582959a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
