{"title":"The role of Lesotho community pharmacists in preventing and controlling cardiovascular diseases: The perceived facilitators and barriers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301525","date":1712239200000,"content":"<p>by Nthabiseng Florina Motlohi, Kofi Boamah Mensah, Neelaveni Padayachee, Ruwayda Petrus, Varsha Bangalee</p>\r\nBackground <p>Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality globally. The impact of cardiovascular diseases can be minimized by addressing modifiable risk factors at primary health care level. Community pharmacists are well-positioned to identify patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases for early detection and initiation of treatment. However, the role of Lesotho community pharmacists in preventing and controlling cardiovascular diseases is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the Lesotho community pharmacists’ role in preventing and controlling cardiovascular diseases.</p> Methods <p>The methodological reporting of this study was guided by the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies. A list of registered community pharmacists was obtained from the Ministry of Health. Pharmacists were selected based on their close proximity to the researcher and invited to participate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically.</p> Results <p>Five themes were identified namely: 1) Current roles 2) Future role 3) Facilitators, 4) Barriers, and 5) Community pharmacists’ perceptions of their roles. Generally, community pharmacists were involved in medication counselling, health promotion, and referral of patients. Lack of support from government, patients’ lack of adherence, poor interprofessional relationship, and lack of clear community pharmacy practice guidelines were identified as barriers. Despite the challenges, community pharmacists are motivated by patients’ gratitude for their services.</p> Conclusions <p>Lesotho community pharmacists can potentially improve cardiovascular diseases’ health outcomes at primary healthcare level through early detection of CVD risk factors, and health promotion.</p>","author":"Nthabiseng Florina Motlohi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bc90d36c8eeb72bb16b09e1fb33e3c5d084fc45e43666139bde9ca4f554eef88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
