{"title":"Older Adult Fall Risk Prediction with Deep Learning and Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1021/v1","date":1726281139000,"content":"Falls are a major public health problem among older adults, therefore predicting the risk of having falls in the near future is of great importance for health and social systems worldwide. Nowadays, prospective fall risk assessment relies on clinical and functional mobility assessment tools, such as the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Recently, wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors measurements have been proposed for fall detection. We hypothesize that the IMU readings captured during TUG test realizations can provide prospective fall risk prediction. In this study, analysis by deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) were used for fall prediction based on features extracted from IMU data acquired during TUG test realizations. Data is obtained from a cohort of 106 older adults wear-ing a wireless inertial sensor with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz while performing the TUG test. Prospective fall incidence was obtained in a six-month follow-up period and used as the ground truth for the supervised training and validations of the deep learning and competing machine learning approaches. Further data collection could lead to potential fall risk biomarker. A repeated hold out cross-validation process using 75 subjects for training and 31 subjects for testing was carried out. Best results were achieved by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM), obtaining an accuracy of 0.83 and AUC of 0.73 with good sensitivity and specificity values.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9513f8ca5b01dbd4117b550389e67e9865d465b254d50e9a576df5349297a944","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
