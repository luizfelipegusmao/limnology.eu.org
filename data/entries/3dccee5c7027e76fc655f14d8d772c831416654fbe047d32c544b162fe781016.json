{"title":"A Green Laboratory Approach to Medical Sample Transportation: Assessing the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Footprint of Medical Sample Transportation by Drone, Combustion Car, and Electric Car","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0908/v1","date":1723532173000,"content":"Background: Amidst escalating climate change concerns, sustainable practices in healthcare logistics are critical. This study evaluates the ecological impact and efficiency of medical sample transportation using drones, combustion cars, and electric cars across diverse terrains and weather in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Methods: We conducted a comparative analysis of CO2 emissions, transport distances, and delivery times for each transportation modality. Data collection involved multiple runs under various conditions, with CO2 emissions measured using onboard systems, and transport efficiency assessed via GPS tracking and time monitoring. Results: Combustion cars exhibited the highest average CO2 emissions at 159.5 grams per kilometer (g/km). Electric cars emitted significantly less, averaging 3.43 g/km, which is 2.15% of combustion car emissions. Drones were the most environmentally friendly, with an average emission of 0.09 g/km, representing 0.07% of combustion car emissions and 2.6% of electric car emissions. Drones also showed substantial transport efficiency, covering 17% shorter distances on flat terrain and 24% shorter in mountainous areas, with time savings ranging from 13% to 80%. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of drone technology to revolutionize healthcare logistics by reducing environmental impact and optimizing operational efficiency. Integrating drones can significantly lower the carbon footprint, improve sample integrity, and enhance patient care, promoting a greener, more resilient healthcare system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dccee5c7027e76fc655f14d8d772c831416654fbe047d32c544b162fe781016","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
