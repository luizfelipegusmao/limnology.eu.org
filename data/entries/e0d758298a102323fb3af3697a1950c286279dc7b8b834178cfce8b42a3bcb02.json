{"title":"Examining the Challenges and Opportunities of Supply Chain Digitalization: Perspectives from Industry Leaders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0541/v1","date":1718004478000,"content":"The abstract of the study on the challenges and opportunities of supply chain digitalization encapsulates the primary findings and their implications from the perspectives of industry leaders. This qualitative research investigated how senior executives across diverse sectors perceive and manage the transition to digital supply chains. Interviews with twenty industry leaders revealed key challenges such as data integration, cybersecurity, organizational resistance, and financial constraints. Data integration issues were particularly pronounced, as participants struggled with unifying disparate data sources from legacy and modern systems, creating barriers to achieving cohesive digital frameworks. Cybersecurity emerged as a critical concern due to the increased vulnerability of digital supply chains to cyber threats, necessitating robust and proactive security measures. Organizational resistance, driven by employee apprehensions about job displacement and technological unfamiliarity, highlighted the need for effective change management practices, including clear communication and training. Financial constraints, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), underscored the difficulty of justifying the substantial investments required for advanced digital technologies. Despite these challenges, the study identified significant opportunities associated with digitalization, including enhanced operational efficiency, improved visibility, predictive analytics, and better customer satisfaction. Digital tools were found to streamline processes, reduce manual intervention, and provide real-time insights into supply chain performance, thus facilitating more informed decision-making and swift responses to disruptions. The accelerated adoption of digital technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated their essential role in enhancing supply chain resilience and agility. Additionally, the integration of sustainability goals through digitalization supported resource optimization and waste reduction, aligning with broader corporate social responsibility objectives. The findings suggest that while the path to digital transformation is complex, the benefits of improved efficiency, decision-making, customer satisfaction, and sustainability present compelling incentives for organizations to invest in and embrace digital supply chain solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0d758298a102323fb3af3697a1950c286279dc7b8b834178cfce8b42a3bcb02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
