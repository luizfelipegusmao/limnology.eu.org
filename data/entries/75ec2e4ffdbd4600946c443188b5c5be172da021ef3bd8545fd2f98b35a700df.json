{"title":"Bacterial and fungal communities in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304634","date":1717164000000,"content":"<p>by Eray Uzunoğlu, Ayşe Kalkancı, Esra Kılıç, Yusuf Kızıl, Utku Aydil, Kadir Serdar Diker, Süleyman Sabri Uslu</p>\r\nObjective <p>Multiple inflammatory mechanisms dynamically interact in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Disruption of the relationship between host and environmental factors on the mucosal surface leads to the development of inflammation. Microorganisms constitute the most important part of environmental factors.</p> Methods <p>28 volunteers (18 CRSwNP patients and 10 healthy individuals) were included in the study. Eight patients were recurrent nasal polyposis cases, and the remaining were primary cases. Swab samples were taken from the middle meatus under endoscopic examination from all participants. After DNA extraction, a library was created with the Swift Amplicon 16S + ITS kit and sequenced with Illumina Miseq. Sequence analysis was performed using QIIME, UNITE v8.2 database for ITS and Silva v138 for 16S rRNA.</p> Results <p>The predominant bacteria in all groups were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria as phyla <i>and Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Corynebacterium</i>, <i>Sphingomonas</i> as genera. Comparison of bacterial communities of CRSwNP patients and control group highlighted <i>Corynebacterium</i>, as the differentiating taxa for control group and Streptococcus, Moraxella, Rothia, Micrococcus, Gemella, and Prevotella for CRSwNP patients. The predominant fungal genus in all groups was <i>Malassezia</i>. Staphylococcus; showed a statistically significant negative correlation with <i>Dolosigranulum</i>. Corynebacterium had a positive correlation with <i>Anaerococcus</i>, and a negative correlation with <i>Neisseria</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Fusobacterium</i> and <i>Peptostreptococcus</i>.</p> Conclusion <p>Nasal microbiome of CRSwNP patients shows greater inter-individual variation than the control group. Corynebacterium is less abundant in patients with CRSwNP compared to the control group. <i>Malassezia</i> is the predominant fungus in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses and correlates positively with the abundance of <i>Corynebacterium</i>.</p>","author":"Eray Uzunoğlu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"75ec2e4ffdbd4600946c443188b5c5be172da021ef3bd8545fd2f98b35a700df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
