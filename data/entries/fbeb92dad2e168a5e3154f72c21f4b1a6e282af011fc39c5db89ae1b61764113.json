{"title":"Photo-Induced Degradation of Priority Air Pollutants on TiO2-Based Coatings in Indoor and Outdoor Environments-A Mechanistic View of the Processes at the Air/Catalyst Interface","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1028/v1","date":1718371278000,"content":"In the last decades, numerous studies indicated the substantial role semiconductors could play in photocatalytic processes for environmental applications. Materials that contain a semi-conductor as a photo-catalyst have a semi-permanent capacity for removing harmful gases from the ambient air. In the present work, the focus is on TiO2. Heterogeneous photo-catalysis using TiO2 leads to the degradation of NO/NO2, benzene, toluene, and other priority air pollutants once in contact with the semiconductor surface. Preliminary evidence indicates that TiO2 containing construction materials and paints efficiently destroy the ozone precursors NO and NO2 up to 80% and 30%, respectively. Therefore, the development of innovative coatings containing TiO2 as a photo-catalyst was in the foreground of research activities with the aim to be used as building and construction materials mainly outdoors, e.g. on building facades in high traffic roads for the degradation of priority air pollutants (NOx and volatile organic compounds) in the polluted urban atmosphere.  \nThough the advantages connected with the application of TiO2 due to its band gap of 3.2 eV are limited. TiO2 is effective only in the UV-region (ca. 5%) of the solar spectrum with wavelengths Î»","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbeb92dad2e168a5e3154f72c21f4b1a6e282af011fc39c5db89ae1b61764113","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
