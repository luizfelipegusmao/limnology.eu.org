CAUTI is particularly prevalent in critical care departments and developing countries, where the duration of catheterization remains the most significant risk factor. This study focused on the characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of CAUTI patients in a tertiary care hospital setting. It also provides the incidence rate of CAUTI in an ICU setting in Palestine. The study adopted a retrospective observational design at a tertiary care hospital in Palestine. The data were collected from patient records as well as from nursing flow charts. Variables are reported as frequencies, percentages and means + standard deviations. Independent t-tests was used for numerical variables, while Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for confounders using binary logistic regression. Mortality risk factors were assessed using the proportional Cox regression model. Of the 377 patients included in the study, 33 (9%) developed CAUTI. Among CAUTI patients, 75% had Candida species isolated, with non-albicans Candida predominating (72%) fungal isolates. On the other hand, 25% of the patients had bacterial isolates in their urine, with a predominance of <i>Escherichia coli</i> growing in 36% of bacterial cultures. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that female gender, longer catheterization days, and corticosteroid use were associated with an increased risk of CAUTI. On the other hand, developing CAUTI, having a malignant disease, developing kidney injury, and developing shock were associated with increased mortality. This study highlighted the emerging presence of fungal and resistant bacterial CAUTI. It also emphasized that the risk of CAUTI was associated with a longer duration of urinary catheterization. The findings of this study may help formulate antimicrobial management and stewardship plans as well as emphasize the risk of urinary catheterizations.","author":"Razan Rabi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"15d37f07d685e1ecb391c82e609fa10e49732247cb51d7d70d938e2cabbc4873","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
