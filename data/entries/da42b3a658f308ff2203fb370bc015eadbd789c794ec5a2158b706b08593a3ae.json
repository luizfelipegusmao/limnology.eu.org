The focus has shifted towards intricate specimens, challenging existing processing software capabilities, and necessitating innovative methodologies. Cryo-EM sample preparation encounters hurdles such as high concentration demands, difficulty in entering EM substrate holes, and degradation at the air/water interface [<a href=\"#ozae044.352-B1\">1</a>]. While diverse samples behave uniquely during plunge-freezing, complications like aggregation, denaturation, and preferred orientations arise, primarily attributed to air-water interface interactions. Various strategies aim to enhance sample preparation at different workflow stages, including optimizing biochemical levels, grid selection, or using alternative support materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.352-B2\">2â€“5</a>]. Tubular samples present a promising solution, minimizing air/water interface challenges. Lipid-modified tubules can serve as substrates for specimen preparation, offering a potential breakthrough in overcoming cryo-EM sample preparation difficulties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"da42b3a658f308ff2203fb370bc015eadbd789c794ec5a2158b706b08593a3ae","category":"Environment"}
