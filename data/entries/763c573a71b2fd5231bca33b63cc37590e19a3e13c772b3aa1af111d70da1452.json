{"title":"Solar Energetic Particles Propagation Under 3D Corotating Interaction Regions With Different Characteristic Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1078/v1","date":1713281320000,"content":"Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are bursts of high-energy particles that originate from the Sun and can last for hours or even days. The aim of this study is to understand how the characteristics of energetic particles was affected by the characteristic parameters of corotating interaction regions (CIRs). In particular, the particle intensity distribution with time and space in different CIRs are studied. The propagation and acceleration of particles are described by the focused transport equation (FTE). We used a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to simulate the background field including CIRs. By changing the inner boundary conditions, we constructed CIRs with different solar wind speeds, angles between the polar axis and rotation axis, and the azimuthal widths of the fast streams. Impulsive particles are injected at the inner boundary. We then study the SEPs in different backgrounds. The results show that the CIR widths are related to the solar wind speed, tilt angles, and the azimuthal widths of the fast stream. The acceleration of particles in the reverse and forward compression regions is mainly influenced by the solar wind speed difference and the slow solar wind speed, respectively. Particles with lower energy (sub-MeV) are more sensitive to the parameters of CIRs. Different CIR parameters also greatly affect the spatio-temporal distribution of particle intensities in different ways. These results indicate that, it is crucial to consider the conditions of large-scale structure in interplanetary space when studying or predicting energetic particles. Additionally, our findings provide empirical guidance for forecasting the characteristics of SEPs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"763c573a71b2fd5231bca33b63cc37590e19a3e13c772b3aa1af111d70da1452","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
