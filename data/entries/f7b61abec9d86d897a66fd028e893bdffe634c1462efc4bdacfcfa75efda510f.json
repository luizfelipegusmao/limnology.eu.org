{"title":"46 Feeding the weaned pig gut and beyond with non-nutritional additives","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/265/7757184?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Weaning imposes simultaneous stress, resulting in reduced growth performance, increased susceptibility to diseases, and increased morbidity and mortality in weaned pigs. Weaning stress can induce negative changes in the intestine, including damaged intestinal integrity, disturbed digestive and absorptive capacity, increased intestinal oxidative stress, and microbial dysbiosis. Improving intestinal development and health is critically important for enhancing disease resistance and overall health of weaned pigs. This, in turn, can increase their survival rate during this vulnerable stage and improve their productive performance in later stages. A healthy gut may include, but is not limited to, several important features: a healthy proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, an integrated gut barrier function, a preferable or balanced gut microbiota, and well-developed intestinal mucosa immunity. Burgeoning evidence suggests that many non-nutritional additives can enhance overall intestinal health and beyond by targeting one or several functions of the gut. However, the exact protective mechanisms may vary and are still not completely understood. For example, direct-fed microbials may confer health benefits on the host by producing antimicrobial products, regulating gut microbial profile or immunity, and/or enhancing gut barrier function. Non-digestible carbohydrates and prebiotics exhibit striking impacts on reshaping the composition of gut microbiota in the host by boosting the production of health-promoting bacteria. Phytochemicals, a large variety of secondary plant metabolites, have been known for their broad and promising biological properties, including anti-microbial, antioxidant, and immune-modulating activities. Several short chain fatty acids derivatives aim to target the upper gastrointestinal tract, where the major nutrients are digested and absorbed, to promote intestinal health of pigs. Moreover, butyrate and valerate glycerides exhibit strong in vitro antimicrobial effects against enterotoxigenic <span>Escherichia coli</span> F18, one of the dominant pathogens causing post-weaning diarrhea globally. There are more candidates in the list that have been used in weaned pigs and shown promising results on growth and health promotion. Therefore, increasing our current understanding of non-nutritional additives and their influences on intestinal function during weaning will facilitate the development of more dietary strategies that increase stress resilience of weaned pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"f7b61abec9d86d897a66fd028e893bdffe634c1462efc4bdacfcfa75efda510f","category":"Environment"}
