{"title":"Research on the brewing technology of Dangshen Huangjiu with low biogenic amines and high functional factors","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13503?af=R","date":1712056503000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Biogenic amines (BA) are hazardous components in Huangjiu (HJ). To ensure the quality of Dangshen Huangjiu, an orthogonal experiment L<sub>9</sub> (3<sup>3</sup>) was proposed to optimize the process by the main brewing factors (pre-fermentation temperature, pre-(post-) fermentation time) that may affect BA and functional factors in Dangshen Huangjiu. Dangshen Huangjiu (DSHJ) was produced with low BA and high functional factors. Gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry combined with a multivariate statistical method (GC-IMS-MSM) was used to analyze the volatile components in the DSHJ brewing process of DSHJ.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The optimum brewing process parameters of DSHJ were as follows: pre-fermentation temperature 28°C, pre-fermentation time 9 days, and post-fermentation time 18 days. The average content of BA in DSHJ was 33.12 mg/L, and the sensory score, total phenol content, and DPPH free radical scavenging rate of DSHJ were significantly higher than HJ. A total of 14 esters, 7 acids, 7 alcohols, 1 ketones, 5 aldehydes, and 1 pyrazine in DSHJ and HJ were identified by GC-IMS. There were no significant differences (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05) in DSHJ and HJ in the soaking rice and saccharification stage. 11 components, such as ethyl acetate, and 12 components, such as acetic acid, were the different components of HJ and DSHJ in pre-fermentation and post-fermentation stages, respectively. In the post-fermentation stage, the content of 8 components of DSHJ such as ethyl acetate were higher than in HJ.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The preparation process parameters of DSHJ optimized by orthogonal experiments can ensure that DSHJ has the advantages of low BA, high total phenol content, and good antioxidant activity. Sensory score and GC-IMS-MSM analysis found that DSHJ prepared by the optimal process had the characteristics of good taste and rich aroma.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
