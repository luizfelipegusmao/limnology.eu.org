{"title":"Investigating Drug Release and Antitumor Activity in Experimental MEC1 and RM1 Cell Lines Using Multifunctional Iron Oxide Nanoparticles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1637/v1","date":1724336971000,"content":"Recent advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of multifunctional iron oxide nanoparticles, presenting new opportunities in cancer therapy. This study aimed to synthesize and evaluate citric acid-coated/ folic acid conjugated nanoparticles loaded with doxorubi-cin and investigate their efficacy in experimental tumor models. For synthesis, controlled co-precipitation method was employed to produce highly dispersive, multifunctional nanofluids with a narrow size distribution of iron oxide nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS) for size distribution and zeta potential, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for structure and morphology, Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM) for magnetic properties, and UV-Visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier-Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy for modification confirmation. In vitro experiments employed RM1 (prostate cancer) and MEC1 (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cell lines to assess cytotoxicity and drug delivery efficiency. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the intracellular delivery of doxorubicin by these nanoparticles, highlighting their potential for targeted therapy. As a result, nanoparticles conjugated with folic acid showed reduced efficacy over time. This study underscores the critical role of nanoparticle modifications in optimizing therapeutic outcomes. Future research should focus on further refining nanoparticle formulations and long-term effects in vivo, for development of effective and safe agents for targeted cancer treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d94026e7766341fb31d8569e4e0aaada83b32d9b71679732aa9a42b0108a683","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
