{"title":"Exploring perspectives and insights of experienced voyagers on human health and Polynesian oceanic voyaging: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0296820","date":1713189600000,"content":"<p>by Marjorie K. Leimomi Mala Mau, Sarah A. Stotz, Christina Mie Minami, Haunani Hiʻilani Kane, Kamanaʻopono M. Crabbe, Heidi Kai Guth</p>\r\nBackground <p>The Worldwide Voyage (WWV) was a 3-year (2014–2017) open-ocean voyage to circumnavigate the world using Indigenous knowledge and navigational skills aboard Hōkūleʻa, a traditionally designed Native Hawaiian (NH) voyaging canoe (waʻa kaulua). Each WWV segment included experienced crew and leadership who were recognized by their voyaging peers as highly experienced in Polynesian oceanic voyaging. This study explored the perceptions and insights of WWV-experienced ocean voyagers on the interconnection between human health and oceanic voyaging.</p> Methodology <p>A constructivist approach with a storytelling-based moderator guide was used to conduct focus groups and informant interviews of experienced crew and voyaging leadership. Participants were interviewed and recorded transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. Triangulation of analysis included secondary thematic review by two independent NH cultural practitioners and participant member checking. Purposive sampling was used to enroll 34 of 66 eligible highly experienced voyagers (leadership n = 6; crew n = 28) in 5 focus groups and 4 informant interviews.</p> Results <p>Six themes emerged: 1) Indigenous context (spiritual and natural environment); 2) Importance of relationships and community; 3) Description of life on the canoe; 4) Holistic health; 5) Mindfulness, stress reduction and emotional health; and 6) Opportunities for intervention. Themes 1–5 were inductive and intricately interrelated, and theme 6 was deductive in that it directly resulted from a moderator guide question. Theme 6 offers strategies to improve the impact of voyaging and health well beyond the physical voyage with recommendations for improved transition back to land and developing a waʻa community context, which reflects a traditional voyaging experience.</p> Conclusions <p>Polynesian oceanic voyaging is strongly perceived as a positive and transformative holistic-health-promoting experience.</p> Significance <p>Recommendations to promote generalizable health benefits of a voyaging lifestyle offers a promising and culturally grounded approach warranting future studies to understand mechanism and potential impact for improving health inequities.</p>","author":"Marjorie K.
