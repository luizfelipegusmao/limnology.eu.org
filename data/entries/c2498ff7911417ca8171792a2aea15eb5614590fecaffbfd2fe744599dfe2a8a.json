Gounni</p>\r\n\r\nDendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal in regulating allergic asthma. Our research has shown that the absence of Sema3E worsens asthma symptoms in acute and chronic asthma models. However, the specific role of PlexinD1 in these processes, particularly in DCs, remains unclear. This study investigates the role of PlexinD1 in CD11c+ DCs using a house dust mite (HDM) model of asthma. We generated CD11c+ DC-specific PlexinD1 knockout (<i>CD11c</i><sup>PLXND1 KO</sup>) mice and subjected them, alongside wild-type controls (<i>PLXND1</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>), to an HDM allergen protocol. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was measured using FlexiVent, and immune cell populations were analyzed via flow cytometry. Cytokine levels and immunoglobulin concentrations were assessed using mesoscale and ELISA, while collagen deposition and mucus production were examined through Sirius-red and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining respectively. Our results indicate that <i>CD11c</i><sup>PLXND1 KO</sup> mice exhibit significantly exacerbated AHR, characterized by increased airway resistance and tissue elastance. Enhanced mucus production and collagen gene expression were observed in these mice compared to wild-type counterparts. Flow cytometry revealed higher CD11c+ MHCII<sup>high</sup> CD11b+ cell recruitment into the lungs, and elevated total and HDM-specific serum IgE levels in <i>CD11c</i><sup>PLXND1 KO</sup> mice. Mechanistically, co-cultures of B cells with DCs from <i>CD11c</i><sup>PLXND1 KO</sup> mice showed significantly increased IgE production compared to wild-type mice.These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of the plexinD1 signaling pathway in CD11c+ DCs in modulating asthma features.","author":"Lianyu Shan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c2498ff7911417ca8171792a2aea15eb5614590fecaffbfd2fe744599dfe2a8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
