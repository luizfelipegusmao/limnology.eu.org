{"title":"Leveraging genomic signatures of oral microbiome-associated antibiotic resistance genes for diagnosing pancreatic cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302361","date":1714485600000,"content":"<p>by Xiaojing Shen, Xiaolin Zhu, Hairong Liu, Rongtao Yuan, Qingyuan Guo, Peng Zhao</p>\r\n\r\nGrowing evidence has increasingly suggested a potential linkage between the oral microbiome and various diseases, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the utilization of gene-level information derived from the oral microbiome for diagnosing PDAC remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to investigate the novel potential of leveraging genomic signatures associated with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the oral microbiome for the diagnosis of PDAC. By conducting an analysis of oral microbiome samples obtained from PDAC patients, we successfully identified specific ARGs that displayed distinct sequence abundance profiles correlated with the presence of PDAC. In the healthy group, three ARGs were found to be enriched, whereas 21 ARGs were enriched in PDAC patients. Remarkably, these ARGs from oral microbiome exhibited promising diagnostic capabilities for PDAC (AUROC = 0.79), providing a non-invasive and early detection method. Our findings not only provide novel modal data for diagnosing PDAC but also shed light on the intricate interplay between the oral microbiome and PDAC.","author":"Xiaojing Shen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d5fc06a5d797a4fce41365cb428e9f674ff72405e62c85b86355bbf3fd819995","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
