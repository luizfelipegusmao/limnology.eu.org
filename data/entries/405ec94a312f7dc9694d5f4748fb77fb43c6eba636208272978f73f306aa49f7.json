{"title":"Attitude Survey regarding to Tourist Attractions of a County in Western Hungary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0977/v1","date":1715689825000,"content":"Preserving and passing on folk traditions and gastronomic culture to the next generations was an important task of the older age group in every historical era. The most important objective of this study is to reveal people's attitudes regarding to the values of gastronomy and culture in a West Hungarian county. The combined presence of the Szigetköz Nature Park and the World Heritage sites (Fertő-Hanság National Park, Pannonhalma Abbey) in the offer requires re-sponsible, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable tourism planning. In the framework of a quantitative research (questionnaire survey), the tourists’ knowledge of gas-tronomy values and also their knowledge regarding to the architectural, cultural and natural attractions will be analysed. Four hypotheses were formulated in the study. The data collec-tion took place between September 1. 2023 and October 30. 2023 (N=666). The sample is not representative, the respondents were selected arbitrarily and randomly. The most important novelty of the study is that in contrast to previous studies, in this study, tourists' visits to different destinations were measured, while previous studies focused on tourists' interests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"405ec94a312f7dc9694d5f4748fb77fb43c6eba636208272978f73f306aa49f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
