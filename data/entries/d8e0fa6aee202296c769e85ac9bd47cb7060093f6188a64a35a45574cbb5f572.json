{"title":"The Impact of Enterprise Digital Capability on Supply Chain Digitalization&mdash;from the Perspective of Supply Chain Cooperation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0560/v1","date":1725627805000,"content":"This paper explores in depth the mechanism of enterprise digital capability effects in supply chain digital development by reconstructing the supply chain cooperation capabilities (digital diffusion capability and digital collaborative capability). We use the questionnaire data covering 272 Chi-nese manufacturing enterprises and apply a structural equation model to test the hypothesis. The results show that enterprise digital capability does not directly have a significant impact on sup-ply chain digitalization, and the supply chain cooperation capabilities play mediation role be-tween enterprise digital capability and supply chain digitalization. The results are robust due to we thoroughly consider the action boundary of enterprise capabilities, and verify the systematic requirements of supply chain digitalization and the high-order of enterprise digital capability. These provide a theoretical basis for enterprises to promote the digital transformation of supply chain through digital technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8e0fa6aee202296c769e85ac9bd47cb7060093f6188a64a35a45574cbb5f572","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
