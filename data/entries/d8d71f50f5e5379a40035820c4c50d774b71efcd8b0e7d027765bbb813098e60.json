{"title":"Recurrent Incisional Hernia; Cases Operated with the Use of the Existing Integrated Prosthesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1611/v1","date":1713960788000,"content":"Incisional hernias have a particular dynamic related both to the repair method and to the absence or presence of a prosthetic material. The incidence of incisional hernias is estimated at 9.8% after 21 months and increases to 18.7% after ten years. This study presents a surgical method for the repair of recurrent incisional hernias, through open surgery and the use of existing mesh. The selection criteria regarding the use of this method are: the prosthesis is well integrated, without granulomas, suppurations, defect appearing on the same prosthetic abdominal area. The analyzed factors were the location of the incisional hernias, the duration of the operation, the duration of hospitalization, identified complications, the size of the parietal defect. The retrospective study carried out focused on recurrences of incisional hernias from a group of 631 patients operated on for incisional hernias in a general surgery department of Dr. Constantin Andreoiu County Emergency Hospital, Ploie»ôti, Romania, during January 2018 - December 2022. Of the total of 18.22% relapses, 13.6% were relapsed eventrations after prosthetic procedures. Following the application of the selection criteria, several 8 patients with recurrent eventrations were operated by the open method using the existing mesh. In the case of recurrences after prosthetic procedures of incisional hernias, the recurrence can be solved by open surgery using the existing well-integrated prosthesis, without tension, absence of suppuration in the wound, and the peritoneal cavity. For the presented case, the return to daily activities occurred after 22 hours of hospitalization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8d71f50f5e5379a40035820c4c50d774b71efcd8b0e7d027765bbb813098e60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
