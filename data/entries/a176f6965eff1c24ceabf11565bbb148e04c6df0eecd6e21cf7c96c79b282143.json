{"title":"Robotic-Assisted Surgery in Urology: Adoption and Impact in Poland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0369/v1","date":1728147266000,"content":"Background/Objectives: The introduction of robotic surgery has revolutionized surgical procedures bringing significant improvements in procedures such as radical prostatectomy. In Poland, robotic technology was first used in public healthcare in 2010 for colorectal surgery in Wroc≈Çaw. Public funding for robotic urologic surgery began in 2022. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of integrating a stable source of funding on the development and utilization of robotic surgery. Methods: Using data from the National Health Fund, a retrospective analysis of these procedures was conducted, focusing on radical prostatectomies from the beginning of the funding period to November 2023. Results: The study showed that in the first year of public funding (2022), 2,149 radical prostatectomies were performed using robotic systems, and this number almost doubled to 4,331 by October 2023. Patients aged 60 years and older accounted for more than 80% of those undergoing robotic surgery. The rise in the popularity of robotic surgery is attributed to its advantages, including high precision, reduced invasiveness in the surgical field, minimized bleeding and pain, and reduced postoperative wound size. The use of robotic surgery also brings environmental benefits. Conclusions: The growing number of robot-assisted surgeries in Poland reflects the increasing role of robotics in medicine. These advances meet the growing demand for healthcare services and demonstrate the precision and effectiveness of robotic technology, potentially improving healthcare access and outcomes. Further implementation and refinement of robotic solutions are necessary to meet the changing needs of medical specialties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a176f6965eff1c24ceabf11565bbb148e04c6df0eecd6e21cf7c96c79b282143","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
