{"title":"Aflatoxin&#039;s Toll on Health: Insights into Human and Animal Impact","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1618/v1","date":1716538158000,"content":"Aflatoxin being a serious threat to public health and international trade, necessi-tates a comprehensive understanding and calculated response with effective inter-vention strategies. This review methodically looks at several aspects of aflatoxin, starting with how it affects international trade laws through feed and feed ingre-dient regulations. Aflatoxin contamination poses serious challenges to world health and the economy, especially in areas that are already at risk. Examining the varia-bles affecting aflatoxin toxicity, the paper clarifies aflatoxin toxicity's complex me-tabolism and the resulting health effects of exposure. The serious repercussions of aflatoxicosis outbreaks and their connections to illnesses like Aspergillosis and cancer are highlighted by a detailed exploration of prospective decontamination techniques as well as strategies for detecting and capturing aflatoxin. A thorough knowledge of the factors that contribute to aflatoxin contamination demonstrates the intricate interactions between environmental variables, farming methods, stor-age circumstances, and different physical, biological, and nutritional components. Strong detection strategies are required due to aflatoxinsâ€™ significant effects on an-imal and human health. The paper describes complete preventative tactics that en-compass manipulation in management strategies. global trade and public health from this pervasive threat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"235309797d1ce780c971719ed6e4e0c4ee0e5efb48f2a73565971520ed07dc93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
