{"title":"Mechanisms of Resistance to Rituximab Used for the Treatment of Autoimmune Blistering Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0419/v1","date":1723126632000,"content":"Autoimmune blistering diseases represent a group of chronic severe, disabling, potentially fatal disorders of the skin and/or mucous membranes primarily mediated by pathogenic auto-antibodies. Despite their rarity, these diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, a profound negative impact on the patientâ€™s quality of life and impose a considerable economic burden. Rituximab, an anti CD-20 monoclonal antibody represents the first line of therapy for pemphigus, regardless of its severity as it ensures high rates of rapid, long-lasting complete remission. Nevertheless, disease recurrence is the rule, all patients requiring maintenance therapy with rituximab sooner or later. While innate resistance to rituximab in pemphigus patients is exceptional, acquired resistance is frequent and may develop even in patients with initial complete response to rituximab, representing a real challenge for physicians. We discuss the various resistance mechanisms and their complex interplay, as well as the numerous therapeutic alternatives that may be used to circumvent rituximab resistance. As no therapeutic measure is universally efficient, individualization of rituximab treatment regimen and tailored adjuvant therapies in refractory pemphigus cases are mandatory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7962e1f729ff74675530fc9f6a32c05d28d68ebedc661f505d08e17fa5c504cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
