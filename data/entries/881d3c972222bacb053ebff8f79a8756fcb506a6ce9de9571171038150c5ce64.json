{"title":"Glass eels at the continental edge of Europe: revisiting catchment recruitment at the international River Minho/Miño","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05459-1","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The glass eel catch from the international River Minho, western Iberian Peninsula, forms the southernmost Atlantic series in the composite index outside the North Sea assessing European eel recruitment. Here, new experimental yield data from the lower estuary (1981–2022) and fishers´ daily records (1990–2022) were modelled to describe and compare seasonal and interannual trends. Seasonality matched river discharge climatology, possibly a more general feature in the southern range of the species distribution, with the difference between high and low season becoming less marked in recent periods of lower abundance. Glass eel yield showed a sharp decline during the 1980s, in line with the recruitment index outside the North Sea and with total Minho catch, but not with recent local estimates of catch per unit effort. This decline is corroborated by trends in fishers´ daily records, suggesting that the reduction in effort in the Minho was the consequence of a gradual adjustment to recruitment in the catchment mediated by progressively tighter local management measures. The inefficiency of fisheries regulatory measures to guarantee stock recovery alone calls for more comprehensive measures to reverse anthropogenic impacts on continental eel populations, but the task seems Herculean.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"881d3c972222bacb053ebff8f79a8756fcb506a6ce9de9571171038150c5ce64","category":"Environment"}
