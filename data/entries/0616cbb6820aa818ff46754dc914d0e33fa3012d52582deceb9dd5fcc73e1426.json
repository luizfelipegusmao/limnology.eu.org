{"title":"Influence of the Molecular Weight of the Polycarbonate Polyol on the Intrinsic Self-Healing at 20 &deg;C of Polyurethanes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1906/v1","date":1724746780000,"content":"Different polyurethanes (PUs) were synthesized with polycarbonate polyols of molecular weights 500, 1000 and 2000 Da. Their self-healing abilities at 20 °C were tested and their structural, thermal, and mechanical properties were analyzed. The PUs made with polycarbonates of molecular weights 500 (YC500) and 1000 Da (YC1000) exhibited self-healing at 20 °C and the self-healing time of YC1000 was the shortest. The high mobility of the short polymeric chains, the absence of crystallinity and the low degree of micro-phase separation favored self-healing at 20 °C in YC500. However, the presence of tack and the existence of allophanate species and urethane-carbonate and urea-carbonate hydrogen bonds disfavored self-healing. Consequently, the self-healing time at 20 °C of YC500 was longer than expected. On the other hand, YC1000 exhibited an “equilibrium” between the urethane-carbonate and urea-carbonate hydrogen bonds and carbonate-carbonate interactions among the soft segments, so a particular structural order was produced which was associated to its fastest self-healing at 20 °C. The PU made with the polycarbonate of molecular weight 2000 Da did not exhibit self-healing at 20 °C because its significant micro-phase separation and the presence of semi-crystalline soft domains.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0616cbb6820aa818ff46754dc914d0e33fa3012d52582deceb9dd5fcc73e1426","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
