{"title":"Nutraceuticals Modulating Mitophagy May Combat the Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Redox Stress in Several Cardiac Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1016/v1","date":1713277641000,"content":"It has been proposed that procedures which up-regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy by replacing damaged mitochondria with healthy ones, may prevent the development of several heart diseases. A member of serine and threonine kinases, AMPK, could play essential roles in the autophagy and/or mitophagy. AMPK is widely distributed in various cells, which might play diverse regulatory roles in different tissues and/or organs. In fact, changes in the kinase function of AMPK due to alteration of activity have been linked with diverse pathologies including cardiac disorders. AMPK can regulate mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC1α signaling and also improve oxidative mitochondrial metabolism through inhibition of mTOR pathway, which may also modulate the autophagy/mitophagy through ULK1 and/or TGF-β signaling. Therefore, the modulation of AMPK in autophagy/mitophagy pathway might be considered as a therapeutic tactic for several cardiac disorders. As kinases are amongst the most controllable proteins, in general, the design of small molecules targeting kinases might be an eye-catching avenue to modulate the cardiac function. Some analyses of the molecular biology underlying mitophagy suggests that nutraceuticals and/or drugs including specific AMPK modulator as well as physical exercise and/or dietary restriction that could modulate AMPK may be useful against several heart diseases. In particular, some nutraceutical regimens may have encouraging potential for controlling some of cardiac disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"053d8a98414da588cad314009a6c70d446407cd2fb5503b1a995a0dfbbe9e290","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
