{"title":"Endolithic Algae (Ostreobium) Diversity in Porites Corals at the Western Atlantic and Tropical Eastern Pacific","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12832?af=R","date":1727664606000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p><i>Ostreobium</i> comprises endolithic algae commonly seen in conjunction with scleractinian corals. In the past, it was solely recognized as a coral skeleton bioeroder. Their relationship with corals is critical because they give photosynthetic byproducts and help the coral when it loses its primary symbionts due to stress. The variety of these algae in coral species of the genus <i>Porites</i> in the Tropical Eastern Pacific and western Atlantic was investigated. <i>Ostreobium</i> samples from seven <i>Porites</i> species including two from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) (<i>P</i>. <i>panamensis</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>lobata</i>) and five from the Caribbean (<i>P. furcata</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>porites</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>colonensis</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>branneri</i>, and <i>P</i>. <i>astreoides</i>) were extracted. Published <i>rbcL</i> sequences from algae found within various coral species from other parts of the world were also compared. A biogeographic analysis and two methodologies, PTP (Poisson tree process) and GMYC (general mixed Yule-coalescent), were used to delineate the different species. The findings revealed a significant degree of genetic diversity within <i>Ostreobium</i>, with more than 15 groups of not more than three individuals and 40 individual lineages. Its origins date back to the Ordovician, 500 Ma, and it does not appear to preserve host specificity. The sampled locations still have a wide variety of <i>Ostreobium</i>. Biogeographically patterns were also confirmed, making it impossible to pinpoint the precise origins of most clades. The ancestry analyses revealed convergent events for not only the emergence of <i>Ostreobium</i> in a few genera of local corals, but also the phenomenon occurred in genera from far-off places.</p>","author":"Juan Sebastián Giraldo‐Vaca, \nJuan Armando Sánchez","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"35725ac4c63c08c0c428a726fac67e1c8e5512a5c69b089059e2f495e4680b4c","category":"Environment"}
