Methods: A total of 83 A. baumannii isolates were recovered using culture-dependent methods from intra-hospital infections (IHI), wastewater (WW) and surface water (SW) samples from two southern Romanian cities in august 2022. The antibiotic susceptibility was screened using disc diffusion, microdilution, PCR and Whole Genome Sequencing assays. Results: The highest microbial load in the analyzed samples was found in Glina, Bucharest for both WW and SW samples across all investigated phenotypes. For Bucharest isolates, the resistance levels corresponded to fluoroquinolones &amp;gt; aminoglycosides &amp;gt; β-lactam antibiotics. In contrast, A. baumannii from upstream SW samples in Targoviste showed the highest resistance to aminoglycosides. The blaOXA-23 gene was frequently detected in IHI, WW, and SW isolates in Bucharest but was absent in Targoviste. Molecular phylogeny revealed presence of ST10 in Târgoviște isolates and ST2 in Bucharest isolates, while other minor STs were not specifically correlated with a sampling point. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, significant differences in microbial populations between the two locations was identified. The low abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria in both locations suggests environmental pressures or contamination events. Conclusions: These findings indicate significant fecal contamination and potential public health risks, emphasizing the need for improved water quality monitoring and management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c60c3b7dc19ed647b6eb40cc69b975ad2c86f40a5cc05e52f674a22c5ec9e7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
