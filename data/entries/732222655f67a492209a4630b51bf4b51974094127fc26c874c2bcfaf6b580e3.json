This transformation behavior makes SMAs an important group of materials for applications ranging from aerospace, biomedical, and robotics [<a href=\"#ozae044.289-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.289-B3\">3</a>]. Despite these attractive mechanical properties, SMAs are difficult to fabricate and machine with conventional processes, which limits their manufacturing to simple shapes [<a href=\"#ozae044.289-B4\">4</a>]. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers an avenue for creating more complex, functional geometries as well as controlling SMA microstructure across multiple length scales [<a href=\"#ozae044.289-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"732222655f67a492209a4630b51bf4b51974094127fc26c874c2bcfaf6b580e3","category":"Environment"}
