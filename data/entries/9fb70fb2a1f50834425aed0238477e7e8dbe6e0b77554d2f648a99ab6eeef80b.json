While some studies have explored the neural underpinnings of order processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging, our understanding of electrophysiological correlates is comparatively limited. To address this gap, we used a three-item symbolic numerical order verification task (with Arabic numerals from 1 to 9) to study event-related potentials (ERPs) in 73 adult participants in an exploratory approach. We presented three-item sequences and manipulated their order (ordered vs. unordered) as well as their inter-item numerical distance (one vs. two). Participants had to determine if a presented sequence was ordered or not. They also completed a speeded arithmetic fluency test, which measured their arithmetic skills. Our results revealed a significant mean amplitude difference in the grand average ERP waveform between ordered and unordered sequences in a time window of 500–750 ms at left anterior-frontal, left parietal, and central electrodes. We also identified distance-related amplitude differences for both ordered and unordered sequences. While unordered sequences showed an effect in the time window of 500–750 ms at electrode clusters around anterior-frontal and right-frontal regions, ordered sequences differed in an earlier time window (190–275 ms) in frontal and right parieto-occipital regions. Only the mean amplitude difference between ordered and unordered sequences showed an association with arithmetic fluency at the left anterior-frontal electrode. While the earlier time window for ordered sequences is consistent with a more automated and efficient processing of ordered sequential items, distance-related differences in unordered sequences occur later in time.","author":"Clemens Brunner","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9fb70fb2a1f50834425aed0238477e7e8dbe6e0b77554d2f648a99ab6eeef80b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
