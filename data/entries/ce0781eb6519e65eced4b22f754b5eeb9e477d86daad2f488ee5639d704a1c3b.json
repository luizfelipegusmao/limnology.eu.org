These distributions may arise from intentional design choices, as seen in composite materials or multi-phase alloys, or as a byproduct of material processing or service-induced degradation, such as those observed in 3D printing, welding, or radiation damage. Regardless of the origin, visualizing and measuring the differences in properties can yield critical insights for optimizing material design, developing more robust materials, or refining processing techniques. Since the relevant length scales over which these properties are distributed are in the micro- to nanoscale, high-throughput nanoindentation-based techniques coupled with automated analysis have become very popular in recent years [<a href=\"#ozae044.283-B1\">1-4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ce0781eb6519e65eced4b22f754b5eeb9e477d86daad2f488ee5639d704a1c3b","category":"Environment"}
