{"title":"Peer Supportersâ€™ Experience of Supporting Second Victims (KoHi-III-Study)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1064/v1","date":1715873203000,"content":"(1) Background: Second Victims are health care workers negatively affected by adverse events and are prone to developing dysfunctional coping strategies compromising not only their own, but also patient safety. An effective way to address this issue is the implementation of peer support programs. This paper reports on the effectiveness of a peer support program at the Austrian Hietzing Clinic (KHI). (2) Methods: Telephone interviews were carried out after peer support sessions using a questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was carried out reporting frequencies and proportions for nominal variables, means with standard deviations for ordinal and interval-scaled variables. (3) Results: So far, 45 peer supporters have completed telephone interviews after a peer support session. The main reasons for the session were bad news from the private sphere and death of a patient. The peer supporters rated the helpfulness of the sessions for their colleagues as very high while not feeling very burdened themselves afterwards. (4) Conclusions: Underutilization of the program is probable. However, the high rating of helpfulness of the carried-out sessions by the peer supporters in combination with them not feeling very burdened, shows that the program is safe for the peer supporters and an upscaling is warranted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"453c43d5baa9ce3a342ce991452f9d5920f348a02cb3302c0258c3bc655ac7fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
