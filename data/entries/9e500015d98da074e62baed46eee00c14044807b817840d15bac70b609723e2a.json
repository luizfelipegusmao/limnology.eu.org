{"title":"Unraveling Evolutionary Dynamics: Comparative Analysis of Chloroplast Genome of Cleomella serrulata","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2154/v1","date":1721991719000,"content":"Cleomella serrulata is a native flowering plant found in North America. Even though this plant is of ecological and native medicinal importance, very little is known about the genomic makeup of Cleomella and the Cleomaceae family at large. Here we report the complete chloroplast genome of Cleomella serrulata and provide an evolutionary comparison to other chloroplast genomes from Cleomaceae and closely related families. This study confirms the taxonomic placement of Cleomella as a distinct genus, but also provides phylogenetic insights that imply potential adaptive strategies and evolutionary mechanisms driving genomic diversity of the Cleomella genus. Whole genome-based and ANI comparisons indicate that the Cleomella species form a distinct clade that is about equidistant from the other Cleomaceae genera as it is from the genera from the nearby Capparaceae and Brassicaceae. This is the first complete chloroplast-based phylogenetic comparison of Cleomella species to other related genera and helps refine the complex taxonomic distinctions of the Cleomaceae.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e500015d98da074e62baed46eee00c14044807b817840d15bac70b609723e2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
