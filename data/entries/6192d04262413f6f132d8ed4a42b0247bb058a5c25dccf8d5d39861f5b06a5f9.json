However, there is no comprehensive review available for the developed GMMs. In order to fill the gap, in the present study an attempt has been made to review the existing GMMs for Himalayan region. The study focuses on the seismotectonic setting of the region, source of seismic data, GMMs used for conducting hazard analysis of different locations and various developed GMMs by several researchers. Further, applicability of these generated GMMs was inspected thoroughly using available seismic records of Indo-Himalayan region. For this purpose, predicted peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak spectral acceleration (PSA) obtained by using the GMMs for different magnitudes and distances are compared with recorded data by computing root mean square error (RMSE) and Chi-square value. Moreover, log-likelihood (LLH) scoring method has been applied and proper weights of the GMMs have been proposed.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"6192d04262413f6f132d8ed4a42b0247bb058a5c25dccf8d5d39861f5b06a5f9","category":"Environment"}
