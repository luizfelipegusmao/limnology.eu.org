{"title":"Comparative Study of Rapid Assessment Methods of Earthquake-Triggered Landslides Based on Newmark Model - A Case Study of The 2022 Luding Ms6.8 Earthquake","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0658/v1","date":1720522961000,"content":"Earthquake-triggered landslides represent a significant seismic-related disaster, posing threats to both the lives and properties of individuals in affected areas. Furthermore, they can result in road and river blockages, as well as other secondary disasters, significantly impacting post-earthquake rescue efforts. Efficient and accurate rapid assessment of high-risk landslide zones carries important implications for decision-making in disaster response and for mitigating potential secondary disasters. This study uses the high-intensity Zone VII to IX of the 5 September 2022 Luding Ms6.8 earthquake as a case study. The \"difference method\" and the \"cumulative displacement method,\" based on the simple Newmark model, are employed to assess earthquake-triggered landslides. The evaluation results from both methods demonstrate that the areas posing an ex-tremely high risk of earthquake-triggered landslides are predominantly situated on the western side of the Xianshuihe Fault. Actual landslide data verification shows that both models have high predictive accuracy, with the difference method model slightly outper-forming the cumulative displacement method model. Moreover, the study recommends determining threshold values for each landslide hazard interval with significant physical meaning using past strong earthquake data as soon as possible when utilizing the difference method to assess the risk of earthquake-triggered landslides.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd2fd3e1d667bb1e7ca225905fe5baa8bd06dbf02d598fd61c89a64681392883","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
