Eight feeds contained two protein levels and four levels of wheat flour substitutions by corn, as a 2 × 4 factorial experimental design, were produced by a twin-screw extruder machine and fed to 800 rainbow trout. The results showed corn grain reduced expansion ratio, water stability at 120 and 260 min, starch gelatinization (SG), and apparent degradability, while bulk density (BD) and oil leakage of feed pellets increased. The high protein diets displayed the most BD, lower oil leakage, SG, and elastic modulus. The high protein feeds improved the final body weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of fish. The corn grain reduced the FCR and promoted the trout's protein efficiency ratio. Lipid proportions of fish livers corresponded to hepatosomatic index and serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. In general, corn, as the starch source in the high and low-protein extruded feeds, can be replaced at levels of 33%–66% of wheat flour without adverse effects on the physical characteristics of feed pellets and the growth performance of rainbow trout.</p>","author":"Amir Soltani Alkoei, \nSayed Mohammad Ali Jalali, \nSeyed Amir Hossein Jalali, \nFarshid Kheiri","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"0ff9f01c225ad8a089ad603f7922e4512c234632ca96956f33e2519aee103511","category":"Environment"}
