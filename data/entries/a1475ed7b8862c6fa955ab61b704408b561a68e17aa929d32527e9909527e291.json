{"title":"Proximate Analysis and Fatty Acid Composition of Hot-Smoked Underutilised South African Black Mussel (Choromytilus meridionalis, Krauss 1848)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0298/v1","date":1719992832000,"content":"The ever-increasing demand for seafood-containing diets, especially fish, primarily due to their superior nutritional value, has impacted the availability of wild stocks, necessitating the focus on other underutilised aquaculture species. In this study, the proximate and fatty acid (FA) composition of the indigenous black South African mussel (Choromytilus meridionalis) was investigated. The effects of the hot-smoking as preservation method on the proximate composition for mussels were assessed using the standard AOAC protocols; while gas chromatography-flame ionised detection (GC-FID) was used to determine the FA content. The moisture level in hot-smoked mussels significantly (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1475ed7b8862c6fa955ab61b704408b561a68e17aa929d32527e9909527e291","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
