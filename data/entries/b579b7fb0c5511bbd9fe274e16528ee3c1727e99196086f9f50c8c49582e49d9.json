{"title":"Effect of Cryogenic Treatment Applied to Cutting Tool on Machining Parameters and RSM Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1057/v1","date":1728953665000,"content":"This study deals with the turning of AISI O2 steel, which has high machinability and dimensional stability in heat treatment and is used in the manufacture of many machine elements, with cryogenically treated and untreated and coated and uncoated cutting tools. In the first phase of the study, along with the determined cutting parameters, Fc and Ra output parameters were also optimized using the RSM method. In addition, numerical significance was obtained with ANOVA analysis, and estimated values were calculated by preparing regression equations. In the second phase, the wear performance of cutting tool tips with and without deep cryogenic treatment was explained with the support of SEM images, EDX, XRD, and microhardness analyses. Feed (F) was found to be the most influential parameter on Fc at 78.89%. The lowest optimized Fc value found with the RSM method was 339.99 N. In order to obtain this value, Vc 252.525 m/min and F 0.16 mm/rev should be selected. In addition, CVD-coated and cryogenic heat-treated cutting tools should be preferred for ideal Fc. It was shown that the most effective parameter on Ra was F, with 69.38%. For both heat treatment and coating conditions, Ra increased significantly as the feed rate increased. In the case of selecting Vc as 243.434 m/min and F as 0.16 mm/rev, the smallest Ra value optimized with the RSM method is 1.04 Î¼m. In addition, a cutting tool without coating and cryogenic heat treatment is also needed for ideal Ra. According to the results of the analysis confirming the effect of deep cryogenic heat treatment on the wear performance of cutting tools in the second stage, coated and uncoated cutting tools had at least 16% longer life compared to the others.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b579b7fb0c5511bbd9fe274e16528ee3c1727e99196086f9f50c8c49582e49d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
