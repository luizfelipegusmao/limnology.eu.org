{"title":"The Adaptation of Laws in Physics: Adaptation of Mathematical Models in Physics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0458/v1","date":1725583147000,"content":"This paper is a part of the broader research on “Adaptation of Laws in Science” and explores the limitations and challenges involved in adapting mathematical concepts to describe natural reality in physics. Specifically, the analysis focuses on two major examples: Euler's exponential laws and spacetime dilation derived from Lorentz transformations. By examining these concepts, the paper emphasizes that some complex laws are not universally applicable for deeper studies of nature, as they originate from mathematics and are correct only for specific parts of nature to which they have been adapted. These complex laws are particularly unsuitable where there is limited information available for adaptation. Therefore, without appropriate adaptations and a deep understanding of the physical context under investigation, the direct use of complex laws can lead to incorrect results. It is essential to avoid excessive generalization of these laws, once they become part of physics, unless a corresponding adaptation to the research context can be made. Furthermore, this paper supports the correctness of relativity theories by invoking that, like Euler's exponential growth theory, they were initially mathematical concepts. However, the nature of mathematics coincided with that of the phenomena in our universe, although through certain adaptations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89816514857b291c7175dd815c6734037fdd278a96b389e08e762cb89e38459d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
