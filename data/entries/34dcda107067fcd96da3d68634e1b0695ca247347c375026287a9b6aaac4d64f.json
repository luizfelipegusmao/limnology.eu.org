{"title":"N‐Acetylcysteine assists muscle development in offspring of mice subjected to maternal heat stress during pregnancy","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13620?af=R","date":1717406099000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Heat stress (HS) has been shown to affect reproductive performance and muscle development negatively in animals. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the antioxidant performance in animals as a recognized antioxidant. The present study assesses the potential of NAC to modulate the reproductive performance and antioxidant function in pregnant mice exposed to HS. The role of NAC in muscle development of offspring mice was also explored.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that NAC supplementation from day 12 to day 18 of gestation increased the number of litters and enhanced the antioxidant function in pregnant mice under HS exposure. It improved the weight and body condition significantly in the offspring mice (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The alleviation of HS-induced muscle impairment with NAC was consistent with the alleviation of apoptosis, the enrichment of the proliferation and differentiation in the offspring mice muscle. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine also reversed HS-induced reduction in the cross-sectional area of the leg muscle and increased the proportion of myosin heavy chain IIx (MYHCIIx) in the muscle fiber.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results of the present study support the use of NAC at a dose of 100 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> body weight as supplement for protecting the offspring derived from pregnant mice exposed to HS from muscle impairment by accelerating proliferation and differentiation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jiawei Lu, \nPeng Zhao, \nXiuhu Ding, \nYuan Liu, \nHuixia Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"34dcda107067fcd96da3d68634e1b0695ca247347c375026287a9b6aaac4d64f","category":"Environment"}
