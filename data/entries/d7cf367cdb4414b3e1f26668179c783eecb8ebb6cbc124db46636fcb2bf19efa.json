{"title":"Considerations for developing and implementing a safe list for alien taxa","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/2/97/7596665?rss=1","date":1706832000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Many species have been intentionally introduced to new regions for their benefits. Some of these alien species cause damage, others do not (or at least have not yet). There are several approaches to address this problem: prohibit taxa that will cause damage, try to limit damages while preserving benefits, or promote taxa that are safe. In the present article, we unpack the safe list approach, which we define as “a list of taxa alien to the region of interest that are considered of sufficiently low risk of invasion and impact that the taxa can be widely used without concerns of negative impacts.” We discuss the potential use of safe lists in the management of biological invasions; disentangle aspects related to the purpose, development, implementation, and impact of safe lists; and provide guidance for those considering to develop and implement such lists.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"d7cf367cdb4414b3e1f26668179c783eecb8ebb6cbc124db46636fcb2bf19efa","category":"Environment"}
