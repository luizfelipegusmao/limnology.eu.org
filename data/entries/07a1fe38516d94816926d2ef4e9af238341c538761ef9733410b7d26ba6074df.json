{"title":"Suitable Hamiltonian for the Riemann Hypothesis: Coinciding with Heavy Atom $U _{238}$","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1568/v1","date":1726818194000,"content":"In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic model to study prime distribution in almost-short intervals, inspired by a corollary of the Maynard-Guth theorem. The model uses the equation   \\[ x_{n+1} = x_n + \\frac{y}{\\log x_n} + \\epsilon_n, \\]  where \\(\\epsilon_n\\) follows a Laplace distribution, and demonstrates that our new bound surpasses both Walfisz and Maynard-Guth bounds, particularly for large \\(x\\):  \\[ \\left| \\pi(x + y) - \\pi(x) - \\frac{y}{\\log x} \\right| \\leq C \\cdot y \\exp(-\\sqrt[4]{\\log x}). \\]  Additionally, we explore a modulated Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}(x)\\), derived from a potential \\(V(x)\\) and a test function \\(f(x)\\), that exhibits behavior akin to the energy levels of the heavy nucleus \\(H_{38}\\). The gaps between these energy levels resemble the distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta function near the critical line, suggesting that \\(\\zeta(0.5 + i \\hat{H}(x))\\) corresponds to the energy levels of \\(\\hat{H}(x)\\), thus supporting a quantum mechanical interpretation of the Riemann hypothesis.  Furthermore, assuming the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture, which implies that prime gaps can be as small as 12, we find that the transition rate \\(\\Gamma_{p \\to p+12}\\) between quantum states associated with prime numbers increases with larger primes. This observation indicates that the distribution of prime gaps reflects an underlying discrete structure in the \"energy\" landscape of primes, offering a novel perspective on the connection between number theory and quantum physics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07a1fe38516d94816926d2ef4e9af238341c538761ef9733410b7d26ba6074df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
