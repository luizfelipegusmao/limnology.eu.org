This primer explores the implications of a PLOS Biology study reporting that zebrafish have amacrine cells, too, and revealing that these cells coexist with a second pair of starburst-like neurons, but neither appears to be strongly motion selective.","author":"Takeshi Yoshimatsu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"043b221c6552536b0ed541130f5163a97cc507133be6727d21826c90779dd920","category":"Environment"}
