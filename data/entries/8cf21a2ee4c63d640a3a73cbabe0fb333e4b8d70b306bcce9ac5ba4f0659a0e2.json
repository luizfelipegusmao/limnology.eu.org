{"title":"Sustainable Entrepreneurial Process in the Deep-Tech Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0059/v1","date":1722568887000,"content":"To date, deep-tech entrepreneurship and sustainable entrepreneurship are both attracting the interest of researchers. Indeed, deep-tech is being employed to address future sustainable challenges in the present. Nevertheless, the process of deep-tech startups is filled with distinct obstacles. These types of startups may necessitate more targeted sustainable entrepreneurial process and specialised knowledge compared to conventional technological startups or general sustainable entrepreneurial process. Currently, there are only publications discussing either a sustainable en-trepreneurial process or conventional technical startups. Therefore, the aim of this article is to in-vestigate the process of sustainable entrepreneurs as they transition from startup ventures to scaleup enterprises within the context of deep-tech industry. Based on previous sustainable entre-preneurial processes, a multiple case study was conducted within six deep-tech startups in order to find out the sustainable process pattern. A conceptual model of sustainable entrepreneurial process in deep-tech industry is established including five phases with six activities: (i) Sustainable idea definition; (ii) Sustainable opportunity recognition and evaluation; (iii) Venture launch; (iv.i) Sustainable products/ services development; (iv.ii) New sustainable enterprise financing; and (v) Sustainable enterprise scaleup. This process enables sustainable deep-tech entrepreneurs to necessarily have an overview of key entrepreneurial stages to navigate from the startup to scaleup process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cf21a2ee4c63d640a3a73cbabe0fb333e4b8d70b306bcce9ac5ba4f0659a0e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
