{"title":"The problem of unconscious and unidentified patients in emergency department admissions; a 3-year retrospective study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307540","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by Demet Acar, Fatih Cemal Tekin</p>\r\n\r\nUnidentified patients present a medical information dilemma for all medical departments but can be a major problem in Emergency Departments (EDs). This study aimed to determine the clinical and socio-demographic profile of ’unidentified’ patients admitted to the ED with altered consciousness and to define the outcomes of these patients. All ED presentations were analyzed retrospectively for the unidentified patients brought to the hospital by ambulance with altered consciousness. We assessed demographic data, clinical presentation, discharge information, and major clinical outcomes. In this study, 1324 unidentified patients were admitted with altered consciousness to the ED. Of these, 1048 (80.1%) were foreign nationals. In this patient group, the most common diagnoses were; traffic accidents, assault or sharp object injuries, drug addicts, or syncope-epilepsy. In addition, the number of patients who left the hospital without permission or escaped and therefore could not be diagnosed was higher in the foreign nationalities group and constituted approximately one-fifth of the patients (18.9% vs. 5.4%, p:0.001). Of the unidentified patients, 903 (68.2%) were discharged after treatment. 351 (26.5%) patients left the ED unattended. 32 (2.4%) patients were hospitalized. 38 (2.9%) patients died in ED. The majority of the unidentified patients admitted to the ED with altered consciousness were immigrant males. Unidentified patients are a high-need population, most commonly presenting with substance misuse or trauma. Although most of the patients were seeking urgent treatment, more than one-fourth of the patients left the hospital without appropriate treatment and most of these patients were also immigrants. We believe that economic, linguistic, and social disadvantages played an important role in this outcome.","author":"Demet Acar","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1f06913a2454378b5e85cc8414a5bcdab8fa378b2e3b209d53a36f3e15da816e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
