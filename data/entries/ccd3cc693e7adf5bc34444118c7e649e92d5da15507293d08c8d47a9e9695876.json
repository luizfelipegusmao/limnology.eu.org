C. D Adam is a shrubby plant of the Asteraceae family that has medicinal benefits for the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.</p> Purpose <p>The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of <i>Spilanthes filicaulis</i> leaf extract in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model and the associated signaling pathways.</p> Methods <p>A sample of 25 male Wistar rats was randomly assigned to groups I, II, III, IV, and V. Each group included five animals, i.e., control rats, diabetic control rats, diabetic rats treated with metformin, and diabetic rats treated with 150 mg/kg/bw and 300 mg/kg/bw of the methanolic extract of <i>S</i>. <i>filicaulis</i> leaves (MESFL). Treatment was administered for 15 successive days via oral gavage. After 15 days, the rats were evaluated for fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), lipid peroxidation (MDA), hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. Gene expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and the antiapoptotic protein caspase-3 were examined.</p> Results <p>MESFL was administered to diabetic rats, and changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c were restored. Furthermore, in diabetic rats, <i>S</i>. <i>filicaulis</i> significantly reduced the levels of triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and significantly increased HDL. <i>S</i>. <i>filicaulis</i> improved ALT, AST, and ALP enzyme activity in diabetic rats. MDA levels decreased considerably with increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as GST, SOD, CAT and GSH, in diabetic liver rats treated with <i>S</i>. <i>filicaulis</i>. Diabetic rats treated with MESFL and metformin exhibited upregulated mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ). Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) mRNA expression in the liver was downregulated in diabetic rats treated with MESFL and metformin. In addition, MESFL downregulated the mRNA expression of caspase-3 in diabetic rats.</p> Conclusion <p>It can be concluded from the data presented in this study that MESFL exerts a protective effect on diabetic rats due to its antidiabetic, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic and antiapoptotic effects and may be considered a treatment for T2DM.</p>","author":"Oluwafemi Adeleke Ojo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ccd3cc693e7adf5bc34444118c7e649e92d5da15507293d08c8d47a9e9695876","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
