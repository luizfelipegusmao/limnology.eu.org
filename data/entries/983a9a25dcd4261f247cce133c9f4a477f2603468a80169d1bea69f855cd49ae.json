A comparative analysis of gene expression profiles across annual, semi-annual, and non-annual killifishes (Cyprinodontiformes: Nothobranchiidae)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308855","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Chi Jing Leow, Kyle R. Piller</p>\r\n\r\nThe Turquoise Killifish is an important vertebrate for the study of aging and age-related diseases due to its short lifespan. Within Nothobranchiidae, species possess annual, semi-annual, or non-annual life-histories. We took a comparative approach and examined gene expression profiles (QuantSeq) from 62 individuals from eleven nothobranchid species that span three life-histories. Our results show significant differences in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across life-histories with non-annuals and semi-annuals being most similar, and annuals being the most distinct. At finer scales, we recovered significant differences in DEGs for DNA repair genes and show that non-annual and semi-annuals share similar gene expression profiles, while annuals are distinct. Most of the GO terms enriched in annuals are related to metabolic processes. However, GO terms, including translation, protein transport, and DNA replication initiation also are enriched in annuals. Non-annuals are enriched in Notch signaling pathway genes and downregulated in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway compared to annual species, which suggests that non-annuals have stronger regulation in cellular processes. This study provides support for congruency in DEGs involved in these life-histories and provides strong evidence that a particular set of candidate genes may be worthy of study to investigate their role in the aging process.","author":"Chi Jing Leow","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"983a9a25dcd4261f247cce133c9f4a477f2603468a80169d1bea69f855cd49ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
