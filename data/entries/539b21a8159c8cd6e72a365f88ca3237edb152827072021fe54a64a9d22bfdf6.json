{"title":"Cu2O Nanoparticles as Nanocarriers and Its Antibacterial Efficacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1818/v1","date":1721797337000,"content":"In this study, Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized using the sol-gel technique and subsequently functionalized with extracts from plants of the Rauvolfioideae subfamily and citrus fruits. Com-prehensive characterization techniques, including UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, XRD, BET, SEM, and TEM, were employed to evaluate the structural and surface properties of the synthesized nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that both functionalized Cu2O nanoparticles exhibit mesoporous structures, as confirmed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution analysis. The Green Extract functionalized nanoparticles displayed a more uniform pore size distribution compared to those functionalized with the Orange Extract. The study un-derscores the potential of these functionalized Cu2O nanoparticles for applications in drug de-livery, catalysis, and adsorption processes, highlighting the influence of the functionalization method on their textural properties and performance in antibacterial efficacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"539b21a8159c8cd6e72a365f88ca3237edb152827072021fe54a64a9d22bfdf6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
