{"title":"Collateral assessment on magnetic resonance imaging/angiography up to 30 hours after stroke onset","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309779","date":1725372000000,"content":"<p>by Shinya Tomari, Thomas Lillicrap, Carlos Garcia-Esperon, Yumi Tomari Kashida, Andrew Bivard, Longting Lin, Christopher R.

Spratt</p>\r\nPurpose <p>We aimed to validate hyperintense vessel sign (HVS) on FLAIR imaging or posterior cerebral artery (PCA) laterality on MR angiography beyond 4.5 hours after stroke onset.</p> Materials and methods <p>Data from acute ischemic stroke patients with internal carotid or middle cerebral artery occlusion who underwent CT perfusion imaging at baseline, follow-up MR perfusion imaging and angiography within 30 hours after stroke, without effective recanalization on follow-up imaging, were analysed retrospectively. Patients were separately classified as high or low HVS (&gt;5 or â‰¤5 slices of HVS), and PCA laterality positive or negative group. We compared core and penumbra volumes at follow-up imaging and neurological outcomes between high or low HVS group, and between PCA laterality positive or negative group.</p> Results <p>Of 49 patients analyzed, four patients with artifacts were excluded and 45 were classified into high (n = 23) or low (n = 22) HVS group. High group had a smaller core volume (median 32 ml versus 109 ml, p = 0.004), larger penumbra volume at follow-up (68 ml versus 0 ml, p = 0.001), and better outcomes (modified Rankin Scale at three months, 3 versus 5, p = 0.03). For PCA laterality analysis, 1 patient with previously occluded PCA was excluded and 48 patients were classified as positive (n = 22) or negative (n = 26). Positive group had larger core volume (116 ml versus 37 ml), and no significant differences in penumbral volumes or outcomes.</p> Conclusion <p>Prominent HVS in later time was associated with small core volume, persistent penumbra volume and favorable outcomes.</p>","author":"Shinya Tomari","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5a6f755913e4249a58f39d39b12ebb7c1d7a32e4d280d10a18eac53c608de0a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
