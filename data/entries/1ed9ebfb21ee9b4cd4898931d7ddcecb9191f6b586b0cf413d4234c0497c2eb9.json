{"title":"Conservation implications of somatic growth and length-at-age in Pseudemys gorzugi, Rio Grande Cooter","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05486-6","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Conservation decisions are often based on population models that rely on underlying assumptions made about species' demographic parameters. The Rio Grande Cooter (<em>Pseudemys gorzugi</em>) is a conservation-dependent riverine turtle, but our understanding of its population dynamics has been limited due to the absence of long-term surveys. We used mark-recapture data collected between 2016 and 2022 from the Black River, New Mexico, USA, to evaluate <em>P. gorzugi</em> somatic growth parameters. Females reached larger maximum size than males but exhibited a slower growth rate. We observed only a slight difference in maximum length and Brody growth coefficient of turtles from different locations, but the growth coefficients were overall significantly lower than any other <em>Pseudemys</em> species. Turtles on the Black River represent the northernmost robust population of <em>P. gorzugi</em>. In light of the intense human use of the river and riparian areas coupled with the impacts of climate change, it is imperative to maintain commitment to conservation efforts to resist population declines given the slow somatic growth rate of the population.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"1ed9ebfb21ee9b4cd4898931d7ddcecb9191f6b586b0cf413d4234c0497c2eb9","category":"Environment"}
