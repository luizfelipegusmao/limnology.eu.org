{"title":"The best USB-C charger for your MacBook Pro or Air","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html","date":1692456300000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the iPhone, Apple ships a USB-C power adapter with all its MacBooks: Air and Pro. Unless your laptop stays in the same place all of the time, having a spare or a specific travel MacBook charger is a useful addition. You can buy a second Apple charger or check out more versatile, cheaper and smaller MacBook chargers to suit your needs and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to note that there are risks with buying a cheap charger and we don’t recommend you choose on price alone. That bargain MacBook charger might just fry your laptop or get dangerously hot. However, there are some great premium chargers from trusted brands that sell for less than Apple pricey chargers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for in a MacBook charger</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PD charging</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need is a Power Delivery (PD) charger that can connect to your MacBook via USB-C. PD chargers can support up to 240W of power, although the most common congregate around the standard laptop power requirements: 30W, 45W, 65W and 100W. All the USB-C chargers we have tested here are PD chargers. All the chargers tested here can also fast-charge an iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PD version 3.0</strong> supports up to 100W. <strong>PD 3.1</strong> can charge at 140W, which is what you need to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. Note that Apple requires you use its USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable, rather than a USB-C cable, for fast-charging the 140W 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wattage</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of power a charger can give your MacBook is, safety aside, the most important feature to look for when choosing a laptop charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A laptop is designed to draw up to a certain amount of watts when running at full power; that is when you are stretching it by using lots of apps or pushing the graphics and video rendering functions—not when you’re just browsing the web. This level of max power is what the manufacturer considers when it decides on the wattage of the charger it includes with the laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the laptop is idle or doing mundane jobs, it will draw only a small amount of power from the charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fast Charging</strong>   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple supports silicon fast charging on its latest MacBook models. When connected with the right charger and cable, you can charge a MacBook battery up to 50 per cent in 30 minutes. The M2 MacBook Air can be fast charged using a 65W or higher power adapter and the MagSafe or USB-C charging cable; see our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819644/m2-macbook-air-usb-c-67w-35w-dual-compact-charger.html\" target=\"_blank\">M2 MacBook Air fast-charging tests</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the 14-inch MacBook Pro, you can fast-charge with either Apple’s 140W USB-C Power Adapter and the USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable, or a 96W or higher USB-C charger and USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable or USB-C charge cable.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the 16-inch MacBook Pro, you can only fast-charge with Apple’s 140W USB-C Power Adapter paired with the USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable. Apple, Anker and Ugreen are the only companies to make a power adapter that supports the latest PD 3.1 standard that supports power output to up to 240W; other USB chargers have a practical maximum of 100W. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is fine to charge a laptop with a higher-wattage power adapter than it needs. It won’t charge it any quicker (unless you follow the fast-charge rules above), but rest assured that a premium charger such as the ones reviewed here won’t overcharge the MacBook battery and may have extra ports to change iPhones and other devices. If the charger has more wattage than it needs, it can use the spare power to charge other devices at the same time as the laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ports</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the M2 MacBook Air arrived in July 2022, all Apple MacBook chargers had just one port. It makes sense, but more ports make even more sense as we all have more than one device that needs charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re using your MacBook at full power, your charger might not have enough spare power for charging other devices unless you buy a charger with a higher wattage where the excess power can be channeled to your iPhone or AirPods at the same time as you power your laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter Apple has finally released a MacBook charger with two ports for its MacBook Air, although at 35W total, you’re going to get much slower charging than using it on its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Portability</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s silicon-based power adapters are mostly larger than third-party chargers that are built using Gallium nitride (GaN) technology. GaN is a material that produces less heat—and less heat means components can be closer together. This means GaN chargers can be smaller than previously possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of today’s GaN chargers are so small they can slip in your pocket, although you’ll still need to coil that USB-C cable somewhere too. Apple is late to the GaN party, but its recent GaN power adapters are certainly smaller than its older models.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Foldable-pins-USB-C-charger.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Foldable plug pins on USB-C charger\" width=\"1034\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Foldable-pins-USB-C-charger.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Foldable-pins-USB-C-charger.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Foldable-pins-USB-C-charger.jpg?resize=768%2C505&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Foldable-pins-USB-C-charger.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" /></figure><p>UGreen</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to their ultra-safe, sturdy three-pin Type G plug, the U.K. models are usually wider than their U.S. Type A and B plug counterparts. None, for instance, feature handy folding plug pins (see above) that can be found on a lot of the U.S. wall chargers. Apple actually has a 20W charger with folding U.K. plug pins but the space-saving technology hasn’t made it into the larger-capacity U.K. MacBook chargers yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dimensions given in our reviews are for the U.S. models, which are also pictured for each product, but U.K. models are mostly also available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need true portability away from a power socket, look for a laptop power bank. We tested a 25000mAh power bank that can fully recharge a 14-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wall, desktop or strip</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the PD chargers we review here are wall chargers that plug straight into the power socket. You could also consider a desktop charger, which differs from a straight-to-socket wall charger by connecting to power via a longer plugged cable, so offering greater range. This is sometimes a neater and more versatile desk solution, but isn’t as pocketable for travel as a wall charger that requires just the charger-to-device cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is a power strip or extender. The best we’ve seen is from Ugreen. Its <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DigiNest-Extension-Extender-Charging/dp/B09QG8STT2?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">100W 7-in-1 power strip</a></strong> features two 100W PD USB-C ports, one 22.5W USB-C and one 22.5W USB-A port, plus an extension plug socket on its top. Baseus has a more compact <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Baseus-PowerCombo-Charging-2-Outlets/dp/B0B71GPGQD?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>100W PowerCombo</strong></a> strip with four USB ports. Both are reviewed below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cable</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to connect the charger to your MacBook using a USB-C to USB-C charging cable or USB-C to MagSafe cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Mac has a MagSafe 3 port (MacBook Air introduced in 2022; 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro introduced in 2021), you can use Apple’s own USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable (PD 3.1-supporting 240W maximum). As well as freeing up one of the MacBook’s Thunderbolt ports, this can protect from accidental cable pulls and is required for MacBook fast-charging on the 16in, but it is expensive at <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-819438-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYV3AM/A/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-2-m-silver\" target=\"_blank\">$49</a>/<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-819438-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLYV3ZM/A/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-2m-silver\" target=\"_blank\">£49</a> compared to a quality USB-C cable. Apple’s USB-C to USB-C charging cables (100W maximum) cost $19/£19 but you can find quality USB-C charging cables cheaper, for example from Ugreen (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ugreen.com/collections/usb-c-cable?uff_oiqzjk_collections=156910583870&amp;xcust=1-1-819438-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">direct U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E2E437ED-0308-43D2-873B-1578117B4B54?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.com</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/EBA34CB2-501A-47D7-B1EA-46F9DB223642?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon U.K.</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few of the chargers reviewed here come with a USB-C cable. Of course, you can use the cable that shipped with your MacBook, but having a spare is always useful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are our reviews of our favorite MacBook chargers.

It is also tiny in comparison to the Apple-supplied charger (38% smaller in volume than Apple’s non-GaN 30W Power Adapter, and 20% smaller than the 35W charger), and significantly cheaper while being a safe, trusted brand. </p>\n\n<p>Like the other Anker wall chargers, this model features foldable (U.S.) plug pins.

Each of the two USB-C ports can supply up to 67W, although obviously not at the same time as 67W is the total possible output. And the USB-A port supports up to 22.5W. It is the smallest multiport USB-C wall charger, and it weighs just 136g, an indistinguishable difference to the equally compact 130g Ugreen Nexode 65W 3-Port USB-C Wall Charger. </p>\n\n<p>Both the U.S. the U.K. models feature a foldable plug. The U.K. model is a little larger due to the type-G 3-pin plug but it’s the smallest and lightest multiport 67W charger available in the U.K.</p>\n\n<p>Each port will adapt to your charging requirements. You can charge a laptop at up to 65W using just one of the USB-C ports or charge the laptop at 45W and another device at 20W via the other USB-C port. Another option is to power a laptop at 40W via USB-C, and an iPhone or Apple Watch at up to 22.5W using the USB-A port. Using all three ports, the first USB-C port can power the laptop at 40W, the second an iPhone at 12W, and the USB-A port could power up your AirPods at 12W. </p>\n\n<p>It’s a great choice for fast-charging an M2 MacBook Air or just as a multiport solution for the 13in and entry-level 14in MacBook Pro.

On the top is the 10W wireless charging pad—sadly not MagSafe compatible but will work with all wireless-charging iPhones regardless.</p>\n\n<p>To charge all three devices at top power you’ll need a 100W charger connected to the MacMate.</p>\n\n<p>The charging station is tiny and lightweight, so makes a great travel multi-device charging companion—especially when paired with the OneWorld 65.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUgreen 145W Power Bank for Laptop – Best power bank for MacBook\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1200\" height=\"843\" alt=\"Ugreen 145W Power Bank for Laptop – Best power bank for MacBook\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ugreen-145W-Power-Bank-for-Laptop.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPortable 25000mAh power\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t145W total power output\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t3 ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tRequires charger\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$149.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJQ7F16T?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ugreen.com/collections/power-bank/products/ugreen-145w-power-bank-for-laptop&amp;xcust=1-1-819438-6-1967823-17684&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Ugreen</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Dimensions (W,H,D):</strong>  6.3 x 3.2 x 1.1in (16 x 8.1 x 2.8cm)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 18.1oz (513g)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x USB-C (100W PD 3.0), 1x USB-C (45W), 1x USB-A (18W)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Gray</p>\n\n<p>We are not always sat next to a power socket when we need to recharge our MacBook Pro or Air.

It’s more powerful than Apple’s 35W Power Adapter and less expensive. It does have just the one port, but the amount of spare charge you’d get using a 35W charger with a MacBook Air isn’t likely to offer much if you are also trying to charge even your AirPods unless the laptop was sitting doing not much at all at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going for a 65W or even 100W multiport charger makes more sense. Anker’s three-port <strong>Anker Prime 67W GaN Wall Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4YTB56H?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-Charger-Compact-Foldable-MacBook-Black/dp/B0C4Y1FFQH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>) can charge a laptop at 45W and an iPhone or iPad at 20W. It has two USB-C ports (both capable of PD charging at 65W, although not at the same time) and a 22.5W USB-A port. You could even charge a MacBook Air at 40W (still higher than Apple’s supplied charger), an iPhone at 12W and a set of AirPods at 5W. Or fast-charge an M2 MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugreen’s 3-port <strong>Nexode 65W USB-C Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Gallium-Nitride-Charger-Black/dp/B091BGMKYS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-65W-Ports-Wall-Charger/dp/B088CZ8CYG?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>) is similar, although a smidge larger. Using all three ports, you could charge a laptop at 45W and two smaller devices at 8.5W each.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best charger for 13-inch or 14-inch MacBook Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro ships with a 67W Power Adapter, so you can look to a 65W charger to save on money and size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice of charger for the 14-inch MacBook Pro depends on the model. The entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro ships with a 67W adapter while the 10-core model ships with a 96W charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 65W charger will suffice, but you won’t get fast-charging like you will with a 100W model. Anker has the most affordable single-port charger, the <strong>715 Nano II 65W</strong> (<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa2663%3Fvariant%3D41093880250518&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-819438-1-0-0\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fuk%2Fproducts%2Fa2663%3Fvariant%3D42091708711076&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-819438-1-0-0\">U.K.</a>).

We prefer a charger that can power multiple devices at the same time, so we like Ugreen’s 4-port <strong>Nexode 100W USB-C Wall Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-100W-USB-Multiport-Charger/dp/B091Z6JNX4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-GaN-Fast-Charger-100W/dp/B091N7FVDL?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a budget one-port 100W wall charger, the <strong>Nekteck 100W USB-C Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nekteck-Charger-Certified-Foldable-Compatible/dp/B09MD9HJG6?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a>) will save you some cash and has a neat foldable U.S. plug. It also comes with its own 2m (6.5ft) USB-C cable but doesn’t work with Apple’s MagSafe 3 charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most powerful desktop charger we’ve tested is Ugreen’s <strong>Nexode 200W USB-C Desktop Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Nexode-200W-Desktop-Charger/dp/B09MGRNYHH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Charger-Adapter-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B09PFRGBGR?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>), which boasts a whopping six ports (4x USB-C, and 2x USB-A).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best charger for 16-inch MacBook Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Until recently Apple made this recommendation easy. Its <strong>140W Power Adapter</strong> (<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-819438-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYU3AM/A/140w-usb-c-power-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-819438-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MLYU3B/A/140w-usb-c-power-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>) will fast-charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021 and later models) from 0-50 percent charge in 30 minutes as it supports the most up-to-date PD 3.1 charing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple recommends pairing its 140W Power Adapter with a 16‑inch MacBook Pro (2021) using its USB-C to MagSafe 3 as the only way to fast-charge. It’s not cheap, but for pure power this is the combination you want with Apple’s largest MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anker has now released its own PD 3.1 fast-charging USB-C 140W charger, the <strong>Anker 717 Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Laptop-MacBook-Galaxy/dp/B09W2R6SHB?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">U.S.</a>), which is the same price and limited to the same one port. It is, however, 40% smaller than Apple’s super-tall 140W charger. We therefore recommend this as a portable second charger for 16in MacBook Pro owners if they travel with their laptop a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both 140W chargers’ limitation is its single USB-C port, so unless you are using all that 140W potential, any remaining power can’t be used to simultaneously charge other devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the multiport PD 3.1 <strong>Ugreen Nexode 140W Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B129DM9T?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Nexode-Charger-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B09YQ374LF?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>), which offers fast 140W charging in a package with three ports. Fast-charge the 16-inch MacBook using the bottom USB-C port, and luxuriate with another 100W port above, and a 22.5W USB-A port at the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can live without the fast charging, a 100W charger should be ample for most situations, and here there are more options with multi-charging opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugreen’s <strong>Nexode 100W USB-C Wall Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-100W-USB-Multiport-Charger/dp/B091Z6JNX4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-GaN-Fast-Charger-100W/dp/B091N7FVDL?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>) has four charging ports, but for a budget one-port 100W wall charger it’s hard to beat the <strong>Nekteck 100W USB-C Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nekteck-Charger-Certified-Foldable-Compatible/dp/B09MD9HJG6?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S</a>), which comes with its own 2m (6.5ft) USB-C cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, again, Ugreen’s powerful <strong>Nexode 200W USB-C Desktop Charger</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Nexode-200W-Desktop-Charger/dp/B09MGRNYHH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Charger-Adapter-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B09PFRGBGR?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a>) is a great, if less portable, option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which charger does each MacBook need?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the power specs of the batteries and power adapters that Apple ships with each of its MacBooks:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M1 MacBook Air</strong>: 30W Power Adapter</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M2 MacBook Air</strong>: 30W or 35W Power Adapter depending on 8-or-10-core GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>13-inch M1 MacBook Pro</strong>: 67W Power Adapter</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>13-inch M2 MacBook Pro</strong>: 67W Power Adapter</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro</strong>: 67W or 96W Power Adapter depending on 14-or-16-core GPU</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>15-inch MacBook Pro</strong>: 87W Power Adapter</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>16-inch MacBook Pro</strong>: 140W Power Adapter</p>\n\n\n\n<div><h2> FAQ </h2><hr />\n<div><div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Can you use a charger with a higher wattage than your laptop?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Yes, you can safely use a laptop charger with a higher wattage as the laptop will only ever draw the amount of power required at the time. If your laptop was supplied with a 35W charger it will never draw more than 35W unless being fast-charged, so you can use a 65W, 90W or higher charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the charger has multiple ports that extra juice will mean you can charge other devices at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Can you use a charger with a lower wattage than your laptop?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>You can but you should try to avoid using a lower wattage charger than what your laptop requires. A 30W charger can’t supply sufficient power for a 90W laptop’s needs. At the least, your laptop is likely to run out of power while you are using it. At the worst, you could damage the laptop or create dangerous problems for the charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The under-powered charger won’t have enough power to give to your laptop and it therefore has to work harder to try to match the needs of your laptop. The danger is that this can cause overheating and potentially fire.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nComputer Accessories, Laptop Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"91984834cd351d15b1a59e52b2a83b8e8c8b9aa9a970506218411d163076080a","category":"Apple"}
