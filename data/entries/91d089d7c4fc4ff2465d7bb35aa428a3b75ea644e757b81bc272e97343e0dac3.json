{"title":"Forcados Asphaltene and Its Combustion Characteristics for Future Fuel Examination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0569/v1","date":1715238921000,"content":"The high dependence on light crude oil as the main source of energy in automobiles., industrial processes, source of raw material for various industrial synthesis have made the heavy crude more available in the world and open for research work on its potentials as a source of energy for the increasing population of the world in areas like energy source for powering big marine engines, energy source in heavy industrial machines e.t.c. Though the relatively unfavourable characteristics of heavy fuel oil such as; high viscosity, high probability of precipitating is a reasonable challenge to the possible utilization of heavy fuel as a source of energy in the areas highlighted above. These issues of heavy fuel oil are largely due to the presence of Asphaltene in it which is a large complex hydrocarbon in heavy fuel oil. Understanding the combustion potential of asphaltene is therefore an interesting and challenging problem that has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. This research work is aimed at carrying combustion studies on the Forcados (Ni-geria) heavy fuel fraction asphaltene HFFA extracted from Forcados crude Oil and examining its combustion characteristics with the view to examine it for future sweet heavy fuel generation for it source got low sulphur content, to ascertain the volatile composition, moisture and ash content. The HFFA extracted to determine physical characteristics of the HFFA extracted for fuel properties potentialities and this study was carried out to evaluate the chemical constituents of forcadous asphaltene lead-ing to the generaration of HFFA using GCMS. The Forcados asphaltene showed some good fuel properties when subjected to ce-tane number, API gravity, flash point and cloud point parameter test. Probing further with AAS for trace metal presence showed some high concentration on Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn) and Zinc (Zn) indicating the potential for residual and soot formation after combus-tion. But still being a sweet asphaltene from Nigerian sweet crude source will be de-void of corrosive effect on machineries and heavy fuel engine if used to power it as in the case of high sulphur content in Venezuelan crude oil and some other world. The GCMS showed the decomposition of heavy crude asphaltene peaks and sig-naling the presence of heavy fuel fraction in the composition of the asphaltene while the FTIR and the UV-VIS identified the various functional groups in the compounds and the identification of signals that cannot be seen in the normal spectrum respec-tively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91d089d7c4fc4ff2465d7bb35aa428a3b75ea644e757b81bc272e97343e0dac3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
