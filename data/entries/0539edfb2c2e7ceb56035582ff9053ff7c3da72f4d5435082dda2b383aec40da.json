{"title":"Value of hepatic artery digital subtraction angiography in the detection of small hepatocellular carcinoma lesions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24316?af=R","date":1724158478000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>To compare the detection rates of hepatic artery digital subtraction angiography (HA-DSA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (MRI-Gd-DTPA) and MRI gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (MRI-Gd-EOB-DTPA) for small (diameter ≤2 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>A prospective analysis of patients admitted to the Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University between January 1, 2015, and December 30, 2016, was conducted. The detection rates of the three methods were analyzed. The diameter of small HCC lesions detected using HA-DSA and MRI-Gd-EOB-DTPA were evaluated. The diagnostic value of HCC Barcelona staging for HA-DSA was analyzed.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>For 107 small lesions detected in 57 patients, the detection rates of HA-DSA and MRI-Gd-DTPA were 86.0% (92/107) and 71.0% (76/107), respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). Of 77 small lesions detected in 42 patients using MRI-Gd-EOB-DTPA and HA-DSA, 67 were detected using HA-DSA, all of which had a rich blood supply, and 72 were detected using MRI-Gd-EOB-DTPA. The minimum diameter of lesions detected using MRI-Gd-EOB-DTPA was approximately 0.4 cm, whereas that of lesions detected using HA-DSA was approximately 0.5 cm. After HA-DSA, a change in the Barcelona staging occurred in 33.3% (62/186) of cases but not after MRI-Gd-DTPA; HA-DSA was significantly better than MRI-Gd-DTPA for staging (<i>p</i> = .03).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>HA-DSA and MRI-Gd-EOB-DTPA have high diagnostic values for the detection of small HCC lesions, which is helpful for accurate staging of HCC and provides the most valuable information for patient treatment and prognosis.</p>","author":"Tao Bai, \nShaolong Lu, \nJie Chen, \nJiazhou Ye, \nXiaobo Wang, \nZhihong Tang, \nHongyuan Fu, \nLequn Li, \nFeixiang Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"0539edfb2c2e7ceb56035582ff9053ff7c3da72f4d5435082dda2b383aec40da","category":"Environment"}
