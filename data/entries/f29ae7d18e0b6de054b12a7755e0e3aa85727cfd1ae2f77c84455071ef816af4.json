{"title":"A New Type of Hydraulic Clutch with Magnetorheological Fluid: Theory and Experiment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0319/v1","date":1712153967000,"content":"The paper presents a new type of hydraulic clutch operating with magnetorheological (MR) fluids and the results achieved from both theoretical analysis and experimental measurement. The hy-draulic clutch system of its own design with MR working fluid and a rotating magnetic field lo-cated is designed. The principle of this clutch is to use a rotating magnetic field created by an al-ternating current electromagnet to set the MR fluid in motion. In the tests of the hydraulic clutch with a rotating magnetic field, MR fluid produced on their own, consisting of solid iron particles of various diameters mixed with a silicone oil, are used as working fluids. The rheological properties of MR fluids are assessed on the basis of tests carried out with a Brookfield DV2T rheometer equipped with a magnetic device for generating the magnetic field of its own design. The char-acteristics of the hydraulic clutch with MR working fluid and the rotating magnetic field are tested on a specially built test stand. As a result of the research, it has been found that the torque transmitted by the clutch is the greater, the higher the rotational speed of the magnetic field and the lower the rotational speed of the beaker in which the working fluid is placed, and that the greatest torque occurs for the working fluid with the highest iron content. Based on the analysis of the structure and characteristics of the clutch in which the magnetic field is used, it has been shown that the design of the developed clutch is similar to that of an induction clutch, and its characteristics correspond to the characteristics of the eddy current clutch. Therefore, the proposed new clutch working with MR fluid and the rotating magnetic field can be applied to stationary power transmission system similarly to an eddy current clutch.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f29ae7d18e0b6de054b12a7755e0e3aa85727cfd1ae2f77c84455071ef816af4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
