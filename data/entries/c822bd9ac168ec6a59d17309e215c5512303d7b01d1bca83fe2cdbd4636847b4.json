In the present work, we explored the microrelief of the pronotum cuticle surface of a paracoprid dung beetle species inhabiting Argentina, <span>Gromphas lacordairii</span> (Oken, 1834) (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae). This species has two characteristics which distinguish it from other previously studied species. First, <span>G. lacordairii</span> is found in humid areas, especially wetlands, including floodplains, river sandbanks, grasslands, forest edges and gallery forests [<a href=\"#ozae044.473-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.473-B5\">5</a>]. Second, the cuticle of the pronotum presents granules instead of dimples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c822bd9ac168ec6a59d17309e215c5512303d7b01d1bca83fe2cdbd4636847b4","category":"Environment"}
