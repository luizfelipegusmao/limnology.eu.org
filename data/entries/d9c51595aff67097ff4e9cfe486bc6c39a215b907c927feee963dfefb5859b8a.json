{"title":"Impacts of economic factors influencing net returns of beef feedlot heifers administered two implant programs and fed for differing days-on-feed from pooled randomized controlled trials","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae021/7610978?rss=1","date":1708387200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of two implant programs and differing days-on-feed (DOF) on net returns of beef feedlot heifers using sensitivity analyses of key economic factors. Crossbred beef heifers [<span>n</span> = 10,583; initial weight 315 kg (± 20.1 SD)] were enrolled across three trials (one Kansas, two Texas feedlot trials). Heifers were blocked by arrival and randomly allocated to one of six pens, resulting in a total of 144 pens and 24 blocks. Pen was randomly assigned to treatment as a 2 × 3 factorial. Implant programs were: IH + 200—Revalor-IH at initial processing, and a terminal implant after approximately 90 DOF (Revalor-200), or, XH—a single implant at initial processing (Revalor-XH). The DOF treatments were: heifers fed to a standard baseline endpoint (BASE) or heifers fed for an additional + 21 or + 42 d beyond BASE. Pen-level partial budgets were used for economic sensitivity analyses, which varied price points of single pricing components with all other components fixed. Variable components were live-fed cattle prices, base carcass prices (i.e., dressed), Choice-Select spread (CS-spread), and feed and yardage prices (FYP). For each, a Low, Mid-Low, Middle, Mid-High, and High price was chosen. Linear mixed models were fit for statistical analyses (α = 0.05). There were no significant two-way interactions (<span>P</span>-values ≥ 0.14). Regardless of the variable component evaluated, XH heifers had poorer net returns than IH + 200 at all prices (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04). Selling live, the + 21 and (or) + 42 heifers had lower net returns than BASE at every fed cattle price point (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Selling dressed, the + 21 and (or) + 42 heifers had lower returns than BASE at Low, Mid-Low, and Middle fed cattle base prices (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01); there were no significant DOF differences at Mid-High, or High prices (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.24). Net returns were lower for + 42 than BASE at all CS-spreads (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.03), while BASE and + 21 did not differ significantly. Longer DOF had lower net returns than BASE when selling live at every FYP (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) except at the Low price (<span>P</span> = 0.14). Selling dressed, there was no significant effect of DOF at Low or Mid-Low FYP (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.11); conversely, extended DOF had lower net returns than BASE at Middle, Mid-High, and High FYP (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Overall, there was minimal economic evidence to support extending feedlot heifer DOF beyond the BASE endpoint, and when feeding longer, larger reductions in return were observed when marketing live as opposed to dressed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"d9c51595aff67097ff4e9cfe486bc6c39a215b907c927feee963dfefb5859b8a","category":"Environment"}
