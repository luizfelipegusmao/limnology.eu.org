However, potential food allergy risks limit their use in the food industry. This work aims to reveal the mechanism of β-conglycinin-induced food allergy, and to explore the regulatory mechanism of heat treatment and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment in a BALB/c mouse model.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Our results showed that oral administration of β-conglycinin induced severe allergic symptoms in BALB/c mice, but these symptoms were effectively alleviated through heat treatment and HHP treatment. Moreover, β-conglycinin stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation; a large number of cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-13 were released and interferon γ secretion was inhibited, which disrupted the Th1/Th2 immune balance and promoted the differentiation and proliferation of naive T cells into Th2-type cells.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Heat/non-heat treatment altered the conformation of soybean protein, which significantly reduced allergic reactions in mice. This regulatory mechanism may be associated with Th1/Th2 immune balance. Our results provide data support for understanding the changes in allergenicity of soybean protein within the food industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tanghao Li, \nGuanhao Bu, \nYixuan Chen, \nQingqing Zhao, \nYongfeng Chang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"0c65ccce8437b0f02e326da74729a9ac10c005bf5332ab2eab6ffebc1a4dd740","category":"Environment"}
