{"title":"Heat-induced SUMOylation differentially affects bacterial effectors in plant cells","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2103/7623182?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bacterial pathogens deliver effectors into host cells to suppress immunity. How host cells target these effectors is critical in pathogen–host interactions. SUMOylation, an important type of posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells, plays a critical role in immunity, but its effect on bacterial effectors remains unclear in plant cells. In this study, using bioinformatic and biochemical approaches, we found that at least 16 effectors from the bacterial pathogen <span>Pseudomonas syringae</span> pv. <span>tomato</span> DC3000 are SUMOylated by the enzyme cascade from <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. Mutation of SUMOylation sites on the effector HopB1 enhances its function in the induction of plant cell death via stability attenuation of a plant receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1)-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1. By contrast, SUMOylation is essential for the function of another effector, HopG1, in the inhibition of mitochondria activity and jasmonic acid signaling. SUMOylation of both HopB1 and HopG1 is increased by heat treatment, and this modification modulates the functions of these 2 effectors in different ways in the regulation of plant survival rates, gene expression, and bacterial infection under high temperatures. Therefore, the current work on the SUMOylation of effectors in plant cells improves our understanding of the function of dynamic protein modifications in plant–pathogen interactions in response to environmental conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cdb684d3982d0b610d502964ddc74da07f5dfa57a367212793255fb278157ed9","category":"Environment"}
