{"title":"Spatial, Spectral and Time Resolution: Tackling the Challenges of Multidimensional Luminescence Data Analysis with LumiSpy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.006/7719409?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Over the past few decades, advances in instrumentation as well as the enhanced computing powers enabling the acquisition and handling of large datasets have pushed a development towards multidimensional datasets in electron microscopy. While cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy started out with photomultipliers that either allowed the acquisition of a spatial map of the luminescence distribution or of a spectrum integrated over a certain area [<a href=\"#ozae044.006-B1\">1</a>], charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras have established hyperspectral mapping as a standard measurement mode. With improvements in ultrafast pulsing of electron microscopes [<a href=\"#ozae044.006-B2\">2</a>] and the combination with streak cameras for detection, both the temporal and spectral dimensions can be mapped by dedicated CL systems. While the size of the datasets is no issue for current computers, the adequate and efficient analysis and clear visualization are a remaining challenge. As each research project poses different questions, these tasks require rather a suitable toolbox than a standard solution. We will introduce the HyperSpy ecosystem with its dedicated extension LumiSpy for luminescence spectroscopy data as such a versatile and vendor-agnostic toolbox. As a sample study, the determination of the carrier diffusion length in Ga(As,Sb) semiconductor nanowires (NWs) from hyperspectral and time-resolved CL (TRCL) will be discussed. Finally, we will give an outlook on the application laboratory time-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, which is currently being established at our institute.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1077817d79fb317924e1f445da0bea2f2a9ab24173112bd2d1cc544cb7f4b051","category":"Environment"}
