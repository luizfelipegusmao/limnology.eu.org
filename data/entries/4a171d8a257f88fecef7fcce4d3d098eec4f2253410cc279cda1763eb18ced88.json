{"title":"WOX11-LBD16 double partner dancing: a feedback circuitry for crown root development in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1580/7577728?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span>In cereals, the primary root degenerates after germination, but adventitious roots, also known as crown roots (CRs), persist throughout the plantâ€™s life cycle. CRs emerge from underground shoot nodes and constitute the primary elements of the root system, serving crucial functions in nutrient absorption, stress resilience, and overall yield (<a href=\"#koae018-B2\">Rogers and Benfey 2015</a>). The regulation of CR development in rice involves WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) and lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) transcription factors. Yet, the precise molecular mechanisms governing these regulatory processes in rice remain elusive.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"4a171d8a257f88fecef7fcce4d3d098eec4f2253410cc279cda1763eb18ced88","category":"Environment"}
