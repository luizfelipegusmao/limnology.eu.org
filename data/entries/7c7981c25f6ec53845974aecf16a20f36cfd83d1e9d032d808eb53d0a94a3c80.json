This study investigates the effect of fine-grain migration on slope failure through flume experiments, focusing on the spatiotemporal characteristics and mechanisms of slope stability. A series of artificial rainfall flume experiments with varying rainfall intensities and slopes were conducted using soil samples collected from Wei Jia Gully. The experiments monitored pore-water pressure, grain migration, and failure sequences. Grain-size distribution parameters (<em>Î¼</em> and <em>D</em>c) were analyzed to understand the migration path and accumulation of fine grains. The experiments reveal that fine-grain migration significantly alters soil structure, leading to random blockage and interconnection of internal pore channels. These changes result in fluctuating pore-water pressure distributions and uneven fine-grain accumulation, critical factors in slope stability. Slope failures occur randomly and intermittently, influenced by fine-grain content in runoff and resulting pore-water pressure variations. This study highlights that fine-grain migration plays a vital role in slope stability, with significant implications for predicting and mitigating slope failures. The stochastic nature of fine-grain migration and its impact on soil properties should be incorporated into predictive models to enhance their accuracy and reliability.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"7c7981c25f6ec53845974aecf16a20f36cfd83d1e9d032d808eb53d0a94a3c80","category":"Environment"}
