{"title":"Natural pigment from Paracoccus carotinifaciens (Panaferd®‐AX) enhanced colour and immune system of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16061?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigated effects of a natural carotenoid, Panaferd®-AX, derived from the carotenoid-rich microorganism, <i>Paracoccus carotinifaciens</i>, on growth performance, survival, body pigmentation, immune responses and disease resistance of juvenile Pacific white shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>). Four dietary levels of Panaferd®-AX (0, 250, 500 and 1250 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> diet) were supplemented to a basal diet. The shrimp with an initial body weight of 4.00 ± 0.01 g were fed with these diets for 30 days. The results showed that shrimp growth, feed utilization and survival were not affected (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05) by the inclusion of the Panaferd®-AX in any of the dosages tested in the basal diet, under the current experimental conditions. Pigmentation and hemolymph immunological responses were significantly affected by the diets containing Panaferd®-AX (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The dietary supplementation with Panaferd®-AX enhances disease resistance against <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and mortality delayed after exposure to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). In conclusion, the diet supplemented with Panaferd®-AX can enhance pigmentation and antioxidant competence of <i>L. vannamei</i> and it has potential as a promising carotenoid source.</p>","author":"Nutt Nuntapong, \nWutiporn Phromkunthong, \nNaraid Suanyuk, \nDominique Corlay","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"98feea98c7712b7d7206ada0fa2d9943751f9dc1c3f86c3db1acb7bcca43b540","category":"Environment"}
