{"title":"Reliability of Noninvasive Sonic Tomography for Detection and Quantification of Internal Defects in Yoshino Cherry","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/3/259/7635535?rss=1","date":1711411200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Preventive maintenance through monitoring and early detection is important for trees that are structurally weak due to internal decay. Once internal decay has occurred, recovery of lost strength is irreversible. The decaying tree becomes vulnerable to external impacts, which may lead to breakage or windthrow. The Yoshino cherry (<span>Cerasus×yedoensis</span> (Matsum.) “Somei-yoshino”) accounts for a high proportion of landscape trees in Asia. Testing the reliability of noninvasive sonic tomography (SoT) to estimate internal defects could facilitate structural stability evaluation and proactive preventive management. We performed noninvasive SoT and invasive resistance microdrilling to detect and quantify internal defects in old and large Yoshino cherry trees. Generally, SoT reflected the areas and location of severe structural defects, showing a correlation with the resistance microdrilling results (R² = 0.542, <span>p &lt; </span>.001). However, when cracks were present in disks, the SoT overestimated defects and errors mainly observed in the transition zone (green). Based on these findings, when evaluating the SoT, careful decisions are needed to distinguish between actual defects and broad sonic shadows. Furthermore, additional evidence from drilling resistance is required to differentiate between incipient decay and cracks. The results of this study provide valuable insights for enhancing the interpretation of sonic tomograms.<strong>Study Implications</strong>: We suggest defect boundaries in sonic tomograms should be redefined to improve the accuracy of interpretation for any new species being studied. Careful drilling resistance measurements should be taken, especially in transition zones (green areas in tomogram) and incipient decay zone (light brown areas). Noninvasive sonic tomograms only reflect acoustic properties of the tested cross-section of a tree and cannot be considered an actual representation of the internal conditions until the readings are calibrated to destructive sampling results.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"b7d84ce3eb19c8646a45a09fa5b51fad93fbb581cf980606687a8e3ae652a8f9","category":"Environment"}
