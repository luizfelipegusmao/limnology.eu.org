{"title":"Oxidative Stress, LDL-Cholesterol and Lipoprotein(a): A New Formula to Balance Two Diverging Culprits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1317/v1","date":1716273965000,"content":"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, is a chronic inflammatory disease, linked to a state oxidative stress, with several well-identified culprits, of which low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a). No specific treatment is currently available to lower lipoprotein(a). It is, therefore, of paramount importance to identify nutritional factors that could lower lipoprotein(a). Growing evidence shows that although reducing saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake decreases LDL-C, it could increase lipoprotein(a). Optimal dietary recommendations may therefore differ depending on an in-dividualâ€™s baseline lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C levels. Assessing the diet-induced true LDL-C response and net balance of these two atherogenic entities is difficult because LDL-C measurement is confounded by lipoprotein(a) cholesterol content. We have estimated, for the first time, the net atherogenic result of diet-induced variations of both LDL-C and lipoprotein(a), thanks to our new concept of LDLapoB risk equivalent=apoB+lp(a)x5 (in nmol/L). This is illustrated, via the rare case of a physician with very high lipoprotein(a) and hypobetalipoproteinemia. She experiences twice a considerable lipoprotein(a) increase (+32%, + 28mg/dL, + 67nmol/L) and higher LDLapoB risk equivalent (138mg/dL versus 123mg/dL) on a mediterranean diet, low in SFA. A reasonable SFA intake, despite causing marginal LDL-C increase, may be advisable in patients with high lipoprotein(a) who need personalized dietary recommendations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4947ad50b8902fd56d3fe05a41679b4700920b2b5ceccd3c73658c215ffa788","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
