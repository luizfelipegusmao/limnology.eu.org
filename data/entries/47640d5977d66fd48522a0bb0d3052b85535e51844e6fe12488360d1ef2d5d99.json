{"title":"Exoscopic Versus Microscopic Surgery in 5-ALA Guided Resection of High Grade Gliomas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0154/v1","date":1714712948000,"content":"Background: Glioma surgery was remarkably renewed in the past 2 decades, with improved safety and limited but yet improved life expectations. Fluorescence-guided resection of high-grade gliomas (HGG) plays a central role in this sense, by allowing higher degrees of extent of resection (EOR). The introduction of the exoscopic guided surgery may be considered an im-plementation for fluorescence techniques over the traditional microscopes. We present the appli-cation and the advantages of the exoscopic guided surgery compared to the microscopic surgery in tumor resection guided by 5-ALA fluorescence in patients with HGG.\nMethods: ten consecutive patients underwent a surgery for HGG resection. The surgery was per-formed via an exoscopic-guided procedure (Olympus Orbeye) and after oral administration of Gliolan 5 hours before the procedure. During surgery, the procedure was shifted to microscope (Kinevo 900, Zeiss) view. The intensity of the fluorescence under the two different was subjectively measured in different picture samples during the surgery in a 1 to 5 (from minimum to maxi-mum) scale. The brightness of the surgical field and the detailing of the anatomy were also ana-lyzed comparatively.\nResults: among the ten patients the histopathological diagnosis was an high grade glioma in all cases. In 9 cases was possible to achieve the gross total resection. There was no perioperative mortality. The median fluorescence intensity, on a scale of 1â€“5, was 4.5 in the exoscope group and 3.5 in the microscope group (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47640d5977d66fd48522a0bb0d3052b85535e51844e6fe12488360d1ef2d5d99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
