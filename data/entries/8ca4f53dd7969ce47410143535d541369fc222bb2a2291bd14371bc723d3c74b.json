{"title":"Effect of the Localized Insecticides Spray Technique to Control Halyomorpha halys in Actinidia chinensis Orchards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1143/v1","date":1723725209000,"content":"Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) cultivation is expanding worldwide being China, New Zealand and Italy the major producing countries. Halyomorpha halys, the brown marmorated stink bug, has been raising serious concerns to kiwifruit cultivation both in China and Italy. This study aimed at improving the chemical control efficacy against this pest by comparing two insecticide spray techniques (a conventional ray atomizer and a trumpet-modified atomizer adapted for localized spray application in kiwifruit). In fact, kiwifruit is often grown with a ‘pergola’ training system, which may reduce the effectiveness of insecticide penetration into the canopy. Experiments have been performed in naturally infested orchards of both Actinidia chinensis var. chinensis ‘Jintao’ and A. chinensis var. deliciosa ‘Hayward’ during two consecutive seasons. Furthermore, mesh cages, each containing three H. halys adults, were deployed in the orchards to assess the insects’ mortality at 1, 3, 7 and 10 days after the insecticide application with the two spray techniques. In the cultivar 'Jintao', the two systems performed similarly, while in the cultivar 'Hayward', an overall significantly higher insect mortality was recorded with the trumpet atomizer. The crop damage was also evaluated on both cultivars, simulating the grower insecticide applications with the two spray techniques. At harvest, no difference emerged between the spray techniques, which provided a significantly better protection compared to the untreated control. Further investigations in this direction are needed also considering the restriction of insecticidal active substances ongoing in European Union and the need to maximize the efficacy of the available tools.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ca4f53dd7969ce47410143535d541369fc222bb2a2291bd14371bc723d3c74b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
