The technique, adapted from protocols to move stranded cetaceans, was modified to suit the dorso-ventrally compressed shape of mobulid rays and reduce damage to the animal while being pulled back into deeper water. The method and suggestions for its improvement have been described with the intention of assisting in the rescue of other stranded large mobulids.</p>","author":"Henrique Chupil, \nAndrielli Maryan Medeiros, \nAlisson Peter Brito Dopona, \nCarolina de Castro Treza, \nCaroline Freitas Pessi, \nEduardo Roberto Pereira","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"a38805d9d2c51266f5bc8665d5c787153583aa3394ecc55b04484a3dfe1a24f8","category":"Environment"}
