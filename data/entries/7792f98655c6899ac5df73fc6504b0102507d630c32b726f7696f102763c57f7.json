{"title":"Cerebral Aneurysms and AVM: Preliminary Experience with the Use of Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging Applied to Endoscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1789/v1","date":1729660719000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Indocyanine green videoangiography, integrated in the operative microscope, is frequently used in cerebrovascular surgery; it is believed to be a simple and reliable method for capturing high-resolution images in a real-time setting. This technology is often preferred, for cost or availability, to Doppler or intraoperative angiography DSA (Digital substraction angiography): with the same assumption it was possible, in our preliminary experience, to partially vicariate the aforementioned devices using the SPY mode of the Stryker endoscope; it allowed the visualization of fluorescence in high definition.; Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on a series of 5 patients suffering from cerebral aneurysm or AVM who underwent, during the last year at our institution, surgical treatment with the aid of the microscope supported by the Stryker endoscope in SPY mode for the visualization of fluorescence emitted by indocyanine green; Results: The intraoperative use of indocyanine green was a safe, rapid and effective technique within a preliminary case study of \"regular - not giant\" aneurysms and AVM located superficially in the cerebral parenchyma. The endoscopic technique in SPY mode has allowed to partially vicariate, in selected cases, the use of Doppler, intraoperative angiography and integrated microscope video angiography; Conclusions: the main purpose of aneurysm surgery is to completely exclude them from the cerebral vascular circulation in the absence of residues in the collar and occlusion of adjacent vessels; similarly, in AVM surgery the goal is the early identification of the nidus and to avoid residues within it given the high risk of new rupture. For these purposes, we propose, in selected cases and keeping in mind the limitations of the technique already described in the literature, the support of the endoscope in SPY mode during the microsurgical procedure in order to visualize the green fluorescence of indocyanine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7792f98655c6899ac5df73fc6504b0102507d630c32b726f7696f102763c57f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
