The extent to which risk factors, established in industrialised countries, impact the risk of infection and of disease in populations in sub-Saharan Africa, remains unclear. We estimated the incidence of mild and moderate COVID-19 in urban Mozambique and analysed factors associated with infection and disease in a population-based surveillance study. During December 2020-March 2022, 1,561 households (6,049 participants, median 21 years, 54.8% female, 7.3% disclosed HIV positive) of Polana Caniço, Maputo, Mozambique, were visited biweekly to report respiratory symptoms, anosmia, or ageusia, and self-administer a nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Every three months, dried blood spots of a subset of participants (1,412) were collected for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. Per 1000 person-years, 364.5 (95%CI 352.8–376.1) respiratory illness episodes were reported, of which 72.2 (95%CI 60.6–83.9) were COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rose from 4.8% (95%CI 1.1–8.6%) in December 2020 to 34.7% (95%CI 20.2–49.3%) in June 2021, when 3.0% were vaccinated. Increasing age, chronic lung disease, hypertension, and overweight increased risk of COVID-19. Older age increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. We observed no association between socio-economic status, behaviour and COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. Active surveillance in an urban population confirmed frequent COVID-19 underreporting, yet indicated that the large majority of cases were mild and non-febrile. In contrast to reports from industrialised countries, social deprivation did not increase the risk of infection nor disease.","author":"Brecht Ingelbeen","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"1189c1ed485d1cd470fa7d4a997f3cd4c5729d18da621e24af3b3c50eabd0929","category":"Environment"}
