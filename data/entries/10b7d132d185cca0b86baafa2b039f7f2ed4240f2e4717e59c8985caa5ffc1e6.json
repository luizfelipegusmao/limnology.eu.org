{"title":"Raccoons Reveal Hidden Diversity in Trabecular Bone Development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae038/7829353?rss=1","date":1729468800000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Trabecular bone, and its ability to rapidly modify its structure in response to strain exerted on skeletal elements, has garnered increased attention from researchers with the advancement of CT technology that allows for the analysis of its complex lattice-like framework. Much of this research has focused on adults of select taxa, but analysis into trabecular development across ontogeny remains limited. In this paper, we explore the shift in several trabecular characteristics in the articular head of the humerus and femur in <span>Procyon lotor</span> across the entirely of the speciesâ€™ lifespan. Our results show that while body mass plays a role in determining trabecular structure, other elements such as bone growth, increased activity, and puberty result in trends not observed in the interspecific analysis of adults. Furthermore, differences in the trabeculae of the humerus and femur suggest combining distinct boney elements in meta-analysis may obfuscate the variety in the structures. Finally, rates at which fore and hindlimb trabeculae orient themselves early in life differ enough to warrant further exploration to identify the currently unknown causes for their variation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"10b7d132d185cca0b86baafa2b039f7f2ed4240f2e4717e59c8985caa5ffc1e6","category":"Environment"}
