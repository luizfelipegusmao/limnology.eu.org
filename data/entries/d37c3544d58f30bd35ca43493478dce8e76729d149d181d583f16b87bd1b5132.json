{"title":"Field Ion Microscopy of Tungsten Nano-Tips Coated with Thin Layer of the Epoxy Resin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2357/v1","date":1722318074000,"content":"This paper reports results of analysis of field ion emission mechanism from tungsten-epoxy composite emitters that are compared to tungsten nano-field emitters. In this context, the mechanism of emission from this type of emitters is described based on a theory of induced conductive channels. The tungsten emitters were prepared using the electrochemical polishing technique and coated with a layer of the epoxy resin. Field ion microscope (FIM) analyses are reported including the study of the emission-ion density distributions from both the uncoated and coated emitters. Two forms of emission patterns have been observed in the ion emission microscopy technique describing the differences in the emission mechanism of both types of emitters. The observed results show: (a) the expected crystalline surface atomic distribution images of the field ion microscopy in the case of uncoated tungsten tips, and (b) randomly distributed emission spots that describe the locations of the induced conductive channels inside the resin coating layer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d37c3544d58f30bd35ca43493478dce8e76729d149d181d583f16b87bd1b5132","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
