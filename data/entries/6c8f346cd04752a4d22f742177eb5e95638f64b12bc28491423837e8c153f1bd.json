{"title":"Nutritional and Metabolomic Changes of Juvenile Farmed Abalone (Haliotis iris) in New Zealand","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/3297576?af=R","date":1691564400000,"content":"<p>Seasonal variations play a crucial role in the physiology, immune responses, and nutritional profile of aquatic animals. Unpredictable water temperature fluctuations, especially those caused by climate change, may negatively affect feed consumption and growth of cultured organisms, such as abalone. In addition, metabolic and nutritional changes across different seasons may have significant effects on aquaculture production. This study aimed to investigate biochemical and metabolic alterations in healthy abalone (<i>Haliotis iris</i>) during 1 year of grow out in a land-based farm in New Zealand. Proximate analyses were used to identify nutritional variations in whole animal tissues, and a gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was used to identify metabolic changes in adductor muscle of abalone during different seasons in the 1-year sampling period. Results showed that protein content was higher in warmer months compared with colder months, whereas lipid, ash, and carbohydrate contents remained generally constant throughout the year. Metabolic profile fluctuations indicated higher amounts of glutamic acid, glutathione, methionine, lysine, serine, tyrosine, and glycine in January and March compared with October and July, indicating possible amino acid breakdown and collagen degradation due to warmer temperatures. Although the proximate analyses findings revealed no signs of nutritional deficiencies in abalone among seasons, the metabolic profiles suggested possible thermal stress during summer months. This study provides a foundation for further nutritional studies to optimise seasonal diets for farmed <i>Haliotis iris</i> and highlights the need to monitor thermal stress effects, especially during summer and/or heatwave events.</p>","author":"Natalia Bullon, \nAli Seyfoddin, \nSeyedehsara Masoomi Dezfooli, \nTim Young, \nAndrea C.
