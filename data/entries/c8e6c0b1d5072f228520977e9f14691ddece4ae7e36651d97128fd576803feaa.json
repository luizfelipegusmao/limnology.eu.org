{"title":"Nomad Fishers: A Socially Excluded and Climate Vulnerable Fishing Community in Bangladesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1150/v1","date":1721034229000,"content":"This study discusses the belonging, position, livelihood sustainability and vulnerabilities of fishery dependent nomadic community of Bangladesh. Nomads in Bangladesh are called as bede. With the technological advancements, infrastructural developments and advancements in medical science, ancient tradition and culture of the nomad’s community are in the verge of extinction. Fishing is found to be the most sustainable livelihood approach for nomadic community than any other professions. The average daily income is up to BDT 700±100 (mean ± standard deviation) during fishing season. Nomad community is a part of Bengali culture, but they are considered as socially backward community. They have faced numerous natural and anthropogenic threats and stressors affecting their traditional occupations and livelihoods which make their life more vulnerable. Natural drivers include climatic catastrophe, storms, winds, cyclone and tides. Anthropogenic drivers included ban period, dependency on single profession (fishing), lack of effective alternative income generating options, economic, social and cultural exclusion in the society. Proper measures should be taken to design the livelihood interventions of nomad fishers. The Government and responsible NGOs should take a holistic approach to livelihood intervention including financial support during the ban period and other unavoidable crises to continue their profession smoothly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8e6c0b1d5072f228520977e9f14691ddece4ae7e36651d97128fd576803feaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
