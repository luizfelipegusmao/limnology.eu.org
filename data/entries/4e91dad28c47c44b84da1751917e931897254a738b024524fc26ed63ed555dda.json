{"title":"Resource Adequacy and Integration of Renewables in the Light of US, EU and Pakistan&rsquo;s Evolving Power Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0852/v1","date":1723619997000,"content":"This study investigates resource adequacy and renewable energy integration in the United States, European Union, and Pakistan amid global energy market liberalization and greenhouse gas re-duction efforts. It explores how these regions are adapting to the surge in renewable sources like wind and solar, which, despite their financial and environmental benefits, challenge resource adequacy and the economic viability of traditional energy sources. In the US and EU, significant improvements have been introduced in wholesale electricity markets and capacity accreditation mechanisms, which enhanced the large-scale deployment of renewables. This shift has prompted a reevaluation of resource adequacy, leading to increased deployment of battery storage and demand response. Presently, gas-based generation is largely upholding resource adequacy, however, future trends indicate a move towards greater consumer participation, energy efficiency, and utility-scale storage, with a decline in fossil fuel use. Pakistan aims to adopt a liberalized market structure by balancing competitive markets with legacy contracts. Public pressure is driving a shift from costly fossil-based generation to renewables. Similarly, a trend in the rise of behind-the-meter solar generation can be witnessed. In future, Pakistan may also experience resource adequacy challenges. It will likely need to implement battery storage, demand response, and modern capacity accreditation tools, by drawing lessons from developed markets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e91dad28c47c44b84da1751917e931897254a738b024524fc26ed63ed555dda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
