The company’s delayed initial response exacerbated the crisis, leading to a significant decline in stock prices and consumer trust. However, through leadership changes, enhanced safety protocols, strategic marketing campaigns, and customer loyalty programs, Chipotle gradually rebuilt its image and began to recover financially. The paper explores the short- and long-term effects of the crisis on Chipotle and outlines key lessons for companies facing similar PR challenges, emphasizing the importance of swift crisis management, transparency, and proactive communication in restoring public confidence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d8785924169a195af0368c3eee131acc6fd0c96349a11796aad6ce12fc1662a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
