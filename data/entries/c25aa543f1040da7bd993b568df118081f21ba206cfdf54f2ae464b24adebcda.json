{"title":"Living the employer brand during a crisis? A qualitative study on internal employer branding in times of the COVID-19 pandemic","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303361","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Marthe Rys, Eveline Schollaert, Greet Van Hoye</p>\r\n\r\nEmployer branding has emerged as a strategic imperative in the quest for talent. However, existing research has predominantly explored stable periods, overlooking the possible transformative impact of crises and the crucial role that HR managers play in crafting internal employer branding strategies. As such, this research addresses this by scrutinizing internal employer branding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conducting in-depth interviews with 37 Belgian HR managers, we delve into the perceived challenges and opportunities that the COVID-19 crisis presented with respect to internal employer branding and its touchpoints—internal communication and leadership. A subsequent member and employee check with six HR managers and six employees validated our findings. The results unveiled organizations’ heightened concern for employer branding during crises, emphasizing the strategic reflection invested. Remarkably, despite facing organizational/operational constraints/risks imposed by the crisis, the attention and efforts remain steadfastly centered on the experienced internal employer brand in crisis situations. Additionally, a contextual analysis suggests that various employer brand types face similar challenges in crises, however, the employer brand serves as a defining factor that shapes how an organization responds to both external uncertainties and internal dynamics brought about by the crisis. This study contributes to a nuanced understanding of internal employer branding dynamics during crises, shedding light on the strategic considerations of HR managers.","author":"Marthe Rys","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c25aa543f1040da7bd993b568df118081f21ba206cfdf54f2ae464b24adebcda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
