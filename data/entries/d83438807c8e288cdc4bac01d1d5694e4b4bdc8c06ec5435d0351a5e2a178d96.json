{"title":"Spectral Micro-CT Imaging of Minerals: Retrieving Atomic Information and Density Maps","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.140/7719550?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Micro-CT is a unique technology to non-destructively investigate the internal structure of samples, spanning a range from centimeter to micrometer scale. However, when it comes to material identification, the technology has some inherent limitations. The contrast observed within a micro-CT scan arises from a multitude of factors. The attenuation coefficient of a material is influenced not only by its atomic number and density but also by additional variables such as X-ray energy, the X-ray spectrum, and the characteristics of the employed detector. These diverse factors collectively contribute to the observed contrast, making the process of material identification in micro-CT scans a nuanced and multifaceted endeavor.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d83438807c8e288cdc4bac01d1d5694e4b4bdc8c06ec5435d0351a5e2a178d96","category":"Environment"}
