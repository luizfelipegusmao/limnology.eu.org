{"title":"Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence, Management and Outcomes of Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia. Experience in a Spanish Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2035/v1","date":1724845396000,"content":"This work aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and incidence of complications in patients with bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus (BSA). All episodes of BSA at the Costa del Sol University Hospital (Marbella, Spain) were recorded during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 - March 2022), compared with a previous period (February 2018 - February 2020). Demographic, clinical and prognostic variables were recorded. The outcome was measured as 14 and 30-day mortality and the incidence of complications-death. Mortality during the pandemic was 28.7% at 14 days and 35% at 30 days, while in the pre-pandemic group it was 18.9% and 23.3%, respectively. In overall complication-death, the incidence rate is higher in the pandemic group with 42.7%. No significant differences were obtained between groups. 17 patients with COVID-19 were identified, with a mortality rate of 64.7% and 70.6% at 14 and 30 days. Multivariate analysis established the presence of sepsis at diagnosis as a predictor of mortality, but not BSA during the pandemic phase. In conclusion, BSA is a disease with high mortality, slightly higher during the pandemic phase. No differences were found in adherence to the bundle in our centre.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db0759abe5e9597a0968024e4efb3676fb3831e6613a7428f6816547dfe59f3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
