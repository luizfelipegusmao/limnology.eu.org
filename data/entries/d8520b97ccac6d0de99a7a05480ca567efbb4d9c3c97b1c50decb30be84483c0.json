{"title":"Quality of life of elementary school students with sleep-disordered breathing and allergic rhinitis: A population-based study in Thailand","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310331","date":1726063200000,"content":"<p>by Paskorn Sritipsukho, Chanapai Chaiyakulsil, Pimchanok Junsawat</p>\r\nBackground <p>Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and allergic rhinitis (AR) are common problems that can lead to worsening quality of life (QOL) in children with these conditions. There is scarce evidence on the QOL of children with SDB outside of the hospital setting with inconsistent evidence on the association of AR and QOL concerning the SDB in children. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to determine the QOL concerning the SDB of elementary school students by using OSA-18. We also aim to provide the relationship of allergic rhinitis to the QOL.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted on all elementary school students, aged 6–12 years, from 10 elementary schools. The QOL of all participants was evaluated by the Thai version of the caregiver-administered OSA-18 questionnaire. The simple and multiple linear regression models were used to determine the effect of allergic rhinitis on the OSA-18 total scores.</p> Results <p>A total of 3,053 children were included in the final analysis, 50.1% male. At least a moderate impact on QOL from SDB was observed in 9.4% of the population. Children with AR had significantly higher mean total OSA– 18 scores than the children without AR (47.5 ± 15.0 VS 38.5 ± 13.1, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001). After the adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, household income, and history of asthma, the point estimate of the adjusted beta regression coefficient on the OSA-18 total score in children with AR was 7.82 (95% CI: 6.00–9.65, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001). Significant associations were observed between AR and all domains except for emotional distress.</p> Conclusions <p>A substantial number of elementary school children had at least a moderate impact on the QOL from SDB, especially those with AR. Thus, effective screening of SDB in children with AR should be done to improve the QOL of these children.</p>","author":"Paskorn Sritipsukho","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d8520b97ccac6d0de99a7a05480ca567efbb4d9c3c97b1c50decb30be84483c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
