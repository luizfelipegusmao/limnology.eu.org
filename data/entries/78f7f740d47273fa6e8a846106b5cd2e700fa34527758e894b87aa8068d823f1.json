{"title":"Revisiting Clockwork Model: A Review of Theoretical Foundations and Experimental Progress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1122/v1","date":1723727791000,"content":"Clockwork fermions represent a novel theoretical construct in high-energy physics, addressing such fundamental issues as mass hierarchies and dark matter. This review provides an examination of the theoretical underpinnings of clockwork fermions, their implications for particle physics, and the current state of experimental validations.  Clockwork fermions represent a paradigm in particle physics, elegantly addressing the hierarchy problem and offering insights into the generation of small neutrino masses. We provide an analysis of the clockwork mechanism, emphasizing its theoretical innovation and the unique mass hierarchies it produces. We examine recent experimental efforts, including collider searches and direct detection experiments, that place constraints on clockwork models, while also exploring their potential cosmological implications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78f7f740d47273fa6e8a846106b5cd2e700fa34527758e894b87aa8068d823f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
