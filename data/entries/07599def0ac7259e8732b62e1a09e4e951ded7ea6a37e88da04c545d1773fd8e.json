{"title":"Biomechanical Effects on Periodontal Ligaments during Expansion of the Maxillary Arch Using Thermoformed Aligners Modeled by Computational Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1095/v2","date":1725954696000,"content":"Purpose: this paper evaluates the effect of thermo-formed aligners with complementary biomechanical attachments (CBA) on periodontal ligaments (PDL) during the expansion process of the maxillary arch using simulations based on the finite element method (FEM). Methods: four types of teeth (canine 3, premolar 4, premolar 5 and molar 6) were modeled using 3D CAD. In addition, aligners, CBAs and PDL were also 3D modeled. With this information, a FEM model was generated, and a clinical rehabilitation scenario was simulated. For the validation of the results, a comparison with medical records was performed. Results: for canine 3, the displacement was 0.134 mm with a maximum stress of 4.822 x10-3MPa in the amelocemental junction. For premolar 4, the displacement was 0.132 mm at a maximum stress of 3.273x10-3MPa in the amelocemental junction. Premolar 5 had a displacement of 0.129 mm and a stress of 1.358 x10-3MPa at 1 mm from the amelocemental junction. Molar 6 had a displacement of 0.124 mm and a maximum stress of 2.440 x10-3MPa. Conclusions: The simulations showed that the use of CBA reduces tooth tipping. The model with Vestibular CBA presented the best results in terms of the dental movement of expansion of the maxillary arch with the use of thermoformed aligners. Significance: Considering the difficulty of performing in vivo tests that evaluate the configuration effectiveness of the different CBA alternatives in thermoformed aligners, FEM techniques were used to reduce time and costs, and get accurate results with minimal errors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07599def0ac7259e8732b62e1a09e4e951ded7ea6a37e88da04c545d1773fd8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
