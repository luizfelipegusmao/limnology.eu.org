This study examined the relationship between empathy, interpersonal communication, listening and psychological members' competence among 407 university students, and also analysed the mediating role of interpersonal communication and listening. The results showed that psychological members‘ empathy, interpersonal communication, and listening were significantly and positively related to psychological members’competence, interpersonal communication mediated the relationship between empathy and competence, listening mediated the relationship between empathy and competence, and interpersonal communication and listening chained the mediating role between empathy and competence. This suggests that psychological members' empathy enhances their competence by influencing their interpersonal communication and listening, which in turn enhances their competence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de0f8fefb75f0876ef420d4c5fb87c26d378cb1575f3dc420f80a0682fe675f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
