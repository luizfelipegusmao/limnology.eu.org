{"title":"Satellite-Based Assessment of Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) concentrations in the Bay of Bengal: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1685/v1","date":1724394280000,"content":"Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) plays a crucial role in the marine carbon cycle, influencing carbon flux and many important ocean biogeochemical processes in the Bay of Bengal. The purpose of this study was to examine the seasonal and annual variability of POC in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region and its correlation with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chlor_a). This study uses level-3 POC, Chlor_a, and SST data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite. The surface POC concentration in the Bay of Bengal declined at a rate of -1.30 mgm-3y-1 over a ten-year period (2003-12) and ranged from 86.48 mgm-3 to 110.93 mgm-3 with an average of (93.74±7.50 mgm-3). Seasonally, the mean POC was highest (97.40 mgm-3) during the post-monsoon (October-November) and lowest (79.36 mgm-3) in the pre-monsoon (March-May). Seasons were observed to have statistically significant differences in POC concentration in the study area (F(3,2155) = 6.298; p &lt;0.05). A strong positive correlation between POC and Chlorophyll was observed whereas a week positive correlation between POC and SST was observed. POC was observed to be very prominent in post-monsoon (97.40 mgm-3) and in northeast-monsoon (97.14 mgm-3) and moderate to low in southwest (81.12 mgm-3) and pre-monsoon (79.36 mgm-3). The Bay of Bengal’s annual mean POC:Chlor_a ratio ranged from 97.56 mgm-3 to 332.89 mgm-3, indicating a significant impact of biological processes on POC composition. To see how POC fluctuation affects biogeochemical processes in the Bay of Bengal, deeper investigation is required.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc30602c14b9f3ef9d6cf3edde1d31c5bdfdc5a388f0b6a916272fb8a43042bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
