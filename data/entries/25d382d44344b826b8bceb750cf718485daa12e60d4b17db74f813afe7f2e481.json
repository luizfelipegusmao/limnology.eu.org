{"title":"FAR-UV Technology and Germicidal Ultraviolet (GUV) Energy: A Policy and Research Review for Indoor Air Quality and Disease Transmission Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0392/v1","date":1728292097000,"content":"COVID-19 highlighted the challenges of public acceptance of public health measures, including mask-wearing and vaccination. which has spurred interest in engineered approaches to reduce infections. Germicidal Ultraviolet (GUV) Energy has been used for decades in hospital rooms to limit TB transmission, but it is expensive to install in the upper part of rooms where it may be used safely. In contrast, FAR-UV energy is a relatively new, flexible technology that can be set up in rooms for moderate costs, and studies thus far indicate it is efficacious and not damaging to eyes or skin. To examine the state of the field, experts in aerosol biology, infection control, and building engineering from academia, government, and industry were convened to inform policy recommendations for future investments, identify research required, and examine policy options for using these technologies. Despite its high efficacy for deactivating several types of microorganisms and pathogens of concern, before FAR-UV technologies may be widely deployed, additional studies are needed to understand potential adverse effects, as well as the best approaches to use, standardize, and regulate the technology. In some environments, the use of FAR-UV can generate ozone, which can react with volatile organic compounds that may be hazardous to human health, such as respiratory tract irritation. Even with these concerns, the demonstrated effectiveness in disease control of both FAR-UV and longer wavelengths of GUV deserve increased policy attention to reduce risks of indoor disease transmission. While potentially useful to counter disease in high-risk indoor environments, further standardization and regulatory measures, as well as research into the production of oxidative compounds is necessary before broad adoption of FAR-UV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25d382d44344b826b8bceb750cf718485daa12e60d4b17db74f813afe7f2e481","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
