{"title":"Assembly Theory and Life Origin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1491/v1","date":1721293803000,"content":"Any homeostatic protometabolism would have required orchestration of disparate biochemical pathways into integrated circuits.  Extraordinarily specific moieties were also required. Assembly Theory conflated with its cousins—Complexity Theory, Chaos theory, Quantum Mechanics, Irreversible Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics and Molecular Evolution theory— collectively have great naturalistic appeal in hopes of their providing the needed exquisite steering and controls.  They collectively offer the best hope of circumventing the need for active selection required to formally orchestrate bona fide formal organization (as opposed to the mere self-ordering of chaos theory) [1]. This paper focuses specifically on Assembly Theory’s contribution to life-origin models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14c10293ba3d8aedeeaaf02e101ffba6255cf32a12fc97e717826ac72059a1b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
