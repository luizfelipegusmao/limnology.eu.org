{"title":"Assessing the Aesthetic Performance of CAD/CAM Provisional Restorative Materials: A Spectrophotometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1734/v1","date":1724410714000,"content":"The color match between natural teeth and restorative materials is critical in dentistry for achieving aesthetic outcomes. Various factors such as light source, brightness, opacity, and visual perception influence teeth color. The intrinsic color of dental structures is determined by light absorption and scattering within the tooth material. Recent advancements in CAD/CAM systems have improved treatment approaches in prosthodontics, particularly with the introduction of new temporary materials. However, data on the color stability and masking ability of these CAD/CAM materials is limited. Telio® CAD-Temp and VITA CAD-Temp® blocks were cut into slices and polished. Composite resin specimens were prepared using a custom-designed metal resin former and light-cured. A healthy bovine incisor was used to create another type of base. Samples were paired randomly and assigned to experimental groups based on base type and thickness (n=30). Samples were stored in a controlled environment for 24 hours before color evaluation using an EasyShade® V spectrophotometer. Color difference (ΔE) was calculated using L*, a*, and b* values. Statistical analyses included Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene’s test, and three-way ANOVA, with post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni method (α=0.05). ΔE was classified according to perceptibility (PT=1.2) and acceptability (AT=2.7) values.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f99c31b10d63b6faa6da841de9898d4587b2173774eb0d3ff479edf1851db3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
