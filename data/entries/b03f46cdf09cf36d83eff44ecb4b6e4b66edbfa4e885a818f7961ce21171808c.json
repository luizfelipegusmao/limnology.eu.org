In this review, we describe putative roles for EMT during each stage of limb regeneration in axolotls and other salamanders. We hypothesize that EMT and EMT-like gene expression programs may regulate three main cellular processes during limb regeneration: (1) keratinocyte migration during wound closure; (2) transient invasion of the stump by epithelial cells undergoing EMT; and (3) use of EMT-like programs by non-epithelial blastemal progenitor cells to escape the confines of their niches. Finally, we propose nontraditional roles for EMT during limb regeneration that warrant further investigation, including alternative EMT regulators, stem cell activation, and fibrosis induced by aberrant EMT.</p>","author":"Ryan T.
