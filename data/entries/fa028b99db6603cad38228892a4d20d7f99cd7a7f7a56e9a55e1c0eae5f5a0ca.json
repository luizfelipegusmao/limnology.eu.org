{"title":"Artifactual atomic displacements on surfaces using annular dark-field images with image simulation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/4/349/7558227?rss=1","date":1705104000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We investigated artifactual atomic displacements on a Pt (111) surface using annular dark-field (ADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy images under ideal conditions with multi-slice image simulation. Pt atomic columns on the surface exhibited artifact displacement. The bright spots shifted slightly toward the interior of the crystal, indicating that ADF imaging underestimates atomic distance measurements on the crystal surface. Multiple peak fitting is an effective method for determining the positions of bright spots and obtaining more accurate atomic positions while reducing the impact of surface-related artifacts. This is important for the measurement of interatomic distances on crystal surfaces, particularly for catalyst particles.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"fa028b99db6603cad38228892a4d20d7f99cd7a7f7a56e9a55e1c0eae5f5a0ca","category":"Environment"}
