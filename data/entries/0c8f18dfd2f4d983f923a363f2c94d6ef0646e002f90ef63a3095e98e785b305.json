However, working in two workplaces leads to difficulty in forming an integrated identity, and hence affects a person’s work environment and well-being. The aim was to explore how clinical academics experience the psychosocial work environment and their suggestions for improving and changing work well-being. \nA multicenter qualitative approach with group interviews inspired by participatory action de-sign was used. A purposeful criterion sampling strategy was used, selecting researchers affiliat-ed with the university's research network (n=12). Data were analyzed by thematic analysis and the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research was applied. The main finding “lack of integration of research in clinical practice”, revealed how clinical academics balanced between the two practices, how their need for belonging in both work environments were established by fellowship, and how motivational factors and role models could be enhanced through a joint commitment of responsibility in research units and clinical practice. \nThis study provides a contemporary understanding of the challenges that clinical academics en-counter and what solutions they would offer. This study adds to knowledge on psychological work well-being and provides solutions on how clinical academics can achieve integration of research in clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c8f18dfd2f4d983f923a363f2c94d6ef0646e002f90ef63a3095e98e785b305","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
