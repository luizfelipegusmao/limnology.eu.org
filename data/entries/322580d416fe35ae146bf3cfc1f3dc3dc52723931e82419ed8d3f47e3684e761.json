{"title":"Spatiotemporal Dynamics of COVID‐19 Pandemic City Lockdown: Insights From Nighttime Light Remote Sensing","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GH001034?af=R","date":1717657200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The global COVID-19 outbreak severely hampered the growth of the global economy, prompting the implementation of the strictest prevention policies in China. Establishing a significant relationship between changes in nighttime light and COVID-19 lockdowns from a geospatial perspective is essential. In light of nighttime light remote sensing, we evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamic effects of COVID-19 city lockdowns on human activity intensity in the Zhengzhou region. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, nighttime light in the Zhengzhou region maintained a significant growth trend, even under regular control measures. However, following the October 2022 COVID-19 lockdown, nighttime light experienced a substantial decrease. In the central area of Zhengzhou, nighttime light decreased by at least 18% compared to pre-lockdown levels, while in the sub-center, the decrease was around 14%. The areas where nighttime light decreased the most in the central region were primarily within a 15 km radius, while in the sub-center, the decrease was concentrated within a 5 km radius. These changes in both statistical data and nighttime light underscored the significant impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on economic activities in the Zhengzhou region.</p>","author":"Luguang Jiang, \nYe Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: GeoHealth: Table of Contents","siteHash":"018a2f8ee482f9683e9bc368088d60586256b9cdf0b21bf2031822bf8cde1d3a","entryHash":"322580d416fe35ae146bf3cfc1f3dc3dc52723931e82419ed8d3f47e3684e761","category":"Environment"}
