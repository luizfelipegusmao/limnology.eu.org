{"title":"Fibular notch morphometry and its clinical importance on dry bones","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307387","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Nazire Kilic Safak</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the morphometric characteristics of the fibular notch (FN). This study was carried out with 76 dry adult tibial bone specimens (right 38, left 38) with unknown age and sex collected from the Department of Anatomy, Cukurova University, Adana. The mean width of the FN was 23.04 ± 2.02 mm; the mean depth of the FN 3.63 ± 0.83 mm; the mean height of the FN was 41.76 ± 4.01 mm. The mean anterior facet length and posterior facet length was found to be 10.44 ± 1.94 mm and 13.93 ±1.63 mm, respectively. The mean value of the angle between the anterior and posterior facets was found to be 140.56° ± 11.72. The mean value of the angle between the anterior surface of the tibia and the intertubercular line was 75.5° ± 5.47. No statistically significant differences were detected between the right and left sides for all measurements. It is considered that knowing the morphometric and anatomical characteristics of the fibular notch in detail will help radiologists evaluate the talocrural region. It is also considered that these data will guide surgeons and help determine the appropriate size for ankle reconstruction operations.","author":"Nazire Kilic Safak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a817a2bd475636a65408b85862310c38527217c6b69c1cef5aca30b1f38711f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
