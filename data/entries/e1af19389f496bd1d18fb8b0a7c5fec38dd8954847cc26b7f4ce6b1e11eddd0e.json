Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO<sub>2</sub>) is known as a green, cost-effective, high-performance, and promising solvent to develop the low solubility of drugs with the aim of enhancing their therapeutic effects. The prominent objective of this study is to improve and modify disparate predictive models through artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the optimized value of the Oxaprozin solubility in SCCO<sub>2</sub> system. In this paper, three different models were selected to develop models on a solubility dataset. Pressure (bar) and temperature (K) are the two inputs for each vector, and each vector has one output (solubility). Selected models include NU-SVM, Linear-SVM, and Decision Tree (DT). Models were optimized through hyper-parameters and assessed applying standard metrics. Considering R-squared metric, NU-SVM, Linear-SVM, and DT have scores of 0.994, 0.854, and 0.950, respectively. Also, they have RMSE error rates of 3.0982E-05, 1.5024E-04, and 1.1680E-04, respectively. Based on the evaluations made, NU-SVM was considered as the most precise method, and optimal values can be summarized as (T = 336.05 K, P = 400.0 bar, solubility = 0.00127) employing this model.
