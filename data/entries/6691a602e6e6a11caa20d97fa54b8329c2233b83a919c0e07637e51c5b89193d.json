Unlike TU, GA incorporates a sensor mechanism to correct for non-vertical movements, which may lead to systematic differences between devices. The aim of this study therefore was to compare GA to TU for measuring STS power in community-dwelling older adults. Community-dwelling adults (n = 51, aged ≥65 years, 61% female) completed a single chair stand, with peak power measured simultaneously using GA and TU. Participants also completed the pneumatic leg press, 8-Foot Up and Go (TUG) test, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and self-reported measures of physical function. Intraclass correlations (ICC) were used to assess agreement, and Pearson’s correlations were used to assess correlations. The study protocol was prospectively registered on the Open Science Framework. In alignment with our pre-registered hypothesis, peak power demonstrated an ICC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.96). For secondary aims, both transducers showed a correlation greater than 0.8 compared to pneumatic leg press power. For physical performance outcomes, both TU and GA showed similar correlations, as hypothesized: SPPB (r = 0.29 for TU vs. 0.33 for GA), Chair Stands (r = −0.41 vs. -0.38), TUG Fast (r = −0.53 vs. -0.52), mobility questionnaire (r = 0.52 vs. 0.52) and physical function questionnaire (r = 0.44 vs. 0.43). GA and TU peak power showed a high degree of agreement and similar correlations with physical and self-reported performance measures, suggesting that both methods can be used for assessing STS power in older adults.","author":"Anoop T.
