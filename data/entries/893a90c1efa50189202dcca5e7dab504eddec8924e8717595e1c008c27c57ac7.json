{"title":"Design and Implementation of a Musical System for the Development of Creativity through Electroacoustic Music in Edu-Cational Contexts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0297/v1","date":1725431400000,"content":"In the field of music education, the incorporation of technology originally designed for professionals presents both significant opportunities and challenges. These technologies, although advanced and powerful, are often not adapted to meet the specific needs of the educational envi-ronment. Therefore, this study details the design and implementation process of a system con-sisting of a hardware device called \"Play Box\" an associated software, \"Imaginary Play Box\". The Design Sciences Research Methodology (DSRM) specifically adapted to software development was used to structure the project. The three phases shown in this study ranged from the conception of an initial prototype to the realisation of a working software.\nDuring the design phase, a questionnaire was developed to evaluate various aspects of the soft-ware, such as the visual interface, the programming of components and the sound interactivity provided by the Play Box. The technique of panels of experts in music pedagogy and program-ming in MAX-MSP was used to obtain critical feedback. This expert evaluation was crucial to it-erate and polish the software, culminating in a beta version optimised for the creation of electro-acoustic music for music education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"893a90c1efa50189202dcca5e7dab504eddec8924e8717595e1c008c27c57ac7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
