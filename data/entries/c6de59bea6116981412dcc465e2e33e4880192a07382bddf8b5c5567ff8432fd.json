{"title":"Research on Integrated Technology of Synthetic Biology Automated Casting Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0943/v1","date":1723597281000,"content":"Synthetic biology uses engineering principles to redesign organisms and construct biological systems with specific functions, which is an important way to develop drugs, vaccines, biofuels, etc. In the process of transforming synthetic organisms, researchers need to conduct large-scale experiments for a long time, and many of these processes are manual and repetitive tasks, which results in the problems such as low throughput, low efficiency, and slow iteration. In addition, there are many experimental instruments and equipments required in the synthetic biology experiment process. The communication protocols between different instruments and equipments are not uniform, which seriously restricts the automation upgrade process of synthetic biology. To solve these problems, this paper put forward an integration technology based on the Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA) to realize the interconnection of the synthetic biology automated casting platform and related instruments needed in synthetic biology process. The stability of the system is further designed and improved by using the concept of Triple Modular Redundancy. This helps the development of an efficient, stable and scalable automated casting platform for synthetic biology, which greatly improves the efficiency of synthetic biology experiments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6de59bea6116981412dcc465e2e33e4880192a07382bddf8b5c5567ff8432fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
