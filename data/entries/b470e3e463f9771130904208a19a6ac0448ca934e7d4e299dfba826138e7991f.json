{"title":"Mathematical Models for Removal of Pharmaceutical Pollutants in Rehabilitated Treatment Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1530/v1","date":1726742712000,"content":"This paper aims to investigate appropriate mathematical models devoted to optimization of some cleaning processes related to pharmaceutical contaminants removal. In our previous recent works has been reported that a possibility for removal from water sources of this type of micropollutants is to rehabilitate the existing cleaning plants by introducing efficient techniques such as adsorption on granulated active carbon filters, micro-, nano- or ultrafiltration. To have such processes under a better control and to pass from small to large scale treatment stations, specific mathematical models are necessary. Starting from Navier-Stokes equations and imposing proper boundary conditions, some mathematical physics problems are obtained for which adequate solving methods via variational methods and surjectivity results are proposed. The importance of these solution characterizations consists in their continuation in a numerical method and the possibility to visualize the result by using CFD program.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b470e3e463f9771130904208a19a6ac0448ca934e7d4e299dfba826138e7991f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
