In particular, the exsolution and subsequent coarsening of transition metal particles in oxides strongly influence performance. An overview of exsolution and coarsening of metallic Ni in yttria stabilized zirconia and yttria doped barium zirconate (BZY) is provided. Single crystal epitaxial thin films of BZY grown on strontium titanate provide a useful model system to examine the importance crystal orientation in these processes. A coarsening study reveals that Ostwald ripening is active on (100) and (110) films at particle sizes less than about 30 nm; the exact particle size depends on temperature. A transition to particle migration is observed for larger particles sizes and also for all particles on (111) BZY films. The films are used to compare the nature of Ni particles exsolved with ones formed via a dewetting process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"04bed7c3d4af362c67894877e88598eb484a5a3224f716d847a636744fb61803","category":"Environment"}
