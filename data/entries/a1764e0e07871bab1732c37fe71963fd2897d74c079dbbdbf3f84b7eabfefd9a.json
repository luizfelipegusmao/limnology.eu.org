{"title":"Kappa‐carrageenan and xylooligosaccharide effect on water mobility and structural changes in silver carp proteins during frozen storage","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13678?af=R","date":1718957656000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The cryoprotective effect of xylooligosaccharide (XO) and kappa-carrageenan (KC) mixture on silver carp proteins in fluctuated frozen storage from 4 to −18 °C was analyzed. Positive control as a conventional cryoprotectant mixture of sucrose (4%) and sorbitol (4%), KC (3%) and XO/KC (3%) treatments were incorporated in silver carp surimi and myofibrillar proteins to analyze the water mobility and its influence on structural attributes.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The temperature fluctuation significantly increased the structural alteration in samples with no treatments due to oxidative changes, protein denaturation and recrystallization. Meanwhile, the mixture of XO and KC (XO/KC 3%) significantly reduced the tertiary and secondary structural alterations by preventing the oxidative changes in <i>α</i>-helix and tryptophan (Trp) residues. Moreover, XO/KC (3%) inhibited water mobility, hindering the <i>T</i>\n<sub>22</sub> relaxation time, as compared to the samples added with KC (3%) and the positive control. Interestingly, the XO/KC (3%) mixture significantly reduced the formation of extracellular spaces and recrystallization by restricting the partial dehydration of muscles and extracellular solution concentration.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>From the current results, it can be concluded that the XO/KC mixture could be efficient in protecting aquatic food proteins during fluctuating frozen storage by preventing the exposure of Trp residues and <i>α</i>-helix contents. Moreover, XO/KC restricted the water mobility by establishing a bond and making water unavailable for crystallization and recrystallization. Therefore, XO/KC could be used as an effective mixture to prevent fluctuated and frozen storage changes in aquatic foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Noman Walayat, \nRan Wei, \nJose M Lorenzo, \nAsad Nawaz, \nIbrahim Khalifa, \nZhucheng Su, \nMahmoud Salah, \nMukhtar Ahmed","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a1764e0e07871bab1732c37fe71963fd2897d74c079dbbdbf3f84b7eabfefd9a","category":"Environment"}
