This review compares the remission rate and adverse effects of various immunosuppressants used.</p> Methods <p>Studies of adult patients with biopsy-proven SDNS/FRNS, administered any immunosuppressive agents and reported complete remission results as one of the clinical outcomes were included. Articles were independently screened by two researchers. ROBINS-I was used for risk of bias assessment. Random-effects model was used for statistical analysis and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.</p> Results <p>574 patients across 28 studies were included in the analysis. Patients receiving rituximab have a complete remission rate of 89% (95% CI = 83% to 94%; τ2 = 0.0070; I2 = 62%; overall p &lt; 0.01, low certainty) and adverse event rate of 0.26, cyclosporine (CR 40%; 95% CI = 21% to 59%; τ2 = 0.0205; I2 = 55%; overall p = 0.08, low certainty), tacrolimus (CR 84%; 95% CI = 70% to 98%; τ2 = 0.0060; I2 = 33%; overall p = 0.21, moderate certainty), mycophenolate mofetil (CR 82%; 95% CI = 74% to 90%; τ2 &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 15%; overall p = 0.32, moderate certainty) and cyclophosphamide (CR 79%; 95% CI = 69% to 89%; τ2 = 0; I2 = 0%; overall p = 0.52, moderate certainty).</p> Conclusion <p>Among the commonly used immunosuppressive agents, only rituximab has a statistically significant effect in achieving complete remission among patients with SDNS/FRNS and has a relatively good safety profile, but this is limited by low quality of evidence with high degree of heterogeneity causing a lack of statistical power.</p>","author":"Zhi Yong Wong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"08dbf6b8e18807688efe441bc240ff09c6bcffa792e00bb053265e797a6ff1f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
