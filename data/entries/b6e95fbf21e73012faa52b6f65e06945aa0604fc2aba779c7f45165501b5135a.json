The identification and development of forward-thinking, high-potential nursing talent is essential for advancing the intelligent elderly care sector. Multi-benchmarking selection and competitive analysis is used to evaluate and identify nursing personnel in the rehabilitation treatment center of a hospital in Hefei City. Using proxy evaluation and democratic evaluation model, three types of benchmarks such as single item benchmark, individual benchmark and group benchmark were identified and selected, and the professional nursing team was constructed based on the evaluation results. Different from the traditional other-directed evaluation, multi-benchmarking selection and competitive analysis is self-directed evaluation, this method is more conducive to the identification of high-potential and digital nursing talents by intelligent elderly service organizations, and facilitates the formation of professional nursing teams with complementary strengths and cross-fertilization, so as to satisfy the diversified and multi-level needs of the elderly for intelligent elderly services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6e95fbf21e73012faa52b6f65e06945aa0604fc2aba779c7f45165501b5135a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
