{"title":"Creation of the Remote Spin Entanglement with a Nanomechanical Cantilever","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1985/v1","date":1717053488000,"content":"We consider creation of entanglement between the remote electron spins using a magnetic nanoparticle attached to a cantilever tip (CT). We assume that the frequency of the CT vibrations matches the Larmor frequency of the spin (the CT-spin resonance). In the conditions of the CT-spin resonance the CT-spin system is described by the exactly solvable Jaynes-Kummings model. In this work using the evolution operator of the Jaynes-Kummings model we show that a movable CT can create an entangled state between the remote spins. The most striking result is that the entanglement between the remote spins can be achieved without measurement of the vibrational state of the CT.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ab021e0ee82620743f23e1b0a945640f6451ce53048108698037efe6b947a8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
