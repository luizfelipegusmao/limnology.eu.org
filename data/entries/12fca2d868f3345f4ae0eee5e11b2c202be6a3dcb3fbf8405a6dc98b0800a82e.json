{"title":"Is the speed of adjusting to environmental change condition dependent? An experiment with house mice (Mus musculus)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/70/3/350/7623918?rss=1","date":1709769600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Environmental conditions change constantly either by anthropogenic perturbation or naturally across space and time. Often, a change in behavior is the first response to changing conditions. Behavioral flexibility can potentially improve an organismâ€™s chances to survive and reproduce. Currently, we lack an understanding on the time-scale such behavioral adjustments need, how they actually affect reproduction and survival and whether behavioral adjustments are sufficient in keeping up with changing conditions. We used house mice (<span>Mus musculus</span>) to test whether personality and life-history traits can adjust to an experimentally induced food-switch flexibly in adulthood or by intergenerational plasticity, that is, adjustments only becoming visible in the offspring generation. Mice lived in 6 experimental populations of semi-natural environments either on high or standard quality food for 4 generations. We showed previously that high-quality food induced better conditions and a less risk-prone personality. Here, we tested whether the speed and/ or magnitude of adjustment shows condition-dependency and whether adjustments incur fitness effects. Life-history but not personality traits reacted flexibly to a food-switch, primarily by a direct reduction of reproduction and slowed-down growth. Offspring whose parents received a food-switch developed a more active stress-coping personality and gained weight at a slower rate compared with their respective controls. Furthermore, the modulation of most traits was condition-dependent, with animals previously fed with high-quality food showing stronger responses. Our study highlights that life-history and personality traits adjust at different speed toward environmental change, thus, highlighting the importance of the environment and the mode of response for evolutionary models.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"12fca2d868f3345f4ae0eee5e11b2c202be6a3dcb3fbf8405a6dc98b0800a82e","category":"Environment"}
