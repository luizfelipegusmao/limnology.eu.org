{"title":"Commiphora myrrha Resin Extract-Modulated Cytochrome P-450 2C9 Enzyme Expression Is Associated with Resin Extract-Derived Metabolites Binding to Pregnane X Receptor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0500/v1","date":1725843509000,"content":"The use of natural health products (NHP) is constantly increasing worldwide. Among the most NHP consumed are the resins of Commiphora myrrha (C. myrrha) tree. Consumption of C. myrrha may result in herb-drug interactions that can lead to serious health consequences. This study aims to determine the herb-drug interactions based on the induction of drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2C9 by a non-toxic boiled aqueous extract of C. myrrha and to unveil the potential involvement of xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors such as Pregnane X Receptor (PXR), a well-known CYP 2C9 transcription factor. Tested at low concentrations (0.01-10 ÔÅ≠g/mL) devoid of anti-proliferative effects, boiled C. myrrha resin aqueous extract upregulated CYP 2C9 gene and protein expressions in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a mean expression level exceeding 3.0-fold change in Hep G2 cells, compared with the basal level expressed in untreated cells. Furthermore, chemical analysis using mass spectrometry and computational molecular docking using in silico studies revealed that few C. myrrha resin-derived metabolites are strongly bound to PXR. In particular, the identified metabolite named diayangambin exhibited a predicted molecular docking score close to that of a native PXR ligand. The use of the nuclear receptor binding assays confirmed the binding between C. myrrha metabolite(s) and PXR, while no binding to the other xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), was observed, suggesting that C. myrrha metabolite(s) are potential PXR agonists. In conclusion, although in vivo studies are needed, this study cautions patients, healthcare providers, and governmental regulators against the consumption of C. myrrha and diayangambin-rich preparations with a high potential for herb-drug interactions through drug-metabolizing CYP 2C9 enzyme induction, which could affect drug efficacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b883af5b8e7f171236c92f0b41d7df4d22ff084932db24450624e2fb6fe6920d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
