{"title":"Identification of genes governing YMD resistance in soybean cultivar SL 958","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13973?af=R","date":1729490966000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Yellow mosaic disease (YMD) is the most devastating disease of soybean under north Indian conditions. A recombinant inbred line population derived from SL 958 (R) × AGS 456 (S) was used to map the genes imparting YMD resistance. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 148 individuals and the parents was used to identify polymorphic SNPs in the population. These were used to generate linkage maps and subsequently map the QTL.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A QTL, MYMIV 1-1.1, was mapped onto chromosome 6. The QTL was mapped at a genetic distance of 114.31 cM, with likelihood ratio of 81.34 (LOD 17.68), explaining 33.80% of the variation for the trait, with an additive effect of 1.22. MYMIV 1-1.1 was flanked by SNPs Gm06_12614920 explaining 33.80% of variation and Gm06_12887789 explaining 31.04% of the variation. The QTL region spanned for a total of 2.798 Mbp.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The QTL was mapped in an approximately 4 cM region. Flanking SNPs can be developed into linked markers for effective marker-assisted selection. Out of the genes in the QTL region, Glyma.06G161700 (Suppressor of Gene Silencing/SGS3) is the strongest contender for the resistance gene. This is the first study documenting GBS-based mapping of YMD resistance in soybean. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Kamalpreet Singh Mandahal, \nDanda Prasad Meghana, \nAsmita Sirari, \nDharminder Bhatia, \nKarmvir Singh Garcha, \nBalwinder Singh Gill","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1f535cdf6d79bfbf907f8bb1e1297543e93c0ce5cc5620a5617732cb8cc6a83d","category":"Environment"}
