{"title":"Developmental Origins of Non-Communicable Chronic Diseases: Role of Fetal Undernutrition and Gut Dysbiosis in Infancy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0865/v1","date":1728637307000,"content":"Globally, there is increasing prevalence of non- communicable chronic diseases (NCCD) like obesity, metabolic syndrome, type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, allergic asthma and neuro-developmental/psychiatric problems making NCCD a leading cause of disability, morbidity and mortality . Some of these NCCD are presenting at a younger age especially in the socio-economically disadvantaged communities of affluent countries, and in low and middle -income countries undergoing industrialization and socioeconomic transition.to more economic prosperity.  NCCD are often attributed to unhealthy personal lifestyles, but there may be more at play. \nThrough a case report-based discussion, I will illustrate how environmental exposures during the critical window of life, including in utero and early infancy, can significantly influence health as an adult . I will discuss how establishment of a rich and diverse symbiotic gut microbiota in the first three years of life promotes health while a loss of diversity and abundance of beneficial symbiotic gut microbes can predispose to aforementioned NCCD , and the best practices to establish a symbiotic gut.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bf401cab70f9f1c9686a84c0683c2e9b061a0089f45ed10544456a96822d873","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
