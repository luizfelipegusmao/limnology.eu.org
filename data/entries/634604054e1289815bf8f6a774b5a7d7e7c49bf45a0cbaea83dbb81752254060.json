{"title":"Behavioral, biochemical, histopathological evaluation and gene expression of brain injury induced by nanoceria injected intranasal or intraperitoneal in mice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae095/7705549?rss=1","date":1719964800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>Nanotechnology has shown a remarkable progress nevertheless, there is a growing concern about probable neurotoxic and neurodegenerative effects due to NPs exposure. Various toxicological and epidemiological studies reported that the brain is a main target for ultrafine particles. Brain inflammation is considered as a possible mechanism that can participate to neurotoxic and neurodegenerative effects. Whether nanoparticles (NPs) may produce neurotoxicity and promote neurodegenerative is largely unstudied. The present study was done to investigate whether intranasal and intra-peritoneal exposure to cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2NPs, nanoceria (NC)) could cause neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative changes in the brain tissue through conducting some behavioral tests, biochemical evaluation, histopathological examinations of brain hippocampus and gene expressions.<div>Method</div>Fifteen mice were separated into 3 equal groups. In group (I) “control group”, mice were received distilled water orally and kept as a control group. Mice in the group (II) “NC I/P group” were injected i.p with cerium oxide nanoparticles at a dose of 40 mg/kg b.wt, twice weekly for 3 weeks. In group (III) “NC I/N group” mice were received nanoceria intranasally (40 mg/kg b.wt), twice weekly for 3 weeks.<div>Results</div>Exposure to nanceria resulted in oxidative damage in brain tissue, a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetylcholinestrase (AchE) levels, significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration, upregulation in the apoptosis-related genes (c-Jun: c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), c-Fos: Fos protooncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit, c-Myc: c-myelocytomatosis oncogene product or MYC protooncogene, bHLH transcription factor), locomotor and cognitive impairment in mice but the effect was more obvious when nanoceria adminstred intraperitoneally.<div>Conculsion</div>Nanoceria cause oxidative damage in brain tissue of mice when adminstred nanoceria intraperitoneally more than those received nanoceria intranasal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"634604054e1289815bf8f6a774b5a7d7e7c49bf45a0cbaea83dbb81752254060","category":"Environment"}
