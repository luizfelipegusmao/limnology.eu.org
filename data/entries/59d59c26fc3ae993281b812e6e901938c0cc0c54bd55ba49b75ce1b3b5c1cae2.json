{"title":"Osteogenic and Protective Effects of Erucic Acid and Erucic Acid-Induced Exosomes against Fine Dust","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0895/v1","date":1715612369000,"content":"Fine dust causes various disorders, including cardiovascular, neurological, renal, reproductive, motor, systemic, respiratory, and cancerous diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to study functional materials to prevent these problems. In this study we used various methods, including quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Alizarin O staining, to study the beneficial effects of erucic acid against fine dust. Erucic acid and erucic acid-induced exosomes (EIE) strongly suppress the attenuation of osteocytic differentiation and inflammation induced by fine dust. Erucic acid effectively suppresses inflammation in fibroblasts exposed to fine dust. Notably, despite exposure to fine dust, EIE promoted osteocytic differentiation in adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) and osteogenesis in macrophages, in addition to phagocytosis. Dramatic upregulation of RunX2 and BMP7 by EIE indicates that it is a strong activator of osteocytic differentiation in ASC and protects them from the effects of fine dust. Moreover, EIE induces immune activity and acts as an osteogenic trigger for macrophages. Therefore, this study suggests the potential use of erucic acid and erucic acid-induced exosomes (EIE) as biomaterials to prevent environment-borne diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59d59c26fc3ae993281b812e6e901938c0cc0c54bd55ba49b75ce1b3b5c1cae2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
