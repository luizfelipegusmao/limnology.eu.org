{"title":"Acceptability of Medical Male Circumcision as an HIV preven-tion intervention among male learners in a South African high school","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0533/v1","date":1718004485000,"content":"Abstract: Circumcision is a long-standing and frequently performed surgical procedure which holds significant cultural significance among AmaXhosa people in South Africa. Due to cultural reasons in some parts of Africa, the integration of medical male circumcision with traditional manhood initiation rituals still lacks acceptance. This study examined the level of knowledge and acceptance of voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC) among young males in a selected high school in the Nyandeni District of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted, and a self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of VMMC, percep-tions of VMMC, and circumcision practices. One Hundred participants were recruited from both grades 11 and 12, and 82% of the participants indicated that they had received information about VMMC. Most of the respondents (88%) preferred traditional male circumcision (TMC) and only 12% of respondents preferred VMMC. The participants displayed a good understanding of the distinction between VMMC and TMC. However, results from the study showed that most re-spondents exhibited low acceptability towards VMMC. These findings highlight the need to develop evidence-based strategies to enhance learnersâ€™ knowledge and acceptance of VMMC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0476796f35be5751455547a485c14d0c693752b88c235ded91540f7924a7931b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
