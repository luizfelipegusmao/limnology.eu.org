{"title":"Controlled Lateral Pressure on Cortical Bone Using Blade-Equipped Implants. An Experimental Study in Rabbits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0788/v1","date":1720534825000,"content":"Background: This study stands as a pioneer in the histological evaluation of the biological behavior of a novel implant design featuring decompressive cervical blades. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the healing outcome in cortical regions at where decompressive protocols were adopted using implants equipped with blades. Materials and methods: Blades with varying diameters were integrated into the coronal portion of the implant to prepare the cortical region of rabbit tibiae. The blade diameters differed from the implant collar by the following amounts: control group (0 µm), +50 µm, and +200 µm. Results: No marginal bone loss was detected. Instead, all implants exhibited new bone formation in the coronal region. Complete closure was observed in the CG-0 group, as well as in the TG-50 and TG-200 groups, despite the presence of marginal gaps without primary bone contact at installation. In the apical region, most implants breached the cortical layer. Nevertheless, new bone formation in this region completely closed the osteotomy, effectively isolating the internal environment of the tibia from the external. Conclusions: The use of a blade attached to the implant body enabled precise preparation of the cortical layer, allowing for controlled decompression in the targeted area. This technique resulted in optimal osseointegration with no loss of marginal bone, and complete restoration of marginal gaps ranging from 0 µm to 200 µm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"976dbc4f806238bbc1ee3d246fcd3788d7d45d660fb2e238832b601b2967f101","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
