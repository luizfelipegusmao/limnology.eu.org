{"title":"Representations of the G-drazin Inverse for Certain Anti-triangular Matrices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0090/v1","date":1725267132000,"content":"We provide representations for the generalized Drazin inverse of an anti-triangular matrix of the form $\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} a&amp;b\\\\ 1&amp;0 \\end{array} \\right)$ in a Banach algebra $\\mathcal{A}$, under the condition that $ab=ba$. Specifically, we present the representation of Drazin inverse for these types of anti-triangular matrices in Banach algebras.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"683346b1f00d6083b214ec0c61a77c73062146aff50b33c2435a1bb9f746cdfb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
