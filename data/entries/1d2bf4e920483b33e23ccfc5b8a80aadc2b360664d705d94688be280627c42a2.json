{"title":"The Effectiveness of Metaverse in e-Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0222/v1","date":1722819889000,"content":"On using a 3D model to teach students a topic in astronomy, feedback was evaluated via a questionnaire. Analysis of students' responses to the questions revealed that user interface had a significant impact on their attitudes, which in turn could increase users' willingness to use immersive technology in e-learning. The results also showed that improving visual features through immersive technology and augmented reality tools were effective. The results confirm all hypotheses about positive relationships between facilitating conditions and usability of metaverse technology for students' attention and study motivation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d2bf4e920483b33e23ccfc5b8a80aadc2b360664d705d94688be280627c42a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
