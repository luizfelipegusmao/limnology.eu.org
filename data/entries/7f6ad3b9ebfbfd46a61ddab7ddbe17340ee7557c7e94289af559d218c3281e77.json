{"title":"Removal of cadmium and cobalt from water by Slovak bentonites: efficiency, isotherms, and kinetic study","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11356-024-33133-z","date":1712102400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Slovak bentonite was used as an effective natural adsorbent for the removal of Cd(II) and Co(II). Characterization of the samples was conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy with an X-ray energy dispersion spectrometer (SEM–EDS), and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Adsorption experiments were carried out for pure water and artificial seawater, each containing cobalt and cadmium cations within the concentration range of 5–60 mg/L. The highest bentonite adsorption capacities of the tested bentonites were 23.5 (Cd) and 32.2 (Co) mg g<sup>−1</sup>. The kinetics data revealed that, in addition to chemisorption, intraparticle diffusion contributes to metal removal. The physical and structural properties of bentonites play an important role in adsorption. Bentonite P 135 from the Lieskovec deposit showed the highest efficiency for removing both ions, with removal percentages exceeding 90% and 77.5% for pure water and artificial seawater, respectively. The results indicate the suitability of using Slovak bentonites as an alternative sorbent for both metal extractions. The mechanism of metal ion adsorption on bentonite clay can be understood through surface complexation and ion exchange. The examined bentonite deposits show potential as promising natural sorbents for the removal of cobalt and cadmium cations from polluted waters.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"7f6ad3b9ebfbfd46a61ddab7ddbe17340ee7557c7e94289af559d218c3281e77","category":"Environment"}
