{"title":"N-Terminal Sequences of Signal Peptides Assuming Critical Roles in Expression of Heterologous Proteins in Bacillus subtilis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1992/v1","date":1714465138000,"content":"The early elongation events in transcription or translational control in the N-terminal of genes are assuming critical roles in their heterologous expression. The secretory expression of the alkaline pectin lyase APL in B. subtilis were studied to explore the effects of the N-terminal 5-7 amino acids sequences of different signal peptides on gene transcription and protein secretion in this study. The first 5 amino acid sequences of the N-terminal of the signal peptide LipA were identified to play an important role in promoting the expression of APL for the first time. Meanwhile, it also revealed that the signal peptide LipA could lead to higher secretory expression than other signal peptides not because of its sequence structure associated with secretion is stronger but because the N-terminal sequences showed greater advantages in gene transcription. At this basis, the recombinant strain structed in this work showed a new record for the highest extracellular yields (12 295 U/ml) of APL in B. subtilis which was 1.9 times higher than that expressed in the recombinant Escherichia coli strain we had reported before. The novel theories revealed in this study would assuming significance roles for improving expression of foreign proteins in or out of the cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1ee53c0625b15bb50f4afb6e23835386fe19c6eea3b772ddbbb7c44aee6b9ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
