{"title":"Biosafety and toxicity assessment of transgenic cotton-harboring insecticide and herbicide tolerant genes on albino mice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae043/7633692?rss=1","date":1711065600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Introduction</div>Genetic engineering has revolutionized agriculture by transforming biotic and abiotic stress-resistance genes in plants. The biosafety of GM crops is a major concern for consumers and regulatory authorities.<div>Methodology</div>A 14-week biosafety and toxicity analysis of transgenic cotton, containing 5 transgenes ((<span>Cry1Ac</span>, <span>Cry2A</span>, <span>CP4 EPSPS</span>, <span>VIP3Aa</span>, and <span>ASAL</span>)), was conducted on albino mice. Thirty mice were divided into three groups (Conventional, Non-transgenic, without Bt, and transgenic, containing targeted crop) according to the feed given, with 10 mice in each group, with 5 male and 5 female mice in each group.<div>Results</div>During the study, no biologically significant changes were observed in the non-transgenic and transgenic groups compared to the control group in any of the studyâ€™s parameters i.e. increase in weight of mice, physiological, pathological, and molecular analysis, irrespective of the gender of the mice. However, a statistically significant change was observed in the hematological parameters of the male mice, while no such change was observed in the female study group mice. The expression analysis, however, of the TNF gene increases many folds in the transgenic group as compared to the non-transgenic and conventional groups.<div>Conclusion</div>Overall, no physiological, pathological, or molecular toxicity was observed in the mice fed with transgenic feed. Therefore, it can be speculated that the targeted transgenic crop is biologically safe. However, more study is required to confirm the biosafety of the product on the animal by expression profiling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"8ac1760a3d3f173e14117cfb02048dea3c35e4179863e1eb4d6dee9241e094e4","category":"Environment"}
