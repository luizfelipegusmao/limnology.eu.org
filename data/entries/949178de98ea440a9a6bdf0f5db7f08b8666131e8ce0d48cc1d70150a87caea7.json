{"title":"Preserving Heritage Riverine Bridges: A Hydrological Approach to the Case Study of the Grau Bridge in Peru","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1716/v1","date":1716802493000,"content":"Heritage bridges constitute an integral feature of the urban landscape in numerous cities. However, it is common for these structures to surpass their life cycle, rendering them ill-equipped to withstand the dynamic demands of users and extreme events, particularly hydrological occurrences. This research presents a methodology for the assessment of heritage riverine bridges, with a focus on the Grau Bridge in Peru as a case study. The investigation commences with an exhaustive literature review, complemented by a historical examination, followed by a preliminary diagnosis. Subsequently, hydrological and hydraulic studies are conducted, encompassing drone surveys of the riverbed and the bridge, soil analyses, and the application of 1D and 2D models in HEC-RAS. The outcomes of this comprehensive analysis reveal the high vulnerability of the Grau Bridge. Finally, strategic recommendations for its conservation are recommended.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"949178de98ea440a9a6bdf0f5db7f08b8666131e8ce0d48cc1d70150a87caea7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
