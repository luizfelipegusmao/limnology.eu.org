{"title":"Predictive Model of the Effects of Skin Phototype and Body Mass Index on Photobiomodulation Therapy for Orofacial Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1232/v1","date":1726630286000,"content":"Monte Carlo techniques have been extensively used for planning laser-based clinical procedures such as photobiomodulation. However, the effect of several biological tissue characteristics, including morphological structure and physiological parameters, has not been carefully addressed in many applications. Specifically, many questions remain concerning the effect of skin phototype and body mass index on the efficacy of photobiomodulation for extraoral therapies. To address these questions, a Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to analyze the effects of body mass index-dependent skin structure and Fitzpatrick skin type, specifically tailored for the morphological characteristics of cheek tissue. The model describes the settings of a typical oral photobiomodulation treatment protocol for pain relief, namely the use of 660 nm and 808 nm laser wavelengths and a therapeutic dose of 2.0 J/cmÂ² on the masseter muscle. The simulations were used to train a machine learning predictive model aimed at accelerating the treatment planning stage and assessing the importance of patient-specific parameters. A multiple regression approach was adopted to predict muscle dose and treatment time for the effective delivered dose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45302fae516996947f362e830255e6752a5a1813ad51cbb1b89cdcf19f2b3020","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
