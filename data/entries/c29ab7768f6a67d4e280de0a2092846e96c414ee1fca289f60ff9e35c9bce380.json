{"title":"Overview of Hydrogels as Transdermal Delivery System for Pharmaceutical and Cosmetic Applications, and Hyaluronic Acid as a Polymer Model in Hydrogel Preparation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1621/v1","date":1716537286000,"content":"Hydrogels have gained significant attention as vehicles for transdermal delivery systems. These polymeric-structured substances have been implemented in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Many factors are employed in their preparation. Light, pH, temperature and specific molecules ligands are commonly used in the production of hydrogels. The Transdermal delivery system (TDD) is a widely used route, used to deliver actives/drugs via the skin. Hydrogels as a TDD have been shown to be efficient in enhancing the efficacy in delivering the actives and drugs. The aim of this review is to discuss the hydrogels application in both dermatological therapeutic and cosmetic applications, covering the types, and properties of hydrogel polymer networks.  Furthermore, this review presents one of the most extensively used polymers (Hyaluronic acid HA) in this field and discusses the properties, preparation methods and applications of HA hydrogel patches as a delivery system, including methods of loading the actives and the releasing of these actives from them.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c29ab7768f6a67d4e280de0a2092846e96c414ee1fca289f60ff9e35c9bce380","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
