{"title":"A hybrid population of Willow Warblers in the Åland Archipelago","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10336-024-02149-0","date":1709856000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Differences in migratory behavior have been suggested to drive speciation, but the genetics underlying this process remain unknown. Identification and study of migratory divides can help us understand how differential migration can lead to reproductive isolation. Here, we genotyped Willow Warblers <em>Phylloscopus trochilus</em>, from the Åland islands, located in between the ranges of the differentially migrating subspecies <em>P. t. trochilus</em> and <em>P. t. acredula</em>. We found that Willow Warblers on the Åland islands were genetically intermediate to allopatric populations of both parental subspecies, providing evidence that the islands constitute a previously unknown hybrid swarm, likely to be a migratory divide. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"f0c5485485430fcdf417458df51bf55a78078aaf7d68da5d649e5b00928e0bed","category":"Environment"}
