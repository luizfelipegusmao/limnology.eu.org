{"title":"The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Complications among Hemodialysis Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0153/v1","date":1722592283000,"content":"The composition of the gut microbiota varies among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on the basis of their mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT), with notably more pronounced dysbiosis in those undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Interventions such as dialysis catheters, unstable hemodynamics, strict dietary restrictions, and pharmacotherapy significantly alter the intestinal microenvironment, thus disrupting the gut microbiota composition in HD patients. The gut microbiota may influence HD-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), infections, anemia, and malnutrition, through mechanisms such as bacterial translocation, immune regulation, and the production of gut bacterial metabolites, thereby affecting both the quality of life and the prognosis of patients. This review focuses on alterations in the gut microbiota and its metabolites in HD patients. Additionally, understanding the impact of the gut microbiota on the complications of HD could provide insights into the development of novel treatment strategies to prevent or alleviate complications in HD patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05e3782c2241407346e9a6ba3187378524a14e5dffc9f18701d6fe49b05d1a4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
