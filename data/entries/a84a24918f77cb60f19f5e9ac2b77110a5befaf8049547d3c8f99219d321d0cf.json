{"title":"Identification of Damage to Wood Pillar Foundations for Repairing House Construction Damage on Swampland","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1310/v1","date":1721113402000,"content":"House construction is a unique characteristic of the swamp lands in Banjarmasin. Foundations for swampy soil require special handling. The weakness of wood materials and the inability of wood pillar foundations to support building loads are the primary causes of building problems in these swampy areas. Mistakes in foundation construction often arise from the need to expand houses to two stories or renovations. The load-bearing capacity of the wood pillar foundations used is very limited. This study aims to determine the weaknesses of wood pillar foundations to address signs of damage in house construction on swamp land. Field observation research, including the examination of house buildings and individual objects, was conducted at several construction sites in Banjarmasin as part of this study. Data presentation is descriptive. The results indicate that weak wood pillar foundation construction is characterized by damaged piles and floor subsidence. The small size of the wood pillars also limits the load-bearing capacity. The presence of broken 'sunduk' elements is one of the causes of this foundation damage. This research provides new insights into the weaknesses of wood pillar foundations and offers repair recommendations to enhance the resilience and stability of buildings on swamp land.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a84a24918f77cb60f19f5e9ac2b77110a5befaf8049547d3c8f99219d321d0cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
