{"title":"Interactions of beet leafhopper (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), vector of beet curly top virus, and hemp in New Mexico","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/11/7227785?rss=1","date":1689897600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The beet leafhopper, <span>Circulifer tenellus</span> (Baker 1896), is the sole vector of beet curly top virus (BCTV). Both the virus and the vector have very wide host ranges, including many crops and weeds. Industrial hemp (<span>Cannabis sativa</span> L.) has been reported as a host for both the virus and leafhopper in the past few years with the legal cultivation of the crop in the United States. This research assessed the interactions of the beet leafhopper and hemp in New Mexico by determining the natural infection of hemp with BCTV in 3 field plots in 2021 and 2022 and monitoring the numbers of leafhoppers using yellow sticky traps. The relative preference of beet leafhopper for hemp types and varieties of hemp was assessed using cafeteria-style choice tests. Higher numbers of beet leafhoppers were trapped in and around hemp fields in 2022 than in 2021 in all 3 locations. BCTV was found to infect all 3 types of hemp (cannabidiol or CBD, fiber, and grain) in 2022 in 1 location and only a single CBD variety of hemp in the other 2 locations. Two BCTV strains were identified in CBD hemp, while an additional BCTV strain was found infecting chile pepper grown at the same location.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"58cb3a09ea47ca184ae0e1e8353e8e537058a8e84c40cdc3301658473e0b0e6c","category":"Environment"}
