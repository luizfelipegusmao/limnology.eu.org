{"title":"Equine Corneal Wound Healing Using Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome: Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1909/v1","date":1716964392000,"content":"Corneal ulcers are a common and potentially vision-threatening condition in horses that can be challenging to treat with conventional therapies alone. This case report describes the successful treatment of a non-healing corneal ulcer in a 28-year-old Hispano-Bret√≥n mare using the secretome derived from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). Despite initial treatment with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and surgical debridement, the corneal ulcer failed to heal properly, exhibiting persistent epithelial defects and stromal complications. As an alternative regenerative approach, the ASC secretome, a rich source of trophic factors, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles, was topically administered to the affected eye. Remarkably, within one week of secretome treatment, the clinical signs of blepharospasm and epiphora resolved, and the corneal ulcer exhibited complete re-epithelialization, regained transparency, and reduced neovascularization. No recurrence was observed during the 1.5-year follow-up period. This case highlights the potential therapeutic benefits of ASCs secretome in promoting corneal wound healing and suggests its promise as a novel cell-free therapy for treating refractory corneal ulcers in horses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a31420768e6a116bc37c482e4176b1fccf4b7a981ff892c16d87f0c3b985d8dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
