{"title":"The Impact of R&amp;D Investment on the Performance of Portuguese Companies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1565/v1","date":1719219535000,"content":"The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of investment in Research &amp; Development on the performance and value of companies, that is, to try to explain how R&amp;D investment influences the companiesâ€™ performance. For this purpose, a dynamic panel data model was estimated using the Generalized Method of Moments, which made possible to measure the impact of R&amp;D investment on performance through the Return on Operating Assets ratio for the Portuguese companies that invested the most between 2012 to 2019. The results show that the investment in R&amp;D is not statistically significant in explaining the operating return on assets. However, the lagged financial performance in one period, the leverage, the asset turnover ratio and the accounts payable turnover show to have impact on the variable under study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa8d10fc9b133283e753ce3fb8c8262a0289c45d89d6427ee7b62487f1743618","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
