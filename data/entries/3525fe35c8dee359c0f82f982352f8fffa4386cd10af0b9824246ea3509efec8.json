{"title":"A cellulose synthesis inhibitor affects cellulose synthase complex secretion and cortical microtubule dynamics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/124/7687647?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>P4B (2-phenyl-1-[4-(6-(piperidin-1-yl) pyridazin-3-yl) piperazin-1-yl] butan-1-one) is a novel cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor (CBI) discovered in a screen for molecules to identify inhibitors of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) seedling growth. Growth and cellulose synthesis inhibition by P4B were greatly reduced in a novel mutant for the cellulose synthase catalytic subunit gene <span>CESA3</span> (<span>cesa3pbr1</span>). Cross-tolerance to P4B was also observed for isoxaben-resistant (ixr) <span>cesa3</span> mutants <span>ixr1-1</span> and <span>ixr1-2</span>. P4B has an original mode of action as compared with most other CBIs. Indeed, short-term treatments with P4B did not affect the velocity of cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) but led to a decrease in CSC density in the plasma membrane without affecting their accumulation in microtubule-associated compartments. This was observed in the wild type but not in a <span>cesa3pbr1</span> background. This reduced density correlated with a reduced delivery rate of CSCs to the plasma membrane but also with changes in cortical microtubule dynamics and orientation. At longer timescales, however, the responses to P4B treatments resembled those to other CBIs, including the inhibition of CSC motility, reduced growth anisotropy, interference with the assembly of an extensible wall, pectin demethylesterification, and ectopic lignin and callose accumulation. Together, the data suggest that P4B either directly targets CESA3 or affects another cellular function related to CSC plasma membrane delivery and/or microtubule dynamics that is bypassed specifically by mutations in CESA3.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"3525fe35c8dee359c0f82f982352f8fffa4386cd10af0b9824246ea3509efec8","category":"Environment"}
