{"title":"Observation of Positive Trap Charge by Electron Holography in PMOS Device","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/3/16/7687036?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>It has been hypothesized that trap charge plays an important role in PMOS (positive-channel metal oxide semiconductor) device reliability. By using electron holography, trap charge in a spacer oxide was observed to cause an inversion of junction in an un-stressed PMOS device prepared using a Ga+ focused ion beam (FIB). Through 400Â°C annealing for 10 min in vacuum, trap charge in the spacer oxide dispersed and the junction recovered. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation was used to confirm the positive trap charge effect on the junction. Furthermore, the simulation showed that a low concentration of positive trap charge at the Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> interface under the spacer led to a higher tunneling current due to an abrupt junction near the Si surface through a very localized junction inversion.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"399576652166e0ae749390021296d4001ffb7bcefea57ea9aaa3e607439c3120","category":"Environment"}
