{"title":"Development Of A Real-Time Object Detection Model For The Detection Of Secretly Cultivated Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1093/v1","date":1726232117000,"content":"AYOLO differentiates itself with a new fusion architecture proposal that leverages the strengths of unsupervised learning and integrates the Vision Transformer approach, taking the YOLO series models as a reference. This innovation enables the model to effectively use rich, unlabeled data, providing a new example in pre-training methodology for YOLO architectures. On the benchmark COCO val2017 dataset, AYOLO demonstrates its superiority by achieving an impressive 38.7 % AP while maintaining an outstanding rendering speed of 239 FPS (Frame Per Second) on the Tesla K80 GPU. This performance outperforms the previous state-of-the-art YOLO v6-3.0 by a significant margin of +2.2 % AP while maintaining comparable FPS. AYOLO is presented as a demonstration of the potential of integrating complex information fusion techniques with supervised pretraining in improving the precision and speed of object detection models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54529ecb7abed178a5aa36818a0888f09d90a73581acd6b456ebba65708c2b39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
