{"title":"Dynamic Risks in Automotive Factories: Fire Risk in Lead-Acid Battery Manufacturing Process &ndash; 3D Simulations and Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0289/v1","date":1728022389000,"content":"The present paper addresses dynamic risks in the automotive industry factories, specifically the car lead-acid batteries manufacturing area. The main analyzed risk is represented by the fire risk. Battery manufacturing process is described and analyzed from the fire risk perspective and the hazard areas are identified. The investigation methodology uses case studies for different lead-acid battery formation processes, combined with 3D simulations using PyroSym platform, and it is based on the author's experience in the battery manufacturing field for about ten years. The results of the case studies are compared using the same inputs, but different specific process conditions, and conclusions are formulated. To avoid the fires and mitigate the risk, a series of actions are proposed in the last sections. As a general conclusion, the actual research demonstrates that the complex and dynamic risks from the automotive industry, associated with Industry 5.0 must be analyzed using combined methods, classical and modern, including 3D simulations, to get great results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"888838caada3c8125352a62d9fe65c0f9cb8f61e8b09f86eaa0b5f3d211b006c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
