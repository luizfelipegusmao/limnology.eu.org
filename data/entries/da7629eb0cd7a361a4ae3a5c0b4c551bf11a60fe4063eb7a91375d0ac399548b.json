{"title":"Long COVID: G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) Associated Genes and Pathways as a Promising Therapeutic Potential Through Computational Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0558/v1","date":1723112321000,"content":"Long COVID, also referred to as post-COVID-19 condition, describes the lingering after-effects of COVID-19 infection. This complex syndrome encompasses a range of symptoms affecting physical well-being, cognitive function, and mental health. The widespread impact of long COVID extends beyond individual sufferers, placing significant strain on healthcare systems and causing far-reaching socioeconomic consequences. The scale of this multifaceted health crisis is unparalleled in recent history, affecting millions globally and challenging our understanding of post-viral conditions. This study aimed to explore the possibility of targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling pathway-related genes as therapeutics for long COVID using computational analysis. Targeting GPCRs and their signaling pathways holds significant promise for long COVID therapeutics, as these receptors are involved in crucial physiological processes including immune regulation, inflammation control, and neurotransmission. All of these are implicated in the diverse and persistent symptoms of long COVID, potentially offering a versatile approach to addressing multiple aspects of the condition simultaneously. This study identified 21 genes associated with GPCRs for further exploration as potential targets. Notably, GPCR genes such as HRAS, KRAS, GNAQ, and GNA11 were determined to be possible therapeutic targets for the pathophysiological mechanisms of long COVID. FDA-approved drugs targeting these genes were identified, including Binimetinib, Cabozantinib, Selumetinib, Panitumumab, Cetuximab, Adagrasib, Tipifarnib, and Sotorasib. Additionally, Naltrexone and Tipifarnib have emerged as potential new treatment options for long COVID. SARS-CoV-2 may hijack GPCR signaling pathways to dysregulate lung ion and fluid transport, contributing to the pathophysiology of pulmonary edema in patients with COVID-19. Further research is required to translate the findings into the development of therapeutics and to investigate the relationship between viral infection and GPCR signalling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da7629eb0cd7a361a4ae3a5c0b4c551bf11a60fe4063eb7a91375d0ac399548b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
