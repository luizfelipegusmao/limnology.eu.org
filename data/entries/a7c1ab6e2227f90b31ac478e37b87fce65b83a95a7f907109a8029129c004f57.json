{"title":"Residual Flexural Performance of Large-Scale Ferronickel Slag Alkali-Activated Concrete Slabs After Fire Exposure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1736/v1","date":1727089088000,"content":"This paper investigates the flexural behavior of unfired and fired one-way slabs constructed from reinforced ferronickel slag-based alkali-activated concrete. The study aims to expand the limited knowledge of large-scale testing of alkali-activated concrete structural elements, with a particular emphasis on their post-fire performance. Four slabs, each measuring 2.1 × 0.9 × 0.18 m³, were produced—two made of alkali-activated concrete and two of conventional concrete incorporating ordinary Portland cement. Both types of concrete exhibited similar compressive strengths. In each group, one slab served as a reference (control specimen—tested under monotonic four-point bending in its original state), while the other was subjected to a standard fire curve on the tensioned side before mechanical testing. The fired slabs were then tested in a cooled condition under ambient conditions. The effect of fire on the alkali-activated concrete was further examined using mercury intrusion porosity and scanning electron microscopy. The results reveal that the load capacity of structural members cast with alkali-activated concrete is only slightly lower than that of their conventional concrete counterparts (6% lower). However, the alkaliactivated slabs retain more of their stiffness and ductility after fire exposure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7c1ab6e2227f90b31ac478e37b87fce65b83a95a7f907109a8029129c004f57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
