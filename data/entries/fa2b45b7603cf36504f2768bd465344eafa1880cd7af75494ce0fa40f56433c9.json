Sulfate formation mechanisms during winter haze events in northern China have recently received considerable attention, with more than 10 studies published in high-impact journals. However, the conclusions from in-field measurements, laboratory studies, and numerical simulations are inconsistent and even contradictory. Here, we propose a physically based yet simple method to clarify the debate on the dominant sulfate formation pathway. Based on the hazes evolving in the synoptic scale, first, a characteristic sulfate formation rate is derived using the Eulerian mass conservation equation constrained by in situ observations. Then, this characteristic value is treated as a guideline to determine the dominant sulfate formation pathway with a 0D chemical box model. Our observation-derived results establish a linkage between studies from laboratory experiments and chemical transport model simulations. A convergent understanding could therefore be reached on sulfate formation mechanisms in China's wintertime haze. This method is universal and can be applied to various haze conditions and different secondary products.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"fa2b45b7603cf36504f2768bd465344eafa1880cd7af75494ce0fa40f56433c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
