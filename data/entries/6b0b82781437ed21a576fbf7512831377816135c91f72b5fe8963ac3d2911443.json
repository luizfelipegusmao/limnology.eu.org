{"title":"Review of Measuring Methods of Residual Stress in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0422/v1","date":1715154145000,"content":"This literature review provides an in-depth exploration of the research conducted on the investigation and measurement of residual stress (RS) in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) products, particularly focusing on how process parameters influence the phenomenon. RS plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical behavior and structural integrity of WAAM components. This review article gives an understanding of the relationship between process parameters and RS to optimize the WAAM processes and ensure the durability of the final products. It also summarizes key findings, measurement techniques, challenges, and future directions in this evolving field. The review also analyzes a measurement of RS in the products of WAAM as a function of process parameters depending on examining various research studies, techniques, and methodologies employed in their studies. Experimental measuring techniques and numerical analysis of RS to determine the impacts of RS in mechanical response in products of WAAM were discussed. By offering a comprehensive overview of current research trends and insights, this review serves as a valuable resource to guide future investigations, fostering the advancement of WAAM as a robust and efficient manufacturing technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b0b82781437ed21a576fbf7512831377816135c91f72b5fe8963ac3d2911443","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
