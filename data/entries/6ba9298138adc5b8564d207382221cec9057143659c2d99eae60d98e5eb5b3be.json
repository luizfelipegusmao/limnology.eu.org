{"title":"Metaverse of Things (MoT) Applications for Revolutionizing Urban Living in Smart Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1045/v1","date":1718787270000,"content":"The Metaverse of Things (MoT) is an advanced technology that has the potential to revolutionise urban living in the present era. This article explores the advantages, uses, and transformative outcomes of MoT in smart cities. The covered subjects encompass sustainability, urban planning, citizen participation, infrastructure management, and various more. MoT integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) with metaverse technologies. The ultimate objective is to develop virtual environments that are highly interactive, interconnected, and immersive while maintaining a high level of fidelity to reality. The IoT utilises virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and other digital technologies to gather data, facilitate communication, and automate certain processes, thereby enhancing several elements of urban living. It is all a component of the metaverse. The IoT will bring about a profound transformation in the way cities gather and utilise data to enhance services and optimise efficiency. Cities that can efficiently distribute this data can enhance public safety, optimise energy usage, regulate traffic, and manage waste properly. MoT apps that utilise immersive technologies and the IoT can be used to generate more intelligent and captivating cityscapes. The implementation of MoT can greatly enhance the quality of life for residents of smart cities through improvements in transportation, healthcare, education, and community engagement. The study's author examined how smart cities utilise the IoT to enhance the daily experiences of their inhabitants. This study examines the technical structure, possible advantages, and difficulties of implementing MoT in urban settings, aiming to enhance the resilience, responsiveness, and adaptability of cities. The findings emphasise the importance of robust legislative frameworks, stringent security requirements, and well-developed infrastructure to facilitate the extensive use of MoT technology. These factors are crucial for establishing a highly interconnected and efficient urban environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ba9298138adc5b8564d207382221cec9057143659c2d99eae60d98e5eb5b3be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
