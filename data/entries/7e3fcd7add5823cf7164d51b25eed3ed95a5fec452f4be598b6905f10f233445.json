{"title":"Forest Treatment Effects on Watershed Responses Under Warming","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035627?af=R","date":1718195684000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The effects of forest treatments on watershed hydrology have often been studied in isolation from climate change. Consequently, under a warming climate, it is unclear how forest thinning will impact snowpacks, evapotranspiration, and streamflow availability. In this study, we used a distributed hydrologic model to provide insight into the effects of warming and forest treatment on the hydrologic response of the Beaver Creek watershed (∼1,100 km<sup>2</sup>) of central Arizona. Prior to the numerical experiments, confidence in the hydrologic model performance was established by comparisons to long-term observations (2003–2018) of snow water equivalent and streamflow using station observations and through spatially distributed estimates. Results indicated that warming during the 21st century could increase mean annual streamflow by 1.5% for warming levels up to +1°C, followed by a −29% decrease for continued warming up to +6°C, due to the varying effects of warming on snow sublimation, soil evaporation, and plant transpiration. On average, forest thinning increased streamflow by +12% (or 7 mm/yr) through lower plant transpiration by −19% (or −18 mm/yr), while also increasing the change in soil water storage by +42% (or 11 mm/yr). Forest thinning delayed the detrimental effects of warming on streamflow until +4°C, as compared to +2°C without forest treatment. Furthermore, model results suggested that forest cover reductions laterally displace water availability and evapotranspiration to downstream sites. These model-derived mechanisms provide insights on the potential for water resilience toward warming effects afforded through treatment projects in southwestern US ponderosa pine forests.</p>","author":"Charles J.
