Particularly, the decreasing line width of semiconductor devices has heightened the demand for probing critical dimensions using SEM metrology. Despite the high resolution of SEM, it suffers from a drawback in speed compared to optical inspection methods. Furthermore, images captured at rapid frame rates often exhibit significant noise, resulting in poor signal-to-noise ratios. To mitigate noise in SEM images, traditional methods involve averaging tens or hundreds of frames, yet this approach introduces challenges such as increased measurement time and potential sample contamination. These shortcomings are particularly critical for throughput and quality in inspection equipment, notably in semiconductor devices. Typically, SEM images may contain Gaussian and Poisson noise, which have traditionally been addressed through spatial or frequency domain filtering, or by employing statistical methods for restoration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b7503a5591e4cbf81c87e860edb32ba4121f671c9f5cda46743ba7da14c38de5","category":"Environment"}
