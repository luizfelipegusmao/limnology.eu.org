{"title":"Surface Modification of Polyethylene Terephthalate Track-Etched Membranes by 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7- Dodecafluoroheptyl Acrylate for Application in Water Desalination by Direct Contact Membrane Distillation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2082/v1","date":1717142754000,"content":"In this work, the surface of poly(ethylene terephthalate) track-etched membranes (PET TeMs) with pore sizes of 670-1310 nm was hydrophobized with 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7-dodecafluoroheptyl acrylate (DFHA) by photoinitiated graft polymerization. Attenuated total reflection FTIR spec-troscopy (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled to an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), and contact angle measurement were used to identify and characterize the TeMs. The optimal parameters for graft polymerization were determined as follows: polymeriza-tion time 60 min, monomer concentration of 30% and distance from the UV-source 7 cm. The wa-ter contact angle of the modified membranes reached 97Â° which is 51o for pristine membranes. The modified membranes were tested for water desalination using direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) method. The effect of membrane pore size, the degree of grafting and salt concentration on the performance of membrane distillation process was investigated. According to the results obtained, it has been concluded that large pore size hydrophobic TeMs modified by using DFHA could be used for desalinating water.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26bd957981162f21708efd49a797b896ad6abd91a68a63ef3ab47b5968f5ff31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
