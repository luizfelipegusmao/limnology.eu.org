{"title":"Quantifying the Influence of Climate and Agricultural Inputs on Rice Yields: Evidence from Bangladesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0185/v1","date":1725349517000,"content":"This study examines the combined influence of both meteorological and non-climatic factors on rice production in Bangladesh between 1990 and 2020, using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The key variables consist of temperature, precipitation, urbanisation, fertiliser management (specifically potassium levels), and the area of permanent crops. The findings highlight the substantial detrimental impact of temperature on rice output over a prolonged period, whereas precipitation and urbanisation have a favourable affect on rice productivity. However, the utilisation of potassium fertiliser has a detrimental effect on crop productivity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the development of permanent crop fields has a beneficial effect on rice output. These findings provide important information for policymakers and agricultural stakeholders, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies to improve the ability of rice production to withstand the impacts of climate change and urbanisation. The significance of these discoveries applies to rice-producing regions worldwide, offering a strategic blueprint for sustainable cultivation of rice and ensuring food security.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d2cb6174d4f139354208a774ffa237e5174e2c7d09acbeb5476b0d4544d84f6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
