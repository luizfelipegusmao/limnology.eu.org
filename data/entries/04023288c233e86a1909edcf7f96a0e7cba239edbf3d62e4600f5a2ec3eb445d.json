{"title":"A Acylhydrazone Compound A5 Promotes Neurogenesis by Up-regulating Neurogenesis-related Genes and Inhibiting Cell-cycle Progression in Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1604/v1","date":1713946066000,"content":"Adult neurogenesis involves generation of functional neurons from neural progenitor cells, which have the potential to complement and restore damaged neurons and neural circuits. Therefore, the development of drugs that stimulate neurogenesis represents a promising strategy in stem cell therapy and neural regeneration, greatly facilitating the reconstruction of neural circuits in cases of neurodegeneration and brain injury. Our study reveals that compound A5, previously designed and synthesized by our team, exhibits remarkable neuritogenic activities, effectively inducing neurogenesis in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Subsequently, transcriptome analysis using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq technology was performed to further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which compound A5 promotes neurogenesis. Notably, comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were mainly associated with neurogenesis and the down-regulated genes were mainly concerned with cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we confirmed that compound A5 significantly affected the expression of transcription factors related to neurogenesis and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Collectively, these findings identify a new compound with neurogenic activity and may provide insights into drug discovery for neural repair and regeneration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04023288c233e86a1909edcf7f96a0e7cba239edbf3d62e4600f5a2ec3eb445d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
