{"title":"Cracking Down on Data Leaks: Challenges and Legal Pathways for Statistical Officers in Indonesia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1991/v1","date":1724833560000,"content":"Data leakage by statistical officers represents a significant statistical crime under the Indonesian Statistics Law. However, despite the legal provisions, there has been a notable absence of enforcement actions against such breaches, raising questions about the effectiveness and applicability of the current legal framework for addressing statistical crimes related to data leakage. This study identifies a research gap in the enforcement and operationalization of existing laws, emphasizing the lack of empirical data on how these legal provisions are applied in practice. Utilizing an empirical research methodology, this study analyzes data and real-world instances of statistical data leakage. The findings reveal that unethical behavior among statistical officers, inadequate data security measures, and the threat of social engineering significantly contribute to the potential for data breaches. The study's strength lies in its focus on providing a comprehensive understanding of these issues and proposing actionable solutions. This research not only fills the existing gap by offering empirical insights but also advances practical recommendations for enhancing data protection and legal enforcement mechanisms within Indonesiaâ€™s statistical framework.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe1ea5dd18b86552732f1e15fb22bc8f10310d0bbd8d8db24f86a4b9a8f002cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
