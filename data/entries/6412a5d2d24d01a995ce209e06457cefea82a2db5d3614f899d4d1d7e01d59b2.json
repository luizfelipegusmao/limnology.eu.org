{"title":"Identifying High-Risk Patterns in Single-Vehicle, Single-Occupant Road Traffic Accidents: A Novel Pattern Recognition Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0171/v1","date":1725349912000,"content":"Despite various interventions in road safety work, fatal and severe road traffic accidents (RTAs) remain a significant challenge leading to human suffering and economic costs. Understanding the multicausal nature of RTAs, where multiple conditions and factors interact, is crucial for developing effective prevention measures in road safety work. This study investigates the multivariate statistical analysis of co-occurring conditions in RTAs, focusing on single-vehicle accidents with single occupancy and personal injury on Austrian roads outside built-up areas from 2012 to 2019. The aim is to detect recurring combinations of accident-related variables, referred to as blackpatterns (BPs), using the Austrian RTA database. The study proposes Fisherâ€™s exact test to estimate the relationship between an accident-related variable and fatal and severe RTAs (severe casualties). In terms of pattern recognition, the study develops the maximum combination value (MCV) of accident-related variables, a procedure to search through all possible combinations of variables to find the one that has the highest frequency. The accident investigation proceeds with the application of pattern recognition methods, including binomial logistic regression and a newly developed method, the PATTERMAX-method, created to accurately detect and analyse variable-specific BPs in RTA data. Findings indicate significant BPs contributing to severe accidents. The combination of binomial logistic regression and the PATTERMAX-method appears to be a promising approach to investigate severe accidents, providing both insights into detailed variable combinations and their impact on accident severity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6412a5d2d24d01a995ce209e06457cefea82a2db5d3614f899d4d1d7e01d59b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
