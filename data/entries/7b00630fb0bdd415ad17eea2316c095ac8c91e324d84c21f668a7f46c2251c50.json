{"title":"Evaluation of the mineral manganese OXMN009 and OXMN009P in the Chemical looping Combustion (CLC) process using Thermogravimetry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1571/v1","date":1719222125000,"content":"Carbon dioxides capture chemical looping combustion (CLC) technology uses metal oxides as oxygen transporters (TO). (1) These oxygen transporters, OXMN009 and OXMN009P, are used in a cyclic process that prevents the formation of nitrogen oxides by keeping air and fuel separate. (2) Thermogravimetric balance (TGA) experiments were conducted to evaluate the kinetic behavior of these copper-modified oxygen transporters. (3) It was found that OXMN009P has improved reactivity and oxygen transfer properties due to copper impregnation. The kinetic parameters obtained in the TGA indicate that the reaction is non-thermal and requires less energy to initiate. (4) The results show that OXMN009P has reactivity comparable to other manganese-based materials reported in the literature and can be an effective option for carbon dioxide capture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b00630fb0bdd415ad17eea2316c095ac8c91e324d84c21f668a7f46c2251c50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
