{"title":"Combined Microbial Fermentation Converts Bioactive Compounds in Nitraria tangutorum Bobrov Fruit and Displays Its Antidiabetic Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1251/v1","date":1711011805000,"content":"Nitraria tangutorum Bobrov is a berry shrub with white flowers and red fruits, which grows in the deserts in the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolia, and western China. Its fruit N. tangutorum fruit (NTF) contains various bioactive compounds, with anti-fatigue, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective functions. However, the high saccharide content of NTF makes it unsuitable for diabetic patients. In this study, we fermented NTF to obtain N. tangutorum fermented juice (NTJ), and N. tangutorum fermented residue (NTR), which are suitable for diabetics to consume. We characterized the bioactive compounds in NTF, NTR, and NTJ, and found that fermentation increased the diversity of bioactive compounds, and greatly reduced sucrose, glucose, and fructose content while generating trehalose, which has the potential to manage blood glucose levels. Further, NTJ displays anti-diabetic potential due to various compounds anti-diabetic properties. This study provides a basis for further clinical research on NTJ's anti-diabetic function in humans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b15448c251ffe229d45d96bfaa45ba315a41c1c5b26b54dfb9086125e646d9ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
