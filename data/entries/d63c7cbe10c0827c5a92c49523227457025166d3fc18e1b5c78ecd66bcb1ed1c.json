{"title":"Complexity: Emergent Order in Ant Colonies. Is Natural Selection Pressure a Requisite","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1656/v1","date":1719211472000,"content":"The phenomenon of emergence in complex systems is vividly exemplified by the coordinated behaviors of ant colonies, where apparent chaos evolves into order. This article delves into the essence of complexity and emergence through interdisciplinary research spanning biology, computer science, and information theory. It begins by examining the foundational principles of swarm intelligence, revealing how simple ant behaviors culminate in sophisticated collective intelligence. The discussion then transitions to the philosophical dimensions of emergent phenomena and the principles of self-organization that underpin systemic order. Key concepts such as ant colony optimization algorithms and stigmergy are synthesized, highlighting their relevance in both natural and artificial systems. The broader societal implications are considered through the lens of collective intelligence, drawing parallels between ant colonies and human social structures. Complementary online resources and multimedia content enrich the narrative, providing accessible insights and dynamic representations of ant intelligence. This convergence of diverse perspectives underscores the remarkable capacity for simplicity to generate complexity, culminating in a profound understanding of collective wisdom.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d63c7cbe10c0827c5a92c49523227457025166d3fc18e1b5c78ecd66bcb1ed1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
