{"title":"Genetic Foundations of Nellore Traits: A Gene Prioritization and Functional Analyses of Genome-Wide Association Study Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1101/v1","date":1723651327000,"content":"The main goal of this study was to pinpoint functional candidate genes associated with multiple economically important traits in Nellore cattle. After quality control, 1 830 genomic regions sourced from 52 scientific peer-reviewed publications were used in this study. From these, a total of 8 569 positional candidate genes were annotated for reproduction, 11 195 for carcass, 5 239 for growth, and 3 483 for morphological traits, and used in the overrepresentation analysis. The significant genes (adjusted p-values&amp;lt;0.05) identified in the overrepresentation analysis underwent prioritization analyses, and an enrichment analysis of the prioritized overrepresented candidate genes was performed. The prioritized candidate genes were: GFRA4, RFWD3, SERTAD2, KIZ, REM2, and ANKRD34B for reproduction, RFWD3, TMEM120A, MIEF2, FOXRED2, DUSP29, CARHSP1, OBI1, JOSD1, NOP58, and LOXL1-AS1 for carcass, ANKRD34B, and JOSD1 for growth traits, and no gene prioritized for morphological traits. The functional analysis pinpointed the following genes: KIZ (plays crucial role in spindle organization, essential in forming a robust mitotic centrosome), DUSP29 (involved in muscle cell differentiation), and JOSD1 (involved in protein deubiquitination, thereby improving growth). The enrichment of the functional candidate genes identified in this study highlights that these genes play an important role in the expression of reproduction, carcass, and growth traits in Nellore cattle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"322dbde26fd6f41e512a009c2b566e024a697a9f383213510b19e67bc729387f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
