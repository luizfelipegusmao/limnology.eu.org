{"title":"Epigenetic stress memory in gymnosperms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1117/7595554?rss=1","date":1706659200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gymnosperms are long-lived, cone-bearing seed plants that include some of the most ancient extant plant species. These relict land plants have evolved to survive in habitats marked by chronic or episodic stress. Their ability to thrive in these environments is partly due to their phenotypic flexibility, and epigenetic regulation likely plays a crucial part in this plasticity. We review the current knowledge on abiotic and biotic stress memory in gymnosperms and the possible epigenetic mechanisms underlying long-term phenotypic adaptations. We also discuss recent technological improvements and new experimental possibilities that likely will advance our understanding of epigenetic regulation in these ancient and hard-to-study plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"8efc741d6b78933cc20b1aed09c709613dea4f2c705334f17afe2ae16f2fefa7","category":"Environment"}
