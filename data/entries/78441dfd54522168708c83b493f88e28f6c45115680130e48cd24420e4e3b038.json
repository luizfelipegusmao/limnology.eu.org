The post-compressed pulses with an average power of 11.47 W demonstrated reasonable spatial-spectral homogeneity of the beam with the spectral overlap parameter V&gt;83% and good beam quality with Mx2=1.28 and My2=1.14.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78441dfd54522168708c83b493f88e28f6c45115680130e48cd24420e4e3b038","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
