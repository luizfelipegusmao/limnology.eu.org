{"title":"Connections and Unmet Needs: Severe Asthma Biologics and Osteoporosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0228/v1","date":1722917350000,"content":"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease for which the main anti-inflammatory drugs for better disease control are steroids or corticosteroids. The use of steroids in asthma patients, in particular in uncontrolled asthma patients, is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures. A single oral corticosteroids course increases the risk of osteoporosis and continual use of inhaled corticosteroids is correlated over time to an increased risk for both bone conditions. With the use of new, available biologic therapies for asthma, perhaps even anticipating the times of their use in what are the steps of therapeutic management, in the current guidelines and with targeted strategies of prevention it may be possible to improve asthma management, preventing some comorbidities, such as osteoporosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb34b416ae7aee2789898100aa6f0026a8a5c523f569aa56d35560535a50034b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
