{"title":"Methodologies for smellwalks and scentwalks—a critical review","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae005/7607202?rss=1","date":1707782400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Olfactory elements of the human environment are essential with respect to culture, society, and heritage, and robust methodological approaches are necessary to identify and describe aspects of this sensory component. To accurately investigate and advance knowledge of olfactory composition of spaces and places, that is, a smellscape—an olfactory contextualized landscape—innovative methodologies such as smellwalks can be employed as part of the research approach. Despite the increasing use of smellwalks, there is no current standard methodology for this investigative method in practice.We identify major themes including variance of group size, participant versus researcher-led walking techniques, reinvention of smellwalking process, and methodological discussion and theory. Limitations and future research potential are suggested, including that of group dynamics, attribute focus, the extension of smellwalk attribute data beyond traditional hedonic attributes, and avenues for development of future processes and protocols for multisensory sensewalks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"dc832b25fc11a89e266155eb4c1125de7f3cd81b4a8cd7cf92c2247b92776342","category":"Environment"}
