{"title":"The NMR Studies of the Interactions between Sialyllactoses and Polysialytransferase Domain for the Polysialylation Inhibition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1452/v1","date":1711369273000,"content":"Sialylated milk oligosaccharides (SMOs) is the most important oligosaccharides in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), and have a multifunctional health benefit, and the most abundant SMOs are sialyllactose (SLs). The previous studies indicate that the growth of tumor cells, and angiogenesis on tumor tissues with Lewis lung carcinoma, melanoma, and colon carcinoma cells could be prevented by SL. Thus, it has been proposed that SL might be an ideal candidate for the development of anti-angiogenic drugs without any side effects. It has been proposed that the Sialic acid (Sia) can be produced through SL’s hydrolysis, and the dietary Sia is further transported to the brain and other tissues though blood for formation of CMP-Sia, the activated precursor of Sia, and then is catalyzed by polysialyltransferases (polySTs) for synthesis of polysialic acid (polySia) or polysialylation of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Thus, it’s necessary to study and develop new inhibitors, which not only modulate a proper balance between the gut health and neuros system development, but also inhibit the overexpression of polySia, and thus block the tumor cell migration. In this study, we proposed that 3’-SL and 6’-SL may be more ideal inhibitors comparing with two previous inhibitors, the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and cytidine monophosphate (CMP) in the previous studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af7526e571aa7fb7cb0ac798295a43923e884e2e7a8f5c6e0cfb4cea3c791367","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
