{"title":"The Dysregulation of the Monocyte-Dendritic Cell Interplay Is Associated with In-Hospital Mortality in COVID-19 Pneumonia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1213/v1","date":1710983822000,"content":"Background: The monocyte-phagocyte system (MPS), including monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), plays a key role in anti-viral immunity. We aimed to analyze the prognostic value of the MPS components on in-hospital mortality in a cohort of 58 patients (M/F ; mean ageï‚±SD years) with COVID-19 pneumonia and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Methods: We measured frequencies and absolute numbers of peripheral blood CD169+ monocytes, conventional CD1c+ and CD141+ (namely cDC2 and cDC1), and plasmacytoid CD303+ DCs by means of multi-parametric flow cytometry. A gene profile analysis of 770 immune-inflammatory related human genes and 20 SARS-CoV-2 genes was also performed. Results: Median frequencies and absolute counts of CD169-expressing monocytes were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in controls (p 0.04 and p 0.01, respectively). Conversely, percentages and absolute numbers of all DC subsets were markedly depleted in patients (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a8711744e47b096d0234398d5f7104a2097d90f216d4a962ec52657490eea47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
