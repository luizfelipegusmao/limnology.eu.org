Well, the latest delicacy to come out of the &#8216;FL Kitchen&#8217;, as his friends call it, is something a little different: an ultralight homebuilt mountain bike. Take it away, Francis.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>We are all in awe of the bikes that <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/dangerholm-scott-hyper-spark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dangerholm</a> can come up with, technically and aesthetically, but not everyone has the deep budget and technical know-how to work on their bikes at that level. This build bridges the void between stock bikes and those creations. It&#8217;s something any bike enthusiast can do; a reasonably priced bike that can hold its own in terms of aesthetics and weight against all the superbikes out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mbaction.com/mountainbiking-healthand-fitness-cycling-travel-trans-hong-kong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hong Kong has a lot of MTB trails</a> and a robust MTB scene. I wear my road biking heart on my sleeve but sometimes, especially on colder days, I wish there was an MTB in our cramped apartment that I could take for a two-hour ride in Lantau Island where we live. I&#8217;d love to sneak onto small village roads, climb the steep hill to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Buddha_(Hong_Kong)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Big Buddha</a> or ride the <a href=\"https://www.lantau.gov.hk/en/our-projects/mountain-bike-trail.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">big, new bike park</a> built on the south side. And as someone not technically proficient off-road, I&#8217;d need the bike to be light for an easier carry!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"929\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_2665-1340x929.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505781\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_2665-1340x929.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_2665-650x451.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_2665-190x132.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_2665-1080x749.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_2665-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_2665.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, my goal was to build a light and reasonably priced MTB, that performs as well and looks as good as any top model!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had some components lying around, among them a grey-padded Berk Lupina saddle. This led me to decide on a grey frame colorway. I went with an open-mold frame that goes by FM-199 SL and had it custom-painted matte gray (pantone: Cool Gray 9C). For me this colorway highlights the curves and edges of the frame and goes with any accent color for components. It&#8217;s also the lightest boot axle frame in the open-mold market and the size S geometry is just what I was looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery__slider\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850-1340x756.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"505779\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=505779\" class=\"wp-image-505779\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850-1340x756.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850-650x367.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850-1080x610.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4850.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849-1340x756.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"505776\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=505776\" class=\"wp-image-505776\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849-1340x756.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849-650x367.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849-1080x610.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4849.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to try carbon MTB wheels this time and with good experience from my road wheels in the last build, I went with the same open mold supplier.

As you might know, most sellers don’t offer the greatest customer service but with a little bit of patience and a couple more weeks waiting, everything arrived as ordered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike my previous road builds where I had a set build list that I followed, this one took more of a spec-as-we-go approach. The pandemic is preventing full bike shop inventories and many items were unavailable. I went with shiny orange forks by Fox as they just arrived in time at the local bike dealer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"1005\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298-1340x1005.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505790\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298-1340x1005.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298-650x488.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298-190x143.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298-510x382.jpg 510w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298-1080x810.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298-16x12.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thumbnail_IMG_2298.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wanted to use grip shifters as I prefer the simplicity of use and cockpit cleanliness that they offer but since they are only offered as an aftermarket purchase and not with the complete set, I knew I had to cobble together a groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with a SRAM GX 12 grip shifter and rear derailleur. I lucked out in the local second-hand market when I found some weightweenie-favorite Raceface Next SL crank arms, only to get disappointed when my usual 30T chainrings were not available in any color. I did see some orange-anodized 28s which were small, but then lucked out again when I found some Leonardi Racing 12s cassettes with a 9-49T configuration that gives a 533% range and a 0.50-3.11 ratio! With some more orange Leonardi Racing bits I had my accent color on point!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these purchases were done online which, even if we want to support local shops, will be more convenient as product availability is in real-time and you don&#8217;t have to be exposed to crowds – important given the regulations currently in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery__slider\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091-1340x756.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"505791\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=505791\" class=\"wp-image-505791\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091-1340x756.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091-650x367.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091-1080x610.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5091.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094-1340x756.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"505794\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=505794\" class=\"wp-image-505794\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094-1340x756.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094-650x367.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094-1080x610.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5094.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123-1340x756.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"505796\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=505796\" class=\"wp-image-505796\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123-1340x756.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123-650x367.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123-1080x610.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5123.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to keep the unbranded theme for the cockpit except for the fact that I have an MCFK handlebar which was originally 680 mm long, and then had one end damaged in a crash.

all the stuff that I didn’t already have, which puts the build right around the price range of a Specialized Epic HT (11.3 kg / US$2,800), Canyon Exceed CF 7 (10.55 kg / US$3,300) and Trek Procaliber 9.6 (11.34 kg / US$2,800). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the pedals came in, the bike weighed a total of 8.18 kg – lighter than most top-end built models. All with bolt-on specs and no DIY tuning or Dremel. Considering I used a third-tier shift kit, brakes and pedals, I&#8217;m very happy with this outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See below for a full breakdown of the build (note: &#8220;LBS&#8221; means the

If you want to ride a unique bike and not bump into a couple of similar models out on the bike park but also don&#8217;t want to spend a princely sum for the high-end models, then having a bit of patience and resourcefulness is the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To critique, the brake hoses and cables could have been tidier and the frame finish gloss instead of matte so it&#8217;s easier to manage the scratches. And I need to get a matte finish seatpost. I will also lookout for the durability of the carbon rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5142-1340x756.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505853\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5142-1340x756.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5142-650x367.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5142-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5142-1080x610.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5142-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_5142.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far I&#8217;ve found the bike to be nimble and quick to react – probably thanks to the 69.5º head angle and shorter 425 mm chainstays – and stable on the downhills whether on dirt or on the road. In the past I&#8217;ve always put 2.0 or 2.1&#8243; tires on my MTBs but this time, with a slightly larger diameter, plus the solid fork, this build is more capable on the new bike park trails. I assume a very experienced rider would have loads of fun on this!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the very low weight it obviously climbs just like a road bike, so the small little hills around old villages are no problem, neither are long climbs up to the Big Buddha.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li
