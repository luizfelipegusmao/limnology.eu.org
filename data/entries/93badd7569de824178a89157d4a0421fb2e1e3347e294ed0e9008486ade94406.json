{"title":"Identification and Spatiotemporal Expression of a Putative New GABA Receptor Subunit in the Human Body Louse Pediculus humanus humanus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1864/v1","date":1716893921000,"content":"Human louse (Pediculus humanus) is an obligatory blood feeding ectoparasite with two ecotypes: human body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus), a competent vector of several bacterial pathogens and the human head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis) responsible for pediculosis and affecting millions of people around the globe. \nGABA (Î³-aminobutyic acid) receptors, members of the cys-loop ligand gated ion channels superfamily, are among the main pharmacological targets for insecticides. In insects, four subunits of GABA receptors: resistant to dieldrin (RDL), glycin like receptor of drosophila (GRD), ligand gated chloride channel homologue3 (LCCH3), and 8916 are well described and form distinct phylogenetic clades revealing orthologous relationships. Our previous studies in human body louse confirmed that subunits Phh-RDL, Phh-GRD and Phh-LCCH3 are well clustered in their corresponding clades. In the present work, we cloned and characterized a putative new GABA receptor subunit in human body louse that we named HoCas for Homologous to Cys-loop alpha like subunit. Extending our analysis to arthropods, HoCas was found to be conserved and clustered in a new (fifth) phylogenetic clade. Interestingly, the gene encoding this subunit is ancestral and has been lost in some insect orders. Compared to the other studied GABA receptor subunits, HoCas exhibited a relatively higher expression level in all development stages and in different tissues of human body louse. These findings improved our understanding of the complex nature of GABA receptors in Pediculus humanus and more generally in arthropods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93badd7569de824178a89157d4a0421fb2e1e3347e294ed0e9008486ade94406","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
