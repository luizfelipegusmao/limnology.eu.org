{"title":"Development and optimization of nasal composition of a neuroprotective agent for use in neonatology after prenatal hypoxia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2021/v1","date":1719555718000,"content":"The intranasal route of drug administration is characterized by high bioavailability and is considered promising for rapid delivery of drugs with systemic action to the central nervous system, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. This is particularly important for the use of neuroprotective drugs in the treatment of brain tissue damage in infants caused by the effects of intrauterine hypoxia. Creation of new dosage forms for neonatology with the use of software and mathematical technologies in pharmaceutical development allows to create cerebroprotective drugs with controlled pharmaco-technological properties, thus reducing time and resources for necessary research. We developed a formulation of a new nasal gel formulation with Angiolin using Box-Benken experiment design for the therapy of prenatal CNS damage. It was found that the consistency properties of the nasal gel were significantly influenced by the gelling agent and mucoadhesive component - sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose. We have optimized the composition of nasal gel formulation with Angiolin using the formed models and relationships between the factors. The optimized composition of the obtained nasal gel has satisfactory parameters of thixotropic properties. The developed 1% gel for neuroprotection with Angiolin meets all the requirements for harmlessness and safety to drug forms of this group - low toxicity, absence of local irritant and allergic effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1000ae6d2eb05c93d5931d9f3acae1933c4787fb0088f4f68cdbd8858aba891f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
