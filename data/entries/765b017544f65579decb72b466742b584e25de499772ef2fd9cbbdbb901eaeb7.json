{"title":"Implementation of a Grupal Intervention Program for the Treatment of Obesity in Children: PinPO.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0982/v1","date":1720756654000,"content":"Childhood obesity is a public health problem and most of the interventions are focused on healthy habits as reducing energy intake, avoiding a sedentary lifestyle and increasing physical activity. However, usually they are based in individual programs, with few structured interventions in health systems without satisfactory results. PinPo aims to carry out an integral intervention in children with obesity, as well as in their parents and caregivers, to get motivation to change towards healthy lifestyle habits. The program contains 9 educational grupal sessions directed by a multidisciplinary expert team. 10 boys and girls, and another group with 10 family members and/or caregivers participate in sessions during 90 min biweekly. Moreover, there is an individual adaptation depending on the severity and comorbidities. At the beginning and at the end of the program, an integral evaluation for health status is developed including anthropometric, nutritional, physical activity, and psychologist and analytical measurements. Finally, a satisfaction survey is carried out on the participants.In conclusion, the implementation of PinPo could offer to paediatric patients with obesity and their families, an integral intervention to treat obesity and its complications. So, there are expectations of achieving favorable results that also allow to optimize its effectiveness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"765b017544f65579decb72b466742b584e25de499772ef2fd9cbbdbb901eaeb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
