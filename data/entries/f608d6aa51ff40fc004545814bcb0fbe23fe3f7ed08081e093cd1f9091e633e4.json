The current investigation was aimed at quantifying the MP concentration on 25 beaches on the Maharashtra coast, India. Beach sediments (1 kg) were collected from each site, with five replicates to evaluate the extent of MPs. The samples were homogenized, and three 20 g replicas were prepared for subsequent analysis. Later, the samples were sieved, and MPs were extracted using previously published protocols. The abundance of MPs found as 1.56 ± 0.79 MPs/g, ranges from 0.43 ± 0.07 to 3 ± 0.37 MPs/g. Fibers were found as the most abundant shape of MPs. Size-wise classification revealed dominance of &lt;1 mm and 1–2 mm-sized MPs. Blue- and black-colored MPs were recorded dominantly. Polymer identification of MPs revealed polyurethane, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, acrylic or polymethyl methacrylate, and rubber. The findings revealed that MPs were found to be higher at highly impacted sites, followed by moderately impacted sites and low-impacted sites, possibly due to a different degree of anthropogenic pressure. The study recommended the urgent need for effective policy to prevent plastics accumulation in the coastal environment of Maharashtra State, India.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe study investigated the abundance and distribution of microplastics in the marine environment, specifically in sediments.\nThe most common type of microplastic found was fibers, followed by fragments and films.\nMicroplastics were found to pose a potential risk to the marine ecosystem, although further research is needed to fully understand their ecological impact.\nFuture research should focus on expanding the sample size, assessing long-term effects, exploring sources and pathways, and considering size and shape of microplastics.\nThe findings recommended urgent action to mitigate plastic pollution in Maharashtra coast.\n</p>","author":"Riddhi Shinde, \nVasantkumar Rabari, \nRishiraj Duggal, \nAshish Patel, \nSulaiman Ali Alharbi, \nMohammad Javed Ansari, \nJigneshkumar Trivedi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"f608d6aa51ff40fc004545814bcb0fbe23fe3f7ed08081e093cd1f9091e633e4","category":"Environment"}
