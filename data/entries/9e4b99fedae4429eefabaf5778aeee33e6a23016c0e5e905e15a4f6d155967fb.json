{"title":"The impact of food insecurity on mental health among older adults residing in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301046","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Cornelius Osei-Owusu, Satveer Dhillon, Isaac Luginaah</p>\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, food insecurity has been increasing globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, economic downturns and conflict and a number of other intersecting factors. Older adults residing in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to food insecurity. While the impacts of food insecurity on physical health outcomes have been thoroughly researched, the effect on mental health outcomes remains under-researched, especially among older adults. Hence, this systematic review aims to investigate existing literature to assess how food insecurity impacts the mental health of older persons residing in LMICs. A systematic search of six databases and Google for studies was conducted. The search was limited to studies written in English and published between 2000 to the present. We identified 725 studies, out of which 40 studies were selected for a full-text review and 12 studies were included for a final analysis. The significant finding in all the included studies was that food insecurity is associated with the worsening mental health of older adults. We also found a complex interplay of factors such as gender, age, rural/urban and health conditions associated with the aggravation of several mental health outcomes. The findings of this study illuminate the need for improved food programs to improve food security and, consequently, mental health among older adults.","author":"Cornelius Osei-Owusu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9e4b99fedae4429eefabaf5778aeee33e6a23016c0e5e905e15a4f6d155967fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
