{"title":"Epirubicin and Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1432/v1","date":1716366455000,"content":"(1) Background: Intravesical Chemotherapy is standard of care in intermediate risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Different agents are used across the world based on availability, cost and practice patterns. Epirubicin (EPI), one of these agents is used by many centers over many decades. However, its true differential efficacy compared to other agents and its tolerability is still poorly reported. We aimed to assess the differential efficacy and safety of intravesical EPI in NMIBC patients. (2) Methods: A systematic search of PUBMED, Webofscience, clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar databases was performed on December 31, 2023. We reviewed 28 studies that included patients treated EPI after TURBT (transurethral resection of bladder tumors) for NMIBC and who compared oncological outcomes such as recurrence and progression to other adjuvant treatment such as Mitomycin C (MMC), Gemcitabine (GEM) and BCG. Further, we looked at the safety profile of EPI at room temperature under hyperthermia intravesically and at the oncological outcomes when administrated with hyperthermia; (3) Results: When compared to other chemotherapeutics (MMC/GEM), EPI seemed to be equally effective; however, EPI seems less effective in preventing disease management recurrence compared to BCG intravesical. The most common adverse events of EPI include cystitis, dysuria, and pollakiuria. (4) Conclusions: EPI exhibits similar oncological performances to Gemcitabine and Mitomycin C currently used for adjuvant therapy in NMIBC. Novel delivery mechanisms such as hyperthermia are promising newcomers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49f0397070c732e13fb5d97b4e17b84b51bf430a8dfd37152e7348caad542905","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
