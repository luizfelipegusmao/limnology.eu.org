{"title":"Exploring a Dynamic Homotopy Technique to Enhance the Convergence of Classical Power Flow Iterative Solvers in Ill-conditioned Power System Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1311/v1","date":1724054974000,"content":"This paper presents a dynamic homotopy technique that can be used to calculate a preliminary result for a power flow problem (PFP). This result can then be used as an initial estimate to efficiently solve the PFP using either the classical Newton-Raphson (NR) method or its fast decoupled version (FDXB) while still maintaining high accuracy. The preliminary stage for the dynamic homotopy problem is formulated and solved by employing integration techniques, where implicit and explicit schemes are studied. The dynamic problem assumes an initial condition that coincides with the initial estimate for a traditional iterative method such as NR. In this sense, the initial guess for the FPF is adequately set as a flat start, which is a starting for the case when this initialization is of difficult assignment for convergence. The static homotopy method requires a complete solution of a PFP per homotopy pathway point, while the dynamic homotopy is based on numerical integration methods. This approach can require only one LU factorization at each point of the pathway. Allocating these points properly helps avoid several PFP resolutions to build the pathway. The hybrid technique was evaluated for large-scale systems with poor conditioning, such as a 109272-bus model and other test systems under stressed conditions. A scheme based on the implicit backward Euler scheme demonstrated the best performance among other numerical solvers studied. It provided reliable partial results for the dynamic homotopy problem, which proved to be suitable for achieving fast and highly accurate solutions using both the NR and FDXB solvers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e7adebecf644cffb994c2b0562a742dccbcddbb2175bb37ef0345ec72097fd7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
