{"title":"Application of Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Network Anomaly Traffic Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0595/v1","date":1720422442000,"content":"This study discusses the application of deep learning technology in network intrusion detection systems (IDS) and focuses on a new model named CNN-Focal. First, through the review of traditional IDS technology, it analyzes its limitations in dealing with complex network traffic. Then, the design principle of the CNN-Focal model is described in detail, which uses threshold convolution and SoftMax multi-class classification technology to effectively improve abnormal traffic detection's accuracy and efficiency. The experimental results show that CNN-Focal performs well on the open data set, demonstrating the potential and advantages of its application in the natural network environment and providing a new perspective and method for further research of deep learning in the field of network security in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e42aa3953609b4303a0d7079bde3eab6bda0fb720b256bc94cb0dfa0032dbd8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
