{"title":"Electromovility and Energy Transition in Cuba","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0386/v1","date":1725532140000,"content":"The large-scale introduction of renewable energy, replacing fossil fuels, is presented as an essential part of the energy transition; this substitution is being observed in electrical systems, but it will also be necessary to introduce them in other sectors, such as transportation, either by incorporating renewable energy sources in the sector's facilities, including automotive service centers, or by electrifying transportation technology. The introduction of electromobility in a country is associated with a group of technologies that are required to make this introduction feasible. In Cuba, the introduction of electric vehicles, electric charging stations and charging points, including residential charging points, could increase the current demand by about 330 MW, based on the prospects for the introduction of electrification in the country's transportation system. Taking all of the above as a point of reference, this article addresses the basic elements of an energy transition proposal in the transportation sector, arriving at a proposed Roadmap to achieve the required synergy between energy transition and electromobility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ae948a455601a383ff35cc5cb0bc7eba75b17eb253a92df88892b13acf7b37e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
