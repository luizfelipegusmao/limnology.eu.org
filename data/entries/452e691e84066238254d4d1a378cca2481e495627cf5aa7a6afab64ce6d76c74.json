{"title":"Splenic Myelolipomas in the Domestic Cat &ndash; to Operate or Not to Operate?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0320/v1","date":1715092285000,"content":"Myelolipoma is a benign, typically inert neoplasm of uncertain aetiology that is rarely reported in cats. Although commonly asymptomatic, in some cases, myelolipomas can cause abdominal discomfort or present with rupture and haemorrhage. Here, we describe a rare case of a splenic myelolipoma in a Domestic Long Hair cat in which, after extensive diagnostic investigations, clinical signs of hyporexia and weight loss were attributable to the presence of an intra-abdominal mass. The patient was treated by splenectomy and unexpectedly died during the post-operative period. Although splenectomy appears to be a sensible intervention in symptomatic patients, the optimal management of splenic myelolipomas in cats remains unknown. The risk-benefit ratio of surgical management needs to be carefully considered, and therapeutic intervention should be tailored individually to each patient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"452e691e84066238254d4d1a378cca2481e495627cf5aa7a6afab64ce6d76c74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
