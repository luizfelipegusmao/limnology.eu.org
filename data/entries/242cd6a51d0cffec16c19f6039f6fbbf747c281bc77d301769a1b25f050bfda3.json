{"title":"Third-generation cephalosporin resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> in dogs and cats in Germany in 2019–2021","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309554","date":1724680800000,"content":"<p>by Stefanie Katharina Frenzer, Leonie Feuer, Alexander Bartel, Astrid Bethe, Antina Lübke-Becker, Babette Klein, Wolfgang Bäumer, Roswitha Merle</p>\r\nObjectives <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a worldwide challenge, threatening global health. The objective of this research was to determine the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporin resistance (3GCR) proportion in <i>Escherichia (E</i>.<i>) coli</i> isolated from clinical samples of dogs and cats in Germany.</p> Methods <p>The study utilized result data from antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of isolates obtained from diagnostic samples collected from dogs and cats send in for bacterial examination. Data includes AST results from 3,491 veterinary practices in Germany spanning the years 2019 to 2021, representing 33.1% of practices and clinics nationwide. Out of 175,171 clinical samples, a total of 25,491 <i>E. coli</i> strains (14,6%) were evaluated for their susceptibility to antimicrobials, in particular the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporin cefovecin, but also aminoglycosides (gentamicin, GEN), fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, ENR), tetracyclines (doxycycline), phenicols (chloramphenicol), folate pathway inhibitors (sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim), and nitrofurans (nitrofurantoin).</p> Results <p>The cefovecin resistance proportion was 11.6% in the study period. Geographical analysis showed local variations in 3GCR in <i>E. coli</i> of ±3%. Regarding all <i>E. coli</i> isolates investigated, resistance proportions were observed as follows: 12% for sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 7% for enrofloxacin, 8% for chloramphenicol and 4% for gentamicin. Notably, 3GCR <i>E. coli</i> showed significantly higher resistance proportions, specifically 30% for sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 28% for chloramphenicol, 18% for enrofloxacin and 14% for gentamicin.</p> Conclusions <p>This study represents the first of its kind to utilize an extensive dataset encompassing dogs and cats across Germany. Companion animals have close contact to their owners and transmission of 3GCR between them is likely as well as acquisition from other environmental sources. Resistance proportions (6.7%) against the antibiotic ceftazidime as reported by the German AMR surveillance for human medicine were lower than in our veterinary data. Our study provides an overview of the current 3GCR resistance proportion in Germany and demonstrates the importance of integrated AMR monitoring.</p>","author":"Stefanie Katharina Frenzer","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"242cd6a51d0cffec16c19f6039f6fbbf747c281bc77d301769a1b25f050bfda3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
