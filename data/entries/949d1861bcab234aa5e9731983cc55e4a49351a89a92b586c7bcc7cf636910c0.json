In the Aegean, the growing of olives is known since the Neolithic period, and it has been suggested that their cultivation increased during the 1st millennium <span>bce</span>. The olive and its by-products have played dynamic roles in the economies of the regions in which it was grown. The finding of charred olive stones at the site of Sikyon in the northeastern Peloponnese, Greece, reflects the role of olives in this region during the second half of the 1st millennium <span>bce</span> until the beginning of the 1st millennium <span>ce</span>. The results of geometric morphometric analysis of some complete olive stones found in various archaeological contexts at Sikyon provide information on the state of olive cultivation and the richness of the various olive varieties grown there.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"949d1861bcab234aa5e9731983cc55e4a49351a89a92b586c7bcc7cf636910c0","category":"Environment"}
