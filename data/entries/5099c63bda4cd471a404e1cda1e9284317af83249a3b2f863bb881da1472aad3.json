In addition to the traditional Si based cells, CdTe can also be used as a solar energy material. Despite having a high theoretical efficiency [<a href=\"#ozae044.592-B1\">1</a>], CdTe devices do not match current Si device performance, with CdTe only reaching an energy conversion efficiency of 22.3% [<a href=\"#ozae044.592-B2\">2</a>] compared to Si cells at 26.1% efficiency [<a href=\"#ozae044.592-B3\">3</a>]. Thus, raising the efficiency of CdTe-based solar cells is a primary concern for those working on them.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5099c63bda4cd471a404e1cda1e9284317af83249a3b2f863bb881da1472aad3","category":"Environment"}
