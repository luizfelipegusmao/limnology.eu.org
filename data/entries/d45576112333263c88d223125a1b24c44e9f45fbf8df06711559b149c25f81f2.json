However, it remains unclear whether the binding of Gag to <i>Psi</i> alone is enough to promote RNA packaging and what role LRIs play in this process. Using mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), we investigated the effects of mutations in 4 proposed LRIs on gRNA structure and function. Our findings revealed the presence of an unsuspected extended LRI, and hSHAPE revealed that maintaining a wild-type–like <i>Psi</i> structure is crucial for efficient packaging. Surprisingly, filter-binding assays demonstrated that most mutants, regardless of their packaging capability, exhibited significant binding to Pr77<sup>Gag</sup>, suggesting that Gag binding to <i>Psi</i> is insufficient for efficient packaging. Footprinting experiments indicated that efficient RNA packaging is promoted when Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> binds to 2 specific sites within <i>Psi</i>, whereas binding elsewhere in <i>Psi</i> does not lead to efficient packaging. Taken together, our results suggest that the 3D structure of the <i>Ps</i>i/Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> complex regulates the assembly of viral particles around gRNA, enabling effective discrimination against other viral and cellular RNAs that may also bind Gag efficiently.","author":"Suresha G.
