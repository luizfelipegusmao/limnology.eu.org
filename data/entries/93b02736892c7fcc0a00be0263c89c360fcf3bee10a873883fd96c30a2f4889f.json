{"title":"9 Randel Lecture: In Vivo investigation of pregnancy Physiology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/52/7617940?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pregnancy in any mammal requires the integration of three distinct compartments; the maternal, placental and fetal compartments. Compromised function of any of the three compartments can result in suboptimal pregnancy outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality at delivery, reduced livestock production efficiency and adult-onset of metabolically-related disease in humans. To accurately understand the progression of both normal and compromised pregnancies, therefore, requires the simultaneous assessment of all three compartments, which for most species is not technically feasible. Consequently, over the past 60 yr the pregnant sheep has been used extensively for in vivo investigation of pregnancy physiology. The ability to place indwelling catheters, within both maternal and fetal vessels, allows the simultaneous steady-state assessment of uterine and umbilical blood flows, hormone secretion, and nutrient uptake and utilization of nutrients by each of the three compartments, under non-stressed and non-anesthetized conditions. This has provided unrivalled insight into the physiology of pregnancy, and the realization that the placenta is a highly metabolic tissue, utilizing the majority of oxygen and glucose taken up by the uterus. However, the deficit in studying pregnant sheep is the lack of genetic models, readily available in rodents, that could help define specific gene function during pregnancy. Consequently, we developed in vivo lentiviral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) methods to specifically alter the abundance of specific gene transcripts/proteins within the placenta, beginning at 9 d of gestation (dGA). Our lentiviral-mediated approach limits the RNAi to the trophectoderm derivatives of the placenta. Initially we used this approach to determine the importance of PRR15 and LIN28 during the establishment of pregnancies, but turned our efforts towards combining in vivo RNAi with steady-state physiological assessments during late gestation to examine the function of genes involved in placental nutrient transport (SLC2A3) and placenta derived hormones (CSH). By creating a placental deficiency in SLC2A3, not only was the fetus smaller and hypoglycemic at mid-gestation, but by interfering with placental glucose uptake, maternal hormone concentrations were also impacted, yet near-term, a distinctly different phenotype was present. For the placental hormone CSH (a.k.a. placental lactogen), CSH RNAi not only impacts placental and fetal growth, but also reductions in uterine blood flow, nutrient fluxes to the fetus, and produces an altered hormonal environment. Combining these methodological approaches provides new and often unexpected insights into the physiological integration of the maternal, placental and fetal compartments.
