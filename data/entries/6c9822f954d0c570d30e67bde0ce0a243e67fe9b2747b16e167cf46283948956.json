{"title":"Anticancer Activities of Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) Testa Extract in Combination With Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil Against Cholangiocarcinoma Cells In Vitro and in Mouse Xenograft Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0656/v1","date":1720526326000,"content":"Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with limited treatment options. Current therapies, such as cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), often cause side effects and drug resistance. This study investigated a potential new approach by combining a peanut skin extract (KK4-PSE) with these drugs. The extract effectively inhibited the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells in laboratory studies and showed even greater selectivity for cancer cells compared to healthy cells. When combined with cisplatin or 5-FU, KK4-PSE enhanced the drugs' effects, leading to cell cycle arrest and increased cell death. These combined treatments also reduced levels of proteins that promote cancer cell survival. In animal models, KK4-PSE combined with 5-FU showed superior tumor suppression compared to the combination with cisplatin. Overall, these findings suggest that KK4-PSE may be a promising synergistic agent to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma, warranting further clinical investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c9822f954d0c570d30e67bde0ce0a243e67fe9b2747b16e167cf46283948956","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
