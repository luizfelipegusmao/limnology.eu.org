{"title":"Evaluation of Carbon Neutrality Capacity of Regional Construction Industry Based on the Entropy Weight TOPSIS Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1950/v1","date":1721814599000,"content":"This study examines the overall needs of the green construction scheme with ‘carbon neutrality’ as the centre in the Zhejiang provincial green development target area. By aggregating and organising the construction and development data of Zhejiang Province, the entropy weight TOPSIS model is formed according to the statistical modelling for quantitative examination of the data, and the scientific assessment scheme of ‘carbon neutrality’ in the regional construction industry of Zhejiang Province is developed. This study aids in completely exhibiting and dynamically understanding the advancement of the ‘carbon neutral’ capacity of the urban construction industry. The objective is to discover the weak link in the advancement of carbon neutrality in several regional construction industries, which is of great relevance for further examining and forecasting the strategic outlook of carbon neutrality and modifying the planning of carbon neutrality strategy in special regional construction industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"200a401b0dc3afcc4081987c23ef6b4cea49175dd844f09065ef695fe74587f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
