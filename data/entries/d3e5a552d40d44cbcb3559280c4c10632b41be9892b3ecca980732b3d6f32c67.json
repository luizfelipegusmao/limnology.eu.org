{"title":"Recalibration and Recommendation for the Prediction of the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) from Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0404/v1","date":1712325377000,"content":"The high reliable correlations between CBR and DCP in general proposed are presented in this paper. We analyzed the test data and correlations from many researchers to find the best equation for prediction the CBR from DCP test. The findings show that all correlations from existing paper are based on local material and cannot apply to soil in a different location in general purpose. New correlations between CBR and DCP were proposed and validated in this paper for general uses. The validation confirmed that these new correlations can predict well with higher R2.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3e5a552d40d44cbcb3559280c4c10632b41be9892b3ecca980732b3d6f32c67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
