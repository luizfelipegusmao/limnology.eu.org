The development of the cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) has enabled site-specific analysis in unique systems such as biological specimens, liquid-solid interfaces, and environmentally sensitive materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.985-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.985-B2\">2</a>]. Furthermore, this tool facilitates the implementation of specimen preparation techniques for high-resolution characterization with cryogenic scanning/transmission electron microscopy (cryo-S/TEM). Cryo-FIB lift-out specimen preparation is a powerful technique for researching these systems. However, successful <span>in situ</span> specimen manipulation is often challenging due to issues with specimen attachment, thermal stability, and the structural integrity of the specimen [<a href=\"#ozae044.985-B3\">3</a>]. The cryogenic <span>ex situ</span> lift out (cryo EXLO) technique has recently been developed to address these challenges and has successfully been applied to both soft matter organic polymers and biological vitreous materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.985-B4\">4</a>]. In this work, we demonstrate, through a combination of cryo-FIB thinning and EXLO manipulation, the preparation of high-quality, electron-transparent specimens of low-melting-point indium metal (mp=156.6Â°C).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0b40de8f41e03c75cef8a4c79a7ebd20ba97a9537288c64e8acf8efad1e8273e","category":"Environment"}
