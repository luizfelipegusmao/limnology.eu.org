However, a small proportion of the population were fully vaccinated in Benin (20.9%) and Senegal (7.6%) by December 2022. This study explores the determinants of intent to vaccinate. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study of 865 Beninese and 813 Senegalese aged 18 years and older. Marginal quota sampling by age, gender and region was adopted. Data collection, using a survey instrument based on the Random Digit Dialing method, was conducted from December 24, 2020, to January 16, 2021, in Senegal and from March 29 to May 14, 2021, in Benin. The questionnaire used the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Health Belief Model. The influence of factors was assessed using a structural equation model based on a diagonally weighted least squares estimator to account for ordered categorical data (Likert scales). In Benin and Senegal, the intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 is influenced by distinct factors. In Benin, social influence (β = 0.42, p = 0.003) and perception of vaccine safety (β = -0.53, p&lt;0.001) play pivotal roles, suggesting those socially influenced have a higher vaccination intention. In Senegal, vaccination intentions are primarily driven by positive attitudes towards the vaccine (β = 0.65, p = 0.013) and social influence (β = 0.25, p = 0.048). This underscores the importance of individual beliefs, personal perceptions, and supportive social contexts in decision-making. Notably, positive vaccination attitudes and perceptions in both countries are strongly tied to increased social influence. While nuances exist between Benin and Senegal regarding factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination intentions, both nations underscore the pivotal roles of social influence and individual vaccination perceptions. Emphasizing trust in vaccine safety and promoting positive attitudes through effective communication are crucial for enhancing vaccination uptake in these West African countries.","author":"Ibrahima Gaye","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"75168832e0de5ab0b82b38c1dcea0b644c2913e0d1ae9b0c5d5d11cfbc38e316","category":"Environment"}
