{"title":"Biomechanical Analysis of Rectus Femoris Kinesio Taping Effects on Stop Jump Task Performance Post-Muscle Fatigue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1513/v1","date":1726811328000,"content":"Objectives: This study examined the effects of kinesio tape (KT) on the rectus femoris muscle under pre- and post-fatigue conditions, with trained and novice participants. Methods: Nineteen male volunteers took part, and fatigue was assessed using the Borg CR10 Scale. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using Vicon MX13+ infrared cameras (250 Hz) and Kistler force platforms (1500 Hz), respectively. Visual 3D software analyzed the data, focusing on parameters like angular displacement, ground reaction forces (GRF), impulse, and joint moments during a stop-jump task. A two-way mixed-design ANOVA was used to assess group, fatigue, and KT effects. Results: The results showed significant differences in knee flexion range of motion (ROM), hip flexion moment, vertical impulse, and peak vertical GRF between pre- and post-fatigue conditions (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). The trained group exhibited less knee valgus ROM, higher hip flexion velocity at initial contact, and prolonged time to peak proximal tibia anterior shear force. Conclusions: KT application was found to reduce lower limb loading, improve force acceptance and joint stability, and alleviate fatigue-induced disparities. These findings highlight the potential of KT in enhancing lower limb strength and performance, particularly under fatigue.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0588f985fa4a17b6287d708749a14398002327ed1ad27800dbe56917832cd6cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
