{"title":"Ten-Year Response of Riparian-Associated Songbirds to Implementation of Streamside Management Zones in Watershed-Scale Harvests in the Appalachian Mountains","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/122/4/383/7664444?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Streamside management zones (SMZs) are regulated components of actively managed forests in the eastern United States, but width and overstory retention requirements vary widely among states. Within watershed-scale harvests, we evaluated the relative abundances of three riparian-associated songbirds (Acadian flycatcher, <span>Empidonax virescens</span>; blue-headed vireo, <span>Vireo solitarius</span>; and Louisiana waterthrush, <span>Parkesia motacilla</span>) near Appalachian headwater streams receiving three SMZ treatments representative of a range of current state SMZ regulations in the eastern United States. Prior to harvest, all species were relatively abundant near all stream types, including ephemerals. Abundances of all species were largely similar among SMZ treatments at 3 years and 10 years postharvest and were higher along streams with greater residual canopy cover within 100 m. Forested SMZs as prescribed by current regulations can sustain these species in managed forests up to 10 years postharvest, but abundance appears to be driven largely by canopy cover retention in adjacent stands. Managing habitat for riparian-associated songbirds in harvested watersheds will require expanding the extent of focus beyond the local stream corridor to include consideration of silvicultural systems that retain greater canopy cover in surrounding forests. Where conservation of riparian-associated songbirds is a management objective, SMZ protection should be extended to all streams.Study Implications: The results of this study suggest that forested streamside management zones (SMZs) mandated by contemporary best management practices (BMPs) in Kentucky and other eastern US states can sustain similar abundances of three riparian-associated songbirds in managed watersheds up to 10 years after harvest. Overstory retention in SMZs along perennial and intermittent streams is common across the eastern United States, but state BMPs rarely require retention along ephemeral streams. Target songbird species occupied forests along all stream types prior to harvest, and their postharvest abundances were positively associated with canopy retention within 100 m of streams. If long-term occupancy of managed stands by riparian-associated songbirds is an objective, we recommend using SMZs around all streams, including ephemerals, and implementing at least moderate-retention silvicultural systems in areas within 100 m of streams.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Forestry Current Issue","siteHash":"f325018648ab04fba35e6e1191e9c9d953f9458bd233a7a41545c2e465328e3b","entryHash":"f53db0acdc2e7e668550fb86d770f45f48949c672176152debe98755e620f5a8","category":"Environment"}
