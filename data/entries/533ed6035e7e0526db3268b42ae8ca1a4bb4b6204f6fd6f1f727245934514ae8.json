{"title":"Topological Analysis of Toroidal Genomes: Evolutionary Dynamics and Subspecies Formation Under Constant Mutation Rate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0084/v1","date":1722511332000,"content":"This study presents a novel approach to understanding evolutionary dynamics through topological analysis of genotypic structures. We model the genome of a simple organism as a topological torus undergoing mutations at a constant rate of 1% per generation. Employing persistent homology and other topological data analysis techniques, we investigate how these mutations influence the overall topology of the genomic structure over time. Our simulations reveal that specific critical mutations lead to significant changes in the homotopic and homologic properties of the torus. We interpret these topological shifts as potential markers for the formation of new subspecies. By identifying the precise points of topological \"breaks\" within the toroidal genomic representation, our model provides a quantitative framework for observing the incremental transformations that underpin major evolutionary developments. The results offer new insights into the thresholds of speciation and adaptation, demonstrating how gradual genetic changes can accumulate to produce qualitative shifts in organismal traits. This approach bridges the gap between microscopic genetic mutations and macroscopic evolutionary outcomes, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of evolutionary processes. Our findings have implications for various fields, including theoretical biology, genetic engineering, and conservation biology. The model provides a novel perspective on genetic resilience and adaptability, offering a foundation for future research on the relationship between genomic topology and evolutionary trajectories. It also emphasizes the innovative nature of the research and its potential impact on multiple fields of study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"533ed6035e7e0526db3268b42ae8ca1a4bb4b6204f6fd6f1f727245934514ae8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
