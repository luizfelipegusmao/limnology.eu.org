{"title":"Assessing Carbon Intensity of E-Fuels Production in European Countries: A Temporal Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2229/v1","date":1727573174000,"content":"The transport sector is heavily relying on the use of fossil fuels that are causing major environmental concerns. Solutions relying on the direct or indirect use of electricity, through e-fuels production, are emerging to power the transport sector. To ensure environmental benefits over this transition, an accurate estimation of the impact of the use of electricity is needed. This work presents a temporal analysis of carbon intensity of e-fuels using grid electricity in countries members of the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E). It also provides an estimation of the potential load factor for to produce low-carbon e-fuels according to the European Union legislative framework. This was achieved, building on top of the existing EcoDynElec tool, by developing EcoDynElec_xr a python tool enabling, with an hourly time resolution, the calculation, visualisation and the analysis of the historical time-series of electricity mix from the ENTSO-E. The results highlight that, in 2023, a minority of European countries were reaching low carbon intensity of electricity that enables the use of grid electricity for green electrolytic hydrogen production. The methodological hypothesis to consider the consumed electricity mix instead of the production mix, and the considered time step, are of paramount importance and drastically impact the potential load factor of green hydrogen production. The developed tool and calculated data are released under an open-source license to ensure transparency, results reproducibility, reuse on newer data, or for other purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29a9684a7ab4ec56be600f8956b7e4ba01ee10b3f94a87fb9fe73d0a04e7447b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
