With non-linearity, time delay and strong coupling data in cement production process, making it difficult to maintain stable control of the denitration system. However, excessive pursuit of denitration efficiency is often prone to large ammonia escape, causing environmental pollution. A multi-objective prediction model combining time series and a bi-directional long short-term memory network (MT-BiLSTM) is proposed to solve the data problem of the denitration system and achieve simultaneous prediction of NOx emission concentration and ammonia escape value. Based on this model, a model predictive control framework is proposed and a control strategy of denitration system with multi-index model predictive control (MI-MPC) is built based on neural networks. In addition, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm is used for rolling optimization to find the optimal solution and to obtain the best control variable parameters. The control method proposed has significant advantages over the traditional PID (proportional integral derivative) controller, with a 3.84% reduction in overshoot and a 3.04% reduction in regulation time. Experiments prove that the predictive control framework proposed in this paper has better stability and higher accuracy, with practical research significance.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"f90f947861a859c52ee6c8293fc962983f7fce8a7e7c948b6c3697781490efa3","category":"Environment"}
