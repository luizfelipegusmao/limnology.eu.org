{"title":"Modeling and Measurement of Tool Wear During Angular Positioning of a Round Cutting Insert of a Toroidal Milling Tool for Multi-axis Milling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2088/v1","date":1727334979000,"content":"The aim of this work is to propose an angular positioning solution for the round cutting insert of an indexable insert torus milling cutter, dedicated to the multi-axis milling process under HSM conditions. The solution was based on the development of a wear model using a nonlinear estimation method with an eigenfunction, the development of a tool life model taking into account parameter of the cutter blade working angle and the method of reference marking and insert mounting, as well as the measurement methodology. The own function adopted to approximate the wear of the tool over its useful life is adequate and provides a prediction accuracy of 90%. The developed procedure for angular positioning and measurement enables the entire cutting edge of the cutting blade to be fully used, so that the total lifespan of the tool as an indexable insert tool is significantly extended. In addition, the measured largest defect values between the worn cutting edge and the nominal outline of the insert indicate the location of “notching” type wear.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9977e0f1dc0d82ad59646c27a4a156d082fb471c19a941dd5eff88b23cb2c3a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
