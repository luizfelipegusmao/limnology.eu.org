{"title":"Rapid Freezing and Cryo-SEM–EDS Imaging of Foraminifera (Unicellular Eukaryotes) Using a Conductive Viscous Cryogenic Glue","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/359/7641387?rss=1","date":1712275200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Spatial distribution of water-soluble molecules and ions in living organisms is still challenging to assess. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) via cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) is one of the promising methods to study them without loss of dissolved contents. High-resolution cryo-SEM–EDS has challenges in sample preparation, including cross-section exposure and sample drift/charging due to insulative surrounding water. The former becomes problematic for large and inseparable organisms, such as benthic foraminifera, a unicellular eukaryote playing significant roles in marine ecosystems, which often exceed the size limit for the most reliable high-pressure freezing. Here we show graphite oxide dispersed in sucrose solution as a good glue to freeze, expose cross-section by cryo-ultramicrotome, and analyze elemental distribution owing to the glue's high viscosity, adhesion force, and electron conductivity. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the glue for cryo-SEM–EDS, deep-sea foraminifer <span>Uvigerina akitaensis</span> was sampled during a cruise and plunge frozen directly on the research vessel, where the liquid nitrogen supply is limited. The microstructures were preserved as faithfully in cryo-SEM images as those with the conventional resin-substituted transmission electron micrograph. We found elements colocalized within the cytoplasm originating from water-soluble compounds that can be lost with conventional dehydrative fixation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"eea5e223927a420c8d94528ea22d3b216ad278f3655fdf696dd5165dda32450f","category":"Environment"}
