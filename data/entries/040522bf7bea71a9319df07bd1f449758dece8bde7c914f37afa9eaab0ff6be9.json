{"title":"Dual role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen monoubiquitination in facilitating Fanconi anemia-mediated interstrand crosslink repair","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae242/7695717?rss=1","date":1718668800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway governs repair of highly genotoxic DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and relies on translesion synthesis (TLS). TLS is facilitated by REV1 or site-specific monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (PCNA-Ub) at lysine 164 (K164). A <span>PcnaK164R/K164R</span> but not <span>Rev1−/−</span> mutation renders mammals hypersensitive to ICLs. Besides the FA pathway, alternative pathways have been associated with ICL repair (<a href=\"#pgae242-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pgae242-B2\">2</a>), though the decision making between those remains elusive. To study the dependence and relevance of PCNA-Ub in FA repair, we intercrossed <span>PcnaK164R/+; Fancg−/+</span> mice. A combined mutation (<span>PcnaK164R/K164R; Fancg−/−</span>) was found embryonically lethal. RNA-seq of primary double-mutant (DM) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed elevated levels of replication stress-induced checkpoints. To exclude stress-induced confounders, we utilized a <span>Trp53</span> knock-down to obtain a model to study ICL repair in depth. Regarding ICL-induced cell toxicity, cell cycle arrest, and replication fork progression, single-mutant and DM MEFs were found equally sensitive, establishing PCNA-Ub to be critical for FA-ICL repair. Immunoprecipitation and spectrometry-based analysis revealed an unknown role of PCNA-Ub in excluding mismatch recognition complex MSH2/MSH6 from being recruited to ICLs. In conclusion, our results uncovered a dual function of PCNA-Ub in ICL repair, i.e. exclude MSH2/MSH6 recruitment to channel the ICL toward canonical FA repair, in addition to its established role in coordinating TLS opposite the unhooked ICL.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"040522bf7bea71a9319df07bd1f449758dece8bde7c914f37afa9eaab0ff6be9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
