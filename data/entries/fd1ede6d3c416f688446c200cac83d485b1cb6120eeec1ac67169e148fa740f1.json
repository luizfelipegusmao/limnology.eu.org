{"title":"Advances in the Synthesis of Graphene: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0582/v1","date":1715243745000,"content":"Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, has attracted tremendous attention due to its exceptional properties and diverse applications. Synthesis methods play a crucial role in tailoring graphene's properties for specific applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in graphene synthesis techniques, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), exfoliation, epitaxial growth, and chemical reduction. We discuss the principles, advantages, challenges, and applications associated with each method. Furthermore, emerging trends and future prospects in graphene synthesis are explored, with a focus on scalability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd1ede6d3c416f688446c200cac83d485b1cb6120eeec1ac67169e148fa740f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
