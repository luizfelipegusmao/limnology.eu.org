{"title":"Assessing Stability in Renewable Microgrid Using a Novel-Optimized Controller for PVBattery Based Micro Grid with Opal-RT Based Real-Time Validation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1311/v1","date":1721115162000,"content":"This paper focuses on distributed generation (DG) controller of a PV based Micro Grid. An independent DG controller (IDGC) is designed for PV applications to improve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in Micro Grid (MG). Extreme learning machine (ELM) based MPPT method exactly estimate the reference input of converter control. They are voltage and current at MPP. Feedback controls employ linear PI schemes or nonlinear, intricate techniques. Here the converter controller, IDGC is improved by measuring directly converter outputs like duty cycle. PWM index in a single DG PV-based MG. It introduces a fast learning Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) using Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse and an online-sequential ridge re method for robust CR estimation. The approach ensures the stability of the microgrid during PV uncertainties. Internal DG control approach (IDGC) improves the strength of the Micro Grid during, three-phase faults at load bus, partial shading, irradiance change, islanding operation and load change. The model is designed and simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK platform and some of the results are validated in hardware in simulation (HIL) platform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3320379ceb07338f6a0c79271c01225d317791535b15aa890a371bbc745fdf32","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
