{"title":"MRD in Acute Leukemias: Lessons Learned from Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1812/v1","date":1724719895000,"content":"Advances in molecular biology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have transformed the concept of minimal residual disease (MRD) from a philosophical idea into a measurable reality. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) led the way in this transformation, initially using PCR to detect MRD in patients in remission, and more recently, aiming to eliminate it entirely with modern treatment strategies. Along the way, we have gained valuable insights that, when applied to other forms of acute leukemia, hold the potential to significantly improve outcomes in these challenging diseases. In this review, we explore the current use of MRD in the management of acute leukemia and delve into the biological processes that contribute to MRD persistence, including its overlap with leukemia stem cells and the role of the bone marrow microenvironment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a05ec67a5504b8b68128781a37d6fe43ef2880e2d463a638fe41bb9b4f8a0159","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
