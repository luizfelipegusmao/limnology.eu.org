Based on the perspective of resources and capabilities, this paper uses the relevant data of 1588 listed companies in strategic emerging industries from 2011 to 2021 to study the differential impact of digital transformation on enterprise ESG performance, and further tests the mediating role of absorptive capacity and the moderating role of regional digital level. The research results indicate that: firstly, digital transformation of enterprises can positively promote the improvement of ESG performance; Secondly, there are significant differences in the impact of digital transformation on the ESG performance of enterprises in terms of property rights and industry characteristics. The ESG performance of state-owned enterprises and high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises is more sensitive to digital transformation; Thirdly, absorptive capacity plays a mediating role between digital transformation and corporate ESG performance; Fourthly, the positive regulation of regional digital level promotes the ESG performance of enterprises through digital transformation. The research conclusion is based on a digital perspective, providing relevant insights for improving the ESG performance of strategic emerging industry enterprises and expanding their ESG development paths.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84274e4dc425803dee4b51dab30cb07e4200f602d98cbb09ed083a552bdfc1fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
