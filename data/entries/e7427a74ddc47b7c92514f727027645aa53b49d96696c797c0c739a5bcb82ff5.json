{"title":"Seismic Response Characteristics of Utility Tunnels Crossing River Considering Hydrodynamic Pressure Effects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0480/v1","date":1728380194000,"content":"As a long lifeline system of buried structures, Utility tunnel (UT) is vulnerable to earthquake invading. For utility tunnels with inverted siphon arrangement crossing the river, the seismic response is more complex due to the basin effect of acceleration in the topography and the influence of fluctuating hydrodynamic pressure. Based on a UT project in Haikou, this paper studied seismic response of cast-in-place UT considering the coupled model of water-soil-tunnel structure on ABAQUS software. Herein, the dynamic fluctuation of hydrodynamic pressure is simulated using acoustic-solid interaction model. A viscoelastic artificial boundary was used to simulate the soil boundary effect, and seismic loads were equivalent to nodal forces. Considering seismic invading direction and varying water elevation, the paper investigates the dynamic response characteristics and damage mechanisms of river-crossing utility tunnels. The study shows that basin effects cause the different acceleration amplifying of the soil around the UT in different sections, and the greater damage to the tunnels in bidirectional seismic excitation, which the damage concentrated at the junction of the transition between the horizontal section and the vertical section; Bending moments and axial forces are the dominant mechanical behaviors along the axial direction; and the river water level change influences the internal distribution of the tunnels, showing a certain amount of energy dissipation and seismic damping effects. For the aseismic design of cross-river cast-in-place utility tunnels, bidirectional seismic calculations should be performed, and the influence of river hydrodynamic pressure should not be neglected.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7427a74ddc47b7c92514f727027645aa53b49d96696c797c0c739a5bcb82ff5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
