{"title":"Should I stay or should I go? Trafficking of plant extra-nuclear transcription factors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1524/7439555?rss=1","date":1704153600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>At the heart of all biological processes lies the control of nuclear gene expression, which is primarily achieved through the action of transcription factors (TFs) that generally contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to facilitate their transport into the nucleus. However, some TFs reside in the cytoplasm in a transcriptionally inactive state and only enter the nucleus in response to specific signals, which in plants include biotic or abiotic stresses. These extra-nuclear TFs can be found in the cytosol or associated with various membrane systems, including the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. They may be integral proteins with transmembrane domains or associate peripherally with the lipid bilayer via acylation or membrane-binding domains. Although over 30 plant TFs, most of them involved in stress responses, have been experimentally shown to reside outside the nucleus, computational predictions suggest that this number is much larger. Understanding how extra-nuclear TFs are trafficked into the nucleus is essential for reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks that govern major cellular pathways in response to biotic and abiotic signals. Here, we provide a perspective on what is known on plant extranuclear-nuclear TF retention, nuclear trafficking, and the post-translational modifications that ultimately enable them to regulate gene expression upon entering the nucleus.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"93910e232b9aeab1e5822a76dabd8f8240c819528956ed626b0cc3147f63e71d","category":"Environment"}
