{"title":"Instantaneous Action at a Distance and the Principle of Locality, a new Proposal about their Possible Connection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1741/v1","date":1714120028000,"content":"The interaction of matter when separated by a distance is a fundamental question, whether such interactions occur through instantaneous action at a distance or retarded action at a distance (principle of locality)? While the mainstream consensus favors the principle of locality, instantaneous action at a distance offers certain advantages. Previously, instantaneous action at a distance has been viewed as an appearance or representation from specific gauge choices of electromagnetic potentials (retarded). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines Weberâ€™s electrodynamics with the concept of vacuum polarization to explore a new possible connection between the two viewpoints: instantaneous action at a distance and the locality principle. This new approach aligns with the observation of locality in signal/energy propagation while retaining the notion of instantaneous action at a distance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b3a56a95f4392d26b1190ace28c9bb641016ddac650706171e269cb520b04c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
