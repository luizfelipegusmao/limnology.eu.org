{"title":"Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli with Analysis of Impact of Socio-Economic Factors in Low, Medium and High-Income Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1855/v1","date":1727173925000,"content":"Background: While mapping Escherichia coli susceptibility in community acquired simple UTIs across 38 centres, DASH to Protect Antibiotics, (https://dashuti.com/), a multiregional study also assessed impact of socio-economic conditions and climate on antimicrobial susceptibility. Methods: The centres were located in the Indian subcontinent, Middle East, North and West Africa, Eurasia, Europe, and North America. Harmonic means were used for comparative analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli in simple cystitis. Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized to compare susceptibility means between the antimicrobials and the GDP. A two-way ANOVA to simultaneously analyzed the impact of the antimicrobials and GDP on the proportion of susceptible E. coli while adjusting for variables (low and high temperature, humidity and population density per sqkm). Findings: Antimicrobial susceptibility varied between regions and within large countries like India and Pakistan. Nitrofurantoin (89%) and fosfomycin (96%) emerged as the most effective antimicrobials. In majority of the centres, susceptibility to other oral antimicrobials was low: cotrimoxazole.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5b020446b1361ec6b1df0ad29a2115bae7f9ab2f9e96b1a344c42507ed13a5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
