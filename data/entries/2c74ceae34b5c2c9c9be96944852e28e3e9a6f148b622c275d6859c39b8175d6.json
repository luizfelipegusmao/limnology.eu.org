{"title":"Exploring the Relationship Between Fundamental Movement Skills and Health-Related Fitness Among First and Second Graders in Korea: Implications for Childhood Health Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0232/v1","date":1719958938000,"content":"This study investigated the relationship between fundamental movement skills (FMSs) and health-related fitness (HRF) among first and second graders in South Korean elementary schools. It aimed to provide foundational data for developing physical education programs tailored to the motor development stages and fitness levels of younger elementary school students. In October 2023, FMSs (jumping, running, hopping, static balance, dynamic balance, overhand throwing, and kicking) and HRF (muscular strength, cardiorespiratory endurance, and flexibility) were evaluated among 291 first and second graders. The collected data were analyzed through frequency and multiple regression analyses performed using the SPSS software. The results revealed that higher scores in jumping and hopping are associated with greater muscular strength, cardiorespiratory endurance, and flexibility. Running had no significant effect on HRF elements. Higher scores in static balance (single-leg stance) were associated with increased muscular strength, cardiorespiratory endurance, and flexibility, but dynamic balance (balance beam walking) did not have a significant effect. Higher scores in overhand throwing were associated with greater muscular strength and cardiorespiratory endurance, but kicking did not show a significant association. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of prioritizing jumping and static balance in physical education for the well-rounded health development of first and second graders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c74ceae34b5c2c9c9be96944852e28e3e9a6f148b622c275d6859c39b8175d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
