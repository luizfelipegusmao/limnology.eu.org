{"title":"Measure the Dental Chamber Volume with DICOM Images from Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Can Be Improved with a Simple Algorithm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0978/v1","date":1715761569000,"content":"The knowledge of the precise anatomy and dimensions of the pulp chamber in the different teeth allows the odontologist to perform correct diagnosis, as well as treatment planning and moni-toring. The clinical practice has introduced cone-beam computed tomography (CB-CT) as a method to evaluate the morphology and dimensions of the pulp chamber. Nevertheless, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is regarded as the gold standard in approaching those topics. Here we have designed an algorithm that takes as input DICOM images from in vivo CB-CT of permanent molars to determine the accuracy CB-CT for evaluation of pulp chamber volume. The values were compared with those from in vivo CB-CT (rough and expert manipulated) and ex vivo micro-CT. The relative errors obtained with the volume calculated by the algorithm vs. the volume measured by micro-CT do not exceed 5.7%; also, no significant differences were found between algorithm volumes vs. manipulated CB-CT volumes while all volumes were different from those obtained with automatic CB-CT software. These data demonstrate that volume algorithm CB-CT based may be a reliable technique for evaluation of the pulp chamber volume in permanent molars and can be useful in the diagnosis of pulp diseases, as well as in the planning and monitoring of their treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c16d49c63bfa2485b4161c35c09c06066e43a5f0f929b73e5ddc0881411cb42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
