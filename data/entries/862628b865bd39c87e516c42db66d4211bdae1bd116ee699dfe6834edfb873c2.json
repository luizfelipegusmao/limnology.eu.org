{"title":"PSVI-1 Supplemented milk replacer improves feed transition of dairy bull-calves","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/542/7757635?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Neonatal calves are affected by pathogenic infections, compounded by stress, leading to enteric and respiratory disorders accounting for about 7.8% mortality rate and annual treatment costs exceeding $250 million. Federal restrictions on antibiotic use due antimicrobial resistance in humans has opened the door for viable alternatives like rumen enhancements which have been reported to aid the establishment of beneficial rumen flora leading to improved health and performance. It is hypothesized that nutritional formulation of milk replacers to help the calf prevent or cope with diarrhea can provide a leeway that will ensure better animal performance and transition to solid feed. The objective of study was to evaluate the performance of dairy bull-calves fed nutritionally supplemented milk replacers. Three milk replacers were tested with or without supplementation of metabolic enhancements (Control: no metabolic enhancer; Added: milk replacer with metabolic enhancer added at the time of mixing milk in shuttle; Composite: produced along with metabolic enhancer. Dairy bull-calves (n = 60; 2 to 5 d-old) were grouped into three treatments of milk replacers. The study lasted for 10 wk; 6 wk of milk-feeding and 4 wk of calf starter feeding. Body weights (BW) were taken on a weekly basis, while calf starter intake was measured daily and data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Calves fed milk replacer with composite metabolic enhancer recorded the greatest intake and final BW over the 10-wk period. Calves fed milk replacer with added metabolic enhancer at the point of milk mixing recorded the poorest data in terms of BW gain and final BW. Calves fed metabolic enhancer, either added or composite recorded a better weaning and transition to solid feed from milk feeding. Calves fed control milk replacer experienced a poor transition from milk feeding to solid feed. It is concluded that composited rumen metabolite enhancers in milk replacer supported greater starter intake, average daily gain and better transition of calves to solid feed, and is recommended for the feeding of neonatal calves.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"862628b865bd39c87e516c42db66d4211bdae1bd116ee699dfe6834edfb873c2","category":"Environment"}
