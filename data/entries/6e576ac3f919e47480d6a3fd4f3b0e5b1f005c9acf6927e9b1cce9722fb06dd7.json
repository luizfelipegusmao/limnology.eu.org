{"title":"Effects of Training through Induced Variability on Performance in the Forehand Approach Shot in Tennis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0926/v2","date":1714384021000,"content":"(1) Background: Learning and training in variable conditions favors adapting to unstable or changing environments. The aim of the study was to test the effect of variable practice on the accuracy of the forehand net approach shot in tennis.; (2) Methods: Thirty (n=30) first-class national players (12.9 Â± 1.1 years old) participated, divided into three groups: i) induced variability training (n=10) (varying court surfaces and balls), ii) specific training (n=10) and iii) usual training -control group- (n=10). All groups trained for a month: 12 sessions of 20 minutes -3 per week-. The accuracy of the shots were analyzed through a 2D capture and digitization process of the ball bounce on the court; (3) Results: The variability group presented better accuracy values after the period without practice than the stable training group (p = 0.041; ES= 0.51).; (4) Conclusions: the application of variability in the game conditions during tennis training seems to have a favorable effect on the retention of accuracy in the forehand down the line approach to the net.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e576ac3f919e47480d6a3fd4f3b0e5b1f005c9acf6927e9b1cce9722fb06dd7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
