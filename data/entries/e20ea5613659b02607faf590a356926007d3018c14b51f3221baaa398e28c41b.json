{"title":"Strategic Advances in Combination Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Current Insights and Future Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2024/v1","date":1724834498000,"content":"The contemporary treatment for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) has evolved significantly, building on successes in managing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone has long been the cornerstone of mCSPC treatment, combination therapies have emerged as the new standard of care based on recent advances, offering improved survival outcomes. Landmark phase 3 trials demonstrated that adding chemotherapy (docetaxel) and androgen receptor pathway inhibitors to ADT significantly enhances overall survival, particularly for patients with high-volume, high-risk, or de novo metastatic disease. Despite these advancements, a concerning gap between evidence-based guidelines and real-world practice remains, with many patients not receiving recommended combination therapies. The challenge in optimizing therapy sequences, considering both disease control and treatment burdens, and identifying clinical and biological subgroups that could benefit from personalized treatment strategies remains. The advent of triplet therapy has shown promise in extending survival, but the uro-oncology community must narrow the gap between evidence and practice to deliver the most effective care. Current research is focused on refining treatment approaches and utilizing biomarkers to guide therapy selection, aiming to offer more personalized and adaptive strategies for mCSPC management. Thus, aligning clinical practices with the evolving evidence is urgently needed to improve outcomes for patients facing this incurable disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e20ea5613659b02607faf590a356926007d3018c14b51f3221baaa398e28c41b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
