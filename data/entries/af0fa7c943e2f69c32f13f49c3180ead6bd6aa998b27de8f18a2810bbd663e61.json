{"title":"Will &ldquo;Seeking Pleasure&rdquo; Definitely &ldquo;Sap One&rsquo;s Spirit?&rdquo;: Impacts of Mobile Phone Addiction on Research Self-Efficacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2246/v1","date":1725267073000,"content":"With Generation Z youths growing up with the Internet, the problem of mobile phone addiction is becoming increasingly worse. This paper administered questionnaires based on measures such as the Mobile Phone Addiction Index Scale, Research Self-Efficacy Scale, The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and Stress Mindset Measure. The survey targeted 2,278 graduate students and explored the mechanism of mobile phone addiction on their research self-efficacy (RSE). The results revealed that such addiction has significant negative effects on self-efficacy, with mental stress playing a mediating role in this process. That is, mobile phone addiction lowers RSE by increasing mental stress. Meanwhile, the aforementioned negative impacts caused by addiction can be moderated through stress mindsets: the “stress-is-enhancing” mindset reduces the negative effects of addiction on scientific RSE, whereas the “stress-is-debilitating” mindset amplifies these negative effects by enhancing the mediating effect of mental stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af0fa7c943e2f69c32f13f49c3180ead6bd6aa998b27de8f18a2810bbd663e61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
