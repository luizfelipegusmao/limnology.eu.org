{"title":"Global issues in aquaculture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/af/article/14/4/3/7749994?rss=1","date":1725494400000,"content":"<span>Periodically, the World Association of Animal Production (WAAP) commissions a special Animal Frontiers issue on global matters; in this issue, the spotlight is on aquaculture. Aquaculture, or the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and aquatic plants, is important both now and into the future for several key reasons. Aquaculture will be critical to meeting the global food demand as the human population is projected to reach 10 billion by 2050. This rising population in the face of limiting terrestrial resources will place increasing pressure on food production systems, and aquaculture offers a means of providing a significant source of protein-rich food, supplementing wild-caught fisheries, which are often overexploited. Fish and seafood are important sources of essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, which benefit human health. Aquaculture can help meet the growing demand for these nutrients sustainably and, if practised responsibly, offers an opportunity to ensure food security and stability. Aquaculture can adapt to different environmental conditions and is less vulnerable to climate change than traditional agriculture. Species can be selected and managed to thrive in varying water temperatures and conditions. However, the aquaculture industry faces significant challenges and opportunities, some of which are highlighted in the following issue of <span>Animal Frontiers</span>. The need for further research and innovation in aquaculture practices is not just a suggestion but a necessity for the future of our food production systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Animal Frontiers Current Issue","siteHash":"d2ebbba5d44268c4d5ae0a0fd5e2619282136fd9be49453f0fee01876d4d13af","entryHash":"364ae7dc73427531df1dd4b36769de74a21168adc9dbc1cd2cd8845a9050445a","category":"Environment"}
