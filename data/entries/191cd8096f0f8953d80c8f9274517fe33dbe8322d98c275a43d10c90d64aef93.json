{"title":"Safety awareness and adaptation strategies of Nigerian construction workers in extreme heat conditions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000380","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Haruna Musa Moda, Mahmud Bello Zailani, Ravi Rangarajan, Pauline Hickey, Mu’awiya Abubakar, Joy Maina, Yahaya Ibrahim Makarfi</p>\r\n\r\nThe nature of most construction activities exposes workers to health and safety risks associated with extreme hot weather conditions especially within developing countries in the global south. Considering the magnitude of health and safety risks associated with extreme heat exposure and the prevailing safety culture, and attitude among workers that impede adaptation to safe work practices under extreme heat conditions, it is imperative that serious attention is given to workplace climate change impact on construction workers. The current study provides empirical evidence on safety awareness and practices among Nigerian construction workers, those often exposed to extreme hot weather conditions. A structured questionnaire was used to elicit data from 576 respondents using random sampling technique and the data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical tools. As part of the study outcome, 57.3% of the respondents raised concerns regarding the non-availability of potable water source on sites, which directly impacts their level of fluid intake while working in extreme heat conditions. To improve safety and enhance productivity, construction organisations need to prioritise workers’ safety through the implementation of sustainable adaptive strategies that include the development of early warning systems related to heat stress at work, development of tailored intervention and adaptive measures and enhancement of heat stress awareness among workers. The study provides evidence on the impact of heat stress among construction workers and the need to improve safety awareness and mitigation against climate change driven extreme heat conditions especially among workers in tropical countries.","author":"Haruna Musa Moda","siteTitle":"PLOS Climate","siteHash":"ab511bb583c9cc103fc6bd74737f07eb1311e1e62c758b30431d090c3da71072","entryHash":"191cd8096f0f8953d80c8f9274517fe33dbe8322d98c275a43d10c90d64aef93","category":"Environment"}
