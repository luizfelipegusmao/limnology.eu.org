{"title":"499 Effect of adding plant extracted hydrolysable tanning and saponin combination to prairie blend pelleted feed products on accumulative gas production kinetics and methane emission in ruminant systems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/140/7757436?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objectives of this study were to study the effect of adding plant extracted hydrolysable tanning (HT) and saponin (S) combination as a combined phytochemical feed additive (HTS) on in vitro accumulative gas production kinetics and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission of blend pelleted feed products in ruminant systems. Four combination levels [0 (control), 1.5 (1% HT + 0.5% S), 3 (2% HT + 1%S), 4.5 (3% HT + 1.5% S)] were added to canola meal and pea mixtures with two different ratios (CMP1: 50:50; CMP2: 70:30) which were used to make Prairie blend pellet feed products. The accumulative gas production kinetics and CH<sub>4</sub> were determined using in vitro systems. The ruminal fluid was obtained from rumen fistulated lactation dairy cows. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with the HTS level as a fixed effect and in vitro run with fistulated animals as a random effect. The data were analyzed using SAS Mixed Procedure. Polynomial contract was used to determine linear and quadratic relationship. The results showed that adding HTS level linearly reduced asymptotic production a) from 110.5 to 82.7 mL/g DM (<span>P</span> = 0.043) and average production at one-half of asymptotic production (AP) from 11.9 to 9.5 mL (<span>P</span> = 0.069) without significantly affecting gas production fractional rate (c, %/h) with an average of 0.58 ± 0.49 %/h and lag time with an average of 1.95 ± 0.50 h. As to CH<sub>4</sub> emission at different incubation times, the result showed that at short incubation times (2 h, 4 h, 12 h), adding HTS had numerically reduced methane emission (CH4) from 2.77 to 0.98 mL/g (at 2 h) and 4.39 to 1.38 mL/g (at 4 h). with increasing HTS level, CH<sub>4</sub> was significantly quadratically reduced (<span>P</span> = 0.028) at 12 h incubation time from 8.31 to 5.76 mL/g. After long incubation (24 h), adding HTS did not have significant impact on CH<sub>4</sub>. In conclusion, adding HTS to prairie blend pellet feed products significantly affected gas production kinetics (the asymptotic production and average production at one-half of asymptotic production). Adding HTS had an increased potential to decrease CH<sub>4</sub> emission at short incubation times.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4c3efd8287509c61eea5814bb819ff3c6cd50c1824209828ebd421cc8ab6ca14","category":"Environment"}
