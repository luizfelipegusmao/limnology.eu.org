{"title":"Cross-country Ski Skating Style Sub-techniques Detection and Skiing Characteristic Analysis on Snow Using High Precision GNSS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1487/v1","date":1724207143000,"content":"The comprehensive analysis of cross-country skiing races is a pivotal step in establishing effective training objectives and tactical strategies. This study aimed to establish a method for the classifi-cation of sub-techniques and analyzing skiing characteristics during cross-country skiing skating style timed races on snow using high-precision kinematic GNSS devices. The study involved at-taching GNSS devices to the heads of two athletes during skating style timed races on cross-country ski courses. These devices provided precise positional data and recorded vertical and hor-izontal head movements and ground over velocity (VOG). Sub-techniques were classified by de-fining waveform patterns for G2, G3, G4, and G6 based on these data. The validity of classifica-tion was verified by comparing GNSS data with video analysis, a process that yielded classifica-tion accuracies ranging from 94.0% to 99.3% for G2, G3, G4, and G6. Notably, G4 emerged as the fastest technique, with sub-technique selection varying among skiers and being influenced by skiing velocity and course inclination. The study's findings have practical implications for ath-letes and coaches, as they demonstrate that high-precision kinematic GNSS devices can accurate-ly classify sub-techniques and detect skiing characteristics during skate-style cross-country skiing races, thereby providing valuable insights for training and strategy development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24df4953c8f55c9bb25a7ec86f3696e7dad59fe96a59543be712ac75ecb52ae7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
