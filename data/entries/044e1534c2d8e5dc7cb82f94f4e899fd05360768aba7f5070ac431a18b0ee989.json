{"title":"Study on the Equivalent Density Tool and Depressurization Mechanism of Suction-Type Depressurization Cycle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0655/v1","date":1720441022000,"content":"In order to further control the equivalent circulating density,a new type of annular pres-sure-reducing downhole tool for high temperature and high pressure wells-liquid-absorbing ECD tool is designed.Through this tool,the bottom hole pressure of the equivalent circulating drilling fluid can be close to its hydrostatic pres-sure,therebyachieving a deeper drilling depth.The tool is mainly composed of screw mo-tor,vortex blade,annular seal,universal joint and drill string.Its working principle is mainly to use the liquid absorption effect of the tool and the hydraulic energy of the circu-lating fluid extracted by the screw motor to convert it into mechanical energy,and to gen-erate suction force to improve the flow energy of the drilling fluid in the bottom hole an-nulusand reduce the equivalent circulation density.Based on ANSYS-FLUENT analysis andsimulation,the change of pressure drop characteristics under different drilling fluid density,displacement and tool size was simulated.The simulation results show that thedepressurization effect is 1.0MPa when the drilling fluid density is 1.2g/cm3. When the drilling fluid density is 1.5g/cm3,the depressurization is about 1.7MPa,and when thedrill-ing fluid density is 1.8g/cm3,the depressurization is about 1.9MPa.When the drilling fluid density is 2.0g/cm3,the pressure drop is about 2.3MPa.When the flow rate is from 1500-2500L/min,the maximum pressure can be reduced by 2.3MPa.When the viscosity is 40mPa•S and 60mPa•S,the pressure drop almost does not change.The increase of viscosi-ty has little effect on the pressure drop,and it is mainly affected by the flow rate under equal displacement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"044e1534c2d8e5dc7cb82f94f4e899fd05360768aba7f5070ac431a18b0ee989","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
