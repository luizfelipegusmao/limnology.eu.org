{"title":"A Novel Spectral Density Function Validation for Besselâ€™s Equation in L-N Form","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0060/v1","date":1725271555000,"content":"In the 2014 paper by C. Fulton, D. Pearson, and S. Pruess [7], a new characterization of the spectral density function is given for a Sturm-Liouville equation.  These authors provide spectral theory showing that the Appell system, a companion linear system of ordinary differential equations, can be utilized to obtain a spectral density function.  Though this new method is both elegant for its simplicity and fully viable (as is shown in this work), it has largely been ignored in the literature since its discovery.  To motivate greater attention towards this new theory, and its potential applications, work is given here by this author demonstrating a nontrivial example of this new spectral method being applied towards the Bessel Equation in its Liouville-Normal (L-N) form.  Validations of results obtained in this paper are also given, showing full agreement with the classical results obtained by E.C. Titchmarsh in [11].","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6590005fffc892aa6b50f4108c248915157a263c5ca1c78e334dbf9b79fc2a9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
