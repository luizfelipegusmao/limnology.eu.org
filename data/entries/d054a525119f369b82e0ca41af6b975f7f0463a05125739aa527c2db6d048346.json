{"title":"Relaxing Effect of 8-Methoxycirsilineol Extracted (Larrea tridentata) by Potassium Channels Depend-Voltage Activation on Vascular Smooth Muscle from Guinea Pig","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0560/v1","date":1720425911000,"content":"Larrea tridentata is an endemic plant from the Mexican highlands used in traditional medicine to treat hypertension and kidney stones, among many ailments. This study evaluated a vasorelaxant compound: 5- Hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-6,7,8-trimethoxy-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (also known as 8-Methoxycirsilineol: 8-M) which we purified from an extract of this plant. Mesenteric artery rings were isolated from male guinea pigs for isometric force measurements. Freshly isolated smooth muscle cells from mesenteric artery were used for ionic current measurement for calcium and potassium. 10 μM 8-M completely relaxed vascular rings contracted with phenylephrine in a dose-dependent fashion with an EC50 = 4.26 ± 1.16 10-6 M and 4.56 ± 1.64 10-6 M   for endothelium intact and endothelium-free tissue, respectively. The relaxant effect of 8-M was not affected by maximal doses of nifedipine, verapamil or iberiotoxin. Nevertheless, the relaxant effect was partially abolished by addition of 10 mM Tetraethylammonium (TEA). In accordance to this, calcium currents evoked by depolarization were not affected by 8-M, whereas TEA-sensitive potassium currents, were increased upon its addition. Vasorelaxation due to 8-M is partly due to activation of KV currents in an endothelium independent mode.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d054a525119f369b82e0ca41af6b975f7f0463a05125739aa527c2db6d048346","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
