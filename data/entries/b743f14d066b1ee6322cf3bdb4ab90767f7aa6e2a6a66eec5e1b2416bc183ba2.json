It is most widely used to functionally deactivate genes by targeted mutation, something that would be classified as a pre-translational strategy. However, a powerful alternative to attenuate or eliminate gene functions at the post-translational stage is the targeted degradation of a protein of interest.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"b743f14d066b1ee6322cf3bdb4ab90767f7aa6e2a6a66eec5e1b2416bc183ba2","category":"Environment"}
