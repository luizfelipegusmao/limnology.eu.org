{"title":"Adapting and Verifying the Liming Index for Enhanced Rock Weathering Minerals as an Alternative Liming Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2459/v1","date":1727746419000,"content":"Acidic soils limit plant nutrient availability, leading to deficiencies and reduced crop yields. Agricultural liming agents address these issues and are crucial for deploying silicate amendments used in enhanced rock weathering (ERW) for carbon sequestration and emission reduction. Grower recommendations for liming agents are based on the liming index (LI), which combines the neutralizing value (NV) and fineness rating (FR) to predict a mineralâ€™s acidity neutralization relative to pure calcite. However, the LI was originally developed for carbonate minerals, and its applicability to silicates remains uncertain, with studies often yielding inconclusive results on soil carbon and liming efficiency. This study aims to evaluate the liming efficiency of silicates. We determined the LI of five candidate ERW minerals (basalt, olivine, wollastonite, kimberlite, and montmorillonite) and compared them to pure calcite. Post-NV acid digestion, we characterized the minerals and soils, applying nonparametric statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Kendall) to correlate liming results with LI, dosage, and amendment methods. We developed an empirical model incorporating mineralogy and kinetics to explain silicate behavior in liming, considering soil, climate, and crop factors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"755b0c778a9db9243965e6c04430e64159e16c6c68be86f8552209d478a49f1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
