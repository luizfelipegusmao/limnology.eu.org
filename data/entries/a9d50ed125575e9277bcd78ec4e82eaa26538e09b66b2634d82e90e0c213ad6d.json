{"title":"Incorporating Waste Materials into Concrete: Opportunities and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1799/v1","date":1719363687000,"content":"It is estimated that 3 billion tons of concrete are used globally each year. Cement is a critical component of concrete, and its production accounts for nearly 5-7% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Producing one ton of concrete (OPC) releases approximately one ton of CO2. These CO2 emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming, polar ice cap melting, sea level rise, coastal city flooding, land desertification, decreased agricultural productivity, ecosystem damage, and adverse effects on human health. This situation is concerning, and there is an urgent need to minimize CO2 emissions from the cement industry. This paper focuses on incorporating various materials into concrete to increase its strength and reduce emissions of CO2 and other harmful substances, thereby mitigating the impacts of the greenhouse effect and achieving the great vision of carbon neutrality. The study theoretically analyzes the issues of coconut shell disposal in Southeast Asia and waste tire disposal in Europe and the United States. This paper uses Abaqus to model and analyze various green concretes and compares the data with that of ordinary concrete.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9d50ed125575e9277bcd78ec4e82eaa26538e09b66b2634d82e90e0c213ad6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
