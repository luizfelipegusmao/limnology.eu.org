{"title":"ZEMELA - Smart Software Platform for Small Vegetable Farms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0854/v1","date":1712917306000,"content":"This article summarizes the results of a research conducted to create an intelligent platform supporting small farmers growing vegetables. In Bulgaria, many farmers use relatively small areas for their production. Considering this situation, the platform is designed for regional use, trying to make maximum use of the specific climatic features of the monitored microdistrict. Consequently, special attention is paid to the possibilities of adapting the platform to the specific environment in which the observed plants grow. Thus, the platform is implemented as an agent-oriented system providing needed flexibility. The core of the platform is a personal assistant, which is responsible for tracking the vegetation cycle of the monitored crop and, upon detection of anomalies, preparing warnings to the farmer. The general architecture of the platform is also presented. In a distributed knowledge base, agriculture-specific knowledge are stored. Furthermore, a standardized interface for receiving data from the sensor networks located in the production areas is briefly described. Currently, the platform is being tested for monitoring four varieties of tomatoes grown on the territory of the national research center for potato breeding. Special attention is paid to the measurements carried out. Conclusions have been drawn that will help improve the platform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a6d635dbb1c3c8a16ee46c4c6f0b5070477c54ef810adbd5b6d30b7ed06e76a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
