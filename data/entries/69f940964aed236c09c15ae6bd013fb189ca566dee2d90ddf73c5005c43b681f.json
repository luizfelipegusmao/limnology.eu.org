{"title":"Six Dimension for Proof of Riemann Hypothesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1612/v2","date":1724634083000,"content":"In this paper, Riemann’s hypothesis is proved based on the gloden ratio and eccentricity of the ellipse in six dimensions. The proof of Riemann’s hypothesis affects all fields of science. In this article, logical and mathematical rules are proposed for the distribution, identification and classification of prime numbers. The prime numbers are the product of the complex conjugate of five prime numbers in dimensions. Also, even numbers and... are also classified based on prime numbers. Based on the findings of this research, identifying the properties and laws related to prime numbers establishes a deep connection between quantum mechanics and general relativity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69f940964aed236c09c15ae6bd013fb189ca566dee2d90ddf73c5005c43b681f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
