{"title":"Sodium Alginate/MXene Based Flexible Humidity Sensors with High-Humid Durability and Application Potentials in Breath Monitoring and Non-Contact Human-Machine Interface","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2110/v1","date":1727400170000,"content":"Flexible humidity sensors (FHS) with fast response and durability to high-humidity environment are highly desirable for practical applications. Herein, an FHS based on crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) and MXene was fabricated, which exhibited high sensitivity (impedance varied from 107 to 105 Î© between 10% and 90% RH), good selectivity, prompt response (response/recover time of 4 s/11 s), high sensing linearity (R2 = 0.992) on a semi-logarithmic scale, relatively small hysteresis (~5% RH), good repeatability, and good resistance to high humid environment (negligible change in sensing properties after placed in 98% RH over 24 h). It is proposed that the formation of crosslinking structure of SA and introduction of MXene with good conductivity and high specific surface area contributed to the high performance of the composite FHS. Moreover, the FHS could promptly differentiate respiration status, recognize speech and measure fingertip movement, indicating potentials in breath monitoring and non-contact human-machine interactions. This work provides guidance for developing advanced flexible sensors with wide application scope in wearable electronics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ca21c974c3c58f7f1f66accf27eeedbc4b7222efac80003e878322a6ee9b2fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
