{"title":"Implementing Tri-brid Energy Systems for Renewable Integration in Southern Alberta, Canada","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1277/v1","date":1711018721000,"content":"The steep decline in the price of wind and solar photovoltaics provides a possibility to decarbonize electricity deeply and affordably. This study uses HOMER Pro energy modeling tool to model an optimized grid-connected renewable energy system for a community in southern Alberta, Canada. The study's goal is to identify the best renewable energy technology combinations that can provide electricity at the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and has lesser greenhouse gas emission as compared to the electricity produced by traditional fossil fuel. Gleichen, is a small town in southern Alberta and is near to numerous commercial wind and solar projects given the region’s high quality renewable resources. “Tri-brid” systems consisting of wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) are considered and compared based on electricity prices, net present cost, and greenhouse gas emissions savings. This tri-brid system is connected to the grid to sell excess electricity generated or buying electricity when there is less or no availability of solar and wind. The tri-brid energy system has an estimated LCOE of 0.0705 CAD/kWh which is competitive with the price of electricity generated by natural gas and coal  which is 0.127 CAD/kWh.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d449710990d67e81eecca69730d6aee3ed7089f82d95f207a09eb4bf27c803c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
