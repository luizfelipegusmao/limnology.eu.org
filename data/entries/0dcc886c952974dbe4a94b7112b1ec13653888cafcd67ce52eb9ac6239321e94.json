{"title":"Construction of Carbon Dioxide Responsive Graphene Point Imbibition and Drainage Fluid and Simulation of Imbibition Experiments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1780/v1","date":1724682683000,"content":"The global oil and gas exploration targets are gradually moving towards a new field of oil and gas accumulation with nano pore throats, ranging from millimeter scale to micro nano pore throats.There are difficulties in fluid transport in nano confined pore throats, such as strong adsorption, which greatly increases the difficulty of starting crude oil.Therefore, it is necessary to construct a nanoscale fluid with strong diffusion and dispersion, and improve its permeability, suction, and displacement capabilities.This article develops a carbon dioxide responsive graphene dot type surfactant.By characterizing its structure, physical and chemical properties, and conducting infiltration simulation experiments, its infiltration and drainage ability in nanopore throats is elucidated.Infrared spectrum measurement shows that after functional modification exhibit new characteristic peaks at 1600 cm-1 to 1300 cm-1, considering the N-H plane stretching characteristic peak.The fluorescence spectra showed that the fluorescence intensity of F-GQDs was increased after functional modification, which indicated that F-GQDs was successfully synthesized.Through measurements of interfacial activity and adhesion work calculations, the oil-water interfacial tension can achieve ultra-low values within the range of 10-2 to 10-3 mN/m. Oil sand cleaning experiments and indoor simulations of spontaneous imbibition in tight cores demonstrate that F-GQDs exhibit effective oil washing capabilities and a strong response to carbon dioxide. When combined with carbon dioxide, the system enhances both the rate and efficiency of oil washing.Imbibition recovery can reach more than 50%.The research results provide a certain theoretical basis and data reference for the efficient development of tight reservoirs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0dcc886c952974dbe4a94b7112b1ec13653888cafcd67ce52eb9ac6239321e94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
