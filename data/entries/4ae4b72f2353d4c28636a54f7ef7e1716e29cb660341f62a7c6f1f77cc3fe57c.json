{"title":"Industrial prospects on regulatory gaps and barriers in pharmaceutical exports and their counteraction: Local experiential with global implication","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305989","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Zobia Mubarak, Nasir Abbas, Furqan Khurshid Hashmi, Hina Shahbaz, Nadeem Irfan Bukhari</p>\r\nBackground <p>The pharmaceutical sector in Pakistan has grown over a period with export potential, however, there are certain barriers in the framework that regulate the growth and export of domestically manufactured pharmaceuticals. The purpose of this study was to highlight the current challenges that hinder the export of pharmaceuticals, especially to the countries with stringent regulatory authorities (SRA), as perceived by the domestic pharmaceutical industry experts, and to highlight the facilitators that may help to resolve the identified challenges.</p> Methods <p>In a qualitative study, the data were collected from the consented experts from the pharmaceutical industries in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta. Industrial experts with a minimum of 10 years of experience and who were serving at managerial levels or above were recruited through purposive sampling. The semi-structured interviews were conducted for the collection of data from industrial experts. Thematic content analysis was applied to conclude the data.</p> Results <p>Data analysis generated 4 themes and 16 codes. The export of pharmaceuticals, despite having greater potential was regarded as poor, which was attributed to the following: (a) inadequate industrial research and development, particularly on new molecules (b) non-compliance with the cGMP standards, (c) absence of high-tech equipment, (d) unwillingness of the pharmaceutical companies for bioequivalence studies on their generics, (e) unavailability of locally manufactured active pharmaceutical ingredients, (f) disruption in the supply of imported raw material, (g) poor international market perception about local pharmaceutical products and (h) lack of support from regulatory in process expedition. The respondents also suggested the measures for overcoming the above challenges to boost the export of domestic pharmaceuticals and expand their international market share in countries with SRA.</p> Conclusion <p>Export from Pakistan to the SRA countries can be enhanced with mandatory bioequivalence studies during generic registration. The pharmaceuticals export could effectively contribute to the national economy.</p>","author":"Zobia Mubarak","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4ae4b72f2353d4c28636a54f7ef7e1716e29cb660341f62a7c6f1f77cc3fe57c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
