{"title":"Increasing marsh bird abundance in coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes, 2011–2021, likely caused by increasing water levels","link":"https://academic.oup.com/condor/article/doi/10.1093/ornithapp/duad062/7467104?rss=1","date":1702080000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America (i.e., lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario) provide critical habitat for marsh birds. We used 11 years (2011–2021) of data collected by the Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program at 1,962 point-count locations in 792 wetlands to quantify the first-ever annual abundance indices and trends of 18 marsh-breeding bird species in coastal wetlands throughout the entire Great Lakes. Nine species (50%) increased by 8–37% per year across all of the Great Lakes combined, whereas none decreased. Twelve species (67%) increased by 5–50% per year in at least 1 of the 5 Great Lakes, whereas only 3 species (17%) decreased by 2–10% per year in at least 1 of the lakes. There were more positive trends among lakes and species (<span>n </span>= 34, 48%) than negative trends (<span>n </span>= 5, 7%). These large increases are welcomed because most of the species are of conservation concern in the Great Lakes. Trends were likely caused by long-term, cyclical fluctuations in Great Lakes water levels. Lake levels increased over most of the study, which inundated vegetation and increased open water-vegetation interspersion and open water extent, all of which are known to positively influence abundance of most of the increasing species and negatively influence abundance of all of the decreasing species. Coastal wetlands may be more important for marsh birds than once thought if they provide high-lake-level-induced population pulses for species of conservation concern. Coastal wetland protection and restoration are of utmost importance to safeguard this process. Future climate projections show increases in lake levels over the coming decades, which will cause “coastal squeeze” of many wetlands if they are unable to migrate landward fast enough to keep pace. If this happens, less habitat will be available to support periodic pulses in marsh bird abundance, which appear to be important for regional population dynamics. Actions that allow landward migration of coastal wetlands during increasing lake levels by removing or preventing barriers to movement, such as shoreline hardening, will be useful for maintaining marsh bird breeding habitat in the Great Lakes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithological Applications Current Issue","siteHash":"0adf13706282b3ccfec74e0cd9d72c5688cecb6af30a6dfa64315dbe0b12427f","entryHash":"e340f31815f87a2da0dd45c311a73d7de8ff8e7c3a616ce7a47932b41e279030","category":"Environment"}
