{"title":"Analysis of the Management of Protected Areas in Galapagos: 60 Years after Its Declaration as a National Park","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1481/v1","date":1716450077000,"content":"The Galápagos Islands are one of the most emblematic protected areas on the planet, and also one of the most studied. Their main economic activity is tourism, which has grown rapidly in recent years. The increase in tourists is associated with the increase in population and the introduction of invasive species, which puts conservation at risk. This makes adequate management even more necessary and relevant on an international scale, since the economy of Galápagos depends on the good state of conservation of its ecosystems and species. Numerous studies have shown that social factors, rather than physical-natural ones, determine the success or failure of a marine protected area (MPA), so they must be urgently incorporated into all phases of MPA management. In this study we have analyzed the management of the protected areas of Galápagos: the National Park and the Marine Reserve. The methodology used presents five prescribed scenarios in which priority is given to one or other factors, each of which has an impact on biophysical and socio-economic systems that are influenced by the MPA. These scenarios have been called: proactive, interactive, centralized, learning, and formal management. The results show that the archipelago's protected areas follow a proactive management model, with a continuous feedback loop. This feedback is a key element in any adaptive management process, which also allows practitioners to anticipate future problems. Both public participation and strategic planning are essential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff3fde86f0cff4e09778b06d041eae72125aa794c6fea870a63f9d9b617dd5d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
