A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0880/v1","date":1713147608000,"content":"The purpose of this review is to investigate the role of legume cover crops in improving climate adaptability and water use efficiency in South African grassland systems. Climate change is posing significant obstacles to agricultural systems all over the world, which includes South Africa, where shortages of water and fluctuations are significant issues. Legume cover crops are growing in popularity as a long-term and cost-effective solution to these problems. The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the possible advantages of legume cover crops for enhancing climate resilience and water use efficiency in South African grassland systems, as well as the fundamental processes and present study findings. According to the outcomes, legume cover crops may boost soil water availability, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and overall ecosystem productivity, resulting in increased climate resilience and water use efficiency. However, a variety of factors, including species selection, management practices, and environmental conditions, can all have an impact on the effectiveness of legume cover crops. With the concerted efforts, adaptation strategies of livestock farmers that seeks to maximise the potential of legume cover crops in South African grassland systems, it is critical to consider site-specific factors when establishing them. This review offers significant insights into the role of legume cover crops in climate resilience and water use efficiency, laying the groundwork for future research and agricultural practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d21fe07e71ebc19f3ccb0b9cee09e4a8e67db6f7ca5be65821cd30143a375560","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
