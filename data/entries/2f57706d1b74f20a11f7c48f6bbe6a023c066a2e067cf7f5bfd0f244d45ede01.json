{"title":"Endoscopic Picture in Chronic Rhinosinusitis Associated with Gerd","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0204/v1","date":1714978041000,"content":"The main goal of our scientific study is to determine the particular characteristics of the endo-scopic image of the otorhinolaryngologic pathology of nasopharynx, which is called chronic rhinosinusitis in association with gastroesophageal acid reflux disease. Background/Objectives: to identify a specific features in the endoscopic picture of chronic rhinosinusitis associated with acid gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Methods: there were selected 521 adult patients, from this sample as a main group we have selected only 95 patients with the highest scores on the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) (&gt;20) and Reflux Symptom Score-12 (RSS-12) (&gt;130) questionnaires. As a control group we have selected 41 adult patients only with chronic rhinosinusitis and 10 healthy patients. Results: there were significant changes in the nasopharyngeal mucosa. In-creased vascularity of the nasopharyngeal mucosa was noted in 91 patients (95,7%). Hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal mucosa was found in 83 patients (87,4%). In 77 (81,1%) patients, mucus was found in the nasopharynx with different characteristics of color and consistency, and no mucus or other secretions were found in the middle nasal passages in these patients. In 62 pa-tients (65,3%) asymmetric hypertrophy of the mucosa of the oropharynx was noted. Conclusions: the presence of specific features of the endoscopic picture of the nose and nasopharynx of pa-tients with chronic rhinosinusitis associated with gastroesophageal disease symptoms and pro-posed a method for assessing the degree of influence of gastroesophageal reflux disease on the mucosal layer of the nose and nasopharynx. The possible influence of symptoms of gas-tro-oesophageal reflux disease on the course and severity of clinical manifestations of exacerba-tions of chronic rhinosinusitis needs further investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f57706d1b74f20a11f7c48f6bbe6a023c066a2e067cf7f5bfd0f244d45ede01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
