{"title":"Orbital Stability Study of the Taiji Space Gravitational Wave Detector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0512/v1","date":1712559012000,"content":"Space-based gravitational wave detection is extremely sensitive to disturbances. The Keplerian configuration cannot accurately reflect the variations in spacecraft configuration. Planetary gravitational disturbances are one of the main sources. Numerical simulation is an effective method to investigate the impact of perturbation on spacecraft orbits. This study shows that, in the context of the Taiji project, Earth’s gravity is an essential factor in the change in heliocentric formation configuration, contributing to the relative acceleration between spacecrafts in the order of O(10−6)m·s−2. Considering 00:00:00 on October 27, 2032 as the initial orbiting moment, under the influence of Earth’s gravitational perturbation, the maximum relative change in armlengths and variation rates of armlengths for Taiji is 1.6×105km, 32m·s−1 respectively, compared with the unperturbed Keplerian orbit. Additionally, by considering the gravitational perturbations of Venus and Jupiter, the armlength and relative velocity for Taiji are reduced by 16.01% and 17.45%, respectively, compared with when only considering that of Earth. The maximum amplitude of the formation motion indicator changes with the orbit entry time. Results show that the relative velocity increase between the spacecrafts is minimal when the initial orbital moment occurs in July. Moreover, the numerical simulation results are inconsistent when using different ephemerises. The differences between ephemeris DE440 and DE430 are smaller than those between DE440 and DE421.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3faa6f15a7f5d38bf8e860a55a578fe4171e756f2275183505ebdd98a158aca8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
