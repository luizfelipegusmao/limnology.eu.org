{"title":"Enhanced Cooling Efficiency of Urban Trees on Hotter Summer Days in 70 Cities of China","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-024-3269-9","date":1730419200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Increasing the urban tree cover percentage (TCP) is widely recognized as an efficient way to mitigate the urban heat island effect. The cooling efficiency of urban trees can be either enhanced or attenuated on hotter days, depending on the physiological response of urban trees to rising ambient temperature. However, the response of urban trees’ cooling efficiency to rising urban temperature remains poorly quantified for China’s cities. In this study, we quantify the response of urban trees’ cooling efficiency to rising urban temperature at noontime [∼1330 LT (local time), LT=UTC+8] in 17 summers (June, July, and August) from 2003–19 in 70 economically developed cities of China based on satellite observations. The results show that urban trees have stronger cooling efficiency with increasing temperature, suggesting additional cooling benefits provided by urban trees on hotter days. The enhanced cooling efficiency values of urban trees range from 0.002 to 0.055°C %<sup>−1</sup> per 1°C increase in temperature across the selected cities, with larger values for the low-TCP-level cities. The response is also regulated by background temperature and precipitation, as the additional cooling benefit tends to be larger in warmer and wetter cities at the same TCP level. The positive response of urban trees’ cooling efficiency to rising urban temperature is explained mainly by the stronger evapotranspiration of urban trees on hotter days. These results have important implications for alleviating urban heat risk by utilizing urban trees, particularly considering that extreme hot days are becoming more frequent in cities under global warming.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"77fd9923ac24e3f15f7ea47d17d38f97c0b5e064f7b25385c6597fc05de494a9","category":"Environment"}
