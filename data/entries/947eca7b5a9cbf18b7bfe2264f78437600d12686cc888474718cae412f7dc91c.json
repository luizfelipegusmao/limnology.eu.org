{"title":"Nonturbulent troposphere of Supper Lorentz Gaussian Seed ‎Mathematically of Receiver Field and Intensity Fluctuation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0013/v1","date":1719818611000,"content":"In recent studies, the circulation of a (SLG) super-Lorentz-Gaussian beam in a non-turbulent ‎troposphere has been investigated and used for laser applications. This method uses the extended ‎Huygens-Fresnel integral technique and refers to the multiplication of the Gaussian beam by the ‎Lorentz function. Formulas are derived for the normal density and approximate field of the Lo-‎Rentz-Gaussian beam in a non-turbulent troposphere. The average density power and the propagation characteristics of the SLG jet in the non-turbulent troposphere are numerically represented. ‎The characteristics of the beam boundaries at atmospheric non-turbulence for the propagation ‎distance of an SLG beam in a non-turbulent troposphere are also discussed in detail. They are ‎practical in an optical communication system used in lasers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"947eca7b5a9cbf18b7bfe2264f78437600d12686cc888474718cae412f7dc91c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
