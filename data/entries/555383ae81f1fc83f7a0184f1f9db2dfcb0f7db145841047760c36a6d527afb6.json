{"title":"Northern blotting of endogenous full-length human-specific LINE-1 RNA","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpae036/7684265?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>LINE-1 belongs to a family of DNA elements that move to new locations in the genome in a process called “retrotransposition.” This is achieved by a copy-and-paste mechanism with the aid of an RNA intermediate. The full-length LINE-1 is responsible for most retrotransposition activity in the human genome. Detecting the active LINE-1 RNA at the endogenous level is challenging due to its small percentage among inactive copies and its different forms of transcripts. Here, we describe a method of designing RNA probes to detect active LINE-1 by northern blotting and use optimized conditions and tools to make the detection practical. This method uses a classical long RNA probe and provides an alternative way to detect LINE-1 RNA using multiple short RNA probes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"555383ae81f1fc83f7a0184f1f9db2dfcb0f7db145841047760c36a6d527afb6","category":"Environment"}
