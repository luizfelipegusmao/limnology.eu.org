There were no differences in equilibrium scores of SOT conditions between 60, 130, and 180 Hz frequencies (p&amp;gt; 0.05), except the SOT6 score (p= 0.003), where 60 Hz showed better equilibrium performance in SOT6, indicating an advantage in postural control when visual and somatosensory cues are disturbed, and vestibular cues are not.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c15541cca0a168429330affb80420f2e77b4c4fc3476c04032679999571d7dc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
