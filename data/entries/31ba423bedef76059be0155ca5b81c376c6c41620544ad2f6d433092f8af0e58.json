{"title":"A Comprehensive Analysis of Knowledge Sharing, Training, Communication, and Attitudes for Effective Medical Waste Management among Healthcare Providers in Bangladesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1934/v1","date":1716963938000,"content":"Medical waste management is crucial issues for keeping our life safe and safety. Without effective measures for waste management, we cannot keep ourselves safe from different types of contagious diseases; viruses, bacteria. Knowledge sharing assists healthcare staff in identifying and mitigating hazards on appropriate handling, segregation and disposal medical waste. The aim of the study is to identify a multifaceted analysis of knowledge sharing, training, communication and attitudes for effective medical waste management. This study selected 153 medical workers randomly, including nurses, lab technologists, and cleaners, from hospitals, diagnostic centers, and clinics in the northern part of Bangladesh. The study design of this research is mixed-methods. This research adopts a survey and interview as a research strategy. The samples are collected randomly. SPSS software packages, MS Excel Office, and PLS-SEM are used to analyze data. Most of the respondents always share their knowledge face-to-face according to the findings. The result also shows that there are positive relationship between sources of knowledge (p: 0.046), awareness and knowledge (p: 0.049), attitudes of waste management (p: 0.025) and effective medical waste management. However, there are no relationships between communication and collaboration (p: 0.943), the practice of waste management (p: 0.155), supervision and staff monitoring (p: 0.527), training and education (p: 0.656) and effective medical waste management. Its focus on the northern part of Bangladesh introduces regional specificity, potentially limiting the applicability of results to other regions. The knowledge-sharing practices for waste management among medical staff are examined within this research, along with the relationship between attitude, awareness, and knowledge, staff supervision and monitoring, practice, training, and education and effective medical waste management that have not been studied before home and abroad. This analysis highlights the critical need for an integrated approach to medical waste management, emphasizing the importance of continuous education, open communication, and cultivating a culture that prioritizes environmental sustainability. The insights from this study offer practical recommendations for healthcare institutions to improve their medical waste management practices, ultimately leading to enhanced health outcomes and better environmental protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31ba423bedef76059be0155ca5b81c376c6c41620544ad2f6d433092f8af0e58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
