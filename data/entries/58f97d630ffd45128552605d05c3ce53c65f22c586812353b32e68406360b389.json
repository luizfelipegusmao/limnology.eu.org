{"title":"Lessons Learned and Outcomes from Risk-Based Modernisation of Post-mortem Inspection and Disposition Criteria of Beef, Sheep, Goat, and Pig Carcasses in Australia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0255/v1","date":1722849117000,"content":"Lessons learned and risk-based outcomes from modernising the Australian Standard for post-mortem inspection and disposition judgement of beef, sheep, goat and pig carcases are described. Initial Risk Profiles identified priorities for quantitative assessments. The main difficulty encountered was the paucity of quantified performance of current inspection. Resolving this involved acquiring gross abnormality data representing regional production/proportional abattoir volumes, the range of gross abnormalities appearing nationally, proportional occurrence at carcase sites, and seasonality to enable comparisons. Evidence and discussion are provided for associated challenges experienced including preventing contamination, use of food chain information to support amendment, inspection as a part of industry Quality Assurance and opportunities to improve inspector training. Criteria considered by the Competent Authority for determination of equivalence of alternative post-mortem inspection techniques included comparisons of public health risk, non-detection rates for gross abnormalities, and microbial contamination resulting from inspection activities, as appropriate. Most gross abnormalities detected arose from animal health and welfare conditions affecting wholesomeness and did not present as food safety hazards. Non-detection rates between current and alternative inspection (observation) were negligible. A Quantitative Risk Assessment for Cysticercus bovis was conducted. Carcases with multiple gross abnormalities predominantly reflected historic infections (prior septicaemia) where trimming achieved wholesomeness unless cachexic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58f97d630ffd45128552605d05c3ce53c65f22c586812353b32e68406360b389","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
