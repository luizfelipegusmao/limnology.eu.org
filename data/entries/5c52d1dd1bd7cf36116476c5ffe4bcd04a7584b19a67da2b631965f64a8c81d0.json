{"title":"Research practice, satisfaction, motivation, and challenges among university academics in Kurdistan Region of Iraq","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302540","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Hamdia Mirkhan Ahmed, Nazdar Ezzaddin Alkhateeb, Nazar P. Shabila, Amir Abdulrahman Ahmad</p>\r\nBackground <p>Researchers in universities and academic institutions must be in a leading position in generating research evidence to inform and direct national policies and strategies, improve service delivery, and achieve the main objectives. This study aimed to determine the factors that promote or hinder research productivity and quality among university academics in Kurdistan Region of Iraq.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted on 949 university academics from all public universities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The authors developed a questionnaire that included sociodemographic data, challenges, satisfaction, and motivation for conducting research. Data were collected using a Google form. Frequencies, percentages, and the Chi-square test were used to analyze the data.</p> Results <p>Most university academics (94.6%) believed that research was part of their job, but only 51.6% were satisfied with their role as academic researchers. The lack of financial motivation was the main reason for dissatisfaction, while the main incentive to conduct research was the passion for science. Around 21% of the university academics had not published any research, while 53.1% published 1â€“5 articles. Half of the participants (49.7%) lacked training in writing research proposals, and the majority (86.1%) have not applied for international grants. Approximately half of university academics (46.9%) shared their research findings with stakeholders, and the primary method was by sharing their published papers (59.4%), followed by seminars (42.2%). One of the important challenges in conducting research was the lack of funding (62.8%).</p> Conclusions <p>The academics at universities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq are passionate about their role as researchers, but face many challenges in conducting effective research. A strategic plan is needed to provide an encouraging environment for university academics regarding infrastructure, financial, and technical support. More studies are needed to identify the root factors of academic staff needs and challenges.</p>","author":"Hamdia Mirkhan Ahmed","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5c52d1dd1bd7cf36116476c5ffe4bcd04a7584b19a67da2b631965f64a8c81d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
