Additionally, it examines case studies where sentiment analysis has been successfully implemented to enhance brand reputation, address customer concerns, and tailor marketing strategies. The findings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptation to dynamic social media landscapes for maintaining a positive brand image.
