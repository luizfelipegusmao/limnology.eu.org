With the increasing demand for advanced materials like high-temperature materials, wear-resistant materials, ceramics, etc which usually contain light elements like oxygen, boron, etc, high resolution analysis of light elements is becoming more and more necessary[<a href=\"#ozae044.332-B1\">2–4</a>]. Accurate X-ray micro-analysis of light elements (Z&lt;10) can be a challenging task due to various reasons like these light elements have only one X-rays line i.e. Kα line with energy below 0.7 KeV, low yield count, back ground, line overlap, high absorption rate, etc. [<a href=\"#ozae044.332-B2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.332-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.332-B5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.332-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e89b9063760cc4bef125adb99d928cc9b4d4619442380e1671127d847feec900","category":"Environment"}
