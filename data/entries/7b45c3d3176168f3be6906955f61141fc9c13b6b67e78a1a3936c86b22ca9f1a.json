These leafhopper-produced brochosomes are hollow, three-dimensional, buckyball-shaped nanoscopic granules featuring distributed nanoscale through-holes. These structures represent a novel class of biologically inspired optical materials, with demonstrated functionality in omnidirectional antireflection [<a href=\"#ozae044.468-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.468-B2\">2</a>]. Despite their discovery in the 1950s, it remains unknown how the dimensions and geometry of brochosomes are related to their optical function [<a href=\"#ozae044.468-B3\">3</a>]. In this invited talk, I will explore how the distinct geometry of brochosomes contributes to their unique optical function and further discuss their potential applications in optical signature management, including antireflection and information encryption [<a href=\"#ozae044.468-B2\">2-5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7b45c3d3176168f3be6906955f61141fc9c13b6b67e78a1a3936c86b22ca9f1a","category":"Environment"}
