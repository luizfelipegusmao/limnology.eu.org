{"title":"Fault Detection of Multi Wheeled Robot Consensus Based on EKF","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0585/v1","date":1715243787000,"content":"In this article the problem of detection and isolation (FDI) in wheeled mobile robot is 1\ntreated. first of all we consider a master-slave robot system in which the master robot has to follow a 2\ndesired trajectory given by a well-determined control law, then the slave is controlled by the master. 3\nHowever in real environment there is no ideality because faults can appear in the master or slave 4\nor even the both and affect the system and may lead to unacceptable results so to ensure a well 5\nfunctioning an extended kalman filter is tuned to diagnosis eventual faults and to generate residuals 6\nin order to detect and isolate them. The performance of an estimator based on an EKF is simulated 7\nbased MATLAB Simulink simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"813088467f1061096dae64991f069bf8946c3de774a3248fa6ffd44a2141464f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
