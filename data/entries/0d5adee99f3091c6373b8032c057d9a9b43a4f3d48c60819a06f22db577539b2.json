In this study, a practical and effective allocation method for permeable pavement was proposed to restore the water cycle within watersheds considering future climate change. A total of 15 general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phase 6 were used to simulate future climate variables according to two shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios. The stormwater management model (SWMM) was employed for long-term hydrological simulation. The installation priority of permeable pavement in sub-watersheds was robustly determined using coupled fuzzy TOPSIS and VIKOR methods. The results of this study confirmed that the different climate predictions of each GCM could affect the prioritization results. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the allocation method adopted in this study improved water cycle restoration more effectively than when allocating the available capacity at once according to priority. The results of this study could help accurately determine the LID capacity of each sub-watershed under limited resources.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"0d5adee99f3091c6373b8032c057d9a9b43a4f3d48c60819a06f22db577539b2","category":"Environment"}
