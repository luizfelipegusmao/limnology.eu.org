{"title":"A Conjecture on the Possible Another Supermassive Black Hole in the Bar of Our Milky Way","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1730/v1","date":1719303003000,"content":"In the bar of our Milky Way, there should be another supermassive black holes B which is with the mass almost 10-2--10-5 the Sgr A* and with a distance10,000--14,500 lightyears from Sgr A*. The bar is formed by the stellar orbiting around both of the black holes. In the Hill radius of B, a lots of stars orbit around B while another lots of stars orbit Sgr A*. It determines that there is a “x-shaped structure” in the bar and the shape of bar appears a peanut. As the orbits of the stars is out of the Hill radius of B, they are repulsed to a distant place by B to form the arms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ecc4409fe9145bcda995840524a2cd86044cf3ef45db828c5a8c7e7ef3bd624","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
