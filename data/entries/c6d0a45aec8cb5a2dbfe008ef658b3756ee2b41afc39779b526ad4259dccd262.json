{"title":"Reduction of Blood Oxidative Stress Following Colorectal Cancer Resection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1455/v1","date":1726740780000,"content":"Background: Colorectal cancer is a major global health burden, with surgical resection being the standard treatment aimed at curative tumor removal. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer progression and prognosis. This study hypothesized that physical removal of colorectal cancer, a primary source of oxidative stress, would reduce blood levels of reactive oxygen metabolite derivatives (d-ROMs), a marker of oxidative stress, and biologic antioxidant potential (BAP) levels, a marker of antioxidant potential. Methods: The study included 123 patients who underwent radical resection for colorectal cancer. d-ROM and BAP levels were measured before and one month after surgery. Results: The clinicopathological analysis showed a correlation between preoperative d-ROM levels and tumor size (p&amp;lt;0.001). The study confirmed a significant reduction in d-ROM levels following tumor resection, indicating reduced systemic oxidative stress. The reduction was significant in stages II and III but not in stage I. The d-ROM ratio before and after tumor resection was significantly higher in cases with positive lymph node metastasis and larger tumor size. BAP levels showed no significant changes post-surgery. Conclusion: These results suggest that d-ROMs could serve as a valuable biomarker for monitoring tumor burden and surgical efficacy in patients with colorectal cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6d0a45aec8cb5a2dbfe008ef658b3756ee2b41afc39779b526ad4259dccd262","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
