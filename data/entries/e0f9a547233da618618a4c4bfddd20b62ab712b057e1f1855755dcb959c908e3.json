{"title":"Research on the Characteristics of Scientific Research Cooperation in Carbon Neutrality Studies from the Perspective of Mode 3 of knowledge production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1375/v1","date":1718872497000,"content":"This paper, from the perspective of Mode 3 of knowledge production, takes the important carrier of knowledge, scientific research papers, as the research object. The mainstream databases (SCIE and SSCI) are chosen as the data sources. Firstly, bibliometric methods are applied to analyze the cooperation status among the main bodies of paper production, including authors and their affiliated institutions, countries, and disciplines; secondly, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to construct a comprehensive evaluation model for the state of research cooperation in carbon neutrality. Based on the evaluation model, the cooperation characteristics of different disciplinary fields and the relationship between paper cooperation status and high-impact research papers are comparatively analyzed. At the same time, an analysis is conducted on the support from the government, the sponsorship from enterprises, and the participation of the public in the process of paper production. Finally, some suggestions are put forward on how to build an innovative ecosystem for carbon neutrality research from the perspective of Mode 3 of knowledge production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0f9a547233da618618a4c4bfddd20b62ab712b057e1f1855755dcb959c908e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
