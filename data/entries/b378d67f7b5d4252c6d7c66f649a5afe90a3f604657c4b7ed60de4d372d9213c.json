{"title":"Identification and Evaluation of Sugarcane Cultivars for Antixenosis Resistance to the Leafhopper Yamatotettix flavovittatus Matsumura (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1240/v1","date":1716187623000,"content":"Leafhopper Yamatotettix flavovittatus Matsumura is a phloem feeder that causes significant damage to sugarcane and also transmits sugarcane white leaf (SCWL) disease. Understanding the settling preference, feeding behavior, honeydew production and biophysical factors affecting Y. flavovittatus leafhopper infestation in sugarcane cultivation is crucial for effective pest management strategies. This study investigated these aspects across nine sugarcane cultivars. Significant variability was observed among cultivars in terms of settling behavior, with KK3 and LK92-11 showing the highest number of settled leafhopper adults. Similarly, honeydew production varied significantly among cultivars, with KK3 and LK92-11 exhibiting the highest production. Employing the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique provided insights into distinct probing behaviors across cultivars, highlighting correlations between settling preference, honeydew production, and specific EPG waveforms. Principal component analysis (PCA) categorized cultivars into four groups based on settling preference, honeydew production, feeding behavior, and biophysical factors. Strong correlations were found between settling preference, honeydew production, and various EPG waveforms, while negative correlations were observed with the number of silica cells and rows per unit area, indicating their potential role in deterring leafhopper settlement. We concluded that TPJ04-768 and K84-200 are promising for resistance to leafhoppers and exploited in sugarcane breeding programs for resistance to insects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b378d67f7b5d4252c6d7c66f649a5afe90a3f604657c4b7ed60de4d372d9213c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
