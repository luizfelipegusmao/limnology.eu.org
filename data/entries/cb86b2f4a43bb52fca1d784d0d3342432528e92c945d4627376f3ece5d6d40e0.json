{"title":"Hyporheic exchange flows in a mountainous river catchment identified by distributed temperature sensing","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4306?af=R","date":1715162286000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Elevated stream temperatures under low-flows, exacerbated by global warming, are a stressor that affects aquatic species directly or in combination with other stressors. Stream temperatures are influenced by energy fluxes across the air–water interface as well as by hydrological exchange processes occurring at the water–riverbed interface. Small-scale stream temperature dynamics influenced by exchange flows are still underrepresented in stream temperature research. To investigate high-resolution temperature dynamics and hydrological exchange processes at the sediment–water interface we applied fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) at two sites in the mountainous Kinzig catchment combined with mapping and measurement of additional environmental conditions. Two types of temperature anomalies could be observed at one site under conditions of low flow and high air temperature. Dampening effects coincided with riverine features such as pools, vegetation roots, fine sediment, and signs of streambank seepage which indicated hyporheic exchange flows. Increased heating of the substrate during the day was identified in shallow sections where sediment was exposed to the air and shading from riparian vegetation was patchy. At another site, at which the cable could not be buried because of the sediment composition, temperature anomalies in the overlying water indicated diffuse groundwater exfiltration. The results show that small-scale processes in the hyporheic zone, low water tables, and riparian shading influence stream temperature in mountainous streams and can be identified with FO-DTS under suitable conditions. The results improve our understanding of stream temperatures (in the hyporheic zone) and provide important information on how to improve hydrological modeling.</p>","author":"Kristin Peters, \nSven F.
