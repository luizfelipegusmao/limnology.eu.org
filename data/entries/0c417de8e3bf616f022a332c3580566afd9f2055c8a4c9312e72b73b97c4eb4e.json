{"title":"The impact of biologic agents on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A meta analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306513","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Xiaodong Jia, Zheming Yang, Jiayin Li, Zhu Mei, Lihui Jia, Chenghui Yan</p>\r\nObjective <p>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of biologic therapy on cardiovascular risk factors in rheumatoid arthritis patients to determine its clinical efficacy.</p> Methods <p>Relevant literature was systematically searched in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Meta-analysis was conducted using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were assessed. Statistical significance was set at <i>P</i>&lt;0.05.</p> Results <p>The meta-analysis revealed that biologic treatment in RA patients was associated with decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels compared to controls (MD: -0.10, 95% CI: [-0.14, -0.05], <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). Subgroup analysis based on treatment duration showed heterogeneity and a potential decrease in total cholesterol levels after 12 months of treatment (MD = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.21, -0.15], <i>P</i> = 0.76). Biologic therapy significantly reduced triglyceride levels compared to controls (MD = -0.23, 95% CI [-0.37, -0.09], <i>P</i> = 0.001), as observed in subgroup analysis. Moreover, biologics effectively decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (MD: -0.10, 95% CI: [-0.14, -0.05], <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001). However, biologic treatment was associated with increased inner carotid artery thickness (MD: 0.05, 95% CI: [0.03, 0.07], <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001), indicating potential adverse effects on cardiovascular health. No significant effect on pulse wave velocity (PWV) was observed (MD: -0.23, 95% CI: [-0.80, 0.34], <i>P</i> = 0.43, I2 = 0%, <i>P</i> = 0.55).</p> Conclusion <p>Biologic agents may improve lipid profiles in RA patients but could also have adverse effects on cardiovascular health. Further research is needed to comprehensively understand the impact of biologic therapy on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular outcomes in RA patients.</p> Systematic review registration <p>https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, CRD42024504911.</p>","author":"Xiaodong Jia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0c417de8e3bf616f022a332c3580566afd9f2055c8a4c9312e72b73b97c4eb4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
