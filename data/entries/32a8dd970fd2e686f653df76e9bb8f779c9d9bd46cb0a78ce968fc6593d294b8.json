{"title":"When Do Tumours Develop? Neoplastic Processes Across Different Timescales: Age, Season and Round the Circadian Clock","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70024?af=R","date":1729658977000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>While it is recognised that most, if not all, multicellular organisms harbour neoplastic processes within their bodies, the timing of when these undesirable cell proliferations are most likely to occur and progress throughout the organism's lifetime remains only partially documented. Due to the different mechanisms implicated in tumourigenesis, it is highly unlikely that this probability remains constant at all times and stages of life. In this article, we summarise what is known about this variation, considering the roles of age, season and circadian rhythm. While most studies requiring that level of detail be done on humans, we also review available evidence in other animal species. For each of these timescales, we identify mechanisms or biological functions shaping the variation. When possible, we show that evolutionary processes likely played a role, either directly to regulate the cancer risk or indirectly through trade-offs. We find that neoplastic risk varies with age in a more complex way than predicted by early epidemiological models: rather than resulting from mutations alone, tumour development is dictated by tissue- and age-specific processes. Similarly, the seasonal cycle can be associated with risk variation in some species with life-history events such as sexual competition or mating being timed according to the season. Lastly, we show that the circadian cycle influences tumourigenesis in physiological, pathological and therapeutic contexts. We also highlight two biological functions at the core of these variations across our three timescales: immunity and metabolism. Finally, we show that our understanding of the entanglement between tumourigenic processes and biological cycles is constrained by the limited number of species for which we have extensive data. Improving our knowledge of the periods of vulnerability to the onset and/or progression of (malignant) tumours is a key issue that deserves further investigation, as it is key to successful cancer prevention strategies.</p>","author":"Margaux Bieuville, \nAntoine M.
