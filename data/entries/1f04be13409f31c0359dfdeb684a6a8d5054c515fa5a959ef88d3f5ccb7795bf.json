{"title":"Bridging the Ruminant Productivity Gap in Eastern Africa: Practical Considerations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0008/v1","date":1727776598000,"content":"In this study, we address key challenges in enhancing ruminant productivity across Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in eastern Africa. A critical focus is on improving access to forage seeds essential for cattle systems. Key factors such as ruminant population, feed deficits, and governmental priorities are examined. The primary challenge lies in inadequate access to affordable forage seeds, compounded by reluctance to invest in perceived expensive elite varieties. Many farmers rely on outdated planting materials, lacking purity and vigor. To overcome these barriers, our analysis stresses the urgency of transitioning to recently improved seed varieties through rigorous selection and breeding. Promoting domestic seed production within Africa is crucial to mitigate high import costs and logistical complexities like variety registration. A coordinated regional approach to seed production could enhance economic viability and foster widespread adoption of improved forages. Such initiatives align with governmental agendas for sector development, offering triple benefits: increased productivity, environmental gains through reduced methane emissions, and regional economic growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f04be13409f31c0359dfdeb684a6a8d5054c515fa5a959ef88d3f5ccb7795bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
