{"title":"Perirenal Fat CT Radiomics-Based Survival Model for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: Integrating Texture Features with Clinical Predictors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1945/v1","date":1727230899000,"content":"Background: Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) presents significant challenges in prognostication due to its rarity and complex anatomy. This study introduces a novel approach integrating perirenal fat (PRF) radiomics with clinical factors to enhance prognostic accuracy in UTUC.\nMethods: The study retrospectively analysed 103 UTUC patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy. PRF radiomics features were extracted from preoperative CT scans using a semi-automated segmentation method. Three prognostic models were developed: clinical, ra-diomics, and combined. Model performance was assessed using concordance index (C-index), time-dependent Area Under the Curve (AUC), and integrated Brier score.\nResults: The combined model demonstrated superior performance (C-index: 0.784, 95% CI: 0.707-0.861) compared to the radiomics (0.759, 95% CI: 0.678-0.840) and clinical (0.653, 95% CI: 0.547-0.759) models. Time-dependent AUC analysis revealed the radiomics model's particular strength in short-term prognosis (12-month AUC: 0.9281), while the combined model excelled in long-term predictions (60-month AUC: 0.8403). Key PRF radiomics features showed stronger prognostic value than traditional clinical factors.\nConclusions: Integration of PRF radiomics with clinical data significantly improves prognostic accuracy in UTUC. This approach offers a more nuanced analysis of the tumour microenvironment, potentially capturing early signs of tumour invasion not visible through conventional imaging. The semi-automated PRF segmentation method presents advantages in reproducibility and ease of use, facilitating potential clinical implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64f2b7b015e73b985e7088787da80a60c7a6fbc3b3b6428da3a806cf1a6ed213","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
