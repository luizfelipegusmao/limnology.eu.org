{"title":"Learning Experiences and Didactic Needs of German Healthcare Professions: A Focus Group Study for the Design of Personalized Interprofessional Further Education in Dementia Healthcare","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1465/v1","date":1713870528000,"content":"Considering the multifaceted nature of neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and the neces-sity for interprofessional knowledge, this research extends its scope to encompass professionals with diverse levels of training and experience in dementia care. A need analysis for the project “My INdividual Digital EDucation.RUHR” (MINDED.RUHR) is conducted to develop an au-tomatized recommender system for individual learning content using AI. In this sub-study, the aim was to reveal didactic specialties, knowledge gaps and structural challenges of further edu-cation in dementia care of different health professions and to derive learning preference personae. Eight focus group interviews among nine health professions and up to six participants (n = 34) each took place to survey distinct didactic experiences and learning needs. The results reflect various learning preferences, with a propensity to multimedia, practical and interactive tasks. Health professions are used to digital education but show aversions against certain e-learning formats. The derived learning preference personae constitute profound blueprints for a us-er-centred digital education design process, aiming to establish personalized and representative further education in dementia care applicable to various individual preferences and structural workplace challenges of healthcare professions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a3842a7b12edc80b414fedf4694bc90ea776bb2a7e919e82f2882ab0b328734","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
