{"title":"eHealth and mHealth in Antimicrobial Stewardship","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1998/v1","date":1721892803000,"content":"The global need for rapid diagnostic methods for pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is underscored by the increasing bacterial resistance and limited therapeutic options, especially critical in sepsis management. The evolution from traditional phenotype-based methods to rapid molecular and mass spectrometry techniques has significantly decreased result turnaround times, improving patient outcomes. Despite advancements, the complex decision-making in antimicrobial therapy often exceeds the capacity of many clinicians, highlighting the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP). These programs, integrating mHealth and eHealth, leverage technology to enhance healthcare services and patient outcomes, particularly in remote or resource-limited settings. However, the application of such technologies in antimicrobial management remains underexplored in hospitals. The development of platforms combining antimicrobial prescription data with pharmacotherapeutic algorithms and laboratory integration can significantly reduce costs and improve hospitalization times and mortality rates. Yet, the effectiveness of empirical antibiotic therapy, influenced by rapid diagnostic tests, becomes cost-effective when error rates exceed 20%, emphasizing the need for technological integration in ASPs to combat the rising challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and healthcare sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f99759f6f9e5ee7872f12db95850fecd67a6c8608cfcc8293b70c973d3cf7ec0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
