{"title":"Quantum Effects in Synaptic Activity: Challenging the Deterministic Model of Neural Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2066/v1","date":1719584048000,"content":"In this study, we explore the impact of quantum effects on synaptic activity and their implications for the deterministic model of neural processes. By simulating synaptic events in a large-scale neural network, we demonstrate how small probabilistic quantum events can accumulate and introduce variability in neural behavior. Our model incorporates Dirac delta functions to simulate sudden changes in synaptic probabilities, creating a non-linear, seesaw effect in the cumulative synaptic activity curve. The results reveal that even minimal quantum effects, when scaled to the vast number of synapses in the human brain, can lead to significant dissociations in neural activity. These findings challenge the traditional deterministic view, suggesting that neural processes—and by extension, decision-making and movements—may inherently incorporate elements of randomness. This probabilistic perspective aligns with theories of free will and underscores the need for further empirical research to validate the role of quantum mechanics in neuroscience. Our study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the complex interplay between quantum effects and neural dynamics, opening new avenues for exploring the nature of consciousness and the fundamental principles governing reality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0113f1bfb381650417c41cd9538a13f1f9dad926acd7f5571508a7284d5057ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
