{"title":"X-ray Computed Tomography of Tristructural Isotropic (TRISO) Fuel from the AGR-5/6/7 Irradiation Tests","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.141/7719549?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The development of graphite-moderated high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) is currently underway. Typical HTGRs use helium as a coolant and are expected to have a core outlet temperature greater than 650Â°. Prismatic-type HTGRs use fuel in the form of cylindrical compacts that contain thousands of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated particles embedded in a graphitic matrix. In pebble-bed HTGRs, TRISO particles are contained within spherical fuel pebbles. TRISO coated particles consist of three dense coating layers encapsulating the low-density carbon buffer layer and the central fuel kernel. In the U.S. TRISO fuel program, the fuel kernels are a heterogenous mixture of uranium oxide and uranium carbide. All the features of the TRISO particle work together to retain radioactive fission products during normal as well as abnormal conditions [<a href=\"#ozae044.141-B1\">1</a>]. Figs. 1 and 2 show the structure of TRISO fuel compact and an individual TRISO particle. As shown in Fig. 1, this particular fuel compact is loaded with roughly 2200 TRISO particles to give a nominal 25% volume packing fraction. Figure 2 shows the structure of a TRISO particle, where a fuel kernel consists of a surrogate ZrO<sub>2</sub> encapsulated in a porous buffer layer of carbon. It is further surrounded by layers of inner pyrolytic carbon, silicon carbide, and outer pyrolytic carbon, respectively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e2349455764e6d210b38432018146a9535cdbee60be0ef51b842ce43677132e2","category":"Environment"}
