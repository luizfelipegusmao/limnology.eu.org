This Formal Comment discusses key considerations regarding the potential effect of missing lineages when assessing relative timing of evolutionary events.","author":"Moisès Bernabeu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"e654a68089638c84369ef4cca3d99215e8227d9077823f27651e0002ddada82a","category":"Environment"}
