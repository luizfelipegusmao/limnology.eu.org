{"title":"Lineage-specific gene duplication and expansion of <i>DUF1216</i> gene family in <i>Brassicaceae</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302292","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Zai-Bao Zhang, Tao Xiong, Xiao-Jia Wang, Yu-Rui Chen, Jing-Lei Wang, Cong-Li Guo, Zi-Yi Ye</p>\r\n\r\nProteins containing domain of unknown function (DUF) are prevalent in eukaryotic genome. The DUF1216 proteins possess a conserved DUF1216 domain resembling to the mediator protein of Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II transcriptional subunit-like protein. The DUF1216 family are specifically existed in <i>Brassicaceae</i>, however, no comprehensive evolutionary analysis of <i>DUF1216</i> genes have been performed. We performed a first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of DUF1216 proteins in <i>Brassicaceae</i>. Totally 284 <i>DUF1216</i> genes were identified in 27 <i>Brassicaceae</i> species and classified into four subfamilies on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. The analysis of gene structure and conserved motifs revealed that <i>DUF1216</i> genes within the same subfamily exhibited similar intron/exon patterns and motif composition. The majority members of <i>DUF1216</i> genes contain a signal peptide in the N-terminal, and the ninth position of the signal peptide in most DUF1216 is cysteine. Synteny analysis revealed that segmental duplication is a major mechanism for expanding of <i>DUF1216</i> genes in <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, <i>Brassica juncea</i>, <i>Brassica napus</i>, <i>Lepidium meyneii</i>, and <i>Brassica carinata</i>, while in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Capsella rubella</i>, tandem duplication plays a major role in the expansion of the <i>DUF1216</i> gene family. The analysis of Ka/Ks (non-synonymous substitution rate/synonymous substitution rate) ratios for <i>DUF1216</i> paralogous indicated that most of gene pairs underwent purifying selection. <i>DUF1216</i> genes displayed a specifically high expression in reproductive tissues in most <i>Brassicaceae</i> species, while its expression in <i>Brassica juncea</i> was specifically high in root. Our studies offered new insights into the phylogenetic relationships, gene structures and expressional patterns of <i>DUF1216</i> members in <i>Brassicaceae</i>, which provides a foundation for future functional analysis.","author":"Zai-Bao Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fc5d075cb531fdb1443c2df84f15f7568746361522a9bde61529e84b5e2be198","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
