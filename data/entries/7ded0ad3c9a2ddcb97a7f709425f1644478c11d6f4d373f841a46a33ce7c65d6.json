{"title":"And yet another transcription factor—the complex world of fruit ripening","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2185/7507782?rss=1","date":1704326400000,"content":"<span>Fruit ripening is a complex process undergone by mature fruits to achieve successful seed dispersal. After ripening initiation, fruits change their color, their flesh becomes soft, and a multitude of organic compounds are synthesized to achieve delicious flavor and aroma. Although the ultimate evolutionary aim of fruit ripening—seed dispersal—might seem obsolete in modern societies, fruit ripening remains one of the most relevant physiological processes in plants. Fruits are an essential part of human diet and a main source of vitamins, and ripening determines nutritional quality, flavor, and post-harvest life. Therefore, understanding and modulating ripening is key for breeders and food industries.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7ded0ad3c9a2ddcb97a7f709425f1644478c11d6f4d373f841a46a33ce7c65d6","category":"Environment"}
