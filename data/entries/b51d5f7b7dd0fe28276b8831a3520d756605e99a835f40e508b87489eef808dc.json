{"title":"Leveraging Methods in Microscopy for Exploring Structure-Property Relations of Ultrahigh Aspect Ratio Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Subject to Ball Milling and Compounding with Polymers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.619/7719592?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used as additives in polymer nanocomposites due to their outstanding electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. The low loading requirements for nanotube composites can lead to high performance, lightweight materials for the electronics, automotive, and aviation industries. However, advancement in the industrial applications of these composites has stalled recently due to high costs associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and processing. To decrease cost of synthesis and remove the need for purification, our group has been developing a high yield, high aspect ratio (100 µm x 15 nm; L/D ≈ 6,600) multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) synthesis process using lamellar minerals as catalyst support material as opposed to traditional monolayer supports. The present study is focused on leveraging methods in microscopy and spectroscopy to explore the structure-property relations of these ultrahigh aspect ratio MWCNTs subject to ball milling and compounding with polymers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b51d5f7b7dd0fe28276b8831a3520d756605e99a835f40e508b87489eef808dc","category":"Environment"}
