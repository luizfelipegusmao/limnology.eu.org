{"title":"Applying and Improving Pyranometric Method to Estimate Sunshine Duration for a Tropical Site","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1439/v1","date":1718941042000,"content":"The aim of this paper is to apply all the existing pyranometric method, to estimate the sunshine duration from the global solar irradiation, in order to find in their original form the most suitable method for a tropical site. Then, in a second step, one of these methods will be optimized to well fit tropical sites. Five methods in the literature (Step Algorithm, Carpentras Algorithm, Slob &amp;amp; Monna Algorithm, Slob &amp;amp; Monna 2 Algorithm, and Linear Algorithm) were applied with eleven years of global and diffuse solar radiation data. As a result, in their original form, the Step Algorithm is on the first rank. But in the second step, after improving its main coefficients, the Carpentras Algorithm was found to be the best algorithm for tropical site in the southern hemisphere.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d20d624ac61265904483d22a61713240de01a591e0274d2f6c233825430e65d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
