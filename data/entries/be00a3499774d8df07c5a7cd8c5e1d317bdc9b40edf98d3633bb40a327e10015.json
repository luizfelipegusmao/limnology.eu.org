{"title":"Is the Myasthenia Gravis (MG) the Result of Age and Sex/Gender? A Narrative Review for Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Biomarkers for a Differential MG Management in Old and Young Women","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1538/v2","date":1714470360000,"content":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease characterized by typical clinical and immunopathogenic pe-culiarities, which correlate with age and sex/gender. Accordingly, MG patients show thymic al-terations and auto-antibodies productions, that can be the expression of a different pathogenetic mechanism related to age and gender. This determines, in relation to age at and sex/gender, a dif-ferent MG onset, prognosis, and outcome. Therefore, diverse MG forms can be identified, classi-fied, and characterized in relation to their different features, and precisely there are early onset and late-onset forms of MG. It has been hypothesized that the cause of appearance the two diverse forms of MG can be ascribed mainly to the diverse genetic and epigenetic factors. In this narrative review, we will analyze and discuss about the interplay of age- and sex-related factors (i.e. genet-ic and epigenetic factors) related to two different MG forms and how they contribute to their di-verse pathogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be00a3499774d8df07c5a7cd8c5e1d317bdc9b40edf98d3633bb40a327e10015","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
