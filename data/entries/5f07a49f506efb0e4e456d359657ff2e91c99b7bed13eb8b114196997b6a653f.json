{"title":"Microbiological Diagnosis &ndash; an Important Tool for Prevention and Management of Peri-Implant Infective Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1293/v1","date":1726627869000,"content":"Peri-implant infective diseases seem to be the most common cause for the late dental implant failure. Therefore, peri-implant microbiota has been intensively studied in modern implantology. Many studies showed a presence of extremely varied microflora in cases of peri-implant infective diseases. The main scope of this observational single-blind study was to analyze the presence of some microbial species in a group of patients with clinical signs of peri-implant mucositis compared to two other groups (patients treated with dental implants but without any clinical signs of peri-implant inflammation and patients treated with no dental implants). The identification of microorganisms was followed by an antibiogram in order to find their sensitivity to various antibiotics. The results showed a microbiota not necessarily specific for each situation (peri-implant infective diseases, healthy tissues around dental implants and healthy natural teeth and gums) with species like Candida albicans, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus and others. Peri-implant infective diseases presented more bacterial species than other conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f07a49f506efb0e4e456d359657ff2e91c99b7bed13eb8b114196997b6a653f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
