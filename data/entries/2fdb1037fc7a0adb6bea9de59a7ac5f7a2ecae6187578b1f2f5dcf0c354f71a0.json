{"title":"Construction and Case Analysis of Comprehensive Evaluation System of Rural Building Energy Consumption from Energy-Building-Behavior Composite Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1939/v1","date":1721818722000,"content":"A comprehensive evaluation system of rural building energy consumption from the innovative composite perspective was established, which was suitable for southwest of China. The index system was established by Brainstorming method and Delphi method, the weights of the comprehensive evaluation model were calculated by Network Process (ANP) method, the scoring criteria of all evaluation indexes were leveld based on fuzzy evaluation theory. The system model was verified by case analysis, at the countryside around Chengdu Second Circle. With the highest weight, lowest comprehensive score, and broadest range of comprehensive scores taken into consideration, three key factors affecting the target layer, namely \"Percentage of Clean Energy Use\", \"Thermal Performance of Exterior Walls\", and \"Implementation Rate of Energy saving Measures\". The distribution of comprehensive indicators and evaluation factors has certain spatial distribution characteristics, and the overall spatial distribution shows a characteristic of \"high in the southeast and low in the northwest\". Finally, Based on key factors and regional distribution characteristics, energy-saving measures have been proposed from three aspects: increasing sunrooms, adding wall insulation layers, and standardizing air conditioning temperature settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fdb1037fc7a0adb6bea9de59a7ac5f7a2ecae6187578b1f2f5dcf0c354f71a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
