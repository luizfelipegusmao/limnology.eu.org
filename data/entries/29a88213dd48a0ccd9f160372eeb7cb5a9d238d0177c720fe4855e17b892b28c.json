Water and sediment samples were obtained from the Los Troncos Stream (LTS), previous to the confluence with the “San Carlos” drainage channel (SCC), and from the SCC. Biological parameters (mortality and sublethal biomarkers) were used to evaluate ecotoxicity during 10-day exposure of <i>Rhinella arenarum</i> tadpoles to LTS and SCC samples. Nine pesticides were detected in both LTS and SCC. Chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia, and coliform count recorded in SCC greatly exceeded limits for aquatic life protection. At SCC and LTS after the confluence with SCC, numerous dying and dead aquatic turtles (<i>Phrynops hilarii</i>) were recorded. In the ecotoxicity assessment, no mortality of tadpoles was observed in LTS treatment, whereas total mortality (100%) was observed in SCC treatments in dilution higher than 50% of water and sediment. For SCC, median lethal concentration and the 95% confidence limits was 18.30% (14.71–22.77) at 24 h; lowest-observed and no-observed effect concentrations were 12.5% and 6.25%, respectively. Oxidative stress and neurotoxicity were observed in tadpoles exposed to 25% SCC dilution treatment. In addition, there was a large genotoxic effect (micronuclei test) in all sublethal SCC dilution treatments (6.25%, 12.5%, and 25%). These results alert about the high environmental quality deterioration and high ecotoxicity for aquatic fauna of aquatic ecosystems affected by agro-industrial wastewater.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nGreat mortality of turtles was observed in a basin with a high load of agro-industrial wastewater.\nSan Carlos Channel (SCC), where effluents are spilled, is environmentally deteriorated.\nThe water-sediment matrix of SCC caused 100% lethality in tadpoles.\nSCC dilutions caused neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity on tadpoles.\n</p>","author":"Ana P.
