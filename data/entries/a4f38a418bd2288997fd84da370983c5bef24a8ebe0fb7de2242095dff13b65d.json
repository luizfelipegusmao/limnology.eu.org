One promising materials family for such applications are intercalated van der Waals (vdW) compounds, in which spin-bearing ions can be into the weak-bonding gap between the quasi-two-dimensional layers of the host lattice [<a href=\"#ozae044.545-B1\">1</a>]. For example, metal intercalants such as iron, chromium, or vanadium can be hosted within metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as TaS<sub>2</sub> and NbS<sub>2</sub>, giving rise to a host of magnetic behaviors [<a href=\"#ozae044.545-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.545-B3\">3</a>]. Some of these compounds can be stabilized directly through bulk synthesis methods such as chemical vapor transport, but alternative methods to actively and controllably introduce intercalant ions into two-dimensional (2D) TMD crystals offer the potential for fabricating bespoke heterostructures and devices with exquisitely tailored properties. One such approach is soaking 2D crystals in dilute organometallic precursors followed by vacuum annealing. Although previous studies have demonstrated the success of this approach for intercalating 2D TMDs [<a href=\"#ozae044.545-B2\">2</a>], the details of the intercalation mechanism and the relative importance of different parameters within the reaction process have remained elusive. Here, we leverage a suite of advanced analytical techniques within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to investigate the structural, electronic, and chemical changes in TaS<sub>2</sub> flakes treated with dilute Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a4f38a418bd2288997fd84da370983c5bef24a8ebe0fb7de2242095dff13b65d","category":"Environment"}
