{"title":"Analysis and Investigation of Thermodynamic Improvement and Exergy of Turbofan Engine Using Fuzzy Logic and Meta-Heuristic Optimizers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0409/v1","date":1720084358000,"content":"This paper delves into the comprehensive analysis and investigation of thermodynamic enhancement and exergy optimization of turbofan engines through the integration of fuzzy logic and newest meta-heuristic optimizers, like the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In contemporary engineering practices, exergy analysis stands out as a crucial and indispensable tool utilized by numerous engineers and researchers in the design, operation, and performance evaluation of energy systems. Its multifaceted advantages include the precise determination of location, types, and quantification of exergy losses and production. By augmenting exergy efficiency while concurrently curbing exergy destruction, substantial enhancements in engine performance and cost reduction can be achieved. The study focuses on the CF6-80A and CFM56 turbofan engines, scrutinizing individual components such as the fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor, combustion chamber, high-pressure turbine, and low-pressure turbine. Key parameters for engine evaluation encompass exergy efficiency, recovery potential, relative exergy destruction, fuel depletion rate, and inefficiency. To conduct a rigorous exergy analysis, engine modeling is imperative, particularly during the cruise phase, which predominantly characterizes engine operation. Subsequently, exergy analysis is executed in accordance with established thermodynamic principles, leveraging equations governing mass conservation, energy conservation, and exergy conservation for each engine component. Further optimization of exergy destruction is achieved through the application of meta-heuristic optimizers and fuzzy logic, facilitating informed decision-making processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7607a476455a635209cab1b935a21df3ee6ad176e75fb541582fb02a70df27a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
