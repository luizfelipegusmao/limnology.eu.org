Multivariate analysis was performed for inpatient death, long term survival and composite of inpatient death/TIA/stroke. Kaplan Meier survival curves were compared at 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 years using the log-rank test.\nResults \n\nMean age was 66.9±13 years and mean follow up was 5.3±4.7 years. 48.9% had LR.
