{"title":"AMPK activator 991 specifically activates SnRK1 and thereby affects seed germination in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2917/7625385?rss=1","date":1710115200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are highly conserved. Compound 991 is an AMPK activator in mammals. However, whether 991 also activates SnRK1 remains unknown. The addition of 991 significantly increased SnRK1 activity in desalted extracts from germinating rice seeds <span>in vitro</span>. To determine whether 991 has biological activity, rice seeds were treated with different concentrations of 991. Germination was promoted at low concentrations but inhibited at high concentrations. The effects of 991 on germination were similar to those of <span>OsSnRK1a</span> overexpression. To explore whether 991 affects germination by specifically affecting SnRK1, germination of an <span>snrk1a</span> mutant and the wild type under 1 Î¼M 991 treatment was compared. The <span>snrk1a</span> mutant was insensitive to 991. Phosphoproteomic analysis showed that the differential phosphopeptides induced by 991 and <span>OsSnRK1a</span> overexpression largely overlapped. Furthermore, SnRK1 might regulate rice germination in a dosage-dependent manner by regulating the phosphorylation of three phosphosites, namely S285-PIP2;4, S1013-SOS1, and S110-ABI5. These results indicate that 991 is a specific SnRK1 activator in rice. The promotion and inhibition of germination by 991 also occurred in wheat seeds. Thus, 991 is useful for exploring SnRK1 function and the chemical regulation of growth and development in crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7033518b6bbc202c077fab069a96a1a57c39e89933232fd7a90721fa794de88a","category":"Environment"}
