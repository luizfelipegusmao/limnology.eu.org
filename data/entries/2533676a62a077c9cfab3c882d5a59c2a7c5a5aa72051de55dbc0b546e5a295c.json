{"title":"Towards Autonomous Experiments by Connecting High Performance Microscopy with High Performance Computing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1011/7720291?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The digitization of controls, data, and analysis in microscopy is bringing the idea of autonomous microscopes closer to reality than ever before. Automated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is already fairly routine for some experiments the only require simple repetitive tasks such as imaging biological macromolecules for single particle cryoEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.1011-B1\">1</a>], tilt series for electron tomography [<a href=\"#ozae044.1011-B2\">2</a>], and movies for crystallography [<a href=\"#ozae044.1011-B3\">3</a>]. The vast majority of TEM experiments are conducted completely by human operators who choose the regions of interest, optimize experimental parameters, and make decisions about data quality visually during an experiment. The field is still a long way from having completely autonomous TEMs that can adapt to sample difficulties and tune experimental parameters based on data quality and desired experimental outcomes. Part of the issue is the lack of capability for feeding information learned from on-line, live data analysis back into the on-going experiment [<a href=\"#ozae044.1011-B4\">4</a>]. This presentation will discuss current capabilities for large scale data reduction and analysis using high performance computing (i.e. supercomputing) and progress towards developing a true feed-back loop that places data analysis and theory in the experimental loop.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2533676a62a077c9cfab3c882d5a59c2a7c5a5aa72051de55dbc0b546e5a295c","category":"Environment"}
