{"title":"Prevalence of and Contributors to Food Insecurity Among College Athletes: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0406/v1","date":1712307719000,"content":"Given the financial demands of attending college, the transition to new living situations, abrupt changes in social support, and overall lifestyle adjustments, college students are at an increased risk of food insecurity (FI) compared to the general population. Collegiate athletes experience an even greater risk of FI as a result of greater time commitments and energy demands associated with their sports. This heightened vulnerability poses a tremendous threat to student-athletesâ€™ academic and athletic achievements. This study aims to address the prevalence and primary determinants of FI among collegiate athletes while providing potential solutions to navigate and alleviate the effects of diminished food security among this demographic. To address these aims, a total of 18 articles were selected from both peer-reviewed and gray literature. The U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (US-HFSSM) survey tools were predominantly utilized across universities throughout the United States to gather data on FI. Student-athletes reported experiencing FI across various regions of the United States, including universities in northeastern states (n=5), the southwest region (n=3), the southeast region (n=3), the northwest (n=1), and the Midwest (n=1). Overall, FI prevalence rates ranged from 9.9% to 65% and the most significant contributors included limited financial resources, time management, meal plans, and housing location/amenities. These findings highlight a need for screening, education, and intervention to address FI among collegiate athletes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4155a9707f8360cf31f24fbe4b605d8078391c2bce662c4ed9030713aa54c7ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
