{"title":"Performance Evaluation of Edge Computing Object Detection Models for Maritime Surveillance on Raspberry Pi","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1361/v1","date":1718795098000,"content":"The exponential growth of maritime traffic has brought with it a multitude of business opportunities, while at the same time posing unprecedented challenges in terms of control and surveillance. Traditional methods struggle to cope with the sheer volume and complexity of maritime activities, which calls for innovative solutions. This study presents a comparative analysis of three prominent computing object detection models applied to maritime surveillance. By evaluating their performance metrics in dynamic maritime environments, this study provides information on the most suitable model for effective maritime monitoring applications, attaining an impressive 91\\% mean Average Precision (mAP) using the YOLOv5n model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b07675ee3bbb72d8f6fbab2665ca47a3c77ac843dbdd7c9c5fbfc131c6417ad0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
