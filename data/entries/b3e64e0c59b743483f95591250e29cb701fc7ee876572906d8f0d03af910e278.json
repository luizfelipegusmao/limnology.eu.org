{"title":"Development of Geotechnical Seismic Isolation System in the Form of Vertical Barriers: Effectiveness and Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2495/v1","date":1722405658000,"content":"This work discusses seismic isolation technologies and analyses the concept of geotechnical seismic isolation (GSI) system, which is characterized by new principles of operation, using geomaterial with modified properties to reduce inertial seismic loads on buildings and structures. The aim of the study is to develop a geotechnical seismic isolation system in the form of vertical barriers, with different geometrical characteristics, using rubber-soil mixture (RSM). The novelty of the work consists in determination of effective constructive and technical solutions of vertical seismic barriers from RSM, which are characterized by reliability in providing seismic isolation of construction objects. Soil and superstructure interactions are modeled in Plaxis software, using the Northridge earthquake accelerogram. The results confirm the positive impact of using RSM as an effective material for GSI vertical barriers. The present numerical and experimental results show that the GSI system using RSM can significantly reduce the seismic hazard. The results of computational-experimental modeling will become a research, analytical and design basis for the development of new ways to ensure earthquake resistance of construction objects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3e64e0c59b743483f95591250e29cb701fc7ee876572906d8f0d03af910e278","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
