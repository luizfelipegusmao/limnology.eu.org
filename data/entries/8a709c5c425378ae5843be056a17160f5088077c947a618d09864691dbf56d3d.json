{"title":"Energy Renormalization in a Berry Geometrical Phase: Low-Energy Perturbations of the Strong Interaction and the QCD Mass Gap","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202307.1051/v8","date":1711437750000,"content":"A Berry geometrical phase is identified in a strongly metastable system containing dynamically responsive clathrate hydrate structures within a crystal-fluid material. High energy degeneracy in the associated chemistry produces local stability and false vacuum conditions that lead to non-extensive and non-additive contributions in the fundamental thermodynamic relation. The reciprocating action of a piston expander confirms a net energy gain despite the crystal-fluid material maintaining almost constant density. Application of Ginzburg-Landau theory and the scaling laws reveals a coherence length and a penetration depth for a macro-scale dual superconductor. The coherence length determines non-extensive volume changes whilst its inverse gives the Higgs mass. The penetration depth determines the extent of QCD vacuum suppression whilst its inverse gives the vector boson mass together with indirect manifestation as non-additive hyperbolic curvature. Additionally, the dual superconductor signifies long-range entanglement within a magnetic condensate displaying relativistic effects, whilst the hyperbolic curvature is attributed to quantum interactions. Gravity-mediated entanglement within the laboratory is thereby deduced. Simultaneous emergence of the Ginzburg-Landau superconducting phase transition is consistent with gauge-invariant coupling of the scalar field to the Yang-Mills action in QCD. The discovery of an energy gap in the gradient energy term of the system Lagrangian is associated with a critical correlation length revealed in the transition from a gapped to a gapless superconducting state. Together with the emergence and absorption of the Higgs-like scalar field, a mechanism for describing a renormalized QCD mass gap arises.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a709c5c425378ae5843be056a17160f5088077c947a618d09864691dbf56d3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
