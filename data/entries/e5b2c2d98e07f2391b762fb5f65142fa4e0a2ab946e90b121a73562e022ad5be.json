{"title":"Genomic islands of speciation harbor genes underlying coloration differences in a pair of Neotropical seedeaters","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/6/1161/7635086?rss=1","date":1711411200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Incomplete speciation can be leveraged to associate phenotypes with genotypes, thus providing insights into the traits relevant to the reproductive isolation of diverging taxa. We investigate the genetic underpinnings of the phenotypic differences between <span>Sporophila plumbea</span> and <span>Sporophila beltoni</span>. <span>Sporophila beltoni</span> has only recently been described based, most notably, based on differences in bill coloration (yellow vs. black in <span>S. plumbea</span>). Both species are indistinguishable through mtDNA or reduced-representation genomic data, and even whole-genome sequencing revealed low genetic differentiation. Demographic reconstructions attribute this genetic homogeneity to gene flow, despite divergence in the order of millions of generations. We found a narrow hybrid zone in southern Brazil where genetically, yet not phenotypically, admixed individuals appear to be prevalent. Despite the overall low genetic differentiation, we identified 3 narrow peaks along the genome with highly differentiated SNPs. These regions harbor 6 genes, one of which is involved in pigmentation (<span>EDN3</span>) and is a candidate for controlling bill color. Within the outlier peaks, we found signatures of resistance to gene flow, as expected for islands of speciation. Our study shows how genes related to coloration traits are likely involved in generating prezygotic isolation and establishing species boundaries early in speciation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"e5b2c2d98e07f2391b762fb5f65142fa4e0a2ab946e90b121a73562e022ad5be","category":"Environment"}
