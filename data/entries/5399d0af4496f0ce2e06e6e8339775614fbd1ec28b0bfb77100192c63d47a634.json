{"title":"Determination of Recovery by Healing or Compensation Using Multifrequency Vestibular Tests and Subjective Functional Scales in a Human Model of Vestibular Neuritis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0649/v1","date":1723424564000,"content":"Background: Vestibular Neuritis (VN) induces Acute Vestibular Syndrome (AVS). This study aimed to identify predictive factors of VN recovery by healing and/or compensation. Methods: In this longitudinal and prospective study, 40 patients were included. The first assessment (T0) included medical history taking (general and specific), for cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), a battery of diagnostic tests, bithermal caloric test (BCT), video Head Impulse Test (VHIT) and skull vibration induced nystagmus (SVIN). All patients also completed a Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). All assessments were repeated 90Â±15 days (T3) later. Subjective criteria compensation were based on DHI total score and objective criteria compensation on the instrumental test results. Four groups of patients (A, B, C, D) were delineated by combining patients with normal vs abnormal vestibular tests and patients with normal vs abnormal DH. Results: CVRFs were associated with a poorer recovery of symptoms but not the age or BMI. Vestibular tests mainly BCT (canal paresis %), VHIT (lateral semicircular canal gain) and SVINT (nystagmus slow phase velocity) recovered within normal values in 20%, 20%, 26% of cases respectively at T3 for the 40-patient group. Conclusions: Vascular risk factors (hypercholesterolemia) are correlated with patients who do not recover their symptoms either by healing or compensation. The evolution did not show any significant difference between high or low frequency vestibular tests in patients recovering from their symptoms. However, some patients with objective recovery may continue to show persisting subjective symptoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5399d0af4496f0ce2e06e6e8339775614fbd1ec28b0bfb77100192c63d47a634","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
