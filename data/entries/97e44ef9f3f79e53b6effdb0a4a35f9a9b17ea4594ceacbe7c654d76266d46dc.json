{"title":"Lifetime Exposure Model of Type 2 Diabetes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0139/v1","date":1714695815000,"content":"Type II diabetes (T2D) is a multifaceted metabolic disease influenced by various factors (genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and other). An alarming surge in T2D prevalence is estimated, reaching 700 million cases by 2045 worldwide. This review explores the complex interactions of multiple risk factors throughout life and offers a new perspective on T2D.  Genetic and epigenetic influences are described in detail. Prenatal factors, such as exposure to undernutrition and maternal overfeeding, induce lasting epigenetic changes, affecting T2D susceptibility. Furthermore, birthweight is a crude proxy for perinatal programming, with low and high birthweights associated with increased T2D risk. Often overlooked, the early postnatal period also significantly contributes to perinatal programming. Neonatal over-nutrition and feeding choices exert lasting effects on DNA methylation and metabolic outcomes later in life. Stress during this period further exacerbates T2D susceptibility. In continuation, childhood behaviors which are influenced by prior periods contribute substantially to T2D risk. Adverse childhood experiences amplify the risk of many diseases, including T2D. Sleep hygiene throughout life plays a role in metabolic health, influencing insulin resistance and appetite regulation. In adulthood, obesity remains a prominent predictor of T2D, with chronic stress contributing to weight gain and unhealthy lifestyle. This review proposes a novel perspective, considering T2D pathophysiology as a nonlinear process governed by numerous factors and their interactions throughout life. The inherent unpredictability suggests a need for personalized interventions tailored to specific risk profiles, emphasizing the importance of understanding gene-environment interactions and embracing a holistic view of T2D pathogenesis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97e44ef9f3f79e53b6effdb0a4a35f9a9b17ea4594ceacbe7c654d76266d46dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
