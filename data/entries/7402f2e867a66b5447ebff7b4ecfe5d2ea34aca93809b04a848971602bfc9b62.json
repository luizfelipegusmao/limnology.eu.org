{"title":"Unclear host taxonomy hinders parasite studies: An up‐to‐date checklist of the protozoan and metazoan parasites of Phoxinus minnows (Teleostei: Leuciscidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15894?af=R","date":1723278833000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Phoxinus</i> minnows are small freshwater fish found throughout Eurasia. The taxonomy of this genus is still under investigation, and new species are regularly described. They are frequently introduced outside their native range due to their use as live bait for angling, and such fish introductions can have diverse impacts on the recipient areas. Before the rise in interest regarding the diversity of this genus in the past 15 years, studies carried out on their biology and ecology reported their findings for the Eurasian minnow <i>Phoxinus phoxinus</i> Linnaeus, 1758, which was then considered ubiquitous. A parasites checklist for <i>Phoxinus</i> minnows has yet to be published, and the recent progress on the taxonomy of this genus has enabled us to propose a reassignment of parasite records to their proper host. The most thoroughly studied potential species were the North European species <i>Phoxinus</i> sp. 7 sensu Palandačić et al. 2017, <i>Phoxinus isetensis</i>, and <i>P. phoxinus</i>. We were able to highlight a gap in knowledge for numerous species that have received little-to-no attention in terms of parasitology. Systematic molecular identification of <i>Phoxinus</i> minnows should be conducted when studying their parasites, as a reliable identification of the host is vital in parasitology research. Future research will certainly reveal a species-specific composition of the parasitofauna occurring in <i>Phoxinus</i>, especially among widespread parasites such as <i>Gyrodactylus</i> and <i>Diplostomum</i>. Such specificities could even become tools for assessing the introduction routes of <i>Phoxinus</i> species.</p>","author":"Anaïs Esposito, \nGaël P. J.
