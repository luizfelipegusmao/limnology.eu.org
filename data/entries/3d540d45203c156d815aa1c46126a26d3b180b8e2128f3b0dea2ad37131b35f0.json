{"title":"The Generalized Eta Transformation Formulas as the Hecke Modular Relation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0963/v1","date":1710745975000,"content":"Transformation formula under the action of a general linear fractional transformation for generalized Dedekind eta-function has been a subject of intensive study, Rademacher, Dieter, Meyer et al. However, the (Hecke) modular relation structure has not been recognized until the work of Goldstein-de la Torre, and streamlining the classical proofs in the modular relation will reveal the meaning hidden in those works. Our main aim is to elucidate the works of these researchers in the context of modular relations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d540d45203c156d815aa1c46126a26d3b180b8e2128f3b0dea2ad37131b35f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
