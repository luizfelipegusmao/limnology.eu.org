{"title":"Mechanistic Insights into the Mutational Landscape of the Main Protease/3CLPro and Its Impact on Long-Term COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0536/v1","date":1720400705000,"content":"The main proteinase (Mpro), or 3CLpro, is a critical enzyme in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lifecycle and is responsible for breaking down and releasing vital functional viral proteins crucial for virus development and transmission. As a catalytically active dimer, its dimerization interface has become an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Recent research has extensively investigated the enzymatic activity of Mpro, focusing on its role in regulating the coronavirus replication complex and its significance in virus maturation and infectivity. Computational investigations have identified four druggable pockets, suggesting potential allosteric sites beyond the substrate-binding region. Empirical validation through site-directed alanine mutagenesis targeted residues in both the active and allosteric regions corroborated these predictions. Structural studies of drug target proteins can inform therapeutic approaches, with metadynamics simulations shedding light on the role of H163 in regulating Mpro function and providing insights into its dynamic equilibrium to the wild-type enzyme. Despite the efficacy of vaccines and drugs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread, ongoing viral evolution, selective pressures, and continued transmission pose challenges, potentially leading to resistance mutations. Phylogenetic analyses indicated the existence of several resistance variations predating drug introduction to the human population, emphasizing the likelihood of drug spread. Hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry reveals the structural influence of the mutation, while clinical trials on 3CLPro inhibitors underscore the clinical significance of reduced enzymatic activity and offer avenues for future therapeutic exploration. Understanding the implications of 3CLPro mutations holds promise for shaping forthcoming therapeutic strategies against COVID-19. This review delves into factors influencing mutation rates and identifies areas warranting further investigation, providing a comprehensive overview of Mpro mutations, their categorization, and terminology. Moreover, we examined their associations with clinical outcomes, illness severity, unresolved issues, and future research prospects, including their impact on vaccine efficacy and potential therapeutic targeting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f831183dcb18d1671a090a530ce1c06746f8205e2eb64104b463b8c9bf565e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
