{"title":"Visceral Leishmaniasis Following A+AVD Treatment in a Patient with Classical Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma: Case Report and Review of the Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1069/v1","date":1723636769000,"content":"We report the case of a 45-year-old Caucasian man who was treated upfront with brentuximab vedotin (A) and doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD; A+AVD) for advanced-stage classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL). Right after completing the 6th cycle of induction therapy, he developed serotine fever, progressive clinical deterioration, symptomatic splenomegaly and se-vere anemia. Extensive infectious disease evaluations and serial PET scans were conducted to rule out lymphoma progression. Finally, a diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was performed. The patient was treated with parenteral amphotericin B, with rapid and complete resolution of clinical and laboratory abnormalities. We described this rare case of infectious complication after A+AVD delivered for cHL, and we performed a comprehensive review of the literature on the occurrence of VL in the context of non-HL and cHL, since this infection is becoming increasingly prevalent in non-tropical countries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16652cf7118e8c0b7eb16758075bdfa11d2c863de7a611bf21e8f884e7323652","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
