{"title":"Historical GIS Insights into Xi&#039;an Urban Spatial Structure: Centralization, Expansion, and Modern Planning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0778/v1","date":1728613918000,"content":"This study uses Historical Geographic Information Systemsand spatial analysis methods like Space Syntax and Kernel Density Estimation to examine the urban spatial evolution of Xi'an from the Five Dynasties (907 CE) to the early People's Republic of China (1949 CE). By focusing on six historical periods, it reveals the city's transition from a centralized layout to a decentralized, multi-center form. The research shows that Xi'an's spatial structure was shaped by political, economic, cultural, and environmental forces. The Ming and Qing dynasties, in particular, saw economic diversification and the influence of the Silk Road, driving the city's outward expansion and the formation of multiple functional zones. The study also discusses how these historical changes offer valuable lessons for modern urban planning, particularly in balancing cultural heritage preservation with modernization. Overall, the findings provide fresh insights into the long-term urban development of historic cities and offer practical strategies for modern urban planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0435ebacd3757bb9300ca57d35256e60e2b4f3be34f21db2054a93c176d25b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
