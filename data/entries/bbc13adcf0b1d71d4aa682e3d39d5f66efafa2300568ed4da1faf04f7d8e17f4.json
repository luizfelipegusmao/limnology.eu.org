{"title":"Importance Sampling for Cost-Optimized Estimation of Burn-Probability Maps in Wildfire Monte Carlo Simulations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0879/v1","date":1728637375000,"content":"Background: wildfire modelers rely on Monte-Carlo simulations of wildland fire to produce burn-probability maps. These simulations are computationally expensive. Methods: we study the application of Importance Sampling to accelerating the estimation of burn probability maps, using L2 distance as the metric of deviation. Results: assuming a large area of interest, we prove that the optimal proposal distribution re-weights the probability of ignitions by the square root of expected burned area divided by expected computational cost, then generalize these results to assets-weighted L2 distance. We also propose a practical approach to searching for a good proposal distribution. Conclusion: these findings contribute quantitative methods for optimizing the precision/computation ratio of wildfire Monte Carlo simulations without biasing results, offer a principled conceptual framework for justifying and reasoning about other computational shortcuts, and can be readily generalized to a broader spectrum of simulation-based risk modeling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbc13adcf0b1d71d4aa682e3d39d5f66efafa2300568ed4da1faf04f7d8e17f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
