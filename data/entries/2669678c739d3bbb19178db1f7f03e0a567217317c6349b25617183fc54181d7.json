The system boundaries for the two comprised scenarios included the storage of the produced non-agriculture source material (NASM), transportation to an applicable location, land application of the NASM, and the impacts of the final emissions to the soil and groundwater for a full year. The Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) v2.1 was selected as the impact assessment method. Furthermore, SimaPro 8.0.4.26 was the LCA model version that was used with all the databases included. Overall, the LCA study showed that the most significant environmental impacts associated with the disposal process resulted from carcinogenic and eutrophication emissions. The component that contributed the most to carcinogenic impacts was found to be from the material required to create the concrete storage tank. Additionally, eutrophication was identified to be a potential significant impact, if proper setback requirements are not followed for the NASM material. Results of the study look to inform stakeholders about the benefits and risks encountered from NASM disposal.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nLife cycle assessment was completed on a representative NASM disposal system using land application.\nConcrete tank used for storage of NASM had the most significant impact in carcinogenic emissions.\nEutrophication impacts were the second most significant impact behind carcinogenic emissions.\n</p>","author":"Connor Dunlop, \nBassim Abbassi, \nRichard G.
