{"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Biotechnology Education: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Gemini and ChatGPT in Laboratory Training","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2085/v1","date":1724849197000,"content":"AI integration is becoming more important in today’s world and could potentially be very useful in the life sciences and biotechnology. This study evaluates the effectiveness of AI systems in teaching molecular cloning techniques to newcomers in molecular biology, focusing on a comparison between Gemini Advanced (powered by Gemini Ultra 1.0) and ChatGPT (GPT-4o). Molecular or DNA cloning is a lab technique for creating multiple copies of a specific DNA segment. It involves isolating the DNA fragment, inserting it into a vector, and introducing it into a host cell, typically bacteria, which then generates numerous copies of the DNA. This essential technique underpins genetic engineering, allowing for gene study, protein expression, and the creation of genetically modified organisms. The primary objective of this study was to assess whether individuals with limited laboratory experience could effectively acquire a specific molecular biology skill set solely through an AI system, rather than relying on the more traditional ‘learning by shadowing’ approach. Participants with limited lab experience completed these tasks using both Gemini and GPT-4o, and evaluated on quality of instructions, conciseness, scientific accuracy, and user satisfaction. Results indicated that both AI systems demonstrated strengths in delivering clear and comprehensive instructions, but in different ways. Gemini, although more interactive with images and diagrams lacked directness and had a harder time keeping past steps in its “memory”. On the other hand, GPT-4o was much more direct and concise in the steps listed and had more accurate results akin to what is performed in the lab. This study underscores the potential of AI-driven tools to simplify complex biotechnological procedures, making them accessible for learners at all levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c892d20f2852809278808b14e5c1d5f6f4f62edf9a7cf2013046e82ca2e1abe8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
