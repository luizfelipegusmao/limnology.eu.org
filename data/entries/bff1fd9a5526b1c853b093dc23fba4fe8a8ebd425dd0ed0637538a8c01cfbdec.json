The primary objective of this study was to compare patients who were not treated to patients who were treated.  Identifying potential reasons for the failure to treat can provide a pathway to interventions using evidence-based data. \nMethods: The electronic medical records in an urban predominately African American (AA) population were searched for all patients with HCV seen at least once in a GI or ID clinic 2019. Data collected included demographics, treatment visits, laboratory, insurance, and ZIP codes for median income.\nResults: Of the 441 patients who were not yet treated at the first 2019 visit, only 43% were treated by July 2020.  Insurance and median income were not factors in failure to treat. Patients with an average of 4 visits were more likely to be treated than those with 2 or less thus confirming that failure to follow up was a significant factor for patient treatment (42% vs 8% p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bff1fd9a5526b1c853b093dc23fba4fe8a8ebd425dd0ed0637538a8c01cfbdec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
