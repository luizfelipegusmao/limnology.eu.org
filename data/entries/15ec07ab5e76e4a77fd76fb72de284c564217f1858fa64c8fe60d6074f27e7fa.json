Combined with the ability to epitaxially integrate these materials with silicon, they are leading candidates for applications spanning from photocatalysts to data storage. Here I will show how thin film epitaxy can be used to selectively stabilize materials which are not stable in the bulk form. I will show our results combining atomically-precise thin film deposition with picoscale electron microscopy imaging performed by Prof. Lena Kourkoutis’ group to develop new nickelate based superconductors. Our talk will highlight Lena’s exceptional contributions to the development of new oxide materials through interrogation of the local structure, electronic properties and defect chemistry [<a href=\"#ozae044.1066-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"15ec07ab5e76e4a77fd76fb72de284c564217f1858fa64c8fe60d6074f27e7fa","category":"Environment"}
