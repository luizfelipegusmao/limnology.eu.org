{"title":"A mechanical transition from tension to buckling underlies the jigsaw puzzle shape morphogenesis of histoblasts in the <i>Drosophila</i> epidermis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002662","date":1718287200000,"content":"<p>by Annafrancesca Rigato, Huicheng Meng, Claire Chardes, Adam Runions, Faris Abouakil, Richard S. Smith, Lo√Øc LeGoff</p>\r\n\r\nThe polygonal shape of cells in proliferating epithelia is a result of the tensile forces of the cytoskeletal cortex and packing geometry set by the cell cycle. In the larval <i>Drosophila</i> epidermis, two cell populations, histoblasts and larval epithelial cells, compete for space as they grow on a limited body surface. They do so in the absence of cell divisions. We report a striking morphological transition of histoblasts during larval development, where they change from a tensed network configuration with straight cell outlines at the level of adherens junctions to a highly folded morphology. The apical surface of histoblasts shrinks while their growing adherens junctions fold, forming deep lobules. Volume increase of growing histoblasts is accommodated basally, compensating for the shrinking apical area. The folded geometry of apical junctions resembles elastic buckling, and we show that the imbalance between the shrinkage of the apical domain of histoblasts and the continuous growth of junctions triggers buckling. Our model is supported by laser dissections and optical tweezer experiments together with computer simulations. Our analysis pinpoints the ability of histoblasts to store mechanical energy to a much greater extent than most other epithelial cell types investigated so far, while retaining the ability to dissipate stress on the hours time scale. Finally, we propose a possible mechanism for size regulation of histoblast apical size through the lateral pressure of the epidermis, driven by the growth of cells on a limited surface. Buckling effectively compacts histoblasts at their apical plane and may serve to avoid physical harm to these adult epidermis precursors during larval life. Our work indicates that in growing nondividing cells, compressive forces, instead of tension, may drive cell morphology.","author":"Annafrancesca Rigato","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"f2b857cb1e854cc36fa23966536f1e73d0cd543a5ba6ce27e0f1612e05c517a1","category":"Environment"}
