{"title":"JOINTLESS Maintains Inflorescence Meristem Identity in Tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/7/1197/7650999?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>JOINTLESS</span> (<span>J</span>) was isolated in tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) from mutants lacking a flower pedicel abscission zone (AZ) and encodes a MADS-box protein of the SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE/AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 subfamily. The loss of <span>J</span> function also causes the return to leaf initiation in the inflorescences, indicating a pivotal role in inflorescence meristem identity. Here, we compared <strong><span>jointless</span></strong> (<span>j</span>) mutants in different accessions that exhibit either an indeterminate shoot growth, producing regular sympodial segments, or a determinate shoot growth, due to the reduction of sympodial segments and causal mutation of the <span>SELF-PRUNING</span> (<span>SP</span>) gene. We observed that the inflorescence phenotype of <span>j</span> mutants is stronger in indeterminate (<span>SP</span>) accessions such as <strong>Ailsa Craig</strong> (AC), than in determinate (<span>sp</span>) ones, such as <strong>Heinz</strong> (Hz). Moreover, RNA-seq analysis revealed that the return to vegetative fate in <span>j</span> mutants is accompanied by expression of <span>SP</span>, which supports conversion of the inflorescence meristem to sympodial shoot meristem in <span>j</span> inflorescences. Other markers of vegetative meristems such as <span>APETALA2c</span> and branching genes such as <span>BRANCHED 1</span> (<span>BRC1a/b</span>) were differentially expressed in the inflorescences of <span>j</span>(AC) mutant. We also found in the indeterminate AC accession that <span>J</span> represses homeotic genes of B- and C-classes and that its overexpression causes an oversized leafy calyx phenotype and has a dominant negative effect on AZ formation. A model is therefore proposed where <span>J</span>, by repressing shoot fate and influencing reproductive organ formation, acts as a key determinant of inflorescence meristems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"05f050b78a5506f51c7756716a3f0c1bef28532bb8c1eb497f37f52134d848b0","category":"Environment"}
