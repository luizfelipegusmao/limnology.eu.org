{"title":"Sweetpotato cultivation: characteristics, constraints and preferred traits of producers and consumers in Côte d'Ivoire","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.12923?af=R","date":1715852592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>In an environment where the adoption of improved varieties resulting from plant breeding programs is limited, it is essential to identify end-user preferences beforehand. A participatory survey was conducted in eight localities in Korhogo and Bouaké regions (central and northern Cote d'Ivoire respectively) to identify producers' preferences and increase the adoption of improved varieties. The study involved 160 producers and consumers through focus group discussions and individual interviews.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Sweetpotato is mostly grown on small plots (&lt;1 ha) of land (89.2%), with women (66%) as the main producers. In the Bouaké region, sweetpotatoes are grown on mounds (100%), whereas in Korhogo they are grown on ridges (86.2%). The main food products or forms of preparation from roots are fries (34.7%), boiled (34.3%), mashed (12.4%), and sweetpotato stew (9.1%). Major constraints, including low price of roots (26.3%), low productivity (16.2%), and post-harvest storage issues (14.5%), were identified as affecting sweetpotato production.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>The selection of new varieties should be oriented towards high-yielding varieties with high dry matter content, deployed stems, and roots of round, oblong, or elliptical shape with good culinary characteristics (dry matter, sweet taste, dry texture, absence of fiber). Plants must be drought resistant, be tolerant to poor soil, diseases, and pests, and have a good yield. The color of skin and flesh of the sweetpotato, although constituting criteria of choice, are not essential for the acceptance or the rejection of a variety by users. © 2023 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jean Hugues Martial Kouassi, \nKonan Evrard Brice Dibi, \nMambé Auguste‐Dénise Boye, \nBrice Sidoine Essis, \nAmani Michel Kouakou, \nBoni N'zué, \nDominique Dufour","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"cb5c029739da1a21621000880921a778758aa80676d8314f0a98d4f4e393cd89","category":"Environment"}
