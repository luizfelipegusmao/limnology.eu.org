{"title":"Biomass Utilization for Energy Generation in Post-Disaster Scenarios: The Case of Puerto Rico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0891/v1","date":1723531828000,"content":"Puerto Rico's geographic and climatic conditions render it highly susceptible to natural disasters, particularly hurricanes. The devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017 highlighted the fragility of the island's centralized energy infrastructure, which led to prolonged power outages and severe disruptions in essential services. This review explores the potential of biomass energy to enhance resilience in post-disaster scenarios, focusing on Puerto Rico as a case study. Biomass energy, derived from organic materials like agricultural residues, woody biomass, and municipal solid waste, offers a renewable and locally sourced power solution that can be rapidly deployed. Key biomass conversion technologies, including direct combustion, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and pyrolysis, are examined for their applicability and benefits in emergency energy provision. The implementation of biomass-powered microgrids in Puerto Rico, such as those by Casa Pueblo and Arensis, demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of decentralized energy systems in disaster recovery. These microgrids provide reliable power to critical infrastructure, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and support waste management efforts. The review also discusses ongoing research and development in advanced biomass technologies, such as second-generation biofuels, algae-based biomass, and biomass-to-hydrogen conversion, which can further enhance energy efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, the economic, environmental, and social impacts of biomass energy are evaluated, highlighting its role in job creation, waste reduction, emission control, and community resilience. Policy recommendations include streamlining permitting processes, enhancing financial incentives, developing feedstock supply chains, and incorporating biomass into disaster recovery plans. The findings suggest that integrating biomass energy into Puerto Ricoâ€™s energy strategy can significantly improve its capacity to respond to and recover from natural disasters, promoting long-term sustainability and resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9444f9e86ff9b1280eae88a571916589a96ceae0c254cfa28b0f5c835da4e8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
