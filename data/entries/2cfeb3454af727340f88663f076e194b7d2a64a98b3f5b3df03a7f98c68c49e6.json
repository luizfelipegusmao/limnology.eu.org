{"title":"Measuring Stress in Later Adulthood: Examining the Psychometric Properties of the Revised Stress Assessment Inventory for Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0435/v1","date":1722952667000,"content":"Background: Research suggests that cognitive and behavioural factors, including lifestyle behaviours, contribute to the mitigation of perceived stress and stress-related health outcomes in later life. Given that stress management and lifestyle behaviour interventions for older adults are an important target for healthcare efforts, there is a need to comprehensively measure stress and coping resources in later adulthood. Additionally, researchers need a relatively short, standardized assessment tool that can robustly measure stress and coping for longitudinal and intervention-based studies to reduce burden on participants and for cross-comparison across research. Methods: The Stress Assessment Inventory (SAI), a valid and reliable 123-item measure designed to assess occupational stress and coping resources in younger adults was examined in 294 independent older adults. Results: A shortened and revised SAI is proposed for older adults, with good internal consistency and strong criterion validity. The revised SAI for older adults was found to have a 4-factor model that captures Adaptive Cognitive Resources, Maladaptive Behavioural and Cognitive Habits, Social Support and Adaptive Health Habits. Conclusion: The current study supports the use of the inventory in community-dwelling older adult populations as a comprehensive tool to assess stress and coping for use by researchers and healthcare professionals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2cfeb3454af727340f88663f076e194b7d2a64a98b3f5b3df03a7f98c68c49e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
