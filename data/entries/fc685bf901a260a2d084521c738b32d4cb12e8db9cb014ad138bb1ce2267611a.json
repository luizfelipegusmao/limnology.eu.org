To make these inferences, data from extant primates and xenarthras representing suspensory, climbing and digging forms were compared. The results indicate niche differentiation existed between these species; <i>Ahytherium aureum</i>, <i>Australonyx aquae</i> and <i>Nothrotherium maquinense</i> could have been climbers, <i>Catonyx cuvieri</i>, <i>Ocnotherium giganteum</i> and <i>Glossotherium phoenesis</i> were diggers, while <i>Valgipes bucklandi</i> and <i>Eremotherium laurillardi</i> were strictly terrestrial in their habits. These results suggest a general pattern in which members of the Megalonychidae and Nothotheriidae were mainly climbers, whereas mylodontines were mainly diggers, and scelidotheres were strictly terrestrial along with members of the giant Megatheriidae.</p>","author":"Adaiana Marta Andrade Santos, \nH.
