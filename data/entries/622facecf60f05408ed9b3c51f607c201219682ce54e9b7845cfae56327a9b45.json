{"title":"Critical Challenges in the Anodizing Process of Aluminium -Silicon Cast Alloys&mdash;A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1005/v1","date":1718366402000,"content":"The microstructure of the substrate plays a crucial role in the anodizing process. Anodizing cast aluminum alloys is quite challenging due to the higher levels of alloying elements present compared to pure aluminum. Elements such as silicon, iron, and copper significantly impact the growth and quality of the anodic layer. Additionally, anodizing parameters such as electrolyte composition, current density, and temperature are critical in determining the morphology and thickness of the anodic film. The casting process, surface condition, and post-treatment also affect the properties of the anodic layer. Optimizing these parameters is essential to achieve a durable and high-quality anodic layer. This work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various factors affecting the anodizing of cast aluminum alloys and the properties of the anodic layer, including its thickness, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"622facecf60f05408ed9b3c51f607c201219682ce54e9b7845cfae56327a9b45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
