High-resolution images provided by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are invaluable for examining surface details at the micro to nanoscale. However, when analyzing 3D structures, conventional SEM images fall short as they cannot adequately capture the third dimension. This limitation is particularly critical in applications where the 3D topology of a surface plays a pivotal role, such as in the analysis of laser-restructured electrodes in energy devices, where surface morphology directly impacts performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"aff4558dc9fbcf03c335c41825cb9d5525b04036977682c03f83e57f4f7a04c3","category":"Environment"}
