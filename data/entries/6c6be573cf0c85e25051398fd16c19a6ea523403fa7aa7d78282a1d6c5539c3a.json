{"title":"Peptide AEDL and Glutathione Stimulates Root Development Nicotiana tabacum","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1625/v1","date":1729523391000,"content":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential molecules involved in intercellular communication, signal transduction and metabolic processes. Abiotic stresses cause accumulation of excess ROS in plant cells. The issues of regulation of antioxidant protection of plants by natural and synthetic compounds with antioxidant activity still remain one of the important and relevant areas of fundamental and applied research. Glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in stress resistance and redox homeostasis of the cell and effectively protects the cell from stress-induced generation of ROS. An increase in the GSH content in plant cells can contribute to an increase in plant resistance to various types of stressors. However, an increase in the GSH content in plants can negatively affect their growth and development. We have shown that growing Nicotiana tabacum in the presence of tetrapeptide AEDL contributes to an increase in the GSH content by 3.24 times. At the same time, the tobacco plant was more developed, especially its root system. A scheme of the mechanism of regulation of the redox balance in the stem cell niche and the participation of the peptide AEDL and GSH in the regulation of the fate of stem cells was proposed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c6be573cf0c85e25051398fd16c19a6ea523403fa7aa7d78282a1d6c5539c3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
