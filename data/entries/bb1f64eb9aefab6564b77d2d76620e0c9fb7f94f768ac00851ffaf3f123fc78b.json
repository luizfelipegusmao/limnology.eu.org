For example, the critical temperature of Nb3Sn reduces by half for less than a 5% change in the atomic Sn concentration [<a href=\"#ozae044.114-B1\">1</a>]. Sn-deficient grains are commonplace with current growth methods [<a href=\"#ozae044.114-B2\">2</a>]. Previously, Slice and View tomography has been attempted on Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn. However, the EDS resolution was not sufficient to measure and quantify the Sn-deficient regions in the Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn film [<a href=\"#ozae044.114-B3\">3</a>]. Another common defect impacting superconductivity is the anti-site defect pair, for which theoretical calculations have shown the lowest energy formation [<a href=\"#ozae044.114-B4\">4</a>]. However, the experimental visualization of anti-site defects in Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn has yet to be reported. To address these questions, in this work, we combine electron imaging and X-ray spectroscopy across multiple length scales. By collecting different types of signals carrying complementary properties, a more complete and improved understanding of the materialâ€™s structure and composition can be achieved [<a href=\"#ozae044.114-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bb1f64eb9aefab6564b77d2d76620e0c9fb7f94f768ac00851ffaf3f123fc78b","category":"Environment"}
