{"title":"Synergistic Impact of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus coagulans on Solid‐State Fermentation of Astragalus and Effects of Fermentation Products on Disease Resistance of Crucian Carp (Carassius auratus)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/1842572?af=R","date":1675756800000,"content":"<p>Dietary supplementation with fermentation products of <i>Astragalus</i> can enhance the immune function of aquaculture animals. We explored the synergistic effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Bacillus coagulans</i> on the solid-state fermentation of <i>Astragalus</i> to investigate whether feeding fermentation products to crucian carp can improve disease resistance. The optimal ratio of <i>Astragalus</i> + (<i>L. plantarum</i> + <i>B. coagulans</i>) (ALB), temperature, and number was 3 : 3, 37°C, and 1.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/g, respectively. After 48 h mixed fermentation, the number of probiotics increased to 2.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/g, pH decreased to 3.2, and high molecular weight proteins disintegrated into small molecular weight or soluble proteins. In addition, several holes appeared on the <i>Astragalus</i> surface<i>.</i> Compared with unfermented <i>Astragalus</i>, the content of <i>Astragalus</i> polysaccharide and calycosin increased by 3.82- and 1.31-fold, respectively, on fermentation and that of total <i>Astragalus</i> saponins decreased by 0.77-fold. Furthermore, on Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2) and <i>Aeromonas veronii</i> (<i>A. veronii</i>) challenges, the cumulative survival rates of crucian carp fed common feed and ALB were 80.00% and 65.00%, respectively. Overall, feeding mixed fermentation products to crucian carp positively impacted their health and disease resistance. We believe that our results provide theoretical guidance for developing effective plant-based agents to prevent diseases in crucian carp.</p>","author":"Lisha Shi, \nMingyang Xue, \nChen Xu, \nNan Jiang, \nYuding Fan, \nJianwu Chen, \nWei Liu, \nYeying Wu, \nLingbing Zeng, \nYong Zhou, \nIoannis Vatsos","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"01b7cca0fe56b63cb6485c1122502a14a4a9cc1fb57bcf9a3df8421102244abc","category":"Environment"}
