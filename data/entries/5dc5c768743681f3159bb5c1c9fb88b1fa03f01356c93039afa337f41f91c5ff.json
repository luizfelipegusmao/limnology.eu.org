{"title":"Microscopic Image Dataset with Segmentation and Detection Labels for Microplastic Analysis in Sewage: Enhancing Research and Environmental Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1478/v1","date":1713865110000,"content":"We introduce a novel microscopic image dataset augmented with segmentation and detection labels specifically designed for microplastic analysis in sewage environments. Recognizing the increasing concern over microplastics — particles of synthetic polymers smaller than 5mm — and their detrimental effects on marine ecosystems and human health, our research focuses on enhancing detection and analytical methodologies through advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. The dataset comprises high-resolution microscopic images of microplastics collected from sewage, meticulously labeled for both segmentation and detection tasks, aiming to facilitate accurate and efficient identification and quantification of microplastic pollution. In addition to dataset development, we present example deep learning models optimized for segmentation and detection of microplastics within complex sewage samples. The models demonstrate significant potential in automating the analysis of microplastic contamination, offering a scalable solution to environmental monitoring challenges. Furthermore, we ensure the accessibility and reproducibility of our research by making the dataset and model codes publicly available, accompanied by detailed documentation on GitHub and LabelBox. The dataset and example deep learning models are publicly available at the following GitHub link. https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Microplastics-in-Sewage-1BEF","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5dc5c768743681f3159bb5c1c9fb88b1fa03f01356c93039afa337f41f91c5ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
