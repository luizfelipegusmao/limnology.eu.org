{"title":"Viruses Identified in Shrews (Soricidae) and Their Biomedical Significance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2145/v1","date":1724926435000,"content":"Shrews (Soricidae) are common small wild mammals. Some species of shrews, such as Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus), have a significant overlap in their habitats with humans and domestic animals. Currently, over 190 species of viruses in 32 families, including Adenoviridae, Arenaviridae, Arteriviridae, Astroviridae, Anelloviridae, Bornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Chuviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Hantaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Hepeviridae, Nairoviridae, Nodaviridae, Orthoherpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Phenuiviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Sedoreoviridae, Spinareoviridae, and three unclassified families, have been identified in shrews. Diverse shrew viruses, such as Borna disease virus 1, Langya virus, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, cause diseases in humans and/or domestic animals, posing significant threats to public health and animal health. This review compiled fundamental information about shrews and provided a comprehensive summary of the viruses that have been detected in shrews, with the aim of facilitating a deep understanding of shrews and the diversity, epidemiology, and risks of their viruses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"696fd1426d3367aeea9a24ebc0464966757f6a5dce01043eb914ab9b5992a1d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
