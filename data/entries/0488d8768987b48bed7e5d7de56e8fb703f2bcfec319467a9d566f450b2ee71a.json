At approximately 160 °C, fresnoite undergoes a transition from a commensurate tetragonal structure to an incommensurate structure, significantly impacting its physical properties, including piezoelectric and pyroelectric coefficients [<a href=\"#ozae044.747-B1\">1</a>]. Recent findings have revealed that the incommensurate structural modulation induces phasons—a type of quasiparticle excitation—that not only enhances fresnoite’s thermal conductivity but also facilitates the transmission of thermal energy at a velocity approximately four times faster than the speed of sound in this material [<a href=\"#ozae044.747-B2\">2–3</a>]. This remarkable discovery emphasizes the necessity for a detailed analysis to clarify the incommensurate structure of fresnoite further.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0488d8768987b48bed7e5d7de56e8fb703f2bcfec319467a9d566f450b2ee71a","category":"Environment"}
