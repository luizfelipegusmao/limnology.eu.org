{"title":"Protective Effects of Dietary Etlingera elatior (Jack) Bud Flower Powder against Edwardsiella tarda Infection in African Catfish, Clarias gariepinus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/1754005?af=R","date":1725025675000,"content":"<p>This study investigates the impacts of dietary <i>Etlingera elatior</i> (Jack) bud flower powder (EE) supplementation on the growth and health status of African catfish, <i>Clarias gariepinus</i>. Each treatment group received different formulated diets: basal diet without EE (control), basal diet + 1% EE (EE1), basal diet + 2% EE (EE2), basal diet + 3% EE (EE3), and basal diet + 4% EE (EE4). After an 8-week feeding trial, fish supplemented with dietary EE exhibited significantly improved growth performance, such as weight gain (WG; 1,251.4%–1,604.3%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), specific growth rate (SGR; 2.02%–2.20%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and final weight (FW; 141.7–178.9 g; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than the control group (WG: 1,192.0%, SGR: 1.98%, and FW: 136.1 g), particularly EE2 and EE3. Furthermore, EE-treated fish recorded significantly lower feed conversion rate (FCR; 1.19–1.53; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), viscerosomatic index (VSI; 3.40%–4.50%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and hepatosomatic index (HSI; 3.13%–4.40%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than the control (FCR: 1.59, VSI: 5.48%, and HSI: 4.75%), particularly EE2 and EE3. The EE-treated fish also had significantly higher white blood cell (WBC) count (124.6–148.6/<i>µ</i>L; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0400), red blood cell (RBC) count (2.43–4.03 × 10<sup>3</sup>/<i>µ</i>L; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0002), hemoglobin (HGB) concentration (6.27–7.87 g/dL; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0160), and hematocrit (HCT; 26.8%–38.7%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0200) compared to the control (WBC count: 112.1/<i>µ</i>L, RBC count: 2.17 ×10<sup>3</sup>/<i>µ</i>L, HGB concentration: 5.60 g/dL, and HCT: 23.7%), with the highest being EE2 and EE3. Dietary EE diets enhanced digestive enzyme activities, including amylase (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0090), protease (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0040), and lipase (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0060), significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) than the control, where EE2 and EE3 demonstrated the highest activities. The EE supplementation also significantly improved the fish’s antioxidative responses, particularly catalase (CAT; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0100), glutathione peroxidase (GPx; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0300), and superoxide dismutase (SOD; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0100) in EE2 and EE3. Similarly, the cumulative survival rate of EE2 (66.7% ± 5.77%) and EE3 (66.7% ± 5.77%) were significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) higher than other groups post-<i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> challenge. Therefore, this study findings highlighted the potential benefits of EE as a feed additive to boost the production in African catfish farming.</p>","author":"Seong Wei Lee, \nVui Kien Liew, \nZulhisyam Abdul Kari, \nMuhammad Anamul Kabir, \nM.
