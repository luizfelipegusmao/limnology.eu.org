{"title":"Aptamer and Electrochemical Aptasensor towards Selenate Ions (SeO42-)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1700/v1","date":1716801855000,"content":"Selenium is one of the inorganic compounds in human and animal nutrition and is involved in the proper functioning of the body. As a micronutrient, it actively contributes to the regulation of various metabolic activities, i.e., thyroid hormone, and protection against oxidative stress and cancer. Selenium anion also plays an essential role in the mechanism of immunity to viral infec-tions. However, this element can also be hazardous, especially in high concentrations. The toxicity of selenium is strongly associated with its chemical form. Se exhibits a narrow concentration window from having a positive to exerting a toxic effect. The daily uptake for humans is in the range of 55-400 µg/day. In higher doses (of the order of 900-1000 µg/day), it negatively affects the human body and causes DNA damage through the formation of free radicals. Increased reactivity of Se anion can also disrupt the integrity and function of DNA-repairing proteins. As the permis-sible concentration of Se in drinking water is 10 µg/L, it is vital to develop sensitive and robust methods of Se detection in aqueous samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9faeab7648b7900be4035b44f2ec55d146a4c6c72485a00b5159a484d51fda75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
