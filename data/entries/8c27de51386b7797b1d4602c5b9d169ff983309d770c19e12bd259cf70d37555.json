The cold <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Classics</a> and their bone-jittering cobblestones. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> exploding into life with exploits from Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) and Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), then last-day shenanigans from Ineos Grenadiers’ Geraint Thomas as he led out Astana Qazaqstan’s Mark Cavendish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a> became the first team in history to achieve a Grand Tour sweep thanks to Primož Roglič, Jonas Vingegaard and Sepp Kuss. Ineos Grenadiers’ Josh Tarling has particularly impressed this year, the 19-year-old British ITT Champion shining with a bronze medal in the Elite Men’s World ITT Championship<strong>. </strong>His first win arrived on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-vuelta-espana-1\" target=\"_blank\">Stage 2 of the Renewi Tour</a>, where he became the joint youngest WorldTour stage winner (alongside Remco Evenepoel, no less), as he was later crowned the European ITT Champion and closed his year with victory at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vittoria-bussi-uci-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Chrono des Nations</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end of a cycling season inevitably marks retirements too, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/thibaut-pinot\" target=\"_blank\">Thibaut Pinot</a> (Groupama-FDJ), Greg van Avermaet (AG2R-Citroën) and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/peter-sagan\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Sagan</a> (Team TotalEnergies) all hanging up their cycling cleats. Or in the case of Sagan, just his road-specific ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year was also not without its tragedy. The loss of Bahrain Victorious’ Gino Mäder is so painful, and no doubt still felt by his family, friends and cycling fans worldwide. As you’ll see in this article, his teammates are continuing to honour him, with post-stage tributes from Matej Mohorič and fundraising from Pello Bilbao.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are my choices for the ten most memorable moments from the 2023 men’s pro season.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-retirements\">End of an era: All the road cycling greats retiring this year</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-retirement-delay\">Mark Cavendish delays retirement to race for one more year in 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sepp-kuss-vuelta-a-espana\">Nice guys finish first: The Sepp Kuss effect</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>1.

A solo attack from 50km out, an audacious group breakaway that outfoxes the bunch in the final kilometres, a tyre-width sprint victory. Some riders are forced to wait minutes for confirmation, suspended in a limbo of uncertainty, such is the closeness of their competitors at the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one side of the scale is an eventually crowned victor, who explodes into the wide range of emotions they had been holding back – screaming, celebrating, crying – while on the other side sits someone who was so close, yet so far. It’s not often a cyclist uses their time to dissect this equation in their post-stage interview. Enter Bahrain-Victorious’s Matej Mohorič after winning Stage 19 of the 2023 Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>\"Not just for myself, but for 𝙂𝙞𝙣𝙤, and the team.\"<br /><br />Incredible interview from Stage 19 winner Matej Mohoric, on finding a way to keep going and get across the line <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matmohoric?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@matmohoric</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BHRVictorious?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@BHRVictorious</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TdF2023?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#TdF2023</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rEYjN6k2kq\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/rEYjN6k2kq</a></p>— Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurosport/status/1682417319358636033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">July 21, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sometimes you feel like you don’t belong here,’ he said in the emotional scene. ‘Everyone is so incredibly strong that you struggle to hold the wheel sometimes. You know the guy who is pulling is suffering just as much as you. Kasper [Asgreen, Soudal-QuickStep] went and he’s so incredibly strong. He went on the attack yesterday and won the stage. To have the win and the determination to do it all over again… you just feel like you don’t belong here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I followed him. I knew everything had to be perfect. I tried my best, not just for myself but also for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-tour-de-suisse\" target=\"_blank\">Gino [Mäder]</a> and the team. Then at the end you almost feel like you betray them because you beat them to the line. The way professional sport is, everyone wants to win and obviously if I want to win, I need to take the wheel of Kasper and try to beat him on the line. At one point I felt sorry for Ben [O’Connor, AG2R Citroën Team] because I knew he had no chance in the sprint. but he still pushed to stay away because he also wants to contest the win even though he knows he’s likely to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I always know I can win a Tour de France stage because I have already won two. I’m strong enough but so are the other 150 guys. I’m not the only one who can win a Tour de France stage and every single rider at this moment would deserve a win. I saw the faces of those in the gruppetto the other day on Col de la Loze and you know what everyone is going through. I know how much a win can change your life and I wish everyone could win a Tour de France stage but it’s just not possible and that’s cruel, no?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To articulate such humanity in the heat of sports is an admirable quality indeed, and to express his conflicting emotions and empathy for his rivals contributed to one of the best, if not the best, interviews from a professional cyclist that I have ever seen. It’s something I will continue to think about for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Geraint Thomas leads out Mark Cavendish to ‘help a brother out’ at the Giro d’Italia</h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stage 21, Giro d’Italia, 28th May 2023</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The role of a leadout man is simple (on paper). With their designated sprinter on their wheel, they give it their all to drop off their teammate who – should things go to plan – sprints to the victory. But Stage 21 of the Giro d’Italia was different. Ineos Grenadiers’ Geraint Thomas proved you don’t have to be racing on the same squad to provide a successful leadout, and that a friendship extending across rival teams will do just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the chaos that preceded the sprint finish, Thomas spoke to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish</a> (Astana Qazaqstan) just prior to the 2km-to-go point. He then hit the front to set a storming pace as Cavendish’s teammate Luis León Sánchez latched onto his wheel, with Cavendish following. Thomas peeled away at the 1km mark. After that, no one could keep up with Cavendish’s pace in the final metres, and the Manx Missile crossed the line in what was then his final Giro d’Italia. (He has since signed a one-year extension.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the race, Thomas said to Eurosport, ‘I saw he only had Luis León Sánchez with him and I thought, help a brother out.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

At the Tour de France, Bilbao donated €1 for every rider he finished ahead of on each stage towards replanting on deforested land. Bilbao said he would double the donation if he achieved a stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one day later, this would be a reality. Bilbao was part of the successful breakaway on Stage 10 towards Issoire. It was a tense final kilometre, with Bilbao and Georg Zimmermann (Intermarché-Circus-Wanty) rejoined by their breakaway companions. Bilbao kicked away in the last 200m and stayed ahead to raise his arms in victory for his first Tour de France stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I crossed the line and I just put out all the energy inside of me and remembered the reason for this victory, a special one – for Gino,’ Bilbao said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teammates were close friends; Mäder had adopted a stray dog in Bilbao and named him Pello.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

During his final Tour de France, Groupama-FDJ’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thibaut-pinot-tour-de-france-2023-stage-20\" target=\"_blank\">Thibaut Pinot launched a solo attack</a> on home roads in the Vosges mountains during Stage 20. Hundreds of his fans lined the roadside to Le Markstein Fellering, specifically over Le Petit Ballon and gathering on Virage Pinot – the bend heralded as a place of worship on Google Maps, such is the almost religious dedication of those drawn to Pinot’s riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinot had jumped from the chasing group and into the breakaway. It was here that he distanced Arkéa-Samsic’s Warren Barguil and Ineos Grenadiers’ Tom Pidcock to cut a lone figure in the distance. Virage Pinot beckoned. The stars had aligned. Pinot was here. Surrounded by his family, friends and fan club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wouldn’t win the stage, but the Frenchman crossed the line 33 seconds down on UAE Team Emirates’ Tadej Pogačar. He might have liked a stage win, but it was still a send-off he could savour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

It’s an informal classification throughout the season hosted by yours truly. To top the Vibes Classification in a Grand Tour requires a combination of combativity and chutzpah. Timings on general classification are irrelevant – although Jumbo-Visma’s Sepp Kuss happened to win the general classification <em>and</em> my Vibes Classification at the Vuelta. You just need to possess a can-do spirit, an attacking ability and to err on the side of do rather than do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) and Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) were the entertainers of the Giro d’Italia with a combined five stage combativity awards. Springboarding off a prosperous Classics campaign with second places in Brabantse Pijl and the Amstel Gold Race, Healy lit up the Giro with boundless energy and abandon. His win on Stage 8 over two ascents of I Cappuccini was the result of a 50km solo breakaway. He couldn’t be contained, seen jostling with Pinot for a KoM duel on Stage 19 too as Jumbo-Visma’s Rohan Dennis laughed on.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>What a GEEro d’Italia <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png\" alt=\"🤯\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png\" alt=\"🇮🇹\" /><br /><br />Derek Gee was the most combative rider of the 2023 Giro d’Italia after spending almost one third of the race in the break and finishing four stages in second place <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44f-1f3fc.png\" alt=\"👏🏼\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4f8.png\" alt=\"📸\" /> Cor Vos <br />_________<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ee-1f1f9.png\" alt=\"🇮🇹\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#Giro</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5QT67U8j9E\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/5QT67U8j9E</a></p>— Velon CC (@VelonCC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VelonCC/status/1665025961643974659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">June 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile Gee had people renaming the race the Gee-ro d’Italia with his determination and ‘why not?’ attitude. Second places on Stage 10, 14 and 19 may have thrust him into a Sep Vanmarcke style always-the-bridesmaid position, but his enthralling persistence on a day-to-day level earned him three combativity awards and the overall prize to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

But Sepp Kuss over Jonas Vingegaard or Primož Roglič? Now that’s a story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I penned an article after his victory that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sepp-kuss-vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">saluted the loyal domestique</a> thrust into his new and sudden leadership role, one that would earn him the title of becoming the first American in over a decade to win a Grand Tour. But to think back to the race itself: the anticipation of him probably relinquishing the jersey further down the line, the suspension when it didn’t happen and the race was speeding towards its finale in the final week, the pitchforks when Kuss was dropped by his teammates on Stage 17’s Alto de L’Angliru, the realisation that, yes, after everything, it would be Kuss on the top step of the podium… what a wonderfully cinematic Vuelta a España that was. My thoughts have already been said: ‘riders working together during a Grand Tour as their teammate is in the red jersey is <em>not a gift</em> – it’s what teams are supposed to do.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuss won the Vuelta a España anyway with help (and one climb of hindrance?) from his teammates as Jumbo-Visma became the first team to win all three Grand Tours in one season.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.

The man who had won the race back in 2015 had made the contending group in 2023 over the punishing cobblestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the five-star Carrefour de l’Arbre secteur, eventual winner Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) rode around his teammate Jasper Philipsen as Degenkolb was passing through along the ‘smoother’ side to his right. Philipsen then moved slightly right, Van der Poel veered towards Degenkolb and down Degenkolb went. He was back on his bike quickly enough, but the damage was already done. Degenkolb finished in tears, crossing the line in 7<sup>th</sup> and 2min 35sec down, describing it as a ‘racing incident’. His performance at Paris-Roubaix was one of his best in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

The Stage 20 ITT towards Monte Lussari was brutal, delivering sections up to 25%. It was a unique and strange affair, prime for late race dramatics – a bike exchange point, no vehicles allowed near the top of the climb and a return to base via a ski lift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič lost the 2020 Tour de France when he imploded on La Planche des Belles Filles, a time-trial that UAE Team Emirates’ Tadej Pogačar rode to perfection to claim overall victory. Yet he would flip the script this time, no matter how hard a mechanical tried to thwart him. This boisterous mountain time-trial performance, winding his way to the finish through flares and roaring fans, would overhaul then-leader Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) for the <em>maglia rosa</em>.
