Incorporation of carbon at contents higher than 2 wt.% results in significantly lower friction coefficients, both against alumina and steel balls. Double-walled carbon nanotubes improve wear resistance and reduce friction without severe damage, contrary to multi-walled carbon nanotubes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66552bdb65f5a0ee3ff05df87afc46349b2a2dceebed52e384ed8ddbc23124e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
