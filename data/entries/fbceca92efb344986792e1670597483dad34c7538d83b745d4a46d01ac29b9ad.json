{"title":"Water Transfer Energy Efficiency Index for inter‐basin water transfer projects","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12929?af=R","date":1714641960000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Inter-basin water transfer projects (WTPs) address water scarcity by lifting water uphill, posing energy challenges due to diverse topography. This study therefore analyses historical trends in WTP distance, average annual water volumes delivered, water lift and pumping capacity to develop the Water Transfer Energy Efficiency Index (WTEEI) and apply it for the assessment of WTPs. Results indicate that the WTEEI is a valuable tool for evaluating WTP energy efficiency. While no definitive trend in WTEEI values was observed, the findings suggest the need for monitoring of energy use of WTPs and more research to better understand and improve the energy efficiency of these large-scale infrastructure projects. By introducing a simple, intuitive and rapid assessment tool for evaluating energy efficiency in WTPs, this study addresses a critical gap in the water–energy field, namely, the evaluation of energy usage in WTPs and the identification of energy-efficiency improvements for current and future WTPs.</p>","author":"Sooyeon Yi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"fbceca92efb344986792e1670597483dad34c7538d83b745d4a46d01ac29b9ad","category":"Environment"}
