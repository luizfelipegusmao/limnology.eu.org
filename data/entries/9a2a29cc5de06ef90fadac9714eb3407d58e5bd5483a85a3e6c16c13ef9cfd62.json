{"title":"Understanding the Role of Culture in Supply Chain Collaboration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0641/v1","date":1718081850000,"content":"This study explores the multifaceted role of culture in supply chain collaboration, focusing on how cultural differences shape communication, trust-building, negotiation, conflict resolution, risk management, and ethical standards. Utilizing a qualitative methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 supply chain professionals from diverse cultural backgrounds and industries. The findings reveal that high-context cultures favor indirect communication and nuanced information exchange, which can lead to misunderstandings with partners from low-context cultures who prefer direct and explicit communication. Trust-building practices vary significantly, with high uncertainty avoidance cultures emphasizing formal agreements and procedural rigor, while low uncertainty avoidance cultures prioritize personal relationships and demonstrated reliability. Negotiation strategies also diverge, reflecting the underlying values of collectivism versus individualism, impacting the tactics and outcomes of supply chain negotiations. Conflict resolution approaches differ, with high power distance cultures favoring hierarchical and mediated solutions, and low power distance cultures preferring direct and egalitarian methods. The study highlights the need for adaptability to cultural changes and the development of cultural intelligence as essential competencies for managing cross-cultural supply chains. Additionally, cultural differences in risk management approaches and governance mechanisms affect the coordination and resilience of supply chains, while varying ethical standards influenced by cultural norms necessitate culturally sensitive strategies for promoting corporate social responsibility. The insights gained from this research underscore the importance of understanding and leveraging cultural differences to build stronger, more productive supply chain relationships, contributing to the broader literature on culture and supply chain management and offering practical implications for enhancing global supply chain collaboration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a2a29cc5de06ef90fadac9714eb3407d58e5bd5483a85a3e6c16c13ef9cfd62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
