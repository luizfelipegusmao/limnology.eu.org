{"title":"Spatial modeling and ecological suitability of Ebola virus disease in Africa","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311936","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Lombo Baluma Didier, Lukusa Lumu Jude, Esuka Igabuchia Franck, HaoNing Wang, Xiao-Long Wang</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper looks into the MaxEnt model in a trial to comprehend the ecological and environmental conditions that propagate and drive the spread of Ebola Virus Disease in Africa. We use the MaxEnt model to assess risk determinants associated with the occurrence and distribution of EVD, taking into account non-correlated variables such as neighborhood mean temperature, rainfall, and human population density. Our findings indicate that among the factors that significantly shape the geographical distribution of EVD risk are human population density, annual rainfall, temperature variability, and seasonality. The model used is both reliable and accurate (the average value for training AUC was 0.987); it can be used as a valuable approach for the prediction of infectious disease outbreaks. High-risk areas are primarily identified in the western and central regions of Africa, with some of the others in the east also vulnerable. This further calls for specified public health interventions and enhanced surveillance in specified hotspots, contributing to global efforts to predict and mitigate risks associated with EVD outbreaks more adequately. The findings further support that it remains imperative to conduct additional research, including socio-economic and cultural variables, to enhance the understanding of how environmental factors contribute to the emergence and transmission of Ebola.","author":"Lombo Baluma Didier","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c2337b689b3e135dba5cbcaafa86f138e76dbbd6905ee7aaca30a38c3e80bb4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
