{"title":"Abiotic Stress Response in Native Grasses and Their Suitability as Garden Plants Under Global Climate Change","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1494/v1","date":1729254001000,"content":"Native garden plants significantly contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions in urban environments. This study aimed to identify the physiochemical differences among native grasses subjected to drought and salinity stress and to assess their potential as garden plants adaptable to outdoor conditions and global climate change. Physiological parameters, such as photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, and chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, decreased in Melica grandiflora and Carex forficula with increasing drought or salinity. In contrast, Carex boottiana maintained high water use efficiency and stable chlorophyll and carotenoid levels even under se-vere drought and salinity conditions. Biochemical analyses showed that C. boottiana had lower levels of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species (including O2.- and H2O2) than those in the other species under stress conditions. Principal component analysis revealed clear differences in tolerance levels among the grass species. C. boottiana demonstrated high adaptability to both drought and salinity stress, indicating its potential as a sustainable and resilient garden material for urban landscapes facing severe climatic challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0705576cf036c0a7f26a5233a08fa169b2f26e3315a0ec3a51473f1d1ab91c74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
