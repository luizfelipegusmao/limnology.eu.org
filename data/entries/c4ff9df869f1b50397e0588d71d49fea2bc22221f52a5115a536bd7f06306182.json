The expressions for the velocity, temperature and concentration distributions are arthemitiaclly solved by perturbation method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4ff9df869f1b50397e0588d71d49fea2bc22221f52a5115a536bd7f06306182","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
