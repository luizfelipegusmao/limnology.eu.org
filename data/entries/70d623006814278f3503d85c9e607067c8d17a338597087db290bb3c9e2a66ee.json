{"title":"A Study on the Charring Properties of Glued Laminated Korean Larch Timber Columns","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1529/v1","date":1726752969000,"content":"As the carbon storage capacity of timber is recognized, there is growing interest in timber and wooden structures as a solution to various environmental problems. The use of Korean timber with substantial carbon storage capacity is required to reduce Korean carbon emissions and circulate timber resources. In this study, fire tests were conducted to investigate the charring properties of glued laminated timber columns made of Korean larch. The fire tests were conducted under both load-bearing and non-load-bearing conditions. The fire test results showed that the charring depth was affected by the corners of the section, and that the load ratio had an insignificant influence on the charring depth when the load ratio was 0.9 or less. This study provides data that can be used to compare the charring properties of laminated wood produced using South Korean larch with the charring properties of foreign standards. This provides reference data for developing fire-resistant design standards for timber structures made from South Korean timber.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70d623006814278f3503d85c9e607067c8d17a338597087db290bb3c9e2a66ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
