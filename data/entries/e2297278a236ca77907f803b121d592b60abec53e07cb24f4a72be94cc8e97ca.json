{"title":"Multitemporal Analysis of Land Cover Changes in Areas with Contrasted Forest Management and Conservation Policies in Northern Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1727/v1","date":1721658500000,"content":"This study evaluates and contrasts the changes in vegetation cover over three decades in two forest areas in northern Mexico with different management statuses: one with sustainable forest exploitation and the other under protection as a Flora and Fauna Protection Area (FFPA). The hypothesis proposed that both areas would maintain or increase their vegetation cover since 1995. Using QGIS 3.32 “Lima” software and supervised and unsupervised classification methods, satellite images from the periods 1995-2008, 2008-2014, 2014-2021, and 1995-2022 were analyzed. The results showed that the Ejido El Largo y Anexos significantly increased forest areas and reduced grasslands due to sustainable management practices, with notable expansion of pine-oak and pine forests. In contrast, the Tutuaca Flora and Fauna Protection Area (FFPA) showed a notable loss of oak and oak-pine forests, suggesting ineffectiveness in its conservation policies. However, a lesser loss of Douglas fir forest was observed, indicating some effective protection efforts. The comparison reveals opposing dynamics: while Ejido El Largo y Anexos demonstrates success in sustainable management, the Tutuaca FFPA faces conservation challenges. In conclusion, this study highlights the need for active management approaches to maintain ecosystem cover and functionality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2297278a236ca77907f803b121d592b60abec53e07cb24f4a72be94cc8e97ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
