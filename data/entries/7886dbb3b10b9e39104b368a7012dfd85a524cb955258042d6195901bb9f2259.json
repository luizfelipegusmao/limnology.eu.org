{"title":"Seasonal patterns of microbial diversity across the world oceans","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10422?af=R","date":1721218166000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Understanding the patterns of marine microbial diversity (Bacteria + Archaea) is essential, as variations in their alpha- and beta-diversities can affect ecological processes. Investigations of microbial diversity from global oceanographic expeditions and basin-wide transects show positive correlations between microbial diversity and either temperature or productivity, but these studies rarely captured seasonality, especially in polar regions. Here, using multiannual alpha-diversity data from eight time series in the northern and southern hemispheres, we show that marine microbial community richness and evenness generally correlate more strongly with daylength than with temperature or chlorophyll <i>a</i> (a proxy for photosynthetic biomass). This pattern is observable across time series found in the northern and southern hemispheres regardless of collection method, DNA extraction protocols, targeted <i>16S</i> rRNA hypervariable region, sequencing technology, or bioinformatics pipeline.</p>","author":"Eric J.
