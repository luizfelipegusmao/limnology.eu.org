{"title":"Past and Future Impacts of the Relative Sea Level Rise on the Seafront of Ancient Delos (Cyclades, Greece) and Flooding Scenarios by 2150","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0061/v1","date":1714542820000,"content":"Sea level rise due to global warming is a continuing and, disappointingly, accelerating process, which has already affected and will further impact coastal lowlands and the social and economic activities in these areas. Delos Island, situated in the middle of the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, was considered the most sacred of all islands in ancient Greek culture and a trading hub for the entire eastern Mediterranean. Uninhabited since the 7th century AD, and consistently the focus of research and touristic attention, the island is designated as an archaeological site and inscribed on the Unesco World Heritage List. Previous studies on the relative sea level (rsl) changes suggest a steadily rsl rise during the last 6,300 years, starting from a sea level at -4.80Â±0.20m in the Late Neolithic. The seafront of the ancient city of Delos is subject to the effects of the rsl rise, which have caused significant coastline retreat and exposure to the northerly winds and waves, whereas parts of the coastal lowland where the remains of the ancient city lie are inundated, forming extended wetlands. The future impacts of rsl rise on the seafront of ancient Delos are illustrated on very high-resolution digital surface models, evaluating both the flooding risk under different climatic projections, as provided by the IPCC AR6 report, and the ongoing land subsidence, as recorded by GNSS data. An rsl rise ranging from 87cm (SSP1-2.6 scenario) to 148cm (SSP5-8.5 scenario) is anticipated by 2150, requiring both resilience strategies and adaptation solutions as well as mitigation policies to cope with the effects of climate change.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9dc629ae1d9dc27639eae75500aed6459b87dc3191f3cd512c01708cbcb00b47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
