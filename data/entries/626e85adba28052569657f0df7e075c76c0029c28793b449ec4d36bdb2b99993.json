{"title":"The first record of the genus Prosantorhinus (Perissodactyla: Rhinocerotidae) of East Asia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlad183/7470716?rss=1","date":1702339200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Prosantorhinus</span> is a genus of small extinct teleoceratine rhinoceroses with shortened limb bones, widely distributed in Europe. However, the Asian evolution of the teleoceratine <span>Prosantorhinus</span> has remained unclear because of a scarcity of fossil records of the genus. Here, we report the first record of <span>Prosantorhinus</span> in East Asia from the Middle Miocene of Tongxin, Ningxia. The new specimen is characterized by a concave dorsal skull profile and elevated nasals; short and stout nasal bones with drooping margins on both sides; the thickened, enlarged, and roughened nasal extremity supporting a small horn; the semi-molarized upper premolars with a lingual bridge between the protocone and hypocone; the metaloph constriction present on P2â€“4; the protocone equal to the hypocone on P2; the crista present on P3; and the cement on the cheek teeth developed. With all the morphological evidence considered, we establish a new species, <span>Prosantorhinus yei</span> sp. nov.. A phylogenetic analysis based on 282 morphological characters scored for 36 taxa reveals that <span>Prosantorhinus yei</span> sp. nov. is a relatively derived taxon in the genus. We hypothesize that <span>Prosantorhinus yei</span> sp. nov. lived in relatively moist environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"626e85adba28052569657f0df7e075c76c0029c28793b449ec4d36bdb2b99993","category":"Environment"}
