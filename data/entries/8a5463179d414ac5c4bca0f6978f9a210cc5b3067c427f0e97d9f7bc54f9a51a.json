{"title":"Suburban Public Open Space &ndash; Types of Gathering and Recreation Places Developed under Mature Urban Planning. A Case Study of Bunnik Commune, the Netherlands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0621/v1","date":1723164545000,"content":"The sustainable development of public open spaces (POS) in suburban areas is crucial to enhancing neighborhood livability, especially in the face of uncontrolled urban sprawl. Therefore, the question was asked: what forms of gathering and recreation places are in suburbs that are subjected to mature urban planning? The research focuses on the Netherlands (Bunnik commune), a country known for its sustainable suburban areas. \nBy conducting field research that involved analyzing physical traces and engaging in non-participatory observation, the study identified and categorized 18 distinct spatial-functional units of POS looking from a top-down design and planning lens. The types of gathering and recreation places identified through top-down development included: estates with recreational areas for neighbors; communal playgrounds; greenery sites by pedestrian routes; social places in central zone; open sports grounds; public allotment gardens; multi-purpose recreational areas at schools, communal facilities generating informal meetings. POS types created as a result of both top-down and bottom-up development were: entrance zones to public facilities with a social value; viewpoints accompanying pedestrian routes; network of green walks for recreation in rural and natural landscapes. Other POS types (resulting from bottom-up development): diner's garden and urban farm.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a5463179d414ac5c4bca0f6978f9a210cc5b3067c427f0e97d9f7bc54f9a51a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
