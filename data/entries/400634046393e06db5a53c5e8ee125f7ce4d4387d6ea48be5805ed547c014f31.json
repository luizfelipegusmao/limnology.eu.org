{"title":"Polystyrene Microplastics Induce Injury to the Vascular Endothelial Through NLRP3‐Mediated Pyroptosis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24387?af=R","date":1722518115000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The health risks associated with microplastics have attracted widespread attention. Polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) can induce damage to cardiac tissue, while pyroptosis-mediated injury to the vascular endothelial plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The study intended to explore the role and mechanism of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) mediated pyroptosis in PS-MPs causing the injury of vascular endothelial cells. In vivo, Wistar rats were exposed to 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg/d 0.5 μm PS-MPs. In vitro, the human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used for mechanistic studies. siRNA was used for silencing the NILRP3 gene. H&amp;E staining and flow cytometry were performed to examine the vascular injury and cell membrane damage. The oxidative stress was detected by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and corresponding kits. ELISA were used to measure the levels of inflammatory factors. Real-time PCR and western blot were used to measure the expression of pyroptosis signaling pathway. In rats, PS-MPs could cause vascular damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response, and activated the pyroptosis signaling pathway. HUVECs exposure to PS-MPs, the vitality decreased in a dose-dependent manner, ROS and MDA were significantly increased while SOD was decreased. PS-MPs induced the onset of pyroptosis signaling pathway in HUVECs. Cell membrane damage and the levels of IL-Iβ and IL-18 in HUVECs significantly increased, those are symbols for the development of pyroptosis. Inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis effectively protected HUVECs from PS-MPs-induced damage. Pyroptosis played a vital role in controlling the vascular endothelial injury caused by PS-MPs.</p>","author":"Chuanyi Huo, \nYing Zhu, \nXiaoqi Fang, \nJianwei Cui, \nHui Ye, \nHaotang Zhao, \nLin Ye, \nLiting Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"400634046393e06db5a53c5e8ee125f7ce4d4387d6ea48be5805ed547c014f31","category":"Environment"}
