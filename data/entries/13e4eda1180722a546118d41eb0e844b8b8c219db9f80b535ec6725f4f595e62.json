SIRPα-CD47 interaction is exploited by cancer cells to suppress anti-tumor activity of myeloid cells, therefore emerging as a novel immune checkpoint for cancer immunotherapy. In blood cancer, several SIRPα-CD47 blockers have shown encouraging monotherapy activity. However, the anti-tumor activity of SIRPα-CD47 blockers in solid tumors seems limited, suggesting the need for combination therapies to fully exploit the myeloid immune checkpoint in solid tumors. Here we tested whether combination of SIRPα-CD47 blocker with antibody-drug conjugate bearing a topoisomerase I inhibitor DXd (DXd-ADC) would enhance anti-tumor activity in solid tumors. To this end, DS-1103a, a newly developed anti-human SIRPα antibody (Ab), was assessed for the potential combination benefit with datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), DXd-ADCs targeting human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, respectively. DS-1103a inhibited SIRPα-CD47 interaction and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of Dato-DXd and T-DXd against human cancer cells. In a whole cancer cell vaccination model, vaccination with DXd-treated cancer cells led to activation of tumor-specific T cells when combined with an anti-mouse SIRPα (anti-mSIRPα) Ab, implying the benefit of combining DXd-ADCs with anti-SIRPα Ab on anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, in syngeneic mouse models, both Dato-DXd and T-DXd combination with anti-mSIRPα Ab showed stronger anti-tumor activity over the monotherapies. Taken together, this study provides a preclinical rationale of novel therapies for solid tumors combining SIRPα-CD47 blockers with DXd-ADCs.","author":"Mayumi Sue","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"13e4eda1180722a546118d41eb0e844b8b8c219db9f80b535ec6725f4f595e62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
