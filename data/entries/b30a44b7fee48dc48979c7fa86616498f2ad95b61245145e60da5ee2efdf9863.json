{"title":"Lycopene Promotes Osteogenesis and Reduces Adipogenesis through Regulating FoxO1/PPAR&gamma; Signaling in OVX Rats and BMSCs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0288/v1","date":1712146714000,"content":"Recent interest in preventing the development of osteoporosis has focused on the regulation of redox homeostasis. However, the action of lycopene (LYC), a strong natural antioxidant com-pound, on osteoporotic bone loss remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the administra-tion of LYC to OVX rats reduces body weight gain, improves lipid metabolism and preserves bone quality. In addition, LYC treatment inhibits ROS overgeneration in serum and bone marrow in OVX rats, and in BMSCs upon H2O2 stimulation, leading to inhibiting adipogenesis and pro-moting osteogenesis during bone remodeling. Mechanically, LYC may improve bone quality via an increase in the expressions of FoxO1 and Runx2, and a decrease in the expressions of PPARγ and C/EBPα in OVX rats and BMSCs. Collectively, these findings suggest that LYC attenuates osteoporotic bone loss through promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting adipogenesis via regula-tion of the FoxO1/PPARγ pathway driven by oxidative stress, presenting a novel strategy for os-teoporosis management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b30a44b7fee48dc48979c7fa86616498f2ad95b61245145e60da5ee2efdf9863","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
