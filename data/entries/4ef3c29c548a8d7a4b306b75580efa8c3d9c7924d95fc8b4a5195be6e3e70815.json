{"title":"Motor-Control Notions in Health and Disease (What Controls Motor Control?)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1799/v1","date":1711700201000,"content":"The term `motor control´ encompasses a wide range of mechanisms thought to be implicated in the organization of movements. Their study, like that of any other scientific field,   must use specific notions to get to grips with them. This review is therefore organized along a series of notions that are frequently used in motor control, and we will discuss them with particular emphasis on neurological conditions, which may disrupt normal motor functioning. We will start with a short description of the roles of space and time, in which movements take place. Subsequently we will deal with kinematics and kinetics (dynamics) of movements. Then, we will list the inputs to motoneurons (MNs), which, in different forms, convey signals from the central nervous system (CNS) to skeletal muscles and muscle spindles, including central pattern generators (CPGs), sensory inputs and supraspinal descending fiber systems. Some helpers in movement organization will be introduced, such as internal models and neuronal network models. A relatively brief section on sensory-motor learning will follow because learning abilities are required to endow the sensory-motor system with flexibility and adaptability. The major emphasis is placed on neurological processes, which result from genetic modifications, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, infections in the nervous system as well as vascular and traumatic lesions. These neurological diseases lead to a variety of impairments and symptoms, particularly movement derangements including cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and (other) movement disorders such as Parkinson’s syndromes. The conclusion is that there is no unique top controller that controls ´motor control`.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ef3c29c548a8d7a4b306b75580efa8c3d9c7924d95fc8b4a5195be6e3e70815","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
