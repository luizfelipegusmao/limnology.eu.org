{"title":"Mechanics 4.0 and Mechanical Engineering Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0721/v1","date":1710248790000,"content":"Industry 4.0 is an industrial paradigm that is causing changes in form and substance in factories, companies and businesses around the world, and is impacting work and education in general. In fact, the disruptive technologies that frame the fourth industrial revolution have the potential to improve and optimize manufacturing processes and the entire value chain, which can lead to an exponential evolution in the production and distribution of goods and services. All these changes imply that the fields of engineering knowledge must be oriented towards the concept of Industry 4.0, for example Mechanical Engineering. The development of various physical assets that are used by cyber-physical systems and digital twins is based on Mechanics. However, the specialized literature on Industry 4.0 says little about the importance of Mechanics in the new industrial era and more importance is given to the evolution of Information and Communication Technologies and Artificial Intelligence. This article presents a frame of reference about the importance of Mechanical Engineering in Industry 4.0 and proposes an extension to the concept of Mechanics 4.0, recently defined as the relationship between Mechanics and Artificial Intelligence. For the analysis of Mechanical Engineering in Industry 4.0, the criteria of the four driving forces that defined Mechanics in the third industrial revolution was used. An analysis of Mechanical Engineering Education in Industry 4.0 is presented, and the concept of Mechanical Engineering 4.0 Education is improved. Finally, the importance of making changes in the educational models of engineering education is described.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58475f513e21697de3884b7f18a4c9e5c6fa269b6a40502a27455792ead8e991","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
