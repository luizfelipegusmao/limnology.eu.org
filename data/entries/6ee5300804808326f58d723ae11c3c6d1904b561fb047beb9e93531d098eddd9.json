{"title":"Impact of an Ethical Climate of Principles on Employees&rsquo; Burnout in the Colombian Electric Sector: The Moderating Role of Work Autonomy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0575/v1","date":1725861642000,"content":"Burnout is a factor that affects organizational performance. Researchers agree that the emotional stability provided by an ethical climate and adequate work autonomy often has a buffering effect on chronic stress. However, despite the abundant literature analyzing the relationship between work autonomy and burnout, whether work autonomy acts as a stress-reducing resource or a stress-increasing demand is not sufficiently well established. It is also unknown to what extent work autonomy contributes to explaining the relationship between ethical climate and burnout. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to examine the relationship between an ethical climate of principles and norms on burnout, using the moderating effect of work autonomy. A multivariate moderation analysis was used to address the issue. The sample consists of 448 employees in the Colombian electric sector. \nThe results show that an ethical climate of principles and work autonomy relate positively to burnout. However, when a rule-demanding work environment is related to a high perception of work autonomy, the relationship with burnout syndrome changes from positive to negative. In conclusion, when employees have significant control over their usual tasks, they develop a behavior pattern that includes both the organization's internal standards and the principles that shape individual morale. In this case, employees are able to balance the workload with the high psychological demands of an ethical climate of principles, without it representing a disturbance to their emotional well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ee5300804808326f58d723ae11c3c6d1904b561fb047beb9e93531d098eddd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
