{"title":"In-Situ Fabrication of Ductile Ti-TiCx Metal Matrix Composite by Laser Powder Bed Fusion with Enhanced Elastic Modulus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0485/v2","date":1728265307000,"content":"The production of high stiffness Ti-based Metal Matrix Composites (Ti-MMCs) displaying significant ductility by additive manufacturing technologies is not yet at the level of conventionally produced Ti-MMCs. This study outlines the production process of stiffness-driven Ti-TiC MMCs displaying a remarkable ductility. The process consists in powder Mechanical Blending, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), and a heat treatment. A TiC fraction of more than 20 vol% was formed in-situ through the reaction of titanium with carbon during the LPBF process. The as-built sub-stoichiometric TiC dendrites are converted in equiaxed TiC grains during the heat treatment. The TiC C/Ti ratio was found to be close to 0.5 in as-built conditions, and 0.7 in heat treated conditions, resulting in an effective reinforcement content nearly twice the one expected for stoichiometric TiC, leading to stronger reinforcement. The mechanical analysis revealed a Young’s modulus of up to 149 GPa and total elongations of up to 2.8%. The former represents a 27% improvement compared to commercially pure Titanium and the latter exceeds by 115% reported values for LPBF Ti-MMCs with similar Young’s modulus. It is enabled by the in-situ formation of defect-free TiC reinforcements combined with their globularisation through heat treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04b38149865ab6b847817eb51719bfb88d9915e3e805df1d9336c7eb3a9e70fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
