{"title":"Design and Multi-Objective Optimization of Auxetic Sandwich Panels for Blastworthy Structures Using Machine Learning Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0668/v1","date":1728469268000,"content":"Design and multi-objective optimization of auxetic sandwich panels (ASPs) are performed to enhance the blastworthiness of armored fighting vehicles (AFVs). Various metastructures in the form of four auxetic geometries are proposed as the sandwich core: re-entrant honeycomb (REH), double-arrow honeycomb (DAH), star honeycomb (SH), and tetra-chiral honeycomb (CH). This paper employs a combination of finite element (FE) and machine learning (ML) methodologies to evaluate blastworthiness performance. Optimization is carried out using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) method. The optimization results show significant improvements in blastworthiness performance, with notable reductions in permanent displacement and enhancements in specific energy absorption (SEA). Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals that cell thickness is the most critical factor affecting blastworthiness performance, followed by the number of cells and corner angle or radius for CH. The application of optimized ASP on AFVs shows promising results, with no failure occurring in the occupant floor. Furthermore, AFVs equipped with the optimized ASP DAH significantly reduce maximum displacement and acceleration by 39.00% and 43.56%, respectively, and enhance SEA by 48.30% compared to optimized aluminum foam sandwich panels (AFSPs). This study concludes that ASPs have potential applications in broader engineering fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"963d4ba35ceb39df321c808b65be5f67a6bc1f0d2bb543596538b4c58111055d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
