{"title":"GERD after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Prevalence and Risk Factors Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0466/v1","date":1715160024000,"content":"Background and Objectives. Prevalence of GERD is increased among individuals with obesity and RYGB is considered as the most effective procedure to control GERD and obesity. However, some patients continue to have GERD after RYGB. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and the risk factors of GERD after RYGB. Material and Methods. This prospective study included 180 patients operated with RYGB and followed for on average of 12.2 (0.6) years. 126 (70%) patients agreed to participate in online consultations and provided data on weight, GERD symptoms, filled GERD-HRQL, TFEQ-18 and GSRS questionnaires. Results. The average age before surgery was 42.7 (10.5) years and BMI was 45.2 (6.4) kg/m2. 128 (71.1%) were females and preoperative GERD was diagnosed in 74 (41.1%) patients. At 12 years follow-up the mean %EBMIL and %TWL were 60.37 and 25.73, respectively. The median %WR was 18.0 (39.0). The GERD was present in 30 (23.8%) patients, of whom 12 (40%) continued to have GERD symptoms and 18 (60%) developed de novo GERD. The GERD-HRQL score significantly decreased from 3.0 (8.0) at baseline to 2.0 (5.0) (p=0.028) at 12 years. GSRS Diarrhea and Indigestion median scores increased significantly, from 1.33 (0.67) to 1.5 (2.42) (p 3.2.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e4ef95ce1545fb53735b20f63cb465ba9109de972038cf292f9c034b518b6d78","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
