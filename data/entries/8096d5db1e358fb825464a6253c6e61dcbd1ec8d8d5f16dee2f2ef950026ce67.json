{"title":"Food and fluid intake during labor in maternity wards: A scoping review protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309746","date":1726668000000,"content":"<p>by Brenda Kelly Pontes Soares, Byanca Rodrigues Carneiro, Ilana Bruna de Lima Feitoza, Anna Cecilia Queiroz de Medeiros, Adriana Gomes Magalh√£es</p>\r\n\r\nDuring the 1940s, aspiration of stomach contents was recognized as a serious problem during labor, which is why fluid and food restriction was adopted for women who would undergo general anesthesia. Currently, the practice of generalized food restriction is a routine that is being discontinued. This review aims to map the evidence on the effects of the intake of foods, supplements and drinks in women on labor outcomes. To that end, documents investigating this topic in pregnant women admitted for uncomplicated deliveries in maternity wards, published from 2013 onwards, will be assessed. This interval was defined based on the publication by Singata et al., who carried out a systematic review on the benefits and harms of oral fluid intake or food restriction during labor. The scoping review methods of the JBI and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA) were followed. Firstly, a preliminary search was carried out to identify the existence of similar scoping reviews or protocols, as well as the keywords and MeSH descriptors in the titles and abstracts, with a view to developing a complete search strategy. Subsequently, a search will be carried out in the Cochrane Library, Medline/PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. The search strategy will be adapted for each of these databases. Finally, a reverse search will be carried out using the references of the included studies. The obtained documents will be imported into Rayyan for duplicate detection and removal. Two independent reviewers will read the titles and abstracts, observing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data extraction from each included study will be carried out independently by two reviewers, using the extraction form created for this purpose. In order to report results, we will follow the PRISMA checklist and report descriptive statistics and a narrative summary.","author":"Brenda Kelly Pontes Soares","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8096d5db1e358fb825464a6253c6e61dcbd1ec8d8d5f16dee2f2ef950026ce67","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
