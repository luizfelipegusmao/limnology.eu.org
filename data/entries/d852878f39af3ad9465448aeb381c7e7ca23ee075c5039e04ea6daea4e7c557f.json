A proficient LMIS improves accountability and supports informed logistic decisions in healthcare. Conversely, a subpar LMIS negatively affects essential medicine availability, compromising overall healthcare service efficiency. This study aimed to evaluate the status of the logistics management information system and the availability of non-program tracer drugs (NPTDs) in public health facilities within Bahir Dar City. This study employed an institutional-based cross-sectional study. Data were collected from February 20 to April 30, 2022 in 12 public health facilities located in Bahir Dar City. Structured questionnaire and data abstraction formats were used to gather pertinent data. After checking for completeness, the data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS version 23. The primary analytical outcomes involved descriptive statistics, encompassing frequencies, averages, and percentages, which were subsequently presented in tables and figures. Bin card and Internal Facility Report and Resupply Form were the only blank LMIS tools available in all health facilities, while stock-record card was the least available, present in only 2(16.7%) facilities. Nine health facilities (75%) used self-prepared forms to request NPTDs from the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Agency (EPSA) at the end of the review period, whereas 7(58.3%) used official letters for emergency orders. Additionally, seven health facilities (58.3%) used the Health Commodities Management Information System On the day of the visit, 78.68% of NPTDs were available. Tetracycline eye ointment 1% had the longest stock-out duration, lasting for a mean 69.64 days. Rather than using the RRF, most of facilities opted for their own forms to request NPTDs from EPSA. While it is advisable for all health facilities to maintain continuous availability of tracer drugs, this study revealed that the current state of non-program tracer drug availability falls short of meeting this expectation.","author":"Biset Asrade Mekonnen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d852878f39af3ad9465448aeb381c7e7ca23ee075c5039e04ea6daea4e7c557f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
