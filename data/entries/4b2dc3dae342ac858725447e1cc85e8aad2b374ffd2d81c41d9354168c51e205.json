{"title":"Rho of Plants patterning: linking mathematical models and molecular diversity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1274/7420125?rss=1","date":1699920000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>ROPs (Rho of Plants) are plant specific small GTPases involved in many membrane patterning processes and play important roles in the establishment and communication of cell polarity. These small GTPases can produce a wide variety of patterns, ranging from a single cluster in tip-growing root hairs and pollen tubes to an oriented stripe pattern controlling protoxylem cell wall deposition. For an understanding of what controls these various patterns, models are indispensable. Consequently, many modelling studies on small GTPase patterning exist, often focusing on yeast or animal cells. Multiple patterns occurring in plants, however, require the stable co-existence of multiple active ROP clusters, which does not occur with the most common yeast/animal models. The possibility of such patterns critically depends on the precise model formulation. Additionally, different small GTPases are usually treated interchangeably in models, even though plants possess two types of ROPs with distinct molecular properties, one of which is unique to plants. Furthermore, the shape and even the type of ROP patterns may be affected by the cortical cytoskeleton, and cortex composition and anisotropy differ dramatically between plants and animals. Here, we review insights into ROP patterning from modelling efforts across kingdoms, as well as some outstanding questions arising from these models and recent experimental findings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"4b2dc3dae342ac858725447e1cc85e8aad2b374ffd2d81c41d9354168c51e205","category":"Environment"}
