{"title":"Machine Learning for Profitability Prediction in Agribusiness Construction: A Novel Approach Using Vector Space Model and Kernel Ridge Regression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1043/v1","date":1726194328000,"content":"In the dynamic realm of agribusiness construction, firms are striving to bolster their operational efficiency and profitability amidst the global shift from traditional farming to commercial agriculture. This transition has intensified the demand for sophisticated infrastructure development, presenting new challenges for commercial managers. A critical hurdle is the accurate estimation of profitability for prospective contracts, a task often reliant on intuition rather than data-driven methods. To address this, we propose the development of a mathematical model utilising machine learning techniques to predict contract profitability and identify influential factors. This model aims to aid in bid decision-making, financial forecasting, and enhancing competitiveness in the marketplace. Furthermore, it would provide valuable insights into how altering specific contract attributes might affect predicted profitability. The implementation of such a system necessitates close collaboration between IT professionals and construction executives. This study delineates the development of this predictive model, outlining the data analysis process and the application of machine learning algorithms to tackle this complex commercial challenge. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between intuitive estimation and data-driven prediction, thereby enhancing the financial performance and strategic decision-making capabilities of firms in the agribusiness construction sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b19174e6ea9e91fb35eeee93424c6fffee9476034769a2a0c577794d9f4a34c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
