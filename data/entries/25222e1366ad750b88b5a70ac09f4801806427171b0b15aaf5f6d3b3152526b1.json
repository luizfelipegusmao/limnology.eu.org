{"title":"Fermentation of millet bran with Bacillus natto: enhancement of bioactivity levels and the bioactivity of bran extract","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13455?af=R","date":1711111213000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Millet bran (MB), a byproduct of millet production, is rich in functional components but it is underutilized. In recent years, researchers have shown that fermentation can improve the biological activity of cereals and their byproducts. This study used <i>Bacillus natto</i> to ferment millet bran to improve its added value and broaden the application of MB. The bioactive component content, physicochemical properties, and functional activity of millet bran extract (MBE) from fermented millet bran were determined.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>After fermentation, the soluble dietary fiber (SDF) content increased by 92.0%, the <i>β</i>-glucan content by 164.4%, the polypeptide content by 111.4%, the polyphenol content by 32.5%, the flavone content by 16.4%, and the total amino acid content by 95.4%. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the microscopic morphology of MBE changed from complete and dense blocks to loosely porous shapes after fermentation. After fermentation, the solubility, water-holding capacity, and viscosity significantly increased and the particle size decreased. Moreover, the glucose adsorption capacity (2.1 mmol g<sup>−1</sup>), glucose dialysis retardation index (75.3%), and <i>α</i>-glucosidase inhibitory (71.4%, mixed reversible inhibition) activity of the fermented MBE (FMBE) were greater than those of the unfermented MBE (0.99 mmol g<sup>−1</sup>, 32.1%, and 35.1%, respectively). The FMBE presented better cholesterol and sodium cholate (SC) adsorption properties and the adsorption was considered inhomogeneous surface adsorption.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Fermentation increased the bioactive component content and improved the physicochemical properties of MBE, thereby improving its hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. This study not only resolves the problem of millet bran waste but also encourages the development of higher value-added application methods for millet bran. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Shimei Zhang, \nAn Wang, \nZhaoxin Lu, \nFengxia Lu, \nHaizhen Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"25222e1366ad750b88b5a70ac09f4801806427171b0b15aaf5f6d3b3152526b1","category":"Environment"}
