{"title":"Chemically Degradable Vitrimeric Materials Based on Divanillin Imine Epoxy Monomer and Aliphatic Diamines. Effect of Transamination in the Stress Relaxation Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0686/v1","date":1725879394000,"content":"This study presents the development of a diglycidyl monomer containing two imine groups that can act as dynamic and reversible bonds. During the curing of the monomer with two different amine hardeners, we confirmed the formation of new imine groups due to the transamination reaction, not reported before, between the imine groups of the diepoxy monomer with the amine groups of the hardener. The effect of this structural change is observed for the first time in the stress relaxation behavior, resulting in the overlapping of two different relaxation modes. The analytical modelling could extract two distinct characteristic relaxation times using a double-element Maxwell model. A second characterization of the stress relaxation process by frequency sweep experiments was performed to corroborate the results obtained, confirming speedy stress relaxation. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis was performed on the studied materials, demonstrating the complete degradation of the network. We finally confirmed that the synthesized diepoxy compound is suitable for preparing carbon fiber-reinforced composite materials, demonstrating easy fiber impregnation, fast reshaping and especially a total degradation of the polymer matrix that allows the recovery of the carbon fibers in mild conditions. This epoxy-amine system is an excellent candidate for overcoming the traditional limits of thermosets in preparing fiber-reinforced composites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90fb9959a60f0254d787ec2a48cabed396c2f829c1f4bc4590930c186c5c6581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
