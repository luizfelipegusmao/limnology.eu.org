{"title":"Changes on Reproductive Hormones and Metabolism Caused by Heat Stress and Beneficial Foods during Male Adolescence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0668/v1","date":1723186741000,"content":"Heat stress due to climate warming can significantly affect the synthesis of sex hormones in male adolescents, which can impair the ability of the hypothalamus to secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which leads to a decrease in luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which ultimately negatively affects spermatogenesis and testosterone synthesis. For optimal spermatogenesis, the testicular temperature should be 2–6°C lower than body temperature. Heat stress directly affects the testes, damaging them and re-ducing testosterone synthesis. Additionally, chronic heat stress abnormally increases the level of aromatase in Leydig cells, which increases estradiol synthesis while decreasing testosterone, lead-ing to an imbalance of sex hormones and spermatogenesis failure. Low levels of testosterone in male adolescents lead to delayed puberty and incomplete sexual maturation, negatively affect height growth and bone mineral density, and can lead to a decrease in lean body mass and an in-crease in fat mass. In order for male adolescents to acquire healthy reproductive capacity, it is recommended to provide sufficient nutrition and energy, avoid exposure to heat stress, and pro-vide foods and supplements to prevent or repair testosterone reduction, germ cell damage, and sperm count reduction caused by heat stress so that they can enter a healthy adulthood.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"677bf8c987bf62c48b09501d509f863b695fd0d8dc3ec5c3544ee53579de10af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
