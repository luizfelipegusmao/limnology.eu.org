{"title":"Ongoing excess hospitalizations for severe pediatric Group A streptococcal disease in 2023-2024 â€“ a single center report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1530/v1","date":1721339097000,"content":"A Europe-wide outbreak of invasive pediatric Group a streptococcal infections (iGAS) began in fall 2022. Here we report the evolution of GAS hospitalizations in children and adolescents during the second outbreak year in 2023-2024 at a tertiary center in Switzerland. Using prospective monitoring of all in-patient GAS cases below 16 years of age including those with iGAS, we compared case frequencies and clinical characteristics in three time periods (2013-2020; 2022-2023; 2023-2024). Annual GAS hospitalizations increased from a median of 25 case (range 11-28) in 2013-2020 to 89 and 63 cases, respectively, in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. iGAS cases evolved similarly (2013-2020, 4 cases (3-8); 2022-2023, 32 cases; 2023-2024, 21 cases). The decline in cases from 2022-2023 to 2023-2024 included all types of GAS organ involvement except suppurative infections in the head area, which remained largely unchanged (48 vs. 45 cases). Pleural empyema declined from 13 to 7 cases, possibly explained by a poor overlap of the GAS and influenza curves, respectively, in 2023-2024 compared to 2022-2023. These data document the prolongation of the GAS outbreak into its second winter season in 2023-2024, however with a decline of iGAS, pleural empyema, skin and soft tissue infection and infections of bone, joint and muscle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77e78c0e2c79df55eab6deb719f6fa7b8104c4d20ba685bbee076d2b9396acc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
