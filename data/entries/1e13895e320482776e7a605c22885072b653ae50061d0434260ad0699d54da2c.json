{"title":"Aurelia aurita as a Model for Assessing Food Additives: Comparative Results Across Trophic Levels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1430/v1","date":1724241172000,"content":"The industry currently generates numerous substances, such as food additives, whose environmental impacts, particularly in marine environments, remain inadequately assessed. This study employs Aurelia aurita for the first time as a model organism to evaluate the toxicity of such compounds. For this, the main goal is to evaluate the toxicity of two food additives, 2-Methyl-1Phenylpropan-2-ol (S1) and 1-Phenylethan-1-ol (S2), on A. aurita ephyrae, comparing the results with other organisms representing different trophic levels, specifically the alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the crustacean Artemia salina. Acute toxicity tests were conducted on each organism. Mortality rates were measured for Artemia, growth inhibition for the algae, and mortality and pulsation frequency for ephyrae. LC50 values were determined using probit regression analysis with R software. Tests for algae and Artemia followed ISO guideline and international standardized protocols. For A. aurita, a modified protocol by Mercado et al. (2023) was used. The tested additives showed a toxicity around 600 mg/L for A. salina. For the algae, S1 was significantly more toxic (LC50 ≈ 100 mg/L) compared to S2 (LC50 ≈ 450 mg/L). Similarly, in A. aurita, S1 exhibited high toxicity (LC50 ≈ 10 mg/L) while S2 had a lower toxicity (LC50 ≈ 80 mg/L). Pulsation frequency data for A. aurita revealed that S1 initially increased pulsation rates at lower concentrations (maximum at 10 mg/L), followed by a significant decrease at higher concentrations. Conversely, S2 showed a steady decrease in pulsation rates up to 10 mg/L, with a slight increase at concentrations of 15, 20, and 25 mg/L. The results demonstrate varying sensitivity to the toxic effects of the two compounds across different trophic levels, with A. aurita ephyrae being the most sensitive. This suggests the potential efficacy of jellyfish as novel ecotoxicological models due to their heightened sensitivity, enabling detection of lower contaminant concentrations in test samples. Further research is required to enhance the efficiency of ecotoxicological assays using these models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e13895e320482776e7a605c22885072b653ae50061d0434260ad0699d54da2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
