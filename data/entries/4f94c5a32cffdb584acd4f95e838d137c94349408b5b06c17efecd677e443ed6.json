{"title":"Challenges in Silver Conservation: Characterizing the Composition and Sources of Unusual Tarnish on Seleucid Silver Coins Using SEM-EDS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.062/7719454?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Due to its status as a noble metal, one might expect that silver, a material abundant in antiquity and cultural heritage, would require little or no conservation, particularly in controlled museum environments. While silver demonstrates greater resistance to oxidation compared with other ancient metals like copper, iron, lead, and tin [<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B1\">1</a>], it possesses a vulnerability that complicates its long-term preservation. Silver exhibits an electrochemical affinity with sulfur, a contaminant that is naturally found in unregulated indoor environments, primarily in the form of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) [<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B2\">2</a>]. This process, commonly known as ‘silver tarnishing’, is well-documented and characterized by the growth of silver sulfide (acanthite, Ag<sub>2</sub>S) on the metal’s surface [<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B3\">3</a>]. Remarkably, airborne sulfur concentrations as minute as 0.2 ppb have been reported as sufficient to trigger silver sulfidation, with increased levels of moisture and sulfur accelerating the tarnishing rate [<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B4\">4</a>]. Prolonged exposure to ambient indoor conditions can result in tarnish layers beyond 100 nm thick [<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B5\">5</a>], giving the originally sleek and shiny metal a black/grey discoloration and dull appearance [<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B8\">8</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B9\">9</a>] which, by many curators and patrons, may be considered aesthetically displeasing. Consequently, conservators may be tasked with removing the tarnish chemically or mechanically using particles to abrade the surface, as necessary to reduce the crystalline silver sulfide [<a href=\"#ozae044.062-B10\">10</a>]. At the same time, unless the underlying environmental factors contributing to tarnishing are addressed, the silver artifacts will continue to react with the sulfur, requiring continuous treatment to maintain their appearance. This tarnishing/treatment cycle will cause the progressive removal of surface atoms, resulting in the loss of surface details that characterize the cultural heritage of the object. As such, the long-term preservation of silver artifacts necessitates the maximally achievable elimination of tarnish-inducing agents from their storage and/or exhibition environments. The exact sources responsible for the accelerated development of silver tarnish, however, are not always evident.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4f94c5a32cffdb584acd4f95e838d137c94349408b5b06c17efecd677e443ed6","category":"Environment"}
