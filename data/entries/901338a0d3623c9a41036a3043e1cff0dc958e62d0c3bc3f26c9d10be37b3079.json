{"title":"Study of Floristic, Morphological, and Genetic (atpF-atpH, ITS, matK, psbK-psbI, rbcL, and trnH-psbA) Differences in Crataegus ambigua Populations in Mangistau (Kazakhstan)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1407/v1","date":1713835020000,"content":"This article studies the morphological parameters of vegetative and generative organs of different age groups of Crataegus ambigua from four populations in Western Karatau (Mangistau region, Kazakhstan). The study examined four populations Pop 1 Sultan Epe, Pop 2 Karakozaiym, Pop 3 Emdikorgan, and Pop 4 Samal located in various gorges of western Karatau. Some phylogenetic inference methods were applied using six genetic markers atpF-atpH, ITS, matK, psbK-psbI, rbcL, and trnH-psbA. We also used a statistical analysis of the vegetative and generative organs of plants for three age groups of plants (virgin, young generative, and adult generative). According to the age structure, Samal populations have a high concentration of young generative plants - 42.3% and adult generative plants - 30.9%. Morphological analysis showed the significance of the parameters of the generative organs and separated the Samal population into a separate group according to the main PCoA coordinates. The results of the floristic analysis showed that the populations in the Samal have a high concentration of species diversity. The comparative dendrogram of UPGMA shows the informativeness of the use of genetic markers and the psbK-psbI region can be used to judge the difference between the fourth Samal population and the other three.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"901338a0d3623c9a41036a3043e1cff0dc958e62d0c3bc3f26c9d10be37b3079","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
