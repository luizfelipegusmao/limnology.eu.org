{"title":"Prevalence of Sarcopenia and its Related Clinical Factors in Postmenopausal Women with Type-1 Osteoporosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0468/v1","date":1723083654000,"content":"Background:  Sarcopenia is a progressive muscle disorder characterized by muscle wasting, decreased strength, and a substantially elevated risk of developing severe and potentially life-threatening health complications. For decades, muscle wasting has been recognized as a clinical symptom in various severe diseases and conditions. However, with increasing life expectancy and an aging population, sarcopenia has emerged as a prominent age-related condition in primary care, significantly contributing to disability and mortality rates.\nAim and Objective: Our goal was to elucidate the clinical characteristics associated with sarcopenia prevalence in postmenopausal women with type 1 osteoporosis.\nMethodology: 370 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients who routinely visited the physiotherapy department at Ali Fatima Hospital were examined in this cross-sectional investigation. Mean age 64.59 ± 5.85 years, it was discovered that the patients' quality of life, postural stability, muscular strength, and balance were related to the existence of sarcopenia. \nConclusion: In summary, among postmenopausal female patients with type 1 osteoporosis, the incidence of sarcopenia was relatively high (90.35%), affecting quality of life in 39.82% of patients, postural instability in 92.21% of patients, and balance in 39.92% of patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61898663337b532f4c819aa0492f464f36612089aaf690a4486a1a5f1976bdc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
