{"title":"Age-Related Variations in the Population of Active Secondary Hair Follicles, Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Parameters in Cashmere Goats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0774/v1","date":1712823123000,"content":"The objective of this study was to investigate age-related changes in cashmere production and the population of active secondary hair follicles in cashmere goats across different age groups, as well as to explore the association between secondary hair follicle activity and oxidative stress. A total of 104 adult Inner Mongolian ewe goats, aged between 2 and 7 years old, were randomly selected as experimental subjects. Skin samples were collected in August 2020 and cashmere samples were collected in April 2021. The cashmere fiber yield, staple length, and diameter showed age-related variations in cashmere goats aged 2 to 7 years (P &lt; 0.05). Cashmere production was higher in goats aged 2-4 years compared to those aged 5-7 years (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the population of primary and secondary hair follicles among goats aged 2 to 7 years. However, the population of active secondary hair follicles varied significantly with age, with the younger group (aged 2-4 years) having a higher population than those aged 5 â€“ 7 years (P &lt; 0.05). A moderate negative correlation was observed between cashmere fiber diameter and the population of active secondary hair follicles (P &lt; 0.05). Age-related variations in skin antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage were observed among cashmere goats aged 2 to 7 years old (P &lt; 0.05). Goats aged 2 to 4 years exhibited higher antioxidant capacity and lower oxidative damage (P &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, the skin antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage exhibited significant positive and negative correlations, respectively, with the population of active secondary hair follicles (P &lt; 0.05). This study presents a novel approach to enhance the activity of secondary hair follicles and improve cashmere production performance through the regulation of oxidative stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4c7b415f7240ea169695947b17e14d54b4da61a886ac716ac6c53a35d4197c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
