{"title":"Androgen Receptors in the Dermal Glands of Male and Female Ouachita Dusky Salamanders","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae001/7550032?rss=1","date":1705276800000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The presence of androgens in female development is an important, yet often overlooked, topic. We tested for the presence of androgen receptors (ARs) in the dermal glands of male and female <span>Desmognathus brimleyorum</span>, a plethodontid salamander. This species engages in a courtship behavior called the tail-straddling walk. During this process, communication between males and females is hypothesized to be facilitated by pheromones secreted from modified granular glands (MGGs) on the dorsal tail base, where the female's chin is positioned. These glands are present not only dorsally but also laterally and ventrally on the tail of both males and females. Using immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antibody, ARs were located in the MGGs of both sexes. Males had a higher percentage of immunopositive cells per MGG than females. The presence of ARs in both sexes highlights the similarity between MGGs in males and females and suggests androgens play a role in female gland function. Furthermore, our results suggest courtship communication is bidirectional, and females have a more active role, signaling the male, than previously described.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"f2728e6c78a899e36cab401ab06adc1db2593237660061aceaf0c95238450836","category":"Environment"}
