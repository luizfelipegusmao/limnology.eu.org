{"title":"REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE proteins are required for plastid proliferation and carotenoid accumulation in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/511/7674214?rss=1","date":1715731200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Increasing the amount of cellular space allocated to plastids will lead to increases in the quality and yield of crop plants. However, mechanisms that allocate cellular space to plastids remain poorly understood. To test whether the tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span> L.) <span>REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE</span> (<span>SlREC</span>) gene products serve as central components of the mechanism that allocates cellular space to plastids and contribute to the quality of tomato fruit, we knocked out the 4-member <span>SlREC</span> gene family. We found that <span>slrec</span> mutants accumulated lower levels of chlorophyll in leaves and fruits, accumulated lower levels of carotenoids in flowers and fruits, allocated less cellular space to plastids in leaf mesophyll and fruit pericarp cells, and developed abnormal plastids in flowers and fruits. Fruits produced by <span>slrec</span> mutants initiated ripening later than wild type and produced abnormal levels of ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA). Metabolome and transcriptome analyses of <span>slrec</span> mutant fruits indicated that the <span>SlREC</span> gene products markedly influence plastid-related gene expression, primary and specialized metabolism, and the response to biotic stress. Our findings and previous work with distinct species indicate that REC proteins help allocate cellular space to plastids in diverse species and cell types and, thus, play a central role in allocating cellular space to plastids. Moreover, the SlREC proteins are required for the high-level accumulation of chlorophyll and carotenoids in diverse organs, including fruits, promote the development of plastids and influence fruit ripening by acting both upstream and downstream of ABA biosynthesis in a complex network.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4686f24962e6444665f44be2c24294990b2bd7c320a84ff8df20db6a91377a71","category":"Environment"}
