{"title":"Metal Contamination and Human Health Risk Assessment of Soils from Parks and Playgrounds of an Industrialized Town (Galati, Romania)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0732/v1","date":1728544634000,"content":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contamination state of the surface soil from 10 parks and playgrounds from Galati, Romania, and the health hazard. The soil samples, collected in each site from the playing ground and from the edge of the park, were analyzed by using com-bined Wavelength- (WDXRF) and Energy-Dispersive (EDXRF) X-ray fluorescence techniques. A total number of 27 chemical elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sn, Sr, Ti, V, Zn and Zr) were quantified in the urban soils, and the results were compared to the normal and alert values from Romanian legislation for toxic trace elements, as well as with European and world average values of element concentrations. The mineralogical analyses were performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDX) and Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared technique (ATR-FTIR). To assess the soil contamination and the impact on human health of the presence of potential toxic elements and heavy metals in the soil, a series of pollution and health risk indices were used. All the results indicated an unpolluted to moderate polluted soil. The soil samples collected from the edge of the parks presented higher values for the specific pollutants that originated from heavy traffic, such as Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb. The non-carcinogenic risk to children was assessed using the estimate daily intakes (EDI), afferent to the pathways that pollutants can enter the human body, such as ingestion, dermal contact and inhalation. Using the obtained values for EDI, the hazard quotient and hazard index were determined, which strengthen the formerly issued presumption that soil pollution is moderate and, by itself, does not present any threat to the childrenâ€™s health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eec60b6b2c0f99970df1bbdbdae717df7316c834b9c73f5ab8fe534409369178","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
