{"title":"Respiratory Symptoms and Changes of Oxidative Stress Markers among Motorbike Drivers Chronically Exposed to Air Fine and Ultrafine Particle: The Case of Douala and Dschang, Cameroon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0862/v1","date":1715610546000,"content":"Recent studies releaved that the high production of reactive oxidative species due to exposure of fine or ultrafine particles are implicated in many chronical respiratory disorders. However, the poor standard of clinical data in sub-Saharan countries makes very difficult the assessment of knowledge of air pollution health impact in urban cities. Objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate distribution of respiratory disorders associated to exposure of air fine and ultrafine particles through changes of some oxidative stress biomarkers among motorbike drivers from two cities of Cameroon Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a standardized questionnaire was conducted in 2019 on 191 motorcycle drivers (MD) working in Douala and Dschang. Then, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by colorimetric methods. The data of participants after clustered in Excel Microsoft were analysed and statistically compared using Spss 2.0 software. Results: The motorbike drivers recruited to both cities were aged from 21 to 40, with mean age of 29.93 (Â± 0.82). The distribution of respiratory disorders as running nose, cold, dry cough, chest discomfort, and breathlessness, was significantly increased among MD in Douala. According to results of biological assays, SOD and MDA, were significantly more increased among MD recruited in Douala, compared to those of Dschang. The change of these oxidative stress markers was significantly correlated with mobilization of neutrophils and Monocytes showing initiation and evolution of subjacent inflammatory reactions, and seemed to be significantly influenced by place of habitation of MD. Conclusion: Through this study it is confirmed the evidence of initiation and evolution of oxidative stress with long-term exposure to air fine or ultrafine particles among active people in Urban cities. Further studies should be conducted with more analysis to provide evidence cellular damage and dysfunction related to chronically exposure to fine air PM among active people in metropolitan of sub-Saharan Africa context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ddd3c94673a8cea724981f3f9f00fe94f09a349edeb2b00716213a42b0289b71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
