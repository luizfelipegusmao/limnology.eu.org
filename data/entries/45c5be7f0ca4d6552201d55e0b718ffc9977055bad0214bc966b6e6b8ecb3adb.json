{"title":"Evaluation of Powder- and Extrusion- based Metal Additive Manufacturing Processes for the Fabrication of Spare Parts in Electromobility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1258/v1","date":1711009033000,"content":"Electromobility promises to efficiently mitigate consequences of increasing traffic volume and its accompanied greenhouse gas emissions. On an individual level, electrified bikes allow emission free electrified mobility at moderate costs and consequently their stock has increased significantly in recent years. This simultaneously increases the demand for spare parts, which are often manufacturer or application-specific, and due to many variants, challenging to provide for the market. This article evaluates powder-based and extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing of a typical electrified bike component to demonstrate an alternative spare parts supply. The investigation demonstrates how these parts can be additively manufactured function equivalent and with sufficient mechanical properties, also taking economical aspects into account. Furthermore, the needed resources and related environmental consequences for metal-based additive manufacturing spare-part production are compared for both process routes. The results show that both routes are capable of producing spare-parts at comparatively same mechanical performance and resource costs, while needed resources such as energy, gases and manufacturing time are significantly lower for powder-based, respectively machine costs for extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Therefore, additive manufacturing offers a promising opportunity to produce parts in small quantities resource efficient and rapidly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45c5be7f0ca4d6552201d55e0b718ffc9977055bad0214bc966b6e6b8ecb3adb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
