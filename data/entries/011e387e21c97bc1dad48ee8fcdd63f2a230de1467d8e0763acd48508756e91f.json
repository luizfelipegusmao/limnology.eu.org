{"title":"Development and Evaluation of a Dry Emulsion of Ostrich Oil as a Dietary Supplement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0644/v1","date":1720526827000,"content":"This study aimed to develop a high-quality dry emulsion incorporating omega-3, 6, and 9 fatty acid-rich ostrich oil for use as a dietary supplement. Extracted from abdominal adipose tissues using a low-temperature wet rendering method, the ostrich oil exhibited antioxidant properties, favorable physicochemical properties, microbial counts, heavy metal levels, and fatty acid compositions, positioning it as a suitable candidate for an oil-in-water emulsion and subsequent formulation as a dry emulsion. Lecithin was employed as the emulsifier due to its safety and health benefits. The resulting emulsion, comprising 10% w/w lecithin and 10% w/w ostrich oil, was stable, with a droplet size of 3.93 ± 0.11 μm. This liquid emulsion underwent transformation into a dry emulsion to preserve the physicochemical stability of ostrich oil, utilizing Avicel® PH-101 or Aerosil® 200 through a granulation process. Although Aerosil® 200 exhibited superior adsorption, Avicel® PH-101 granules surpassed it in releasing the ostrich oil emulsion. Consequently, Avicel® PH-101 was selected as the preferred adsorbent for formulating the ostrich oil dry emulsion. The dry emulsion, encapsulated with a disintegration time of 3.11 ± 0.14 min for ease of swallowing, maintained microbial loads and heavy metal contents within acceptable limits. Presented as granules containing butylated hydroxytoluene, the dry emulsion showcased robust temperature stability, suggesting the potential incorporation of animal fat into dry emulsions as a promising dietary supplement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"011e387e21c97bc1dad48ee8fcdd63f2a230de1467d8e0763acd48508756e91f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
