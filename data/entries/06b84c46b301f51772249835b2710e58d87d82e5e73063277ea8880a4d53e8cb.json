{"title":"Deep Learning Models for White Blood Cell Image Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1990/v1","date":1727258943000,"content":"White blood cells are crucial for immune defense in the human body, and fluctuations in their levels can lead to severe health issues. This research introduces a system designed for the localization and classification of white blood cells. The dataset utilized comprises two segments: one for localization consisting of 364 annotated images, and another for classification with 12,444 labeled images. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a robust system for the accurate localization and classification of white blood cells using deep learning techniques. The study explores two localization methods—a traditional technique and a deep learning-based approach—and evaluates five deep learning architectures for classification, including three pretrained and two custom models. Upon testing these models on the dataset, the study identifies and evaluates the most effective approach. The localization process achieved an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 71%, and the classification process reached an accuracy of 92%. The robustness of the model was further assessed by introducing different types of noise to test its resilience. The performance of this system demonstrates high accuracy and resilience to noise, which can be attributed to the use of a large dataset, our developed architectures, and our proposed methodology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06b84c46b301f51772249835b2710e58d87d82e5e73063277ea8880a4d53e8cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
