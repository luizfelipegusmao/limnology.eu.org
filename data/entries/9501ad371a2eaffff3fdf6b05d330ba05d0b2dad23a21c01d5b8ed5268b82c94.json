{"title":"Prevalence of BRCA mutation in breast and ovarian cancer among women in India: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306612","date":1721138400000,"content":"<p>by Abhilash Patra, Syeda Sana Ali, Ng Marina Devi, Amatullah Sana Qadeer, Sureshkumar Kamalakannan, Shona Nag, Shriniwas Subhash Kulkarni, Senthil Rajappa, Nisha Hariharan, Hira Ballabh Pant, Varun Agiwal, Nirupama A. Y.</p>\r\nPurpose <p>We present a methodically devised protocol for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at ascertaining the prevalence of BReast CAncer gene (BRCA) mutations in breast and ovarian cancer (BOC) among women in India. The review will include cross-sectional, cohort, case-series, and registry-based studies focusing on females clinically diagnosed with any stage of BOC, tested for BRCA germline mutation and undergone any form of treatment.</p> Methods <p>A Cochrane literature search will be carried out to identify all the published and unpublished articles available in English from 2010 till date across various electronic databases including PubMed, Psych Info, SCI, Cochrane Central, Embase, Scopus, IND Med and Google Scholar. A step-by-step process will be followed to select all the relevant studies for final inclusion using Rayyan software. The selection process of the review will be reported based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA) checklist. The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023463452). Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist will be used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. The outcome measure will be the prevalence of BRCA1/2 gene mutation in this population. Meta-analysis will be performed to report the pooled prevalence along with 95% confidence interval.</p> Discussion <p>The results of this review study will provide valuable insights for clinicians, and policy makers, enabling them to formulate guidelines that underscore the importance of screening for BRCA mutations in cases of BOC.</p>","author":"Abhilash Patra","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9501ad371a2eaffff3fdf6b05d330ba05d0b2dad23a21c01d5b8ed5268b82c94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
