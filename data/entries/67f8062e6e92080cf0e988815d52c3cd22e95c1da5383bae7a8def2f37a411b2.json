{"title":"Meta‐Analysis of the Causality of Deformations in Marine Fish Larvae Culture","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/9932995?af=R","date":1703750400000,"content":"<p>The development of deformities in farmed fish is largely the result of abiotic, biotic, and xenobiotic factors, information deficiencies in optimizing nutrition, and the genetic background to which the fish are exposed in their early life stages. In general, skeletal anomalies are considered to have significant adverse effects on animal welfare, biological performance of farmed fish, product quality, and production costs. In the data obtained by the meta-analysis method, the presence of negative effects on the formal structures of fish was found, regardless of the region, duration, stage, factor, stock density, and method used to detect deformation. In this regard, in the studies considered within the deformation region/type, 46% of deformities were found in the spine, 37% in the head, and 16% in the total skeleton. In turn, the results of the meta-analysis showed that the percentages of the apparent value were 35.82% in the spine, 33.12% in the skeleton, and 31.06% in the head. The deformation rate had an overall negative effect on the functional characteristics of the fish, regardless of the variables considered. In addition, all statistically significant individual response variables had a negative effect size. In the future, advanced statistical tools such as Bayesian meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis can be used to explore more complex data structures. The rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques will increase the efficiency of data collection and the robustness of results for meta-analysis studies in aquaculture and other fields.</p>","author":"Hatice Tekoğul, \nHülya Eminçe Saygı, \nMuammer Kürşat Fırat, \nMüge Aliye Hekimoğlu, \nŞahin Saka, \nCüneyt Suzer, \nOsman Özden, \nFatih Güleç, \nDeniz Çoban, \nJianguang Qin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"67f8062e6e92080cf0e988815d52c3cd22e95c1da5383bae7a8def2f37a411b2","category":"Environment"}
