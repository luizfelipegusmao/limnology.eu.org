{"title":"PaWOX3 and PaWOX3B Regulate Flower Number and the Lip Symmetry of Phalaenopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/8/1328/7696875?rss=1","date":1718928000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The standout characteristic of the orchid perianth is the transformation of the upper median petal into a distinctively formed lip, which gives orchid flowers their typically zygomorphic symmetry and makes them the most popular ornamental plants worldwide. To study orchid flower development, two <span>WUSCHEL</span>-related homeobox (<span>WOX</span>) genes, <span>PaWOX3</span> and <span>PaWOX3B</span>, were identified in <span>Phalaenopsis. PaWOX3</span> and <span>PaWOX3B</span> mRNAs accumulate abundantly during early reproductive development and perianths of young buds, significantly decreasing in mature flowers and absent in vegetative leaves and roots. <span>PaWOX3</span> and <span>PaWOX3B</span> virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) knockdown in <span>Phalaenopsis</span> significantly reduces floral bud numbers, suggesting that <span>PaWOX3/PaWOX3B</span> may be involved in flower initiation. Transgenic <span>Arabidopsis</span> ectopically expressing repressor forms of <span>PaWOX3/PaWOX3B</span> and their <span>Oncidium</span> ortholog, <span>OnPRS</span>, exhibit lateral organ development defects, implicating these genes likely have function in regulating growth and differentiation for lateral organs. Neither <span>PaWOX3, PaWOX3B</span> single nor <span>PaWOX3</span>/<span>PaWOX3B</span> double VIGS <span>Phalaenopsis</span> altered the flower morphology. Interestingly, double silencing of <span>PaWOX3</span> or <span>PaWOX3B</span> with <span>OAGL6-2</span>, which controlled the identity/formation of lips, altered the symmetry of ‘BigLip’ produced in <span>OAGL6-2</span> VIGS. This result indicated that the levels of <span>PaWOX3</span>/<span>PaWOX3B</span> are still sufficient to maintain the symmetry for the <span>OAGL6-2</span> VIGS ‘BigLip’. However, the symmetry of the <span>OAGL6-2</span> VIGS ‘BigLip’ cannot be maintained once the expression of <span>PaWOX3</span> or <span>PaWOX3B</span> is further reduced. Thus, in addition to controlling lip identity, this study further found that <span>OAGL6-2</span> could cooperate with functionally redundant <span>PaWOX3</span>/<span>PaWOX3B</span> in maintaining the symmetric axis of lip.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"098cc6dbb2b63b1707bcc5909e3dca41901461d6cdb15164f38ef439e275f803","category":"Environment"}
