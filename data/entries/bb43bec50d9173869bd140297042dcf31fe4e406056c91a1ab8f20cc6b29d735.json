{"title":"A qualitative exploration of the experiences of pregnant women living with obesity and accessing antenatal care","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302599","date":1714744800000,"content":"<p>by Margaret Charnley, Lisa Newson, Andrew Weeks, Julie Abayomi</p>\r\n\r\nWomen are advised to optimise weight before pregnancy. However, many are either already living with overweight or obesity prior to becoming pregnant, increasing the risks for adverse outcomes. Health care professionals (HCP) are responsible for advising women of risks throughout and following pregnancy. However, midwives often find broaching the conversation around maternal obesity difficult. This study explored the experiences of pregnant women living with obesity in accessing antenatal care. Seventeen women completed a semi-structured interview. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Four themes were developed: 1) antenatal care is inconsistent, 2) additional support is needed, 3) women feel judged about their weight, and 4) weight cycling is highly prevalent. Findings suggest that pregnant women living with obesity often experience weight bias from HCPs, feel judged because of their weight and are left feeling confused and overlooked. Women reported inconsistencies in advice and care offered and acknowledged a lack of continuity of care throughout pregnancy. We call for an urgent need for further multidisciplinary training to address the concerns, experiences and needs of pregnant women living with obesity.","author":"Margaret Charnley","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bb43bec50d9173869bd140297042dcf31fe4e406056c91a1ab8f20cc6b29d735","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
