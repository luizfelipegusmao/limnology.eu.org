{"title":"The requirement for external carbonic anhydrase in diatoms is influenced by the supply and demand for dissolved inorganic carbon","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13416?af=R","date":1708105134000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Photosynthesis by marine diatoms contributes significantly to the global carbon cycle. Due to the low concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater, many diatoms use extracellular carbonic anhydrase (eCA) to enhance the supply of CO<sub>2</sub> to the cell surface. While much research has investigated how the requirement for eCA is influenced by changes in CO<sub>2</sub> availability, little is known about how eCA contributes to CO<sub>2</sub> supply following changes in the demand for carbon. We therefore examined how changes in photosynthetic rate influence the requirement for eCA in three centric diatoms. Modeling of cell surface carbonate chemistry indicated that diffusive CO<sub>2</sub> supply to the cell surface was greatly reduced in large diatoms at higher photosynthetic rates. Laboratory experiments demonstrated a trend of an increasing requirement for eCA with increasing photosynthetic rate that was most pronounced in the larger species, supporting the findings of the cellular modeling. Microelectrode measurements of cell surface pH and O<sub>2</sub> demonstrated that individual cells exhibited an increased contribution of eCA to photosynthesis at higher irradiances. Our data demonstrate that changes in carbon demand strongly influence the requirement for eCA in diatoms. Cell size and photosynthetic rate will therefore be key determinants of the mode of dissolved inorganic carbon uptake.</p>","author":"Matthew Keys, \nBrian Hopkinson, \nAndrea Highfield, \nAbdul Chrachri, \nColin Brownlee, \nGlen L.
