{"title":"Immune Response of Silver Pomfret (Pampus argenteus) CC Chemokine Ligand Gene Family to Photobacterium damselae Subsp. Damselae and Nocardia seriolae Infections","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14032?af=R","date":1729681785000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Chemokines play a crucial role in immune responses by facilitating the migration of cells expressing corresponding chemokine receptors along concentration gradients. <i>Photobacterium damselae</i> subsp. <i>Damselae</i> (PDD) and <i>Nocardia seriolae</i> (NS) are known to induce substantial mortality in silver pomfret populations, yet there exists a dearth of research regarding the immune response of <i>CCL</i>s in PDD- or NS-infected silver pomfret. In our investigation, we identified 10 <i>PaCCL</i>s, which include one fish-specific <i>CCL</i> (<i>PaCCL44</i>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed considerable diversity in <i>CCL</i> types and copy numbers among various teleost fishes. Notably, silver pomfret lacks specific <i>CCL</i> genes, with most <i>PaCCL</i>s exhibiting heightened expression levels in immune-related organs such as the spleen and kidney, and some being expressed in mucosal immune-related organs like the skin and gills. Transcriptome analysis conducted on silver pomfret infected with NS and PDD elucidated that the expression changes of <i>PaCCL</i>s primarily manifested in the spleen during the initial stages of NS infection, shifting to the kidney in later stages. Conversely, the expression changes of <i>PaCCL</i>s following PDD infection predominantly occurred in the kidney. InÂ vitro studies using silver pomfret spleen cell lines demonstrated an early peak in <i>PaCCL</i>s expression during infection, followed by gradual decline with NS treatment and rapid diminishment with PDD treatment. These findings suggest that <i>PaCCL</i>s primarily support the innate immunity of silver pomfret, potentially exhibiting chemotactic effects in the early infection stages, such as the synergistic action of <i>PaCCL4</i> and <i>PaCCL25</i>, and later serving as direct antibacterial agents. NS invasion is characterised by a chronic infection affecting multiple organs, whereas PDD primarily inflicts severe damage to the kidney. <i>PaCCL19a</i> and <i>PaCCL19b</i> are specific to PDD, and their expression levels may decrease in the later stages of infection due to PDD immune escape. These data offer initial insights into understanding the mechanism underlying the innate immune response of the <i>CCL</i> gene family in silver pomfret and provide theoretical underpinnings for fish culture practices.</p>","author":"Kaiheng Yan, \nYouyi Zhang, \nYuanbo Li, \nMengke Tang, \nYifan Xu, \nXiaojun Yan, \nJiabao Hu, \nYajun Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"29b5310dcfd91407a5e4daf1bb8fc8cee3a7acfae100c38a8ac124438f81c474","category":"Environment"}
