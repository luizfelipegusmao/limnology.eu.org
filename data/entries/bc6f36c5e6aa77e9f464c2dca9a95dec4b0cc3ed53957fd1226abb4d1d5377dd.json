{"title":"The evolution of life span and aging in response to dietary macronutrients in male and female decorated crickets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/5/971/7608703?rss=1","date":1707955200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Dietary macronutrients regulate life span and aging, yet little is known about their evolutionary effects. Here, we examine the evolutionary response of these traits in decorated crickets (<span>Gryllodes sigillatus</span>) maintained on diets varying in caloric content and protein-to-carbohydrate ratio. After 37 generations, each population was split: half remained on the evolution diet, and half switched to a standardized diet. Crickets lived longer and aged slower when evolving on high-calorie (both sexes) and carbohydrate-biased (females only) diets and had lower baseline mortality on high-calorie (females only) diets. However, on the standardized diet, crickets lived longer when evolving on high-calorie diets (both sexes), aged slower on high-calorie (females only) and carbohydrate-biased (both sexes) diets, and had lower baseline mortality on high-calorie (males only) and protein-biased (both sexes) diets. Life span was longer, and baseline mortality was lower when provided with the evolution vs. the standardized diet, but the aging rate was comparable. Moreover, life span was longer, aging slower (females only), and baseline mortality was lower (males only) compared to our evolved baseline, suggesting varying degrees of dietary adaptation. Collectively, we show dietary components influence the evolution of life span and aging in different ways and highlight the value of combining experimental evolution with nutritional geometry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"bc6f36c5e6aa77e9f464c2dca9a95dec4b0cc3ed53957fd1226abb4d1d5377dd","category":"Environment"}
