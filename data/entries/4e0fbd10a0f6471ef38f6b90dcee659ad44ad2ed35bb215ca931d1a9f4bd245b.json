{"title":"Advance personal planning knowledge, attitudes, and participation amongst community-dwelling older people living in regional New South Wales, Australia: A cross-sectional survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309152","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Emilie C. Cameron, Nola Ries, Amy Waller, Briony Johnston, John Anderson, Jamie Bryant</p>\r\nBackground <p>Advance personal planning (APP) involves planning for future periods of incapacity, including making legal decisions and documents. APP ensures that a personâ€™s values and preferences are known and respected. This study aimed to examine knowledge of APP, attitudes and confidence towards APP, and participation in APP activities among older people residing in regional and rural areas.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional survey was conducted with people aged over 65 years residing in and around regional towns in New South Wales, Australia. Participants responded to a social media advertisement or information provided through a community organisation. Data was collected via pen and paper survey or an online survey. The survey was developed for the study and included questions about the participant and their experiences with APP. Poisson regression modelling was conducted to explore the relationship between APP participation and APP knowledge, confidence and attitudes as well as the participant characteristics associated with APP participation.</p> Results <p>Overall, 216 people completed the survey. Most participants had a will (90%) but only a third (32%) had documented an advance care directive. Knowledge of APP was low with only 2.8% of participants correctly answering all 6 knowledge questions. Participants had a positive attitude towards APP and high level of confidence that they could discuss APP issues with important people in their life. Those with increased knowledge, confidence and attitude towards APP were significantly more likely to participate in APP activities. Older age and having private health insurance were significantly associated with engaging in APP activities. Increased frailty and the presence of health conditions were not associated with increased APP participation.</p> Conclusions <p>There is a need to increase engagement with APP particularly among those who may be considered frail or have chronic health conditions. Increasing knowledge of, confidence and attitudes towards, APP could help to increase engagement in APP activities.</p>","author":"Emilie C.
