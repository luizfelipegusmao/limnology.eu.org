{"title":"Decoding Cold Mechanisms of Enhanced Bone Repair through Sensory Receptors and Molecular Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2177/v1","date":1724944481000,"content":"Applying cold to a bone injury can aid healing, though its mechanisms are complex. This study investigates how cold therapy impacts bone repair to optimize healing. Cold was applied to a rodent bone model, with physiological responses analyzed. Vasoconstriction was mediated by an increase in TRP channels, TRPA1 (p=0.012) and TRPM8 (p&amp;lt;0.001), within cortical defects enhancing sensory response and blood flow regulation. Cold exposure also elevated hypoxia (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and VEGF expression (p &amp;lt; 0.001), promoting angiogenesis vital for bone regeneration. Increased expression of osteogenic proteins PGC-1Î± (p = 0.039) and RBM3 (p&amp;lt;0.008) suggests stimulated reparative processes. Enhanced osteoblast differentiation and ALP presence at days 5 (three-fold, p=0.014) and 10 (two-fold, p=0.010) were observed, along with increased osteocalcin (OCN) at day 10 (two-fold, p = 0.010) indicating presence of mature osteoblasts capable of mineralization. These findings highlight cold therapy's multifaceted effects on bone repair, offering insights for therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6eb95015fd04ca09ca6ee00142150ac6288fc96c2693b536fcb871e27bd58a1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
