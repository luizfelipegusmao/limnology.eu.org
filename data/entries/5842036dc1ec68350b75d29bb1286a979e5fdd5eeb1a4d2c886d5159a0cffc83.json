Molecular epidemiology and serotyping studies have suggested that some variants are host specific; however, these associations have not been evaluated by cross-challenging fish species with putatively host-associated <i>F. psychrophilum</i> isolates via more natural (i.e. immersion) exposure routes. To this end, <i>F. psychrophilum</i> isolates US19-COS, US62-ATS and US87-RBT, each originally recovered from diseased coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i>), Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) or rainbow trout (<i>O. mykiss</i>), and belonging to a host-associated multilocus sequence typing clonal complex (e.g. CC-ST9, CC-ST232 or CC-ST10), were PCR-serotyped, evaluated for proteolytic activity, and used to challenge adipose fin-clipped 4-month old Atlantic salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout via immersion. Findings showed US87-RBT caused disease and mortality only in rainbow trout (e.g. 56.7% survival probability). US19-COS and US62-ATS caused more mortality in coho salmon and Atlantic salmon but also caused disease in both other host species, albeit to a lesser extent. Observed survival differences may be due to variant antigenic/virulence determinants as differences in serotype and proteolytic activity were discovered. Collectively, results highlight the intricacies of <i>F</i>. <i>psychrophilum</i>-host interactions and provide further inÂ vivo evidence that some <i>F. psychrophilum</i> MLST variants are host specific, which may have implications for the development of BCWD prevention and control strategies.</p>","author":"Christopher Knupp, \nThomas P.
