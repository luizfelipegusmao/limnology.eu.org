{"title":"Cotton leaf curl Multan virus subverts the processing of hydroxyproline-rich systemin to suppress tobacco defenses against insect vectors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5819/7686920?rss=1","date":1717372800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Insect vector–virus–plant interactions have important ecological and evolutionary implications. The constant struggle of plants against viruses and insect vectors has driven the evolution of multiple defense strategies in the host as well as counter-defense strategies in the viruses and insect vectors. Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) is a major causal agent of cotton leaf curl disease in Asia and is exclusively transmitted by the whitefly <span>Bemisia tabaci</span>. Here, we report that plants infected with CLCuMuV and its betasatellite CLCuMuB enhance the performance of the <span>B. tabaci</span> vector, and βC1 encoded by CLCuMuB plays an important role in begomovirus–whitefly–tobacco tripartite interactions. We showed that CLCuMuB βC1 suppresses the jasmonic acid signaling pathway by interacting with the subtilisin-like protease 1.7 (NtSBT1.7) protein, thereby enhancing whitefly performance on tobacco plants. Further studies revealed that in wild-type plants, NtSBT1.7 could process tobacco preprohydroxyproline-rich systemin B (NtpreproHypSysB). After CLCuMuB infection, CLCuMuB βC1 could interfere with the processing of NtpreproHypSysB by NtSBT1.7, thereby impairing plant defenses against whitefly. These results contribute to our understanding of tripartite interactions among virus, plant, and whitefly, thus offering ecological insights into the spread of vector insect populations and the prevalence of viral diseases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"58851f367be0d311218a0eaa9729641e681a4e8afdd789e8373133979f06b523","category":"Environment"}
