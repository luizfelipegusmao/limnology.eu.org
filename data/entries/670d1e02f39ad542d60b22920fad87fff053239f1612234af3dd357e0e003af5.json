With the first patents filed for SLA printers in the late 1980s, the precision, repeatability, and range of usable materials for them has expanded greatly [<a href=\"#ozae044.431-B1\">1</a>]. Early printers were extremely slow, expensive to maintain, and material choices were limited. The efficiency of printers has increased ten-fold, allowing modern printers to print at resolutions of 25-micrometers, with full-sized prints completed within hours, and with near perfect reproducibility for mass manufacturing of parts. Along with the increase in quality of the machines, the number of printing materials has increased to include biologically compatible materials, leading to applications in various research subjects and industries such as dentistry, biomedical engineering, aerospace, and microbiology [<a href=\"#ozae044.431-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"670d1e02f39ad542d60b22920fad87fff053239f1612234af3dd357e0e003af5","category":"Environment"}
