{"title":"A Nature-Inspired Approach to Energy-Efficient Relay Selection in LPWAN","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1419/v1","date":1713922257000,"content":"Despite Low Power Wide Area Networks’ ability to offer an extended range, it might still encounter challenges with coverage blind spots in the network. This article proposes an innovative energy-efficient nature-inspired relay selection algorithm for LoRa-based LPWAN networks, serving as a solution for challenges related to poor signal range in areas with limited coverage. A behavior swarm-inspired approach has been utilized to select the relays’ localization in the network, providing network energy efficiency and radio signal extension. These relays help bridge communication gaps, significantly reducing the impact of coverage blind spots by forwarding signals from devices with poor direct connectivity with the gateway. The proposed algorithm considers critical factors for the LoRa standard, such as the Spreading Factor or device energy budget analysis. The simulation experiments validate the proposed scheme’s effectiveness in terms of energy efficiency under diverse multi-gateway topology scenarios involving thousands of devices. Specifically, it has been verified that the proposed approach outperforms the reference method in preventing the battery depletion of relays, which is vital for battery-powered IoT devices. Furthermore, for some large-scale problems, the proposed heuristic method achieves over twice the speed of the exact method with a negligible accuracy loss of less than 2%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"458d1b05e5283e8b5ca9eff7a096a69feab920fd216cc22ce2ca9953b231f4e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
