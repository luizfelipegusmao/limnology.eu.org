Hundley</p>\r\n\r\nIn Lower-Middle-Income-Countries women are encouraged to present at a birthing facility for skilled care, but attending early can be associated with additional harm. Women admitted in latent labour are more likely to receive a cascade of unnecessary interventions compared with those attending a birthing facility during active labour. One reason that women present early is pain, with higher rates of admission among those who pain catastrophise. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of pain catastrophising in nulliparous women in Nepal and to identify predictors for pain catastrophising. A cross sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured survey. The survey was completed by 170 women (18–32 years) in one higher education institution in Kathmandu. The survey included the pain catastrophising scale (PCS), current and previous pain and information about period pain, sociodemographic variables of age, ethnicity, and religion. The prevalence of pain catastrophising reported at a cut off score of PCS≥20 was 55.9% and at a cut off score of PCS≥30 was 17.1%. All women with a PCS ≥30 reported having painful periods. Those with a PCS≥20 were four times [95%CI 1.93–8.42] more likely to report painful periods affecting their daily activities (p&lt;0.001) and those with PCS≥30 three times [95%CI1.10–10.53] more likely (p&lt;0.05). In both cases ethnicity and age were not associated. Women with higher PCS were less likely to take pain medication. A high prevalence of pain catastrophising was reported. It is important to understand how women’s previous negative experiences of pain and pain catastrophising are perceived and if they are contributing to the rise in obstetric intervention, particularly caesarean births, in Nepal. We recommend repeating this study with a larger sample representing a more diverse population.","author":"Carol J.
