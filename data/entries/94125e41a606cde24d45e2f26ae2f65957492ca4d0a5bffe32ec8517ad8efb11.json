{"title":"Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence Paving the Future of Cardiac Interventions and Training, a Review of the Available Reviews","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2055/v1","date":1727334757000,"content":"Several medical graduates, avoid surgical specialties especially those with complex and delicate anatomy due to their doubt in their visual spatial abilities. Many patients are deemed inoperable, particularly in the field of pediatric cardiology, due to the complexity of the anatomy. On a similar note, stratification of risk of cardiac interventions, and decision making, is a room of significant person-based and center-based bias. Two inter-related technologies, namely immersive virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence have made impossible things possible and can help to standardize decision making strategies. This review aimed at reviewing the main anatomical and lesion-based scopes of these advancements in the field of cardiac care, with a special focus on pediatric cardiology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94125e41a606cde24d45e2f26ae2f65957492ca4d0a5bffe32ec8517ad8efb11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
