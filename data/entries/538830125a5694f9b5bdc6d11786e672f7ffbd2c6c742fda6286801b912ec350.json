{"title":"Scientific collaborative within-group conduct, data-sharing, and publication agreements","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/10/710/7756521?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As science becomes ever more collaborative, the mechanisms for working in large and more diverse groups become more necessary. In the present article, I explore the utility of within-group collaboration agreements on participant conduct toward other project participants, within-group data sharing, and authorship of published manuscripts for research groups. Such agreements can solidify the expectations of the interactions among collaborators, potential rewards, and a feeling of security for those involved in the projects. They could also lead to more productive and satisfying research, as well as improving the training of future scientists.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"538830125a5694f9b5bdc6d11786e672f7ffbd2c6c742fda6286801b912ec350","category":"Environment"}
