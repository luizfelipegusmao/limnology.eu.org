{"title":"Psychological well-being of healthcare workers during COVID-19 in a mental health institution","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300329","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by HoiTing Leung, Madeline Lim, Wee Onn Lim, Sara-Ann Lee, Jimmy Lee</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>This study examined the psychological wellbeing of Healthcare Workers (HCWs) during COVID-19 in a mental health setting, associations of psychosocial wellbeing with coping style, and ways that organisations can mitigate the psychosocial burden on HCWs.</p> Methods <p>Thirty-seven Mental HCWs (MHCWs) from infected and non-infected wards (control group), were recruited and assessed at three timepoints. Psychological wellbeing, perceived cohesion, and coping style (Brief-COPE) were assessed. Reports on individual coping and feedback on the organisation were collected through in-depth interview. Comparison between infected and non-infected wards, as well as comparison of psychosocial measures and perceived cohesion, across the three timepoints were made. As there were no significant changes in coping styles across the timepoints, Timepoint 1 (T1) coping style was used to correlate with the psychosocial measures across all timepoints. Thematic analysis was used for qualitative data.</p> Results <p>MHCWs from infected wards reported significantly higher levels of stress, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.74, p = 0.009, effect size: medium (ε<sup>2</sup> = 0.198), and more severe sleep disturbance (PSQI), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.20, p = 0.013, effect size: medium (ε<sup>2</sup> = 0.182), as compared to the control group at T2. They also engaged in more problem-focused coping (T2 and T3) and emotion-focused coping (T2). As expected, negative coping style was correlated with negative outcomes except problem-focused coping that was correlated with both negative (sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms) and positive outcomes (wellbeing). Emotion-focused coping was moderately correlated (T<sub>b</sub> = 0.348, p&lt;0.017) with higher levels of wellbeing at T2. Thematic analyses revealed MHCWs felt supported by the responsiveness of the institution, emotional and informational support, and the availability from direct leaders, presence of team and hospital leaders on the ground, helped build trust and confidence in the leadership.</p> Conclusions <p>MHCWs experienced significantly higher levels of stress and sleep disturbance during COVID-19. The ways that organizations can offset the psychological burden of pandemics on MHCWs are discussed.</p>","author":"HoiTing Leung","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ef2e90a028e7c3c9a48c70526cfba59b680d59f81a5ee4ea1fdfc863f156a321","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
