{"title":"Probing Enzyme@Metal-Organic Framework Interactions for Enhanced Stability and Catalytic Efficiency Using Cryogenic Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (CryoEELS) and Energy-Filtered TEM (EF-TEM)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.623/7719580?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Enzymes offer a sustainable alternative to traditional catalysts currently employed in chemical synthesis and bioremediation. Nonetheless, their utility is constrained by their susceptibility to denaturation under non-native conditions such as elevated temperatures, extreme pH levels, or exposure to organic solvents [<a href=\"#ozae044.623-B1\">1</a>]. Consequently, significant research has focused on developing materials that can prevent the degradation of enzymes. A promising approach involves the encapsulation of enzymes within metal-organic frameworks (E@MOFs), synthetic biocomposite crystals capable of enhancing the stability and longevity of encapsulated enzymes [<a href=\"#ozae044.623-B2\">2-4</a>]. Enzyme encapsulation is commonly achieved by performing MOF synthesis in the presence of the enzyme; where the enzyme often mediates the crystal nucleation and growth and enables encapsulation. A critical knowledge gap in our understanding of E@MOF structure is how the precise spatial localization and distribution patterns of the enzymes encapsulated within the MOF crystals affect their overall properties. Addressing this necessitates a fundamental understanding of the enzyme spatial localization and orientation within MOF crystals. The prevailing methods to assess enzyme spatial distribution in E@MOFs involve indirect studies conducted after thermal calcination [<a href=\"#ozae044.623-B1\">1</a>], confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) paired with fluorescent protein labeling [<a href=\"#ozae044.623-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.623-B3\">3</a>], or nanolabeling the proteins, and then imaging using conventional electron microscopy techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.623-B5\">5</a>]. Despite this progress, a broad method to ascertain enzyme spatial localization and orientation with individual enzyme resolution has remained elusive. Therefore, by understanding enzyme-MOF (E@MOF) interactions, avenues for sustainable and efficient chemical synthesis, bioremediation, and related applications can be realized and steer the field toward greener and more effective practices. Here, we utilize advanced techniques such as cryogenic electron energy loss spectroscopy (cryoEELS) and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) to determine enzyme location and orientation inside the E@MOF. The results obtained from CryoEELS provide elemental composition and high-resolution distribution information, while EFTEM offers unique contrast information to distinguish the enzyme from the MOF. These results provide a new understanding of the nucleation and growth mechanism of E-MOF systems, advancing the field of E@MOF catalysis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e62bbbd237d548a7439c7bf4a259f926662e5fc379dac3e378f4e06602ca83e3","category":"Environment"}
