All dyads engaged in intense fights, in which the first attacker became the dominant one, regardless of the body weight difference. During the contest phase, both fish can interrupt their EOD. In the post-resolution phase, only subordinates emit electric signals of submission. Additionally, an EOD rate rank was established: The dominant fish's EOD has a higher rate than the subordinate's EOD.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Electric fish are good models in neuroethology as any behavior in electric fish involves both locomotor and electrical displays, which are experimentally accessible and controlled by well-known neural circuits. The agonistic behavior within the genus <i>Gymnotus</i> has been evaluated in <i>Gymnotus carapo</i> and <i>Gymnotus omarorum</i>, providing an advantageous model system to address comparative analyses. <i>Gymnotus sylvius</i> is a weakly electric fish which occurs in sympatry with <i>G. omarorum</i> in freshwater environments of Argentina. Here, we describe the agonistic behavior of <i>G. sylvius</i> in laboratory conditions. All dyads engaged in intense fights, with a latency to the first attack of 8 ± 7.8 s and a contest phase of 42.71 ± 31.7 s. Individual initiative in the first attack predicted contest outcome with no apparent influence of body weight asymmetry between contenders. Contenders did not escalate in their aggression during the short contest; in turn, subordinates tended to retreat in response to dominants' attacks. Submission and dominance were expressed by electric signals: dominants increased their basal electric organ discharge (EOD) rate after contest resolution, resulting in a persistent EOD rate rank. Subordinates also emitted chirps and offs during the contest and post-resolution phases without a clear temporal pattern. The agonistic behavior of <i>G. sylvius</i> presents some similarities with other species of the genus Gymnotus: EOD rank between dominants and subordinates, electric signals of submission, and the presence of attacks in the post-resolution phase. On the other hand, it also presents differences: a shorter evaluation phase in <i>G. sylvius</i>, initiative as a determinant of outcome, a higher attack rate of dominants in <i>G. sylvius</i>, a different temporal pattern of chirps, and different mechanisms to separate EOD rate of dominants and subordinates. These facts open a promising road to analyze the evolution of different neuroendocrine strategies, operating on homologous neural pathways, to command the same behavior.</p>","author":"Rossana Perrone, \nAlejandra Hurtado, \nAna Silva, \nPatricia Black‐Décima","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ethology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a94182f50d5fe321f60efa1a57eebe5c3e6a74d1fa25ba04a906a999025c0b6","entryHash":"fa7d373325a90ecca702df73aba4c5c88411b9f6df1d0801c4465a1187eab288","category":"Environment"}
