{"title":"Selective Isolation and Identification of Microorganisms with Dual Capabilities: Leather Biodegradation and Heavy Metal Resistance for Industrial Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0399/v1","date":1712307714000,"content":"Tanning, crucial for leather production, relies heavily on chromium yet poses risks due to chromium's oxidative conversion, leading to significant wastewater and solid waste generation. Physico-chemical methods are typically used for heavy metal removal, but they have drawbacks, prompting interest in eco-friendly biological remediation techniques like biosorption, bioaccumulation, and biotransformation. The EU Directive (2018/850) mandates alternatives to landfilling or incineration for industrial textile waste management, highlighting the importance of environmentally conscious practices for leather products' end-of-life management, with com-posting being the most researched and viable option. This study aimed to isolate microorganisms from tannery wastewater and identify those responsible for different types of tanned leather biodegradation. Using a leather biodegradation assay (ISO 20136) with tannery and municipal wastewaters as inoculum, bacterial shifts during leather biodegradation were observed. Over 10,000 bacterial species were identified in all analyzed samples, with 8 bacterial strains isolated from tannery wastewater. Identification of bacterial genera like Acinetobacter, Brevundimo-nas, and Mycolicibacterium provides insights into potential microbial candidates for enhancing leather biodegradability, wastewater treatment, and heavy metal bioremediation in industrial applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ddfa75e4f51a3654bff8357a8553c8d3d9103deddd88b3ee48c55758321376e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
