{"title":"Moderate-intensity physical activity reduces the role of serum PFAS on COPD: A cross-sectional analysis with NHANES data","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308148","date":1723039200000,"content":"<p>by Manyi Pan, Yuxin Zou, Gang Wei, Caoxu Zhang, Kai Zhang, Huaqi Guo, Weining Xiong</p>\r\nBackground <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has emerged as a leading cause of chronic disease morbidity and mortality globally, posing a substantial public health challenge. Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals known for their high stability and durability. Research has examined their potential link to decreased lung function. Physical activity (PA) has been identified as one of the primary modalities of the non-pharmacological treatment of COPD.</p> Methods <p>To investigate the relationship between PFAS and COPD, and whether physical activity could reduce the risk of COPD caused by PFAS exposure, we used data from the NHANES 2013â€“2018, a cross-sectional study. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations between PFAS and COPD in adult populations, and their associations in different PA types.</p> Results <p>We finally included 4857 participants in the analysis, and found that Sm-PFOS (OR: 1.250), PFOA (OR: 1.398) and n-PFOA (OR: 1.354) were closely related to COPD; After stratified by gender, age and smoking, the results showed that Sm-PFOA (OR: 1.312) was related to COPD in female adult, and PFOA (OR: 1.398) and n-PFOA (OR: 1.354) were associated with COPD in male adults; The associations of Sm-PFOS (OR: 1.280), PFOA (OR: 1.481) and n-PFOA (OR: 1.424)with COPD tended to be stronger and more consistent in over 50 years old adults; Sm-PFOS was related to COPD in current smoker (OR: 1.408), and PFOA was related to COPD in former smoker (OR: 1.487); Besides, in moderate-intensity PA group, there were no associations of Sm-PFOS, PFOA and n-PFOA with COPD stratified by gender, age and smoking.</p> Conclusion <p>PFAS exposure may increase the risk of developing COPD, but regular moderate-intensity physical activity can protect individuals from evolving to the disease. However, longitudinal studies are needed to support these preliminary findings.</p>","author":"Manyi Pan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fb10797e06d2cd3c7546d3eab2a7bfcc0a6ca58ddb9d322931681a223d7a37d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
