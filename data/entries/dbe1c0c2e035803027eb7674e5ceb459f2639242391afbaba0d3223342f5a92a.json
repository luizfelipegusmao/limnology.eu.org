{"title":"Impact of Stabilization Splint Therapy on Orthodontic Diagnosis in Patients with Signs and Symptoms of Temporomandibular Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1693/v1","date":1721631373000,"content":"We evaluated the dentofacial characteristics and temporomandibular disorder (TMD) symptomatology of patients with orthopedic instability before and after deprogramming with a stabilization splint. Sixty patients with the signs and symptoms of TMD were assessed using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) and underwent stabilization splint therapy to place the condyles in a more stable musculoskeletal position. The amount of condylar displacement was evaluated using the condylar position indicator (CPI). Six-teen angular and linear hard tissue landmarks were traced and compared from lateral cephalo-grams taken in the maximum intercuspation (MI) position before and in the centric relation (CR) position after the splint therapy. Following the splint therapy, the signs and symptoms of TMD were significantly reduced or completely eliminated in more than 90% of the patients. Compared with the values registered before the splint therapy, a significant reduction in the mean values of condylar displacement was observed on both sides of the vertical, horizontal, and transverse planes of space after the splint therapy. A comparison of pre- and post-splint lateral cephalograms revealed that, following the splint therapy, the mandible moved more posteriorly and rotated more in a clockwise direction. In patients with orthopedic instability and signs and symptoms of TMD, deprogramming of the neuromuscular system with a stabilization splint is highly recommended to provide a correct orthodontic diagnosis and improve the health of temporomandibular joint structures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbe1c0c2e035803027eb7674e5ceb459f2639242391afbaba0d3223342f5a92a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
