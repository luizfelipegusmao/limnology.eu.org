In the central nervous system, zinc ions are involved in synaptic transmission. Therefore, zinc homeostasis is essential, and cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to control cellular zinc concentration, including the zincosome formation. Alterations of free zinc levels have been associated with brain dysfunction and are present in many illnesses and syndromes. Astrocytes are implicated in the maintenance of the neuronal milleu and brain homeostasis. In this work, we have analyzed the combination of direct (TSQ) and indirect (autometallography) zinc detection methods to increase sensitivity for studying zinc uptake by rat astrocytes <span>in vitro</span>. Zincosome formation was visualized with the zinc fluorochrome TSQ by light microscopy. Additionally, we improved both zinc precipitation and cellular fixation methods to preserve zinc ions and make them suitable for autometallography development. Our tests pinpointed paraformaldehyde and sodium sulfide as the more adequate methods for cellular fixation and zinc precipitation, respectively. TSQ incubation and pH of the fixative were shown to be crucial for autometallography. Using this improved method, we visualized the zinc content of zincosomes at the ultrastructural level both as silver autometallographic precipitates and as electrodense sulfide-osmium zinc precipitates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c4562ccb97ae74ca79f10b9dbde3c9409e063bf2d132d7d912a5e24162875c03","category":"Environment"}
