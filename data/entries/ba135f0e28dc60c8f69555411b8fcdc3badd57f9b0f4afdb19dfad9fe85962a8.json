{"title":"Length‐Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LB‐SPR) for Red Grouper (Epinephelus morio) and Associated Species in the Commercial Fishery of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/9960996?af=R","date":1712127600000,"content":"<p>The study calculated the Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LB-SPR) for several species, including red grouper (<i>Epinephelus morio</i>), black grouper (<i>Mycteroperca bonaci</i>), gag grouper (<i>M. microlepis</i>), yellowtail snapper (<i>Ocyurus chrysurus</i>), lane snapper (<i>Lutjanus synagris</i>), hogfish (<i>Lachnolaimus maximus</i>), and white grunt (<i>Haemulon plumierii</i>). Data were obtained from the small-scale commercial fleet operating in the red grouper fishery on the Campeche Bank within the Yucatan Peninsula. Monthly records of total length (cm) from April 2017 to May 2018, totaling 10,182 fish, were collected from five fishing ports along the Yucatan Peninsula coast. Biological data, such as growth and reproductive patterns and exploitation parameters were gathered from scientific literature. The LB-SPR package on the R Core Team platform was utilized for analysis. Despite being the largest, groupers exhibited immaturity (SL<sub>50</sub> &lt; <i>L</i>\n<sub>50</sub>) and low Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR). Red and black groupers showed particularly low SPR values (0.10 and 0.05, respectively), indicating a looming risk of local extinction. The gag grouper achieved the highest SPR value (0.26) among groupers, although it was very close to the minimum critical value (i.e., 0.20). Snappers, hogfish, and white grunt were generally captured in the adult state (SL<sub>50</sub> &gt; <i>L</i>\n<sub>50</sub>). Yellowtail, hogfish, and white grunt displayed high SPR values (0.44, 0.72, and 0.98, respectively). Lane snapper had a low SPR (0.28) but fell within the range for maintaining satisfactory stock productivity, albeit with reduced yields. The findings emphasize the urgent need to adjust the current management framework for the red grouper fishery, focusing on improving fishing gear selectivity to address heightened pressure on both juvenile groupers and adult lane snapper. Implementing these measures is crucial to mitigate the risks of local extinction and population decline for each species.</p>","author":"Luis Alberto Rincón‒Sandoval, \nJorge Alberto López‒Rocha, \nGeorgii Ruban","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"ba135f0e28dc60c8f69555411b8fcdc3badd57f9b0f4afdb19dfad9fe85962a8","category":"Environment"}
