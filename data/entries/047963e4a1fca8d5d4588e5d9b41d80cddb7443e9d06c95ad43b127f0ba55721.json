{"title":"Do Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae) mite flows between Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies bias colony infestation evaluation for resistance selection?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae068/7710978?rss=1","date":1720656000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Since the global invasion of the ectoparasitic mite <span>Varroa destructor</span> (Anderson and Trueman), selection of mite-resistant honey bee (<span>Apis mellifera L.</span>) colonies appears challenging and has to date not broadly reduced colony mortality. The low published estimated heritability values for mite infestation levels could explain the limited genetic progresses obtained so far. We hypothesize that intercolonial horizontal mite transmission could differentially affect the single colonies located in a given apiary and therefore invisibly bias colony infestation phenotypes. This bias may be lower in regions with lower colony density, providing suitable conditions to set up evaluation apiaries. To verify these hypotheses, we monitored mite infestation and reinvasion in experimental colonies, as well as infestation in neighboring colonies belonging to beekeepers in three areas with variable colony densities in the canton of Bern, Switzerland during three consecutive beekeeping seasons. Mite immigration fluctuated between apiaries and years and significantly contributed to colony infestation level. Depending on apiary and year, 17–48% of the mites present in the experimental colonies at the time of the summer oxalic acid final treatment potentially derived from mite immigration that had occurred since mid-spring. Mite immigration was not linked to local colony density or the infestation levels of beekeepers’ colonies located within 2 km. Our results do not prove that apiaries for colony evaluation should necessarily be established in areas with low colony density. However, they highlight the high impact of beekeeping management practices on mite colony infestation levels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"047963e4a1fca8d5d4588e5d9b41d80cddb7443e9d06c95ad43b127f0ba55721","category":"Environment"}
