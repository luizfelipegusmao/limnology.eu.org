{"title":"Hypothermia effects on neuronal plasticity post spinal cord injury","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301430","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Hasan Al-Nashash, Ka-Leung Wong, Angelo H. ALL</p>\r\nBackground <p>SCI is a time-sensitive debilitating neurological condition without treatment options. Although the central nervous system is not programmed for effective endogenous repairs or regeneration, neuroplasticity partially compensates for the dysfunction consequences of SCI.</p> Objective and hypothesis <p>The purpose of our study is to investigate whether early induction of hypothermia impacts neuronal tissue compensatory mechanisms. Our hypothesis is that although neuroplasticity happens within the neuropathways, both above (forelimbs) and below (hindlimbs) the site of spinal cord injury (SCI), hypothermia further influences the upper limbs’ SSEP signals, even when the SCI is mid-thoracic.</p> Study design <p>A total of 30 male and female adult rats are randomly assigned to four groups (n = 7): sham group, control group undergoing only laminectomy, injury group with normothermia (37°C), and injury group with hypothermia (32°C +/-0.5°C).</p> Methods <p>The NYU-Impactor is used to induce mid-thoracic (T8) moderate (12.5 mm) midline contusive injury in rats. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) is an objective and non-invasive procedure to assess the functionality of selective neuropathways. SSEP monitoring of baseline, and on days 4 and 7 post-SCI are performed.</p> Results <p>Statistical analysis shows that there are significant differences between the SSEP signal amplitudes recorded when stimulating either forelimb in the group of rats with normothermia compared to the rats treated with 2h of hypothermia on day 4 (left forelimb, <i>p = 0</i>.<i>0417</i> and right forelimb, <i>p = 0</i>.<i>0012</i>) and on day 7 (left forelimb, <i>p = 0</i>.<i>0332</i> and right forelimb, <i>p = 0</i>.<i>0133</i>) post-SCI.</p> Conclusion <p>Our results show that the forelimbs SSEP signals from the two groups of injuries with and without hypothermia have statistically significant differences on days 4 and 7. This indicates the neuroprotective effect of early hypothermia and its influences on stimulating further the neuroplasticity within the upper limbs neural network post-SCI. Timely detection of neuroplasticity and identifying the endogenous and exogenous factors have clinical applications in planning a more effective rehabilitation and functional electrical stimulation (FES) interventions in SCI patients.</p>","author":"Hasan Al-Nashash","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1095a27573349d1a9fa5536edf64dbdc01740ce3156307494548dd7ad2fd19d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
