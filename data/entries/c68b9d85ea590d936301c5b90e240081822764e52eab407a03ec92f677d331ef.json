{"title":"3D‚ÄêTechnologies in Facial Prosthetics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1682/v1","date":1714053589000,"content":"Manufacturing of facial epithesis is a complex technological process including several traditional stages of production, accompanied by aggravated psycho-emotional status of the patient. One of the main factors causing discomfort in patients with facial defects is the process of obtaining silicone impressions from the wound surface and the long waiting period for the final epithesis. Active development of digital technologies in medicine and dentistry helps specialists not only to automate most of the traditional stages of manufacturing of dento-mandibular and facial prostheses, but also improves the quality of life of patients by increasing the efficiency of services and reducing the production time of prosthetic structures. The application of digital technologies in the production of facial epithesis was difficult due to the lack of specialized 3D-software for modeling and material for further additive manufacturing of structures. The authors developed a unique technology for 3D modeling and additive manufacturing of facial epithesis, including a 3D CAD module and material for 3D printing. The primary objective was to fabricate immediate facial prostheses in the postoperative period in the shortest possible time until the final epithesis was fabricated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c68b9d85ea590d936301c5b90e240081822764e52eab407a03ec92f677d331ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
