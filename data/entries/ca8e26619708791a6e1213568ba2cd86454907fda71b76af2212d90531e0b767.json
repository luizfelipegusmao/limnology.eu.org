{"title":"Association of personal and professional factors, resilience and quality of life of registered nurses in a university medical city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310263","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Abdualrahman Saeed Alshehry</p>\r\n\r\nThis study assessed the resilience of nurses in Saudi Arabia during the corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and examined its influence on their quality of life (QOL). A sample of 356 nurses was surveyed in this quantitative, cross-sectional study using the Resilience Scale for Nurses and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) from October 2020 to March 2021. The nurses reported the highest resilience score on “situational pattern”, while the lowest score was on “relational pattern.” The nurses had good perceptions on their overall QOL and health and rated their “social relationship” as having the highest quality, while their “environmental” domain as having the least quality. Gender, marital status, provision of direct nursing care to COVID-19 patients, “philosophical pattern”, “situational pattern” and “dispositional pattern” had multivariate impacts on the QOL dimensions. The study concluded that being resilient can positively impact the nurses’ QOL during stressful situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","author":"Abdualrahman Saeed Alshehry","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ca8e26619708791a6e1213568ba2cd86454907fda71b76af2212d90531e0b767","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
