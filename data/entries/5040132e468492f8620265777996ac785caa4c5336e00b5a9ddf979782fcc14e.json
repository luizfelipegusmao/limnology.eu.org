The goal of this study was to identify the impact of various motivational factors on individual choice of masks or respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey study included a sample of 619 participants between the ages of 18 to 75 years old and English speaking, who were asked about factors that affected their choice of masks or respirators between the months of April 2020 and May 2021. Participants showed a positive association between choice of respirator and being male, perceived comfort and trust in respirators, importance of personalization, and trust in information from family or friends. In addition, positive associations were found between income, education, and the amount of trust in CDC, WHO, and local/state health departments. Results indicate the need for increased education on attributes of each mask or respirator, review of respirator fit, research into specific areas of discomfort, and outreach efforts to vulnerable populations.","author":"Nicole Bertges","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5040132e468492f8620265777996ac785caa4c5336e00b5a9ddf979782fcc14e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
