{"title":"Improved Cell Allocation Strategies Using K-means Clustering in Congested 6TiSCH Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1627/v1","date":1721619160000,"content":"The 6TiSCH protocol (IEEE 802.15.4e) is crucial for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), utilizing a time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode based on node distribution. In our experiment, we explored node position clustering and adjusted the capacity of existing cells in congested areas to understand traffic patterns and optimize cell selection for TSCH resource allocation, particularly in slot frames. Efficient cell allocation prevents packet loss, manages congestion, and enhances data transmission reliability. Node clustering increases cell usage efficiency and reduces communication latency between nodes, with each cell allocation tailored to its traffic needs through the sink node from the clustering result. We evaluated the clustering method using the K-means algorithm through experiments using the 6TiSCH simulator. Additionally, we considered using the routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) as a comparison, such as OF0 and MRHOF, as the objective function to assess clustering results and their impact on throughput and packet delivery. Our method significantly improved average performance metrics: under the OF0 routing protocol, we achieved a 30.01% latency reduction, 15.95% faster joining time, 8% higher packet delivery ratio, and 13.82% throughput increase. Similarly, with the MRHOF routing protocol, we observed a 12.34% improvement in packet delivery ratio, 21.06% latency reduction, 12.68% faster joining time, and 25.97% higher throughput speed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f0126e2b352afa1f8faaa0b023bf92eabd0c09db5130a43107e6c5672024d4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
