{"title":"Twenty years of irrigation acclimation is driven by denser canopies and not by plasticity in twig- and needle-level hydraulics in a Pinus sylvestris forest","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/3141/7611050?rss=1","date":1708387200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Climate change is predicted to increase atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, exacerbating soil drought, and thus enhancing tree evaporative demand and mortality. Yet, few studies have addressed the longer-term drought acclimation strategy of trees, particularly the importance of morphological versus hydraulic plasticity. Using a long-term (20 years) irrigation experiment in a natural forest, we investigated the acclimation of Scots pine (<span>Pinus sylvestris</span>) morpho-anatomical traits (stomatal anatomy and crown density) and hydraulic traits (leaf water potential, vulnerability to cavitation (Ψ<sub>50</sub>), specific hydraulic conductivity (<span>K</span><sub>s</sub>), and tree water deficit) to prolonged changes in soil moisture. We found that low water availability reduced twig water potential and increased tree water deficit during the growing season. Still, the trees showed limited adjustments in most branch-level hydraulic traits (Ψ<sub>50</sub> and <span>K</span><sub>s</sub>) and needle anatomy. In contrast, trees acclimated to prolonged irrigation by increasing their crown density and hence the canopy water demand. This study demonstrates that despite substantial canopy adjustments, <span>P. sylvestris</span> may be vulnerable to extreme droughts because of limited adjustment potential in its hydraulic system. While sparser canopies reduce water demand, such shifts take decades to occur under chronic water deficits and might not mitigate short-term extreme drought events.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"d97e08bda3834570bb005eb9714506cc153d683d4694f5c198c7c8354edea196","category":"Environment"}
