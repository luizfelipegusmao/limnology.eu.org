Throughout the development of liquid phase TEM, accelerated accomplishments in improving the spatial resolution have been achieved, from the initial low magnification (the 1940s) [<a href=\"#ozae044.804-B2\">2</a>] to a few nanometers (âˆ¼5 nm) in 2003 [<a href=\"#ozae044.804-B3\">3</a>], sub-nanometer in 2009 [<a href=\"#ozae044.804-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.804-B5\">5</a>], atomic resolution in 2012 [<a href=\"#ozae044.804-B6\">6-9</a>], and beyond [<a href=\"#ozae044.804-B10\">10</a>] (<strong>Fig. 1a</strong>).
