{"title":"Solving the B-SAT Problem Using Quantum Computing: Smaller Is Sometimes Better","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0452/v1","date":1725532738000,"content":"This paper aims to outline the effectiveness of modern universal gate quantum computers when utilizing different configurations to solve the B-SAT(Boolean Satisfiability) problem. The quantum computing experiments are performed using Groverâ€™s Search algorithm to find a valid solution. The experiments are performed under different variations to demonstrate their effects on the results. Changing the number of shots, qubit mapping, and using a different quantum processor are all among the experimental variables. The study also branches into a dedicated experiment highlighting a peculiar behavior that IBM quantum processors exhibit when running circuits with a certain number of shots.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5a832363c68f862cc44cb3eaf84b749c167de589521717412b74802fb96d747","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
