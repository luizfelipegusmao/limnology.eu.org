{"title":"Symmetry between Series if Entangled by Sums","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2107/v1","date":1724913116000,"content":"In analogy with entanglement in physics, the concept of entanglement has been developed in mathematics as a symmetry to build upon as a tool to study 'proximity' relations between different number sequences and series in a unifying way. Examples of entanglement are shown. A general algorithm for detecting entangled sequences/series is given in the appendix. The novelty of this paper is to propose the concept of entanglement as a tool to study different sequences and se-ries-series phenomena. To enable useful treatment suggested by Poincar√©.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4725594b7e0e0a82aa717313fbff747856f02f3fda255d983a44434beeeb5723","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
