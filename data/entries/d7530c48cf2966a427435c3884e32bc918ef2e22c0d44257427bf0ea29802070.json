{"title":"Antidiabetic Effect of Raru (Vatica perakensis) Bark Extract and Mocaf Activated Carbon in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1660/v1","date":1714033049000,"content":"Raru’s plants bark has long been used as traditional medicine in Batak’s tribe. Raru’s bark is derived from several trees that are usually used in a mixture in Batak traditional beverages. This bark is generally used as antidiabetic remedies. This study aims to combine the rarus’s bark extract and mocaf activated-carbon (MAC) in order to study antidiabetics in rats. The combination of raru’s bark extract and MAC were tested on male rats as of Sprague Dawley strain for testing antidiabetic bioactivity. The result showed that antidiabetic activity of raru’s extract and MAC exposed the antidiabetic level declines in rat’s blood. The various treatments of different concentration ratios of raru’s extract and MAC useful in the experiments showed that the levels of blood level reduction were slightly different (14-21%). The raru’s extract pure was observed more effective in decreasing the blood glucose level in rat’s blood, in comparison the positive control. The mixture of raru’s extract and MAC with 75:25 ratio is better than 50:50 ratio. The involvement of MAC in the alleged antidiabetic agent did little in improving the blood glucose level decrease in rat’s blood. Raru’s extract and MAC indicate its potential utilization as an antidiabetic agent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7530c48cf2966a427435c3884e32bc918ef2e22c0d44257427bf0ea29802070","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
