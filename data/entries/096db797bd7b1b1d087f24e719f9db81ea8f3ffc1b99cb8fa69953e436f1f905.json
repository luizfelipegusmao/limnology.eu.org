{"title":"Wettability Characteristics for Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films Doped with Glycerol","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1636/v1","date":1716542710000,"content":"This paper addresses the capability to alter the wettability characteristics of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) polymer films doped with glycerol. Films of PVA and glycerol-choline chloride (GCC) blends have been prepared by solution casting method with different glycerol dopants ranging from 0% to 10% (wt %). The results show that as the dopant content increases from 0% to 10%, the wettability increases and hence increases the surface energy of the solid film. The wettability changes are observed by identifying the contact angle of 10 ÂµL deionized water droplet which altered from 55o to 28o as dopant content changed from 0% to 10% per PVA solution weight. The results show that the roughness of film surfaces increases as the content of dopant (GCC) increases in the film which indicates that roughness has a strong influence on the wettability of the casted films.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"096db797bd7b1b1d087f24e719f9db81ea8f3ffc1b99cb8fa69953e436f1f905","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
