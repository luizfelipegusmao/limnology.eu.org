{"title":"Exploring Intrinsic Disorder in Human Synucleins and Associated Proteins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1628/v1","date":1713965756000,"content":"In this work, we explore the intrinsic disorder status of the three members of the synuclein family of proteins - α-, β-, and γ-synucleins. We also analyzed the peculiarities of the amino acid sequences and modeled 3D structures of the human synuclein family members to find potential effects of pathological mutations. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative sequence-based analysis of the synuclein proteins from various evolutionary distant species and evaluated their levels of intrinsic disorder using a set of commonly used bioinformatics tools. Next, we conducted a detailed functional disorder analysis of the proteins in the interactomes of the human synuclein family members using various web-based disorder analysis and prediction tools, such as RIDAO, D2P2 and FuzDrop. We identify that the interactome of human α-synuclein has relatively higher levels of intrinsic disorder, as compared to the interactomes of human β- and γ- synucleins. These observations highlight the critical importance of intrinsic disorder of human α-synuclein and its interactors in neuronal processes as compared to other proteins of the synuclein family.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e9e1283d6193e88e295ca034965732b845299856e069c50393cfd87cd35cced","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
