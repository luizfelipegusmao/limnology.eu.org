{"title":"Rotation Matrix of a Charged Symmetrical Body: One-Parameter Family of Solutions in Elementary Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1313/v1","date":1711418540000,"content":"Euler-Poisson equations of a charged symmetrical body in external constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields are  deduced starting from the variational problem, where the body is considered as a system of charged point particles subject to holonomic constraints. The final equations are written for the  center-of mass-coordinate, rotation matrix and angular velocity.  General solution to the equations of motion is obtained for the case of a charged ball. For the case of a symmetrical charged body (solenoid), the task of obtaining the general solution is reduced to the problem of a one-dimensional cubic pseudo-oscillator. Besides, we present a one-parametric family of solutions to the problem in elementary functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"facc398f73897ac363ffdc2c8650e3a587a8bab87c767e7e687e3ff9fa636f3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
