Using sandpapers of different grit sizes, we characterize how moth flies (<i>Clogmia albipunctata</i>) adjust their stepping kinematics and coordination patterns in order to deal with substrates of varying levels of roughness.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The moth fly, <i>Clogmia albipunctata</i>, is a common synanthropic insect with a worldwide range that lives in nearly any area with moist, decaying organic matter. These habitats comprise both smooth, slippery substrates (e.g., bathroom drains) and heterogeneous, bumpy ground (e.g., soil in plant pots). By using terrain of varying levels of roughness, we focus specifically on how substrate roughness at the approximate size scale of the organism affects kinematics and coordination in adult moth flies. Finally, we compare and contrast our characterizations of locomotion in <i>C. albipunctata</i> with previous work of insect walking in naturalistic environments.</p>","author":"Erin E.
