{"title":"Characterization of the Arabidopsis Mutant oligocellula6-D Reveals the Importance of Leaf Initiation in Determining the Final Leaf Size","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/8/1310/7693900?rss=1","date":1718409600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The leaf is a determinate organ with a final size under genetic control. Numerous factors that regulate the final leaf size have been identified in <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>; although most of these factors play their roles during the growth of leaf primordia, much less is known about leaf initiation and its effects on the final leaf size. In this study, we characterized <span>oligocellula6-D</span> (<span>oli6-D</span>), a semidominant mutant of <span>A. thaliana</span> with smaller leaves than the wild type (WT) due to its reduced leaf cell numbers. A time-course analysis showed that <span>oli6-D</span> had approximately 50% fewer leaf cells even immediately after leaf initiation; this difference was maintained throughout leaf development. Next-generation sequencing showed that <span>oli6-D</span> had chromosomal duplications involving 2-kb and 3-Mb regions of chromosomes 2 and 4, respectively. Several duplicated genes examined had approximately 2-fold higher expression levels, and at least one gene acquired a new intron/exon structure due to a chromosome fusion event. <span>oli6-D</span> showed reduced auxin responses in leaf primordia, primary roots and embryos, as well as reduced apical dominance and partial auxin-resistant root growth. CRISPR-associated protein-9-mediated genome editing enabled the removal of a 3-Mb duplicated segment, the largest targeted deletion in plants thus far. As a result, <span>oli6-D</span> restored the WT leaf phenotypes, demonstrating that <span>oli6-D</span> is a gain-of-function mutant. Our results suggest a new regulatory point of leaf size determination that functions at a very early stage of leaf development and is negatively regulated by one or more genes located in the duplicated chromosomal segments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"39d4e0fa4aad6add7cdfc0e3fdd5d45d716f2bf18ee192098724184b92c6d516","category":"Environment"}
