{"title":"Space-Time Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Relationship with Socioeconomic and Demographic Variables in the Metropolitan Region of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1082/v1","date":1723776101000,"content":"Geographic Information Systems (GIS) played an important role in understanding the dynamics of the territorial spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic. Even today, it is important to understand such dynamics in view of the imminent risk of new epidemics and pandemics. This study aimed  to identify space-time clusters of incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 during the pandemic, analyzing socioeconomic and demographic characteristics in order to highlight the priority areas for control and surveillance actions. This study was conducted in the Metropolitan Region of São  Paulo (MRSP) from March 2020 to February 2022. To detect the clusters, a multidimensional punctual process was created to perform multiple tests  for every geographic point using the SaTScan™ software. Socioeconomic and demographic differences were analyzed using nonparametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. High-risk clusters of incidences were observed in May 2020 (RR=2; p-value &lt;0.001) and March to June 2021 (RR=2.6; p-value &lt;0.001) in the capital of São Paulo and neighboring municipalities, with statistically significant differences between the socioeconomic variables analyzed. No low-risk cluster of COVID-19 incidence was found, but low-risk clusters of mortality from COVID-19 were found in the period from July to December 2020 in the central region of the capital  (RR=0.33; p-value &lt;0.001), which concentrates the highest incomes and the lowest percentages of Black, Brown (Mixed-race), and Indigenous people in the MRSP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e18ce3367785f0e0b67d1ee0ab84da547b64dbd2ca711a8d11c165b0703190c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
