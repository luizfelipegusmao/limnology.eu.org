{"title":"Sourdough Bread and Metabolic Risk Factors. A Randomized, Controlled Trial in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1195/v1","date":1718691541000,"content":"Mediterranean diet, featuring sourdough bread, shows promise in managing metabolic syndrome. This study explored the effects of two sourdough breads with differing fermentation times but similar nutritional profiles on inflammation, satiety, and gut microbiota composition in adults with metabolic syndrome. The double-blind clinical trial randomized participants to consume over two-months Elias Boulanger® long fermentation (48h) sourdough bread (EBLong) or Elias Boulanger® short fermentation (2h) sourdough bread (EBShort). We assessed clinical parameters, inflammatory- and satiety-related biomarkers; and richness and abundance of gut microbiota at baseline and follow-up. 31 individuals (mean age: 67, 55.7% female) participated. EBShort was associated with reduced soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM) levels, and irrespective of the adjudicated intervention, all participants had a decrease in sICAM and diastolic pressure relative to baseline (p&amp;lt;0.017). At follow-up, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels were lower in EBShort (-744 pg/mL; 95%CI: -282 to -1210 pg/mL) compared to EBLong. High-quality sourdough bread may offer mild benefits in blood pressure and inflammation for those with metabolic syndrome, however, only EBLong was associated to reduced Enterobacteriaceae abundance. Further research is needed to understand potential benefits and mechanisms of sourdough bread in managing metabolic syndrome and improving cardiovascular health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18361373edb5346fca78a945401c869ae1ed5c6edce38668719b9f21b16b6aa8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
