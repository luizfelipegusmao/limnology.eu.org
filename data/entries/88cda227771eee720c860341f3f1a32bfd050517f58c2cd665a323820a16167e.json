{"title":"Daphnia magna digestive activity is differentially altered when exposed to equally turbid waters caused by either suspended sediment or suspended microplastics","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24096?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Turbidity can be a result of suspended natural particles, such as sediment, or anthropogenic particles such as microplastics. This study assessed whether <i>Daphnia magna</i>, a pelagic filter feeder known to ingest suspended particles, have an altered response to equally turbid environments caused by the presence of either suspended bentonite or suspended polyethylene microplastics. Compared to controls, daphnids exposed to suspended bentonite maintained their feeding efficiency and increased their digestive activity, as measured by mandibular movement, peristalsis, and expulsion, to pass bentonite through the digestive tract. The same effects were not seen in microplastic-exposed individuals, in which feeding efficiency was decreased and only peristaltic movement was increased but without a coordinated increase in expulsion, suggesting that microplastics do not have the same ability as bentonite to pass through the digestive tract. This study highlights the need to discern the identities of particulates contributing to turbid environments as different particles, even of the same size, can have different effects on filter feeders, which inherently ingest suspended particles.</p>","author":"Lauren Zink, \nMikaila Meslo, \nSteve Wiseman, \nGregory G.
