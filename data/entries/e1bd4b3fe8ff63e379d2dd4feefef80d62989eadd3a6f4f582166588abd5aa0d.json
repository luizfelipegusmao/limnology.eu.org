{"title":"Insights into Signal Behaviour: Dirichlet Problem and Hyperbolic Series Perspective with Fuzzy Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1607/v1","date":1724307946000,"content":"Signal approximation, is the basic idea of signal processing and mathematical analysis where complex signals can be represented with simpler ones. This paper explores unifying two mathematical fundamentals, Dirichlet-type problems, and hyperbolic series identities, into signal approximation. In this paper, we address a well-known classic topic in mathematical analysis - the Dirichlet problem - to improve (the approximation of) signal using Fourier series. We also discuss using hyperbolic series representations to increase signal modeling flexibility. In this way, we hope to create new links that span some distance along this dimension and result in a somewhat theoretical view of signal behavior - present with the mathematical rigor needed for speculation but absent from an understanding capable of appropriately handling real-world complexity. This paper provides a theoretical investigation of the mechanics at play and reveals by analogy how these mathematical tools can potentially advance signal processing techniques and understanding. This paper illustrates Fourier series and fuzzy logic methods by two case studies on signal processing, satellite communication and financial risk measurement. The first case study performs signal approximation using the Fourier series and hyperbolic function identities to provide insight into how signals behave and are modeled. The second case study deals with applying fuzzy logic for risk evaluation of investment portfolios, emphasizing the utility in evasion systems solving uncertainty and imprecision problems related to financial decisions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1bd4b3fe8ff63e379d2dd4feefef80d62989eadd3a6f4f582166588abd5aa0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
