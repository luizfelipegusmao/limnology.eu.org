{"title":"Impact of Temperature on Podding in Faba Bean (Vicia faba)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0014/v1","date":1725276066000,"content":"Faba bean is grown globally for human consumption and animal feed and is a significant rotation crop in cereal dominant areas in many countries including Australia. It is sensitive to several abiotic stresses, such as drought, frost and high temperatures, especially at the reproductive stage.  However, little is known of the upper and lower temperature limits for successful podding. Experiments were conducted over two years at Breeza and Narrabri in north-western New South Wales to assess the impact of temperature on flowering and pod set of three genotypes; Doza, Cairo and IX1148f under field conditions. Flowering nodes were tagged from designated plants in the field and scored for podding, field temperatures were recorded. Optimum maximum temperature for podset ranged from 23.7-26.1 °C and the equivalent minimum temperature was 3.2-3.8 °C. Optimum average daily temperature for podset ranged from 12.7-13.9 °C. The strongest correlations between temperature and podding were observed at minimum temperatures, indicating that low temperatures are more important than high temperatures in determining yield in faba bean.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"820ad10ef01b40313a7df35a4afec94f03261137d960e48630e37c96cd392e33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
