{"title":"Developments in the Use of Indocyanine Green (ICG) Fluorescence in Colorectal Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0224/v1","date":1717573032000,"content":"Indocyanine Green (ICG) has significantly advanced minimally invasive surgery. It is widely recognized for its ability to visualize blood vessel patency in real-time across various surgical specialties. While its primary use in colorectal surgery is to evaluate anastomoses for leaks, nu-merous other applications have been documented in the literature.\n\nIn this review, we aim to explore both established and emerging applications of ICG fluorescence in colorectal surgery, with the goal of improving patient outcomes. This includes preoperative tumor marking and the detection of metastatic disease. Some applications, such as lymphatic mapping, require further research to determine their impact on clinical practices. Conversely, oth-ers, like the intraoperative localizations of ureters, necessitate additional procedures and are not yet widely accepted by the surgical community. However, the development of alternative com-pounds could offer better solutions. Future research should focus on areas like quantitative ICG and protocol standardization in prospective multicenter studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad4ad85e9d0382f4d0627648121419727d3a37b9182cd32136427b2cffb7d3b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
