{"title":"Non-Invasive Gamma Brain Wave Optimization for Cognitive and Emotional Recovery in an Adolescent: A Case Study on REAC NPPO BWO-G Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0836/v1","date":1728627289000,"content":"This case report describes the application of the REAC (Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer) Gamma Brain Wave Optimization (BWO-G) treatment in a 16-year-old female with a history of emotional trauma, depressive symptoms, and gender dysphoria. The patient underwent 18 sessions of REAC NPPO BWO-G, with quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) conducted pre- and post-treatment. Initial QEEG analyses indicated altered brainwave activity, with peaks in alpha rhythm frequencies in occipital and right posterior temporal areas. Following treatment, significant improvements were observed, including a reduction in delta and theta rhythms and increased alpha and gamma rhythms, corresponding to enhanced cognitive clarity and emotional regulation. Clinically, the patient experienced reduced anxiety, improved mood, heightened social engagement, better auditory tolerance, and resumed weight management. These findings suggest that the REAC NPPO BWO-G treatment may be an effective, non-invasive approach to enhancing cognitive and neuropsychological resilience in individuals with complex psychosocial challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82143ba4351d7caf5856334d4acb7622a0fc61e3c1a32e727f745229aea1c530","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
