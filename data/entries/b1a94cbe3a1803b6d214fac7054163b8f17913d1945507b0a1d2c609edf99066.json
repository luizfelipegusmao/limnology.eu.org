{"title":"What&rsquo;s So Great About Inpatient Rehabilitation From the Patient Experience Perspective: Content Analysis of an Appreciative Inquiry During a Bedside Experience Rounding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2055/v1","date":1719905499000,"content":"Background: Positive person-centered attributes of inpatient rehabilitation need to be identified from the patient perspective to be further developed and sustained.\nPurpose: To identify which attributes patients openly evoke as being great care experiences, using an open appreciative inquiry during the inpatient rehabilitation stay. \nMethods: Qualitative secondary analysis of appreciative patient comments during a bedside patient experience rounding, facilitated by a neutral party. Two independent analysts employed an inductive, summative form of content analysis.\nResults: Among 150 patients rounded, 122 provided categorizable appreciative accounts. Over two thirds of the patients (67.2%) focused on “staff attributes” in their great-experience accounts. Those attributes were mostly interpersonal such as being “attentive &amp; caring - beyond clinical duty” and being “encouraging (but not too hard) &amp; reassuring”. These interpersonal staff attributes were reported with words showing deep levels of personal significance or patient appreciation. Beyond staff attributes, the perceived quality of the “patient care” (31.1%) and opportunities for “leisure and social activities” (9.0%) were also frequently evoked. Amenities like food or costumer service were the least evoked, rarely so as an exclusive attribute (0.8% for each).   \nConclusions: The human(e) factor, especially the interpersonal qualities of staff, emerged as greatly appreciated from the patient experience perspective during inpatient rehabilitation. These experiences help identify which person-centered attributes of care might be further developed and sustained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1a94cbe3a1803b6d214fac7054163b8f17913d1945507b0a1d2c609edf99066","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
