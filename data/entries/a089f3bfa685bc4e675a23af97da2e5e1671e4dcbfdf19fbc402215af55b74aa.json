{"title":"Disease-associated microbiome signature species in the gut","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae352/7737795?rss=1","date":1724198400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>There is an accumulation of evidence that the human gut microbiota plays a role in maintaining health, and that an altered gut microbiota (sometimes called <span>dysbiosis</span>) associates with risk for many noncommunicable diseases. However, the dynamics of disease-linked bacteria in the gut and other body sites remain unclear. If microbiome alterations prove causative in particular diseases, therapeutic intervention may be possible. Furthermore, microbial signature taxa have been established for the diagnosis of some diseases like colon cancer. We identified 163 disease-enriched and 98 disease-depleted gut microbiome signature taxa at species-level resolution (signature species) from 10 meta-analyses of multiple diseases such as colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic cancer, and COVID-19 infection. Eight signature species were enriched and nine were depleted across at least half of the diseases studied. Compared with signature species depleted in diseases, a significantly higher proportion of disease-enriched signature species were identified as extra-intestinal (primarily oral) inhabitants, had been reported in bacteremia cases from the literature, and were aerotolerant anaerobes. These findings highlight the potential involvement of oral microbes, bacteremia isolates, and aerotolerant anaerobes in disease-associated gut microbiome alterations, and they have implications for patient care and disease management.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"a089f3bfa685bc4e675a23af97da2e5e1671e4dcbfdf19fbc402215af55b74aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
