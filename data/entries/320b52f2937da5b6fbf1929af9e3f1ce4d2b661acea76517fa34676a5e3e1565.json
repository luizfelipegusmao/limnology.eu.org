{"title":"Bioassays with Allium cepa for the Monitoring of Toxicity in the Groundwater of Yucatan, Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0818/v1","date":1725973882000,"content":"This study employed the Allium cepa bioassay to evaluate the toxic effects of contaminants in the Yucatan aquifer. Seven monitoring wells were studied during September and October 2021. Nutrient concentrations showed significant variation between sites, with samples closer to the coast (P3 and P7) presenting higher ammonia and phosphate concentrations. The pesticides found at the highest concentration were Î´-HCH and chlorpyrifos, with 141.44 and 175.92 ng/L, respectively. Heptachlor and aldrin were present in sites P4oct and P2sept. Interestingly, DDT values were highly correlated with caffeine concentrations. Acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and the sum of B(k)fluoranthene and B(b)fluoranthene presented the highest prevalence. B(k)fluoranthene and B(b)fluoranthene were the PAHs found at the highest concentration. The results of the A. cepa bioassay indicated no nuclear abnormalities. The study also found no statistical differences in the mitotic index, root length, biomarkers of oxidative stress, and inhibition of B-esterases between sites and controls. In summary, the wells sampled in the present study had low concentrations of contaminants that can be used as a proxy of anthropogenic discharges; the lack of effect in the biomarkers used at organism, cellular, and biochemical levels indicated no toxic effect on A. cepa roots.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"320b52f2937da5b6fbf1929af9e3f1ce4d2b661acea76517fa34676a5e3e1565","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
