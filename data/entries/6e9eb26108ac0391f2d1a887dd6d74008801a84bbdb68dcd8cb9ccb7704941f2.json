{"title":"Graph Neural Network for Daily Supply Chain Problems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2376/v1","date":1727669277000,"content":"In this paper, we explore the theoretical foundation of Graph Neural Network (GNN) model and apply it to various traditional supply chain logistics problem.  In particular, we study the Route Optimization Problem, Demand Forecasting Problem, Risk Assessment and Anomaly Detection, Supplier Section and Procurement Optimization, Inventory Optimization Problem, and Green Supply Chain Problem. The study helps us the expand the use the GNN and gives daily supply chain management a boost.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e9eb26108ac0391f2d1a887dd6d74008801a84bbdb68dcd8cb9ccb7704941f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
