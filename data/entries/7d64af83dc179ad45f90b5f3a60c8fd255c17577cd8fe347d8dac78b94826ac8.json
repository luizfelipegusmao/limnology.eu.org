Among various engines, diesel engines are heavily reliant on fluid motion within the engine cylinder, which plays a critical role in fuel-air mixing. This abstract focuses on the potential of dynamic mathematical model simulation for multi-compartment rotor compressed combustion engines, aiming to revolutionize power generation by enhancing fuel burning efficiency. By leveraging advanced simulation techniques, this research seeks to unlock new insights into fluid dynamics and optimize fuel-air mixing, leading to more efficient and sustainable energy utilization. Through this exploration, we aim to pave the way for groundbreaking advancements in the field of combustion engines, ultimately contributing to a greener and more sustainable future. In the realm of internal combustion engines, the fluid dynamics within the engine cylinder greatly influence the combustion processes and heat transfer. For compression ignition (C.I) engines, both the bulk gas motion and turbulence characteristics play vital roles in engine performance. This study focuses on enhancing the combustibility of the fuel-air mixture in C.I engines by modifying the engine design to induce turbulence through squish and tumble flows. The modification involves creating multiple compartments on the rotor crown, comprising three small chambers spaced 120ยบ apart. By implementing this design, the aim is to optimize the fuel-air mixing and improve the overall combustion efficiency. Through comprehensive analysis and experimentation, we seek to revolutionize C.I engine technology and pave the way for more efficient and environmentally-friendly power generation. In this study, the performance of a compression ignition (C.I) engine with a multiple compartment rotor has been analyzed under motoring conditions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with FLUENT software. The obtained results have been compared with those of a base C.I engine. The analysis focused on the effects of the modified engine design on the tumble ratio and squish velocity, which are important parameters for fuel-air mixing and combustion efficiency. The results indicated a significant improvement with the modified engine, with a 35% increase in tumble ratio and a 31% increase in squish velocity compared to the base engine. These findings suggest that the modified engine design has the potential to enhance fuel-air mixing and combustion performance, leading to improved overall engine efficiency. This research presents promising insights into the optimization of C.I engine design and contributes to the development of more efficient and environmentally-friendly power generation technologies..","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d64af83dc179ad45f90b5f3a60c8fd255c17577cd8fe347d8dac78b94826ac8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
