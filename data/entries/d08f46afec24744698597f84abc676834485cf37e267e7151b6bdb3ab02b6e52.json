{"title":"Advanced Glycation End Products and Its Receptor in Obesity: A Review of New and Old Molecules and Their Effect on Metabolic Parameters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2277/v1","date":1725121153000,"content":"Obesity is one of the most prevalent and damaging metabolic conditions and is a risk factor for the development of other disorders that define the metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have identified a significant role of AGE accumulation and RAGE signaling pathways in the underlying mechanisms that cause the chronic inflammatory response present in obesity which, ultimately, leads to adipose tissue dysfunction. Given the current interest and increasing evidence on possible therapeutic opportunities in the AGE-RAGE axis, the purpose of this work is to review the key findings on new small molecules and bioactive compounds that act as AGE or RAGE inhibitors and their effects on metabolic parameters of people with obesity. The search queries were defined according to the following PICO question: “What are the effects of AGE-RAGE antagonism on adipose tissue metabolism and other metabolic parameters of people with obesity? “. Article search was performed in three online databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. In the end, 20 studies were selected for this review. Overall, the reviewed molecules showed beneficial effects on body weight, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, inflammatory profile, and adipose tissue metabolism in mice models with obesity. There are still very few studies on human application of these molecules, but the ones that were reviewed revealed controversial data when compared to animal studies. Therefore, further human clinical trials should be performed to retrieve more conclusive data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d08f46afec24744698597f84abc676834485cf37e267e7151b6bdb3ab02b6e52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
