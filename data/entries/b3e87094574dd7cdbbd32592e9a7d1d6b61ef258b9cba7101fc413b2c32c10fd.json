A systematic review of the literature","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae062/7651361?rss=1","date":1713484800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Selenium is an important and essential trace element in organisms, but its effects on organisms are also a “double-edged sword”. Selenium deficiency or excess can endanger the health of humans and animals. In order to thoroughly understand the nutritional value and toxicity hazards of selenium, researchers have conducted many studies on the model animal zebrafish. However, there is a lack of induction and summary of relevant research on which selenium acts on zebrafish. This paper provides a review of the reported studies. Firstly, this article summarizes the benefits of selenium on zebrafish from three aspects: Promoting growth, Enhancing immune function and anti-tumor ability, Antagonizing some pollutants, such as mercury. Then, three aspects of selenium toxicity to zebrafish are introduced: nervous system and behavior, reproductive system and growth, and damage to some organs. This article also describes how different forms of selenium compounds have different effects on zebrafish health. Finally, prospects for future research directions are presented.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"b3e87094574dd7cdbbd32592e9a7d1d6b61ef258b9cba7101fc413b2c32c10fd","category":"Environment"}
