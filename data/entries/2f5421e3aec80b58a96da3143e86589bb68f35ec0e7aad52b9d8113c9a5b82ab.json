{"title":"The Effect of an Anisotropic Scattering Rate on the Magnetoresistance of a Metal: A Cuprate-Inspired Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0135/v1","date":1727860110000,"content":"Inspired by the phenomenology of high-critical-temperature superconducting cuprates, we investigate the effect of an anisotropic scattering rate on the magnetoresistance of a metal, relying on Chambersâ€™ solution to the Boltzmann equation. We find that if the scattering rate is enhanced near points of the Fermi surface with a locally higher density of states, an extended regime is found magnetoresistance that varies linearly with the magnetic field. We then apply our results to fit the experimental magnetoresistence of La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 and speculate about the possible source of anisotropic scattering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f5421e3aec80b58a96da3143e86589bb68f35ec0e7aad52b9d8113c9a5b82ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
