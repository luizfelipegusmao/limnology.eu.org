{"title":"The relationship between complete blood cell count-derived inflammatory biomarkers and benign prostatic hyperplasia in middle-aged and elderly individuals in the United States: Evidence from NHANES 2001–2008","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306860","date":1720533600000,"content":"<p>by Chengdong Shi, Hongliang Cao, Guoqiang Zeng, Lei Yang, Yuantao Wang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common health disorder of the male genitourinary system with a high prevalence, especially among middle-aged and older adults, which seriously affects men’s quality of life. Inflammatory markers derived from complete blood cell count (CBC) have previously been considered a prognostic indicator for various diseases, but little is known about their relationship with BPH. This study evaluated the relationship between complete blood cell count (CBC)-derived inflammatory biomarkers and BPH.</p> Methods <p>Data for this cross-sectional study were gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2001 and 2008. Using multiple logistic regressions, the study examined the association between benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH) and Inflammatory biomarkers derived from blood cell counts such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI) and Systemic Immunoinflammatory Index (SII).</p> Results <p>3,919 participants were included, with a median age of 61.00 (52.00–71.00) years old. Among them, 609 participants had benign prostatic hyperplasia, with a prevalence of 15.54%. Upon accounting for confounding factors, the study revealed a positive correlation between the plurality of BPH PLR and SII. However, MLR, NLR, and SIRI did not significantly correlate with the prevalence of BPH (p&gt;0.05). In contrast to the lowest quartile, higher quartiles of PLR (OR = 1.93[1.38–2.69]) and SII (OR = 1.71[1.22–2.40]) were linked to an elevated risk of BPH. Interaction tests showed that age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and drinking had no significant effect on this positive correlation (p for interaction&gt;0.05). In addition, we found a roughly linear association between SII, PLR, and BPH using smoothed curve fitting.</p> Conclusions <p>According to our research, high levels of PLR and SII are positively linked with an increased risk of BPH in middle-aged and elderly individuals in the United States. The results compensate for previous studies that still need to be validated with larger prospective cohorts.</p>","author":"Chengdong Shi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1259a98ce709adbc00e5888c20910051f8fb6e7e5c7bc03a0894eeaa666730e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
