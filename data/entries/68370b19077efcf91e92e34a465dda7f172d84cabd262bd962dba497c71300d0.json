{"title":"Fermented By-Products of Banana Wine Production Improved Slaughter Performance, Meat Quality of Broiler Chicken, and Flavor Fingerprint of Chicken Chest Meats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1740/v1","date":1727088734000,"content":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of incorporating fermented feed into the daily diet on the slaughter performance, meat quality, and flavor compounds of cage-raised chicken. The control group (CK) of the Guangxi Partridge chicken was provided a standard base diet (CK), which was supplemented with 10% fermented banana peel (Pe-10), 20% fermented banana peel (Pe-20), 10% fermented banana pulp residue (Pu-10) and 20% fermented banana pulp residue (Pu-20). The slaughter performance, meat quality, and flavor compounds in the meat samples of the chicken in these groups were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the chicken in Pe-10, Pe-20, Pu-10, and Pu-20 had pectoral muscle percentages, thigh muscle percentages, and total fatty acid content of the chest meat in the Pe-10, Pe-20, Pu-10, and Pu-20 groups were higher than that observed in the CK group. The moisture content, meat color, carcass weight, total net weight, and abdominal fat percentage of the meat samples in these experimental groups exhibited no notable differences. The flavor compounds in the meat samples of the chicken fed with the two concentrations of fermented banana peel and banana pulp residue exhibited notable differences from those in the control group. An increase in the quantity of fermented banana peel incorporated into the daily diet from 10% to 20% resulted in a notable alteration in the flavor profile of the chest meat samples. In conclusion, the inclusion of varying proportions of fermented banana peels and dregs in the diet has been demonstrated to enhance both the slaughter performance and the quality of the chicken, while also influencing the flavor profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68370b19077efcf91e92e34a465dda7f172d84cabd262bd962dba497c71300d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
