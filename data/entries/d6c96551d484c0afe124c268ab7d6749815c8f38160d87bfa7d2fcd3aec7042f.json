{"title":"Modelling Living Processes with Nonlinear Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0149/v1","date":1725444088000,"content":"Living processes are integral to open systems for multiple reasons. From a thermodynamic perspective, they reduce local entropy at the cost of increasing environmental entropy. Furthermore, these processes are inherently nonlinear owing to their feedback interactions with the environment. Nonlinear systems exhibit diverse behaviours: some stabilize at a constant value, whereas others display bifurcations and chaotic dynamics. This study introduces a model that describes living processes as the dynamics of nonlinear single-value diverging maps, whereas chaotic evolution is associated with the increasing entropy environment. This model enables us to describe the lifetime of different species simply by varying the model parameters. This model also simplifies explaining the transition from life to death.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6c96551d484c0afe124c268ab7d6749815c8f38160d87bfa7d2fcd3aec7042f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
