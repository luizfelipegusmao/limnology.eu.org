{"title":"Primary production of the kelp Lessonia corrugata varies with season and water motion: Implications for coastal carbon cycling","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13408?af=R","date":1708105134000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Kelp forests provide vital ecosystem services such as carbon storage and cycling, and understanding primary production dynamics regarding seasonal and spatial variations is essential. We conducted surveys at three sites in southeast Tasmania, Australia, that had different levels of water motion, across four seasons to determine seasonal primary production and carbon storage as living biomass for kelp beds of <i>Lessonia corrugata</i> (Order Laminariales). We quantified blade growth, erosion rates, and the variation in population density and estimated both the net biomass accumulation (NBA) per square meter and the carbon standing stock. We observed a significant difference in blade growth and erosion rates between seasons and sites. Spring had the highest growth rate (0.02 g C · blade<sup>−1</sup> · d<sup>−1</sup>) and NBA (1.62 g C · m<sup>−2</sup> · d<sup>−1</sup>), while summer had the highest blade erosion (0.01 g C · blade<sup>−1</sup> · d<sup>−1</sup>), with a negative NBA (−1.18 g C · m<sup>−2</sup> · d<sup>−1</sup>). Sites exhibiting lower blade erosion rates demonstrated notably greater NBA than sites with elevated erosion rates. The sites with the highest water motion had the slowest erosion rates. Moreover, the most wave-exposed site had the densest populations, resulting in the highest NBA and a greater standing stock. Our results reveal a strong seasonal and water motion influence on carbon dynamics in <i>L. corrugata</i> populations. This knowledge is important for understanding the dynamics of the carbon cycle in coastal regions.</p>","author":"Allyson E. Nardelli, \nWouter Visch, \nGlenn Farrington, \nJ.
