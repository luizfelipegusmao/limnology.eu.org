{"title":"Market‐incentivized environmental regulation policy and company green transformation: An analytical perspective based on the cost transfer capability of companies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12554?af=R","date":1724070231000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Based on the carbon emissions trading pilot policy in China, this paper takes Chinese A-share listed companies from 2012 to 2020 as a sample, and analyzes the role of company's cost transfer capability (ECTC) in the mechanism of market-incentivized environmental regulation policy (MERP) influencing company green transformation. This paper finds the following four primary results. First, ECTC significantly strengthens the green transformation driving effect of MERP in general. However, results based on the division of ECTC by percentiles show that MERP-induced green transformation is more pronounced in the top 25% of companies, which distinguishes them from companies in the top 25%–50%, whose cost transfer capacity hampers MERP's contribution to the green transformation. Second, the level of regional economic development, emission regulation, and business reputation have heterogeneous influences on the moderating effect of ECTC. Third, the results based on the moderated mediation model show that ECTC can influence the green transition driving effect of MERP by moderating the two paths of risk-taking ability and financing constraints of companies. Finally, there is a diffusion effect on the green transformation driven by MERP through cost transfer among companies in non-pilot industries and non-pilot regions.</p>","author":"Jiahe Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"400422995363d91f7eb22c7965fc7cc74eb854d3a1dae236705eb05ec794e5de","category":"Environment"}
