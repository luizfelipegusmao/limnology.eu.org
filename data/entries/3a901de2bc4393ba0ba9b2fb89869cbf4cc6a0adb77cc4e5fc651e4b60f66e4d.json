{"title":"Polychlorinated biphenyls exposure and type 2 diabetes: Molecular mechanism that causes insulin resistance and islet damage","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24094?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical persistent organic pollutants that have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in cohort studies. This review aims to comprehensively assess the molecular mechanisms of PCBs-induced T2DM. Recent progress has been made in the research of PCBs in liver tissue, adipose tissue, and other tissues. By influencing the function of nuclear receptors, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnancy X receptor (PXR), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), as well as the inflammatory response, PCBs disrupt the balance of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. This is associated with insulin resistance (IR) in the target organ of insulin. Through androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor α/β (ERα/β), and pancreato-duodenal-homeobox gene-1 (PDX-1), PCBs affect the secretion of insulin and increase blood glucose. Thus, this review is a discussion on the relationship between PCBs exposure and the pathogenesis of T2DM. It is hoped to provide basic concepts for diabetes research and disease treatment.</p>","author":"Qiuli Shan, \nJingyu Liu, \nFan Qu, \nAnhui Chen, \nWenxing He","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"3a901de2bc4393ba0ba9b2fb89869cbf4cc6a0adb77cc4e5fc651e4b60f66e4d","category":"Environment"}
