{"title":"Microfluidics and Nanofluidics in Strong Light–Matter Coupling Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0917/v1","date":1723547997000,"content":"The combination of micro- or nanofluidics and strong light–matter coupling has gained much interest in the past decade, which has led to the development of advanced systems and devices with numerous potential applications in different fields, such as chemistry, biosensing, and material science. Strong light–matter coupling is achieved by placing a dipole (e.g. an atom or a molecule) into a confined electromagnetic field, with molecular transitions being in resonance with the field and the coupling strength exceeding the average dissipation rate. Despite intense research and encouraging results in this field, some challenges still need to be overcome, related to the fabrication of nano- and microscale optical cavities, stability, scaling up and production, sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and real-time control and monitoring. The goal of this paper is to summarize recent developments of micro- and nanofluidic systems employing strong light–matter coupling. An overview of various methods and techniques used to achieve strong light–matter coupling in micro- or nanofluidic systems is presented, preceded by a brief outline of the fundamentals of strong light–matter coupling and optofluidics operating in the strong coupling regime. The potential applications of these integrated systems in sensing, optofluidics, and quantum technologies are explored. The challenges and prospects in this rapidly developing field are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"caca8f4cbbeea0547e2a6f4e1bed2ac191aa19a022af5a953137912aa1fece11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
