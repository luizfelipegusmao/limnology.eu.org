{"title":"Preparation and performance evaluation of a novel orthodontic adhesive incorporating composite dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate—Polycaprolactone fibers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304143","date":1716472800000,"content":"<p>by Xuecheng Xu, Qihan Yuan, Linlin Xu, Mingchang Hu, Jidong Xu, Yuanfei Wang, Yu Song</p>\r\n\r\nThis study addressed enamel demineralization, a common complication in fixed orthodontic treatment, by evaluating a novel orthodontic adhesive with DMAHDM-PCL composite fibers. These fibers, produced through electrospinning, were incorporated into orthodontic adhesive to create experimental formulations at different concentrations and a control group. The study assessed antimicrobial properties, biosafety, and mechanical characteristics. New orthodontic adhesive exhibited significant bacteriostatic effects, reducing bacterial biofilm activity and concentrations. Incorporating 1% and 3% DMAHDM-PCL did not affect cytocompatibility. Animal tests confirmed no inflammatory irritation. Shear bond strength and adhesive residual index results indicated that antimicrobial fibers didn’t impact bonding ability. In conclusion, orthodontic adhesives with 3% DMAHDM-PCL fibers are potential antimicrobial bonding materials, offering a comprehensive solution to enamel demineralization in orthodontic patients.","author":"Xuecheng Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"397a1c314cbd1c7a4349fec4af2c4d3713970c5d5b4b4dedfcc2ce1e0e56f29c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
