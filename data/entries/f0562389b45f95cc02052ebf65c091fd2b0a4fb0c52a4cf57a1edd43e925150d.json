So far, little is known about the therapeutic alliance in telerehabilitation.</p> Purpose <p>To identify and describe central elements of therapeutic alliance in the setting of telerehabilitation and compare it to those in conventional rehabilitation.</p> Methods <p>In this qualitative study, a literature search and in-depth semi-structured interviews with rehabilitation and telerehabilitation experts were conducted from 15.5.-10.8.2020 on elements influencing the therapeutic alliance in rehabilitation and telerehabilitation. Using a combined deductive and inductive approach, qualitative content analysis was used to identify categories and derive central themes.</p> Results <p>The elements bond, communication, agreement on goals and tasks and external factors were identified in the literature search and informed the development of the interview guide. Twelve purposively sampled experts from the fields of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychology, general medicine, sports science and telerehabilitation software development participated in the interviews. We identified three central themes: building effective communication; nurturing a mutual relationship of trust and respect; and agreement on goals and tasks and drivers of motivation.</p> Conclusions <p>In this qualitative study, key elements of therapeutic alliance in rehabilitation confirmed those reported in the literature, with additional elements in telerehabilitation comprising support from others for ensuring physical safety and technical connectedness, caregivers acting as co-therapists and applying professional touch, and promoting patient autonomy and motivation using specific strategies.</p>","author":"Barbara Seebacher","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f0562389b45f95cc02052ebf65c091fd2b0a4fb0c52a4cf57a1edd43e925150d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
