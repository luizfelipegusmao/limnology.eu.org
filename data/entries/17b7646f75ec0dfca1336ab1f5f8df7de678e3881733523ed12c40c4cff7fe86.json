{"title":"Exploring the impact of arginine-supplemented immunonutrition on length of stay in the intensive care unit: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302074","date":1714140000000,"content":"<p>by Niels D. Martin, Laura L. Schott, Mary K. Miranowski, Amarsinh M. Desai, Cynthia C. Lowen, Zhun Cao, Krysmaru Araujo Torres</p>\r\nBackground <p>Arginine-supplemented enteral immunonutrition has been designed to optimize outcomes in critical care patients. Existing formulas may be isocaloric and isoproteic, yet differ in L-arginine content, energy distribution, and in source and amount of many other specialized ingredients. The individual contributions of each may be difficult to pinpoint; however, all cumulate in the body’s response to illness and injury. The study objective was to compare health outcomes between different immunonutrition formulas.</p> Methods <p>Real-world data from October 2015 –February 2019 in the PINC AI<sup>™</sup> Healthcare Database (formerly the Premier Healthcare Database) was reviewed for patients with an intensive care unit (ICU) stay and ≥3 days exclusive use of either higher L-arginine formula (HAF), or lower L-arginine formula (LAF). Multivariable generalized linear model regression was used to check associations between formulas and ICU length of stay.</p> Results <p>3,284 patients (74.5% surgical) were included from 21 hospitals, with 2,525 receiving HAF and 759 LAF. Inpatient mortality (19.4%) and surgical site infections (6.2%) were similar across groups. Median hospital stay of 17 days (IQR: 16) did not differ by immunonutrition formula. Median ICU stay was shorter for patients receiving HAF compared to LAF (10 vs 12 days; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). After adjusting for demographics, visit, severity of illness, and other clinical characteristics, associated regression-adjusted ICU length of stay for patients in the HAF group was 11% shorter [0.89 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.94; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001)] compared to patients in the LAF group. Estimated adjusted mean ICU length of stay was 9.4 days (95% CI: 8.9, 10.0 days) for the HAF group compared to 10.6 days (95% CI: 9.9, 11.3 days) for the LAF group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>Despite formulas being isocaloric and isoproteic, HAF use was associated with significantly reduced ICU length of stay, compared to LAF. Higher arginine immunonutrition formula may play a role in improving health outcomes in primarily surgical critically ill patients.</p>","author":"Niels D.
