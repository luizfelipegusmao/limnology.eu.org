{"title":"Groundwater Quality and Hydrogeochemical Processes in the Katerini-Kolindros Aquifer System, Central Macedonia, Greece","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0354/v1","date":1720007774000,"content":"The Katerini-Kolindros aquifer system (KKas) is a critical freshwater resource, essential for the local and regional economy. To understand contamination sources, groundwater flow paths, and assess the aquifer's health, an extensive dataset of 751 samples from 113 wells collected between 2010 and 2020 was analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis (MVSA) and hydrogeochemical diagrams. The prevailing water types identified were Ca-HCO₃ and Mg-HCO₃, with mixed water types resulting from various factors affecting groundwater quality. The chemistry of groundwater in the KKas is shown to be affected by ion exchange processes and to a lesser extent by reverse ion exchange processes. No indications of sea-water intrusion have been identified in the water wells monitored. On the other hand, nitrate contamination has been detected in specific water wells spatially associated with urban-type land uses and activities. It is considered that nitrate contamination originates primarily from septic tanks and urban sewage networks or secondarily from fertilization of football pitches, cemeteries or urban waste management practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"557b3c6d4ac1abf8beb9dc7f0ce63a8d717a154e42e099e9b68e125eede90641","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
