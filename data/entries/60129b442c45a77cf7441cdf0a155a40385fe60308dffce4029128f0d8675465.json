This study concentrates on the cesium lead-based halides (CsPbX<sub>3</sub>, where X = Br or Cl), which are known in the halide perovskite family due to their promising optoelectronic properties [4]. We aim to elucidate the intricate phase transitions these compounds undergo upon thermal variation. Utilizing <span>in-situ</span> four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM) capabilities and eaSI<sup>™</sup> technology, as integrated within DigitalMicrograph<sup>®</sup> version 3.6, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation of the thermal-induced phase behavior of these perovskites. This approach captures their structural evolution across a temperature range from sub-ambient to the melting point. Energy-filtered 4D STEM data were acquired using a JEOL ARM300F microscope outfitted with a GIF Continuum<sup>®</sup> and post-GIF K3<sup>®</sup> detector from Gatan. Temperature modulation of the samples was achieved using a DENSsolutions heating holder for heating and a Gatan LN<sub>2</sub> holder for cooling.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"60129b442c45a77cf7441cdf0a155a40385fe60308dffce4029128f0d8675465","category":"Environment"}
