Skin Extract against Cervical Cancer Cells In Vitro and in Nude Mouse Xenograft Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0761/v1","date":1718187457000,"content":"Abstract: This study aimed at investigating the effects of Valencia KK4-type peanut skin ethanolic extract (KK4-PSE) in combination with cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against HeLa cells in vitro and in xenograft models. MTT assay showed that KK4-PSE, cisplatin, and 5-FU suppressed proliferation of HeLa cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Drug interactions by Chou-Talalay method demonstrated that KK4-PSE enhanced antiproliferative activity of 5-FU against HeLa cells with combination index (CI) values of 0.49 (48 h) and 0.60 (72 h), indicating a synergistic effect, while KK4-PSE combined with cisplatin exhibited an additive effect (CI = 1.02) (72 h) and antagonistic effect at 24 and 48 h exposures (CI = 1.12 and 1.18, respectively). In nude mouse xenograft models, the combination of 5-FU and KK4-PSE markedly reduced HeLa tumor weights compared with control and single agent treatments. The combination of KK4-PSE and 5-FU achieved greater tumor growth inhibition than that of the KK4-PSE-cisplatin combination. KK4-PSE mitigated hepatotoxicity induced by both cisplatin and 5-FU in nude mice. The spleen hyaloserositis was significantly reduced in the combination treatment of 5-FU and KK4-PSE. These findings suggest a potential of KK4-PSE to inhibit cervical cancer cell growth while alleviating the toxicities of cisplatin and 5-FU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b73cedce2592bf5e4268813d79acb333279a8c8731effdb33e185fbccbf7416","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
