{"title":"Functional Morphology and Ecological Role of Therizinosaurs: A Focused Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0122/v1","date":1722563308000,"content":"Therizinosaurs, a unique clade of theropod dinosaurs, are characterized by their distinct morphological features and enigmatic ecological role. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the functional morphology and ecological significance of these remarkable dinosaurs. Therizinosaurs are distinguished by their elongated, often curved claws, robust postcranial skeletons, and herbivorous diet, which starkly contrasts with their carnivorous theropod relatives. We explore the evolutionary implications of their morphology, focusing on adaptations such as their specialized feeding apparatus and limb structure. These features suggest a complex interplay between their herbivorous lifestyle and ecological niche. The review synthesizes recent findings from fossil evidence, including detailed studies of cranial and postcranial anatomy, to elucidate the functional mechanisms behind their unique adaptations. Additionally, we discuss the broader ecological role of therizinosaurs within their Mesozoic ecosystems, highlighting their interactions with contemporaneous flora and fauna. By integrating paleontological data with comparative anatomy and ecological modeling, this review aims to shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of therizinosaurs and their impact on our understanding of theropod diversity and adaptation. This focused review contributes to a more nuanced appreciation of therizinosaurs' place in dinosaur evolution and their adaptive strategies in prehistoric environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3b9f6a5debfec0a3ea8a98a16ac1c55a7b37abe30507f1a8e652f60fd5811bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
