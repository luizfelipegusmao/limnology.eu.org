{"title":"Consensus of T-S Fuzzy Fractional Order Singular Perturbation Multi-Agent Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2480/v1","date":1722409625000,"content":"This article focuses on the leader-following consensus of fuzzy fractional order singular perturbation multi-agent systems (FOSPMASs) with order in 0,2. By employing the T-S fuzzy modeling approach, a fuzzy FOSPMAS is constructed. Subsequently, a fuzzy observer-based controller is designed and the error system corresponding to each agent is derived. Through a series of equivalent transformations, the error system is decomposed into fuzzy singular fractional order systems (SFOSs). According to the admissibility of SFOSs, the consensus conditions of the fuzzy FOSPMAS are obtained based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) without equality constraint. Finally, the effectiveness of the criteria is verified through an RLC circuit model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc113861ef9e48e1a5074592a5ed1778dcd8576e3b32044417dcb08c3dd919f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
