{"title":"105 Water quality analysis and flow rate comparison between wean-finish swine barns","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/27/7664845?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Water is an essential nutrient to sustain life and a vital component of biological functioning, impacting regulation of pig body temperature along with transporting nutrients to the body. Drinker availability, position, design, water flow rate and pressure, and water quality are major components of pig water intake. The ideal water flow rate for wean-to-finish pigs is 1 L m<sup>-1</sup>. Excessive flow rates could limit pig water intake and increase humidity in the barn, while too little water flow can lead to a decrease in water intake and biological functioning of the pig. Water should not contain harmful substances and should be readily accessible to pigs. Compounds in water are highly variable depending on region, water source, and pH. Quality of water influences feed consumption along with pig health. Water can contain a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, algae, and protozoa; while not all microorganisms are harmful a highly contaminated water analysis is an index of poor water quality. In this study water quality and water flow rates were analyzed across five wean-finish sites comprising 16 barns for three turns of finishing pigs. Water flow rates were measured twice per turn, wk 1 and wk 17. Each barn contained 36 pens and flow rate measurements were collected in 8 pens evenly distributed within the barn. One suspended water source was available per pen, with two nipple drinkers per water source. Water flow rates were averaged over each turn within barns. Average water flow rates were 1.42 L m<sup>-1</sup> with standard deviation of 0.44 L m<sup>-1</sup>. Overall barn water flow rates ranged from 0.78 to 2.19 L m<sup>-1</sup>. Barn flow rates were compared over time to evaluate performance and maintenance of facilities. Water quality samples were also collected and submitted for standard water analysis. Results will provide information on management strategies to assess water quality and water flow rates in wean-finish facilities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"bc9897d3de27ca3ef5c0b85a3ac045a3f93fef90f9fe6495e649f0eafc5c2593","category":"Environment"}
