{"title":"Characterization and utilization of industrial wastewater in biorefinery systems: A comprehensive approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14399?af=R","date":1713959868000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This review explores the innovative utilization of industrial effluents in biorefinery applications, addressing the environmental challenges posed by the complex mixture of pollutants in industrial wastewater. It emphasizes the transformation of these effluents into valuable resources, such as biofuels, biochemicals, and bioplastics, through advanced biotechnological processes including anaerobic digestion, fermentation, enzymatic conversion, and microbial biomass production. The study highlights the critical role of microbial biocatalysts in breaking down diverse pollutants and transforming waste into wealth, thereby contributing to sustainable industrial practices and a circular economy. Challenges such as variability in effluent composition, inhibitory substances, and the necessity for robust bioprocesses are discussed, along with suggestions for future research directions like effluent characterization, development of specialized microbial consortia, and effective monitoring and control strategies. The review underscores the importance of collaboration between industry, academia, and government to advance biorefinery technologies, ultimately advocating for a sustainable and resource-efficient future through the innovative treatment of industrial wastewaters.</p>","author":"Humberto Garcia Castellanos, \nYashar Aryanfar, \nHamidreza fardinnia, \nBusra Arslan, \nMustafa Ilbas, \nAli Keçebaş","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"4e0d72dde04c76612da08bf74040a46528b3c3bb3ec54c76918e52a3b5b7e91a","category":"Environment"}
