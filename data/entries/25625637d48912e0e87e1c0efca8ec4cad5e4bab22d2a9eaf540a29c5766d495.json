{"title":"Perceived Overqualification, Constructive Deviant Behaviour and Intergenerational Differences: Evidence from China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1545/v1","date":1721809795000,"content":"According to the model of proactive motivation, we constructed a moderated impact model to examine the relationship between employees perceived overqualification (POQ), transformational leadership (TL), constructive deviant behaviour (CDB), and the generational differences in their relationships. We examined research hypotheses using data of 525 individuals. Results revealed that POQ positively affects CDB, and TL strengthened the effect of POQ on positive toward CDB. Furthermore, the effect of POQ on CDB is strongest among individuals born in the 1980s, followed by those born in the 1990s, and the moderating effect of TL is strongest among individuals born in the 1980s, and not significant among those born in the 1990s. Implications, limitations, and future directions of the present study are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25625637d48912e0e87e1c0efca8ec4cad5e4bab22d2a9eaf540a29c5766d495","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
