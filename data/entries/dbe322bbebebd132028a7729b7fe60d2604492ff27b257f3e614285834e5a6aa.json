{"title":"Overview of Technologies for Solar Refrigeration Systems and Heat Storage: The Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics for the Analysis of Their Energy Efficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1216/v1","date":1729017753000,"content":"The article reviews selected solar systems that utilize solar energy for cooling production. Particular attention is given to research on individual components of these systems, aimed at improving their efficiency and performance. The article focuses on the analysis of literature concerning the design of thermal storage units, with an emphasis on the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a research tool. Conclusions from scientistsâ€™ research regarding the impact of tank shape, thermal insulation, flow parameters, and the use of stratification partitions on heat storage efficiency have been presented. The literature review indicates that thermal storage units play a key role in the efficiency of solar systems, and thermal stratification within them can significantly improve their performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbe322bbebebd132028a7729b7fe60d2604492ff27b257f3e614285834e5a6aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
