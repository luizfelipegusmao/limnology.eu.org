{"title":"Regressive Machine Learning for Real-Time Monitoring of Bed-Based Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1279/v1","date":1726555070000,"content":"This research presents an ensemble model developed to enhance the safety of bedridden patients in healthcare settings. The model utilizes a unique dataset capturing six typical movements performed by patients laying in bed, such as rolling over, falling off the bed, etc. The aim is to automate the classification of these movements, thereby enabling real-time monitoring of patients without the constant presence of hospital personnel in the room, a common practice in current healthcare settings. The dataset is preprocessed and balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, and then split into training and test sets for model training and evaluation. Three different models are explored: a Decision Tree Regressor, a Gradient Boosting Regressor, and a Bagging Regressor. The Bagging Regressor is an ensemble model that utilizes the Decision Tree Regressor as its base regressor. Each modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, R2 score, and Mean Squared Error on both the training and test sets. The ensemble model demonstrates promising results, indicating the potential of machine learning to improve patient safety in healthcare settings. The study also employs K-Fold cross-validation and learning curves to validate the robustness of the ensemble model. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the application of machine learning in healthcare and opens up new avenues for improving patient safety through real-time monitoring and classification of patient movements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a78e67507d2eb41701e0d34118624b9de9d7dc757278e51378b5aaa725458b0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
