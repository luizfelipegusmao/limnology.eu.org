{"title":"Effect of Coronary Collateral Supply on Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain after Recanalization of Chronic Total Occlusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2442/v1","date":1722408551000,"content":"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to chronic total occlusion (CTO) is still a subject of debate. The primary goal of revascularization is to provide symptomatic relief and enhancing left ventricular (LV) functions. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is proven to be more sensitive than ejection fraction (EF), especially for subtle ischemic changes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the improvement in LV GLS after revascularization of symptomatic stable coronary patients with single-vessel CTO, categorized according to their collateral supply grades. 69 patients with successful CTO PCI were grouped according to their collateral supply grades, as well-developed (WD) and poor collateral groups and followed-up for 3 months. Basal characteristics were similar for both groups, except for lower EF (p=0.04) and impaired GLS (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1049bdcb8e9920e33f6ab3cc14cc015b9b8e690e8f6a8443bb91ad49858c4d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
