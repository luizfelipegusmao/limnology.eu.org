{"title":"3 Dimensional DC Placement: Drone Placement for Optimal Coverage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0406/v1","date":1728293153000,"content":"Using Drone Cells to optimize Radio Access Networks is an exemplary way to enhance the capabilities of terrestrial Radio Access Networks. Drones fitted with communication and relay modules can act as Drone Cells. The multi Drone Cell placement problem is solved using an adapted Dispersive Flies Optimization alongside with other meta-heuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution. A home-brewed simulator has been used to test the effectiveness of the different implemented algorithms. Specific environment respective parameter tuning have been explored to better highlight possible advantages of one algorithm over other in any particular environment. Algorithmic diversity has been explored, leading to several modifications and improvements in the implemented models. The results show that using tuned parameters there is a performance uplift in coverage probability when compared to the default meta-heuristic parameters while still remaining within the constraints implied by the problemâ€™s requirements and resource limitation. The paper concludes by offering a study between multiple meta-heuristic approaches and comparison between the methods, investigating the impact of parameter-tuning as well as analyzing the impact of intermittent restart for algorithms persistent diversity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e44f6953ead51b720857d9774195fdd8b2aff9bc79e63d0436a1d8ed4839ee8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
