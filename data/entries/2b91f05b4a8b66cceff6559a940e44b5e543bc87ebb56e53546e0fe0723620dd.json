Here we specifically utilize a combination of two STEM instruments with distinct capabilities: (1) a low kV <span>in situ</span> STEM with secondary electron (SE), bright field, and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detectors to understand the morphological transformations for panoptic insights, and (2) an aberration-corrected STEM with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to conduct detailed examinations of atomic structure and chemical transformations. By combining the resulting data, we can identify key moments involved in the decomposition of these materials and develop detailed mechanistic understanding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2b91f05b4a8b66cceff6559a940e44b5e543bc87ebb56e53546e0fe0723620dd","category":"Environment"}
