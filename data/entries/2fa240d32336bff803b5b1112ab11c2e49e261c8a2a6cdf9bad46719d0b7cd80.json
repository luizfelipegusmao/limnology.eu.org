{"title":"The immune modules conserved across the tree of life: Towards a definition of ancestral immunity","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002717","date":1721052000000,"content":"<p>by Aude Bernheim, Jean Cury, Enzo Z. Poirier</p>\r\n\r\nImmune defence mechanisms exist across the tree of life in such diversity that prokaryotic antiviral responses have historically been considered unrelated to eukaryotic immunity. Mechanisms of defence in divergent eukaryotes were similarly believed to be largely clade specific. However, recent data indicate that a subset of modules (domains and proteins) from prokaryote defence systems are conserved in eukaryotes and populate many stages of innate immune pathways. In this Essay, we propose the notion of ancestral immunity, which corresponds to the set of immune modules conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. After offering a typology of ancestral immunity, we speculate on the selective pressures that could have led to the differential conservation of specific immune modules across domains of life. The exploration of ancestral immunity is in its infancy and appears full of promises to illuminate immune evolution, and also to identify and decipher immune mechanisms of economic, ecological, and therapeutic importance.","author":"Aude Bernheim","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"2fa240d32336bff803b5b1112ab11c2e49e261c8a2a6cdf9bad46719d0b7cd80","category":"Environment"}
