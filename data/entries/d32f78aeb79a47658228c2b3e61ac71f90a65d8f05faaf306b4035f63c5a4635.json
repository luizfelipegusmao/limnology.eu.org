{"title":"Structural modelling and preventive strategy targeting of WSSV hub proteins to combat viral infection in shrimp <i>Penaeus monodon</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307976","date":1722261600000,"content":"<p>by Tanate Panrat, Amornrat Phongdara, Kitti Wuthisathid, Watcharachai Meemetta, Kornsunee Phiwsaiya, Rapeepun Vanichviriyakit, Saengchan Senapin, Pakkakul Sangsuriya</p>\r\n\r\nWhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV) presents a considerable peril to the aquaculture sector, leading to notable financial consequences on a global scale. Previous studies have identified hub proteins, including WSSV051 and WSSV517, as essential binding elements in the protein interaction network of WSSV. This work further investigates the functional structures and potential applications of WSSV hub complexes in managing WSSV infection. Using computational methodologies, we have successfully generated comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) representations of hub proteins along with their three mutual binding counterparts, elucidating crucial interaction locations. The results of our study indicate that the WSSV051 hub protein demonstrates higher binding energy than WSSV517. Moreover, a unique motif, denoted as \"S-S-x(5)-S-x(2)-P,\" was discovered among the binding proteins. This pattern perhaps contributes to the detection of partners by the hub proteins of WSSV. An antiviral strategy targeting WSSV hub proteins was demonstrated through the oral administration of dual hub double-stranded RNAs to the black tiger shrimp, <i>Penaeus monodon</i>, followed by a challenge assay. The findings demonstrate a decrease in shrimp mortality and a cessation of WSSV multiplication. In conclusion, our research unveils the structural features and dynamic interactions of hub complexes, shedding light on their significance in the WSSV protein network. This highlights the potential of hub protein-based interventions to mitigate the impact of WSSV infection in aquaculture.","author":"Tanate Panrat","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d32f78aeb79a47658228c2b3e61ac71f90a65d8f05faaf306b4035f63c5a4635","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
