{"title":"A qualitative exploration of policy interventions to improve the health-related quality of life of people living with HIV AIDS and co-morbidities of hypertension and/or diabetes in Ghana","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311994","date":1728655200000,"content":"<p>by Richmond Owusu, Serwaa Akoto Bawua, Emmanuel Bugyei Kwarteng, Leonard Baatiema, Justice Nonvignon</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>The intersection of infectious diseases, such as HIV, with chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes poses a significant challenge in global health. While advancements in antiretroviral therapy have transformed HIV into a manageable chronic condition, a growing number of individuals with HIV now grapple with coexisting non-communicable diseases, impacting their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Despite strides in HIV care, there is a notable policy gap that undermines efforts to address HIV-associated co-morbidities, particularly hypertension and diabetes, especially efforts to improve access, early detection, and ultimately HRQoL for individuals with HIV and co-morbidities. This study seeks to explore policy interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of HIV patients with hypertension or diabetes.</p> Methods <p>The study utilized a qualitative descriptive design to explore the experiences and perspectives of healthcare professionals and support staff regarding policy interventions for managing HIV patients with hypertension and/or diabetes co-morbidities in three regions of Ghana. The research was conducted in the Upper West, Ashanti, and Greater Accra regions among 11 participants, chosen purposively from professions involved in HIV patient care to understand their views on the implementation of policy interventions to HRQoL for individuals with HIV and co-morbidities. In-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face and tape-recorded. Thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the data.</p> Results <p>The study involved 11 participants from three regions with varied years of experience. Implemented policies that potentially improve the HRQoL for individuals with HIV and co-morbidities involve support groups, home visits, provision of free drugs, and counselling. Barriers to policy implementation included non-adherence to medication, stigma, cost of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) medications, accessibility issues to NCDs services, lack of interest or understanding among implementers, and high staff turnover. Facilitators encompassed in-service training, guidelines in common platforms, knowledge sharing, external resources, regular check-ups, and motivational packages for patients.</p> Conclusion <p>Individuals with HIV and comorbidities face complex challenges impacting their HRQoL, including emotional and financial dimensions. The study identifies critical policies and barriers, underscoring the need for tailored, patient-centered approaches. Facilitators like in-service training and regular check-ups offer actionable insights for effective policy implementation, emphasizing improved health outcomes for those with comorbid conditions. The study recommends integrated care approach and adherence support programs that address the unique challenges faced by people living with HIV.</p>","author":"Richmond Owusu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9d3a327f554bdb112a99bf38fcd52bcd9a1a31c1e1202d4e3c63464110d0983e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
