{"title":"Alginate coatings applied on apple cubes as a vehicle for Lacticaseibacillus casei: probiotic viability and overall quality of a new functional product","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13805?af=R","date":1723618441000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Worldwide, vegan and vegetarian lifestyles, as well as food allergies and intolerance (e.g. lactose intolerance and milk protein allergy) demand the development of alternatives to dairy-based probiotic foods. In the present study, probiotic <i>Lacticaseibacillus casei</i> CECT 9104 was added to alginate-based edible coatings enriched with inulin and oligofructose and applied to fresh-cut apple. Microbiological, physicochemical and sensory quality parameters of the apple cubes were monitored during 8 days of refrigerated storage. <i>Lacticaseibacillus casei</i> was tested for its antagonistic effect against inoculated <i>Listeria innocua</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7. The viability of the probiotic strain during refrigerated storage and after simulated gastrointestinal digestion (GID) was evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>After 8 days of storage, 9.52–9.64 log colony-forming units (CFU) g<sup>−1</sup> of <i>L. casei</i> were detected in apple samples. The functional apple cubes retained 8.31–8.43 log CFU g<sup>−1</sup> of the probiotic after GID, without a significant effect of prebiotic addition. The microbiological quality and nutritional properties were maintained by the use of active coatings, whereas the sensory quality decreased after 8 days of storage. A bactericidal effect was exerted by the probiotic strain loaded in the coating against <i>L. innocua</i> artificially inoculated on apple cubes. <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 counts were reduced by 2.5 log after 8 days.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study has demonstrated the suitability of apple cubes as an alternative matrix to milk for carrying probiotic <i>L. casei</i> CECT 9104 and prebiotics, offering a promising alternative for the development of plant-based functional foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"María Florencia Bambace, \nMaría Victoria Alvarez, \nMaría del Rosario Moreira","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"9280236ac4de53c69838671cc79c2178ff70249597ad900b3f7af904ae6056eb","category":"Environment"}
