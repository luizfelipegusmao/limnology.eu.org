{"title":"Sexual and reproductive health while living with rheumatoid arthritis: The impact of the disease stage on patient perspectives","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302284","date":1714140000000,"content":"<p>by Loraine Ledón-Llanes, Irazú Contreras-Yáñez, Guillermo Arturo Guaracha-Basáñez, Salvador Saúl Valverde-Hernández, Maximiliano Cuevas-Montoya, Ana Belén Ortiz-Haro, Virginia Pascual-Ramos</p>\r\nBackground <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most prevalent rheumatic diseases that harms all aspects of patients’ lives, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), often neglected in patients’ care. The study aimed to explore the sexual and reproductive experiences of Mexican outpatients with RA from a narrative perspective.</p> Patients and methods <p>From July 2020 to October 2021, 30 adult patients with RA from the Department of Immunology and Rheumatology outpatient clinic of a national referral center for rheumatic diseases had in-depth interviews audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results are presented in a descriptive and interpretative manner and integrated into a theoretical model for the topic understanding.</p> Results <p>Five intertwined major themes emerged: I) RA onset: Absence of SRH contents, II) Healthcare for RA: Emerging SRH contents, III) RA’s impact: Proliferation of SRH contents, IV) Coping with the process of living with RA: SRH-related strategies, and V) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients’ experiences: Increased SRH burden. SRH contents emerged through these major themes (but at RA onset), mostly when inquired and mainly when narrating the RA impact and coping. Patients identified that RA affected their couple dynamics, sexual function, and reproductive project. The SRH care was considered relevant but limited and focused on reproductive contents. It worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. We proposed a theoretical model where patients’ SRH experiences are embedded across their RA biography and integrated with the RA impact and the copy with the disease process. These intertwined experiences were also evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, which challenged participants’ biopsychosocial resources.</p> Conclusions <p>The sexual and reproductive experiences narrated by the RA outpatients concerning their disease-related biography showed that even when the SRH appeared as not prioritized at the disease onset, it was widely expressed during the process of living and coping with the disease and was additionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>","author":"Loraine Ledón-Llanes","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c0ae8069f3522487229aeea0406662b68bc0ca04845742ae3db15c3eca2253af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
