{"title":"Effects of soil physicochemical environment on the plasticity of root growth and land productivity in maize soybean relay strip intercropping system","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13268?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Soil is a key foundation of crop root growth. There are interactions between root system and soil in multiple ways. The present study aimed to further explore the response of root distribution and morphology to soil physical and chemical environment under maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) soybean (<i>Glycine Max</i> L. Merr.) relay strip intercropping (MS) An experiment was carried out aiming to examine the effects of nitrogen (N) applications and interspecific distances on root system and soil environment in MS. The two N application levels, referred to as no N application (NN) and conventional N application (CN), were paired with different interspecific distances: 30, 45 and 60 cm (MS30, MS45 and MS60) and 100 cm of monoculture maize and soybean (MM/SS100).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results demonstrated that MS45 increased the distribution of soil aggregates (&gt; 2 mm) near the crop roots and maize soil nutrients status, which increased by 20.3% and 15.6%. Meanwhile, MS reduced soil bulk density, increased soil porosity and improved soil oxygen content. Optimization of the soil environment facilitated root growth. The MS45 achieved a better result on root distribution and morphology than the other configuration and also increased land productivity.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Relay intercropped soybean with maize in interspecific row spacing of 45 cm, improved soil physicochemical environment, reshaped root architecture and optimized root spatial distribution of crops to achieve greater land productivity. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xinyue Peng, \nJunbo Ren, \nPing Chen, \nLida Yang, \nKai Luo, \nXiaoting Yuan, \nPing Lin, \nZhidan Fu, \nYiling Li, \nYuze Li, \nWenyu Yang, \nTaiwen Yong","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f313a82ce1af2d957ce2520147c7fdac12aa701c25c88a50443ab866464d3736","category":"Environment"}
