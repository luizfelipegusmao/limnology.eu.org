{"title":"Trends and disparities in alcohol-DWI license suspensions by suspension duration, North Carolina, 2007–2016","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310270","date":1726840800000,"content":"<p>by Bhavna Singichetti, Yudan Chen Wang, Yvonne M. Golightly, Stephen W. Marshall, Rebecca B. Naumann</p>\r\nPurpose <p>To examine trends and potential disparities in North Carolina (NC) driving while impaired by alcohol (alcohol-DWI) license suspensions from 2007–2016. Specific objectives included: 1) examining personal (e.g., race/ethnicity) and contextual (e.g., residential segregation) characteristics of alcohol-DWI license suspensions by suspension duration; and 2) examining trends in annual suspension rates by race/ethnicity, sex, and duration.</p> Methods <p>We linked NC administrative licensing and county-level survey data from several sources from 2007–2016. Suspensions were categorized by duration: 1 to &lt;4 years and 4 years or longer (proxies for initial and repeat suspensions, respectively). We calculated counts, percentages, and suspensions rates (per 1,000 person-years) with 95% confidence intervals, examined trends in annual suspension rates by race/ethnicity, sex, and suspension duration.</p> Results <p>We identified 220,471 initial and 41,526 repeat license suspensions. Rates among males were three times that of females. 21-24-year-old (rates: 6.9 per 1,000 person-years for initial; 1.5 for repeat) and Black (4.1 for initial; 1.0 for repeat) individuals had the highest suspension rates. We observed decreases in annual initial and repeat suspension rates among males, but only in repeat suspensions for females during the study period. A substantial decrease in annual initial suspension rates was observed among Hispanic individuals relative to other racial/ethnic groups, while annual repeat suspension rates exhibited large decreases for most racial/ethnic groups. The highest overall suspension rates occurred in counties with higher proportions of the population without health insurance and with the highest levels of Black/White residential segregation.</p> Conclusions <p>Potential disparities by race/ethnicity and sex existed by alcohol-DWI license suspension duration (i.e., initial vs. repeat suspensions) in NC. Contextual characteristics associated with suspensions, including a high degree of residential segregation, may provide indications of underlying structures and mechanisms driving potential disparities in alcohol-DWI outcomes.</p>","author":"Bhavna Singichetti","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c1b0d3d8e33bb67751f862046378d357d4e32a4620d6c1134b07ccfe8b521b56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
