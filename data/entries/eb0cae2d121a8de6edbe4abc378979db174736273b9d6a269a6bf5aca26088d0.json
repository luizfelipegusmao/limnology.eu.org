{"title":"Novel Chromogens for Immunohistochemistry in Spatial Biology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1670/v1","date":1714047791000,"content":"Spatial relations between tumor cells and host-infiltrating cells are increasingly important in both basic science and clinical research. In this study we have tested the feasibility of using standard methods of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a multiplex staining system using a newly developed set of chromogenic substrates for the peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes.  Using this approach we have developed a set of chromogens characterized by 1) providing fine cellular detail, 2) non-overlapping spectral profiles, 3) absence of interactions between chromogens,  4) stable upon storage, and 5) compatible with current standard immunohistochemistry practices.  When viewed microscopically under brightfield illumination the chromogens yielded the following colors; red, black, blue, yellow, brown, and green.  By selecting compatible color combinations we have shown feasibility for four-color multiplex staining.   Depending on the particular type of analysis being performed, visual analysis, without the aid of computer assisted image analysis, was sufficient to differentiate up to four different markers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb0cae2d121a8de6edbe4abc378979db174736273b9d6a269a6bf5aca26088d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
