{"title":"Factor-GAN: Enhancing stock price prediction and factor investment with Generative Adversarial Networks","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306094","date":1719324000000,"content":"<p>by Jiawei Wang, Zhen Chen</p>\r\n\r\nDeep learning, a pivotal branch of artificial intelligence, has increasingly influenced the financial domain with its advanced data processing capabilities. This paper introduces Factor-GAN, an innovative framework that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology for factor investing. Leveraging a comprehensive factor database comprising 70 firm characteristics, Factor-GAN integrates deep learning techniques with the multi-factor pricing model, thereby elevating the precision and stability of investment strategies. To explain the economic mechanisms underlying deep learning, we conduct a subsample analysis of the Chinese stock market. The findings reveal that the deep learning-based pricing model significantly enhances return prediction accuracy and factor investment performance in comparison to linear models. Particularly noteworthy is the superior performance of the long-short portfolio under Factor-GAN, demonstrating an annualized return of 23.52% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.29. During the transition from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to non-SOEs, our study discerns shifts in factor importance, with liquidity and volatility gaining significance while fundamental indicators diminish. Additionally, A-share listed companies display a heightened emphasis on momentum and growth indicators relative to their dual-listed counterparts. This research holds profound implications for the expansion of explainable artificial intelligence research and the exploration of financial technology applications.","author":"Jiawei Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"424599ece1e03b72d6701a9fa65508daa10cd65ca6e5023a543f1525d825ff59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
