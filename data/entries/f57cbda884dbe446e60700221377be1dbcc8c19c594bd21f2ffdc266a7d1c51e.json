{"title":"Strategic management control tools for the sustainability of seaports: Scoping review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0473/v1","date":1722996318000,"content":"This study offers an analysis of existing research on sustainability and its link to accounting and management control in the port sector. The existing studies do not provide a comprehensive discussion of management accounting and control tools in this context, despite recognizing the relevance of the issue. The Scoping Review was used as a methodological basis, with reference to the framework of Arksey and Oâ€™Malley [1], with the aim of mapping the literature on the role of ac-counting and management control, as well as their relationship with the Triple Bottom Line associated with the various levels of sustainability in this sector. The results point to a diversity of tools used essentially in developed countries, where the interest in efficiency, sustainability and strategic alignment stands out.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f57cbda884dbe446e60700221377be1dbcc8c19c594bd21f2ffdc266a7d1c51e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
