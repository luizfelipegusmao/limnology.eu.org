With advancements in technology, the treatment concept for bone tissue defects has gradually shifted from tissue transplantation to tissue regeneration. Porous scaffolds play a crucial role in bone tissue engineering research [<a href=\"#ozae044.425-B2\">2</a>]. In recent years, efforts have been made to control the structure of bone repair materials. This has included creating an optimised porous structure that promotes cell growth and differentiation [<a href=\"#ozae044.425-B3\">3</a>]. However, the effects of different pore structures in silk fibroin scaffolds on bone tissue cells have not been extensively studied. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effects of different porous structures of fibroin-based scaffolds on the growth of MG-63 cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4d80abe616d165d365cc30730549a599d7a2d36de5fdc0e1b51ed0a8a68be42b","category":"Environment"}
