{"title":"A novel fish individual recognition method for precision farming based on knowledge distillation strategy and the range of the receptive field","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15793?af=R","date":1717974456000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>With the continuous development of green and high-quality aquaculture technology, the process of industrialized aquaculture has been promoted. Automation, intelligence, and precision have become the future development trend of the aquaculture industry. Fish individual recognition can further distinguish fish individuals based on the determination of fish categories, providing basic support for fish disease analysis, bait feeding, and precision aquaculture. However, the high similarity of fish individuals and the complexity of the underwater environment presents great challenges to fish individual recognition. To address these problems, we propose a novel fish individual recognition method for precision farming that rethinks the knowledge distillation strategy and the chunking method in the vision transformer. The method uses the traditional convolutional neural network model as the teacher model, introducing the teacher token to guide the student model to learn the fish texture features. We propose stride patch embedding to expand the range of the receptive field, thus enhancing the local continuity of the image, and self-attention-pruning to discard unimportant tokens and reduce the model computation. The experimental results on the DlouFish dataset show that the proposed method in this paper improves accuracy by 3.25% compared to ECA Resnet152, with an accuracy of 93.19%, and also outperforms other vision transformer models.</p>","author":"Jianhao Yin, \nJunfeng Wu, \nChunqi Gao, \nHong Yu, \nLiang Liu, \nShihao Guo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"716248786061cb341526a2ab62b5a8f3cec9f7182922303073c024d657cbbbd1","category":"Environment"}
