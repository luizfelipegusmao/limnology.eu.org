{"title":"304 What does Prop 12 mean for the swine industry","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/11/7664758?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>California’s Proposition 12, also known as the Farm Animal Confinement Initiative, has been fully implemented as of January 1st, 2024. This measure regulates the minimum space requirements for egg-laying hens, dairy calves raised for veal, and breeding pigs in order for the associated products to be sold within the state of California. Suppliers of these covered products need to be accredited by specific, third-party certifying agents to be certified as ‘Prop 12 compliant’. For the swine industry, the spotlight is on the housing of any female breeding pig over the age of 6 mo. These animals must be in an enclosure that allows them to lie down, stand up, turn around, and fully extend their limbs without touching the sides of their stalls or another animal (24 square feet of floor space per animal). These regulations also limit the duration of time producers can house animals in closed crates before farrowing to 5 d. While these housing regulations do not apply during the nursing phase, research contexts, during veterinary treatment or immediately before slaughter, they do apply in the post-weaning phase. This means that the animals cannot be confined for heat-checking or breeding to be considered ‘Prop 12 compliant’. These housing standards have no minimum herd size and apply to those in commercial or private farms if there will be products produced and sold. With any change to the standard operating procedures of animal husbandry, there will be some growing pains. These issues can be addressed when considerations are given to the group composition (age and size of sows), pen mixing practices (pre or post breeding), feeding schedule [collective (trough, floor fed) or individual (electronic sow feeding, free access stalls)], and, pen structural quality (flooring, enrichment). This measure will have considerable economic and ethical implications related to barn renovations, animal care staff training, and husbandry practices for the swine industry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"dc6be20500b3c0fdd22b3b7177dcd5c8af9158e63d1aaf329b5b7ad12fe490ec","category":"Environment"}
