This paper proposes a wideband RFPA by designing the input matching network (MN) and output MN of the device using the simplified real frequency technique (SRFT) and the harmonic tuning network. The load-pull and source-pull is applied at multiple points for 100 MHz intervals over the bandwidth to obtain the optimum impedances at the output and input of the 10W Gallium Nitride (GaN) Cree CGH40010F device. To verify the design, the RFPA is simulated, and the performance is measured between 3.3 and 4.3 GHz. According to experimental findings, the measured drain efficiency (DE) throughout the whole bandwidth ranged from 57.5 to 67.5% at the output power of 40 dBm. Moreover, at the 1 dB compression point between 39.2 and 42.2 dBm output power, the drain efficiency (DE) achieves a high value of 81.2% with an output power of 42.2 dBm at a frequency of 3.3 GHz. The RFPA can obtain a maximum gain of 12.4 dB at 3.5 GHz. The linearity of the RFPA with a two-tone signal is measured and the value is less than -22 dBc all over the band.","author":"Md.
