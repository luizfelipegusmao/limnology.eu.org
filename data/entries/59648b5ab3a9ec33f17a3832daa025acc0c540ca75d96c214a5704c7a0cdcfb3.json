{"title":"Allocation of the household food budget among shopping basket items: How is it influenced by promotions?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304911","date":1717596000000,"content":"<p>by Wafa Mehaba, Djamel Rahmani, José Maria Gil</p>\r\n\r\nRetailers have been using promotion as a differentiation strategy that influences consumers’ expenditures and their shopping basket budgetary allocation. This study assessed the effect of retail promotions on total shopping basket expenditure and determined whether promotions provoke a reallocation of the shopping budget. The analysis was performed on a chain of supermarkets in Catalonia, Spain using a consumer scanner data set from Kantar Worldpanel for 2017. The methodological approach had two steps: prediction of the effect of promotion on household expenditures using an expenditure regression model and estimation of the promotion own- and cross-effect using the censored Exact Affine Stone Index. Promotion had a positive own-effect and mostly a negative asymmetric cross-effect, implying a small but significant budget reallocation.","author":"Wafa Mehaba","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"59648b5ab3a9ec33f17a3832daa025acc0c540ca75d96c214a5704c7a0cdcfb3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
