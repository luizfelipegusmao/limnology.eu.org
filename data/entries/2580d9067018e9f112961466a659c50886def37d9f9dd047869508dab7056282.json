{"title":"Prediction of Dielectric Constant in Series of Polymers by Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0884/v1","date":1723532158000,"content":"The dielectric constant (Îµ) reflects the ability of a material to align and orient electrical dipoles within its structure in response to an externally applied electric field; the greater the polarizability of molecules, the greater the value of dielectric constant. In this study a data set of 86 polymers was investigated to develop a structure-property quantitative relations (QSPR) model to predict the dielectric constant in polymers. An initial set of 1273 descriptors was used to select a best set of descriptors and to construct two machine learning models with Gradient Boosting Regressor (GB_A and GB_B). The best performing model (GB_A) with 8 descriptors, exhibited a performance of (R2train) = 0.938 and (R2test) = 0.802. The models were internally validated by 5 folds cross-validation, demonstrating robustness. Additionally, using the Accumulative Local Effect (ALE) technique, we analyzed the relationship between the 8 descriptors involved and the impact of these descriptors to dielectric constant of polymers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2580d9067018e9f112961466a659c50886def37d9f9dd047869508dab7056282","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
