{"title":"Indistinguishability Hypothesis for Temporarily Identical Particles and Its Possible Implications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0180/v1","date":1717551580000,"content":"Particles are considered temporarily identical if the interchange of these particles does not cause any observable physical effects within a time interval Î”t. An indistinguishability hypothesis is proposed for such particles, suggesting that two particles (or systems) with nearly the same degree of internal freedom will actually interchange under certain circumstances, thereby affecting the subsequent dynamics. This indistinguishability implies that, theoretically, it is possible to capture an elementary particle with extraordinarily large internal freedom by trading it for an isolated composite system of ordinary matter particles with almost the same total internal freedom as the large-freedom particle. Following this, the ordinary particles will instantly disperse into the environment, while the large-freedom particle will initially be captured and then gradually delocalized into the environment, an observable phenomenon. If this hypothesis is proven true in the future, it might provide a novel strategy for detecting dark matter particles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f0f8eb0d4043f616cef96acbd12509a151cf9a6cb2c1d83862dc93a4435a233","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
