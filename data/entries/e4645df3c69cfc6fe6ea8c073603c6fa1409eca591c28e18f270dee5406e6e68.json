Early diagnosis, for which estimating Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is one such tool, is imperative to help mitigate the negative impacts of this insidious disease. GFR was determined by measuring the serum clearance of iohexol in nine clinically normal, cheetahs managed under human care that presented for voluntary blood collection. A 2-sample iohexol clearance method was performed, along with serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) determination. SDMA has shown promise in humans, dogs, and cats, as an early biomarker of renal disease. Additionally, the relationship between GFR and SDMA, along with serum creatinine and BUN were analyzed. The mean values for the uncorrected GFR and corrected GFR were 2.08 ± 0.215 mL/min/kg body weight and 1.87 ± 0.173 mL/min/kg body weight, respectively. No significant correlations were observed between GFR, SDMA, serum creatinine, or BUN. Both the uncorrected and corrected iohexol-based GFR values were similar to an inulin-based GFR reference interval determined in zoo managed cheetahs and a reported domestic cat iohexol-based GFR reference interval. Serum SDMA values support previous research suggesting cheetahs have a separate reference interval from domestic cats (0–14 μg/dL). Measuring GFR by the serum clearance of iohexol shows promise as a readily available, cheap, and easily administered clearance marker that can be used in cheetahs trained for voluntary blood collection, thereby avoiding the need for anesthesia.","author":"Nicholas Lordi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e4645df3c69cfc6fe6ea8c073603c6fa1409eca591c28e18f270dee5406e6e68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
