{"title":"Time-Dependent Evolution of Al-Al4C3 Composite Micro-structure and Hardness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1877/v1","date":1724743390000,"content":"In this study, Al-Al4C3 compounds were manufactured by mechanical milling followed by heat treatment. To analyze the microstructural evolution, the composites were sintered at 550°C during different sintering times of 2, 4 and 6 hours. The mechanical results suggest that dislocation density and crystallite size primary contribute to hardening before the sintering process, with a minimal contribution from particle dispersion in this condition. The compound exhibited a significant 75% increase in hardness after 2 hours of sintering, primarily attributed to the nucleation and growth of Al4C3 nanorods. The HRTEM analysis, combined with ge-ometric phase analysis (GPA) at and near the Al-Al4C3 interface of the nanorods, revealed strain field distributions primarily associated with partial screw dislocations and the presence of closely spaced dislocation dipoles. These findings are consistent with the microstructural parameters determined from X-ray diffraction pattern analysis using the convolutional multi-ple whole profile (CMWP) method. This analysis showed that the predominant dislocation character is primarily of the screw type, with the dislocation dipoles being closely correlated. Based on these results, it is suggested that samples with a lower weight percentage of rein-forcement and longer sintering times may experience reduced brittleness in Al/Al4C3 compo-sites. Strengthening contributions were calculated using the Langford–Cohen and Taylor equations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba5215989a96bd72b0c8e4704c99ac51af0bcbf2a6a943945ca74c095fd1d96a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
