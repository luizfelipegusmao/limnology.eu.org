{"title":"The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Architecture: A Comprehensive Analysis of AI Software Tools and Their Global Adoption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1513/v1","date":1729492297000,"content":"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into architecture is reshaping the industry by enhancing design processes, project management, and sustainability efforts. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of AI software tools, focusing on their functionalities in the market, automated site analysis, building performance analysis, architectural design development, and additional features. Key findings reveal that while tools like Spacio.ai, Swapp, and Autodesk Forma offer extensive features across various design phases, their effectiveness is influenced by design capabilities, sustainability and viability assessments, overall architectural design procedures, and third-party interactions. The study underscores the need for tailored AI tools that can effectively follow the architectural process from conceptualization and design to engineering and building permits, all while ensuring full regulatory compliance and adaptability in real-time. By identifying current trends and features, this study contributes to understanding the role of AI in architecture, offering valuable insights for software developers and professionals aiming to integrate AI capabilities into a robust platform. The goal is to elevate architecture to higher levels of human engagement and construction excellence, harnessing the full potential of AI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21b8ff36cf1c2640a4bfb3bd325cf0d8828496cb1a84477491ccf9bd68d82257","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
