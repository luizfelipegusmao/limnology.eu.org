Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), known for its beneficial characteristics in biological functions, presents an attractive option for intervention therapy to mitigate PMB-induced nephrotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanism of how THC mitigates PMB-induced nephrotoxicity is still poorly understood. Here, we first evaluated the potential of THC intervention therapy to mitigate PMB-induced nephrotoxicity in an in vitro model of PMB-induced cell injury. Moreover, we demonstrated that THC effectively protected HK-2 cells from PMB-induced apoptosis by using cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry assay. THC could also suppress PMB-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway. In addition, using PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 to inhibit ER stress also alleviated PMB-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights that THC possesses the ability to alleviate PMB-induced nephrotoxicity by inhibiting the ER stress-mediated PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP axis, which sheds light on the benefits of THC as an intervention strategy to reduce PMB-induced nephrotoxicity, thus providing a potential avenue for improved clinical outcomes in patients receiving PMB treatment.</p>","author":"Junjie Chen, \nWeibin Fan, \nJing Fan, \nJiao Xie, \nYan Wang, \nYinhui Wang, \nNengming Lin, \nBin Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"f319951a3027dc84282b76447696b416a1e11ef015bfb664e8d5d3e1caefb563","category":"Environment"}
