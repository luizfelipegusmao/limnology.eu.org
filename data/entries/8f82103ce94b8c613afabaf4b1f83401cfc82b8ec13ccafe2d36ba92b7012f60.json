{"title":"Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Application for Candida auris Outbreak Typing in a Referral Intensive Care Unit: Phylogenetic Analysis and Clustering Cut-Off Definition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1931/v1","date":1716961306000,"content":"Recently Candida auris has emerged as a multi-resistant fungal pathogen, with a significant clinical impact, and has become a critical issue in WHO fungal priority list, due to its unique ability to persist for long time on human skin and hospital environments. It is therefore fundamental to reinforce hospital surveillance protocols to limit nosocomial outbreaks.\nThe study purpose was the Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) application to investigate the phylogenetic relationships between isolated strains within the C. auris outbreak at the university Intensive Care Unit of a Tertiary University hospital in Turin (Italy). In order to calculate a clustering cut-off, intra- and inter-isolates distance values were analysed. Data showed the presence of a major cluster Alfa and a minor cluster Beta with a defined C. auris clustering cut-off. The results were validated by an external C. auris strain and Principal Component and Linear Discriminant Analysis.\nThe application of FT-IR technology had allowed to obtain important information about the phylogenetic relationships between the analysed strains, defining for the first time a “not WGS-based” clustering cut-off with a statistical-mathematical approach. FT-IR could represent a valid alternative to molecular methods for rapid and cost saving typing of C. auris strains with important clinical implications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f82103ce94b8c613afabaf4b1f83401cfc82b8ec13ccafe2d36ba92b7012f60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
