{"title":"Optimization Strategies for Atari Game Environments: Integrating Snake Optimization Algorithm and Energy Valley Optimization in Reinforcement Learning Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1262/v1","date":1716192101000,"content":"This study presents a groundbreaking approach in the field of gaming AI, focusing on the classic game” Pacman” through the lens of DRL integrated with advanced optimization techniques. The core of the research involves adapting DRL models for” Pacman”, utilizing the ESO for hyper- parameter tuning. These novel adaptations significantly enhance the AI agent’s performance, demonstrating a remarkable improvement in adaptability, responsiveness, and efficiency within the game environment. A pivotal aspect of this research is the innovative integration of metaheuristic optimization techniques into the DRL framework, a first in the domain of Atari gaming AI. This integration has proven essential in fine-tuning the DRL models, leading to a more effective and dynamic gaming experience. The study thoroughly evaluates and compares the performance of these algorithms, providing empirical support for their effectiveness and setting a new benchmark in AI-driven game development. The implications of this research extend beyond gaming AI, opening up possibilities for future exploration in several directions. Expanding DRL models to other complex gaming environments, continuous algorithmic enhancements, real-time learning adaptations, and applying these principles to robotics and autonomous vehicles are examples. The research also emphasizes ethical and responsible AI use in gaming to address fairness and addiction issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc24cb1300cb6b16f7023292d61d1d3d9a254cc2cee8d676e9d87bc4bf7d6102","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
