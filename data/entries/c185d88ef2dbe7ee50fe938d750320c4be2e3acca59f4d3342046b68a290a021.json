{"title":"Retrospective evaluation of radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction for hypertrophic turbinates in dogs with brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306391","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Marie-Cécile von Doernberg, Brigitte von Rechenberg, Henning Richter</p>\r\nObjective <p>The objective of this study was to retrospectively assess the effect of Radiofrequency Volumetric Tissue Reduction (RFVTR) on hypertrophic turbinates and clinical outcome in brachycephalic dogs when included in multi-level surgery (MLS).</p> Study design <p>Clinical retrospective multicenter study.</p> Animals <p>132 client-owned brachycephalic dogs.</p> Methods <p>132 brachycephalic dogs with high-grade Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Ayndrome (BOAS) and hypertrophic turbinates were treated with RFVTR as part of MLS of the upper airways. Intranasal obstruction was evaluated by computer tomography (CT) and antero-/retrograde rhinoscopy before and 6 months after RFVTR. The clinical records, the CT images and the rhinoscopy videos were reviewed and clinical evolution was evaluated using a standardized questionnaire. The data was scored semi-quantitatively.</p> Results <p>In this study, 132 patients were included for a follow-up period of 120 weeks. RFVTR resulted in minor complications, including serous nasal discharge within the first postoperative week in all dogs, and intermittent nasal congestion between 3–8 weeks after treatment in 24.3% of the patients. Rhinoscopy and CT follow-ups were available for 33 patients. Six months after treatment intranasal airspace was increased (p = 0.002) and the presence and overall amount of mucosal contact points was reduced (p = 0.039).</p> Conclusion <p>MLS with RFVTR led to a significant reduction in turbinate volume at the 6-month follow-up examination and significant clinical improvement over a long-term period of 120 weeks. This suggests the viability of RFVTR as a turbinate-preserving treatment for intranasal obstruction in dogs with BOAS.</p> Clinical significance <p>RFVTR is a minimally invasive turbinoplasty technique for intranasal obstruction in dogs with BOAS and can be included in MLS without increasing complication rates.</p>","author":"Marie-Cécile von Doernberg","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c185d88ef2dbe7ee50fe938d750320c4be2e3acca59f4d3342046b68a290a021","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
