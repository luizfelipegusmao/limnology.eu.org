{"title":"Federated Learning Based Futuristic Fault Diagnosis and Standardization in Rotating Machinery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1688/v1","date":1727143532000,"content":"In the industrial sector, intelligent sensors in fault diagnosis are becoming more critical in recent technological improvements. The prediction accuracy can be enhanced in fault diagnosis using 3-dimensional, sequential, real-time, and image data. Sensors that capture the vibration, sound, and image data are more critical in predicting unbalancing, tool wear, crack, misalignment, etc, in the rotating machinery to increase productivity and to provide an effective maintenance management system. Due to the fast development of industry 4.0 techniques, monitoring of mechanical machinery is experiencing explosive growth and getting more attention in the area of fault diagnosis (FD). Machine learning and Deep learning methods give promising results and accuracy in predicting faults in rotating machinery on shop floors. The success of AI-based models is due to the availability of comprehensive labeled data. Federated Learning (FL) is the machine learning subfield aiming to train an algorithm with a heterogeneous dataset. Data transmission from local facilities to a central server in AI models creates data privacy and security issues. Heterogeneous data analysis is a complicated process in predicting the machine fault in the central server because of millions of data during real-time condition monitoring.  Decentralized data handling and analysis is mandatory in condition monitoring because of heterogeneity in data processing, data privacy, and security advantages. The application of federated learning in fault diagnosis has been getting more attention in recent days, and this study is a review of FL applications that address fault diagnosis in rotating machinery in the first phase. A comparison between the types of FL approaches in FD and the use of aggregation algorithms and their applications will also be discussed in Phase 1. In phase 2, a novel methodology has been proposed using Federated learning to diagnose rotating machinery faults. The proposed method, FLOACOS, addresses how prediction challenges are solved using federated learning approaches by optimizing and standardizing the data at local facilities. This work will be helpful for future condition monitoring researchers and gives an overview of a novel method of the FL technique used in predicting faults and the progress made in the maintenance management of rotating machinery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d93a960c57088a3ba6a83a7f71f98d8afb110fbbfdec7d5d022becb0f9a5656","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
