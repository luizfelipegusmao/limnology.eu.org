It enables quantitative information about the sample and colormaps of the integrated induction to be obtained by reconstructing the phase shift of the transmitted electron wave. Phase reconstruction is commonly performed by solving the transport of intensity equation (TIE), which relates the electron phase shift <span>Ï•</span> to a through-focal series (TFS) of LTEM images. This method is experimentally easy to implement and therefore widely used, though recent work has demonstrated that machine learning-enabled phase reconstruction can reach both a higher spatial and phase resolution given the same input data [<a href=\"#ozae044.504-B2\">2</a>]. Both methods, however, require multiple input images, which makes them unsuitable for in situ experiments that study the time evolution of spin textures. There does a modification of the TIE, known as single image TIE (SITIE), that enables phase reconstruction from some samples [<a href=\"#ozae044.504-B3\">3</a>], but it is only accurate within the small defocus limit and is highly susceptible to all sources of noise.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"de90ac0d7d325adb2900185a433078c51c04d753d4bd13b3aa132180aab592e7","category":"Environment"}
