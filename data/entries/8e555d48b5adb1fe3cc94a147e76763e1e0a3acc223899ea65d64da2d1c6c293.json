{"title":"Research on Operation Optimization of Fluid Sampling in Wireline Formation Testing with Finite Volume Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1205/v1","date":1718702441000,"content":"Wireline Formation Testing is an important technique in the oil field of exploration and development. Not only it can make real fluid samples of the formation directly obtained to know exactly oil existed in formation or not; but it can also show flowing pressure change to see the production capacity of the formation. So it is important measurement for formation evaluation during the drilling process and supports for activities of the exploration and development in the oil field. A numerical simulation model in this article is researched and established based on the Finite Volume Method with considering the influence of sensitive parameters such as reservoir heterogeneity, probe suction area, and mud-filtrate invasion depth during the drilling. The model is capable to design and evaluate for formation fluid sampling operations with calculating hydrocarbon content and flowing pressure. Furthermore, through case application, the performance and effect in the process of Wireline Formation Testing was demonstrated. The results indicate that this technology can be served as an effective auxiliary tool for fluid sampling operations with the function of optimizing fluid sampling measures. It can improve the accuracy of predicting indicators such as hydrocarbon content and breakthrough time during the sampling process. This study provides important backups and technical guidance for professionals in geological exploration and oilfield development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e555d48b5adb1fe3cc94a147e76763e1e0a3acc223899ea65d64da2d1c6c293","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
