{"title":"Analysis of Error-Based Switched Fractional Order Adaptive Systems: An Error Model Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0949/v1","date":1726193980000,"content":"This paper presents the analysis of four error models that can appear in the field of adaptive systems, where adaptive laws for parameter estimation are represented as fractional order differential equations whose order can switch between an order within the range (0,1) and 1. These switched adaptive laws have been proposed in the past few years to improve the balance between control energy and system performance, which is often a challenge when using traditional integer-order or fractional-order adaptive laws in adaptive identification and control. Boundedness of the solutions is proved for all cases, together with the convergence to zero of the estimation/tracking error. Additionally, sufficient conditions for parameter convergence are presented, showing that the excitation condition required for parameter convergence in the vector case is also sufficient for parameter estimation in the matrix case.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"981c0eb5e206c17c37e249797c0f58d787b58b0cef7e426b956948c750e9aa18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
