{"title":"Enzymatic treatment to improve permeability and quality of cherry tomatoes for production of dried products","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13156?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Cherry tomatoes are nutritious and favored by consumers. Processing them into dried cherry tomatoes can prolong their storage life and improve their flavor. The pretreatment of tomato pericarp is crucial for the subsequent processing. However, the traditional physical and chemical treatments of tomato pericarp generally cause nutrient loss and environmental pollution.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, a novel enzymatic method for cherry tomatoes was performed using mixed enzymes containing cutinase, cellulase and pectinase. Results showed that the pericarp permeability of cherry tomatoes was effectively improved due to enzymatic treatment. Changes in the microscopic structure and composition of the cuticle were revealed. After treatment with different concentrations of enzymes, cherry tomatoes exhibited higher pericarp permeability and sensory quality to varying degrees. The lycopene content and total polyphenol content significantly increased 2.4- and 1.45-fold, respectively. In addition, the satisfactory effect of the six-time reuse of enzymes on cherry tomatoes could still reach the same level as the initial effect, which effectively reduced the cost of production.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>This study revealed for the first time that a mixed enzymatic treatment consisting of cutinase, pectinase and cellulase could effectively degrade the cuticle, enhance the pericarp permeability and improve the quality of cherry tomatoes, with the advantages of being mildly controllable and environmentally friendly, providing a new strategy for the processing of dried cherry tomatoes.
