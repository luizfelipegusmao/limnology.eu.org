{"title":"Emerging Roles for Sphingolipids in Cardiometabolic Disease: A Rational Therapeutic Target?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1065/v1","date":1723646020000,"content":"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. New research elucidates in-creasingly complex relationships between cardiac and metabolic health, giving rise to new possible therapeutic targets. Sphingolipids are a heterogenous class of bioactive lipids with critical roles in normal human physiology. They have also been shown to play both protective and deleterious roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. This review will explore the roles of Sphingolipids in vascular, cardiac, and metabolic pathologies and will evaluate the therapeutic potential in targeting Sphingolipids with the aim of prevention and reversal of cardiovascular disease, in order to improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f95ab57b5f4364db6e0c0744b629a5e8b8d28474a2678dd426dda0a8310b463b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
