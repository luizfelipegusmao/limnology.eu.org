{"title":"The Unified Instinct of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Attention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1904/v2","date":1723696107000,"content":"The neural system has limited resources to interact with the environment, and this is where attention comes into play. Attention is a complex process that provides numerous benefits, but there has been a longstanding debate about the mechanisms involved in attentional orientation. Two widely proposed mechanisms are top-down and bottom-up, which relate to the organism's current behavioral goal and the salience of environmental stimuli, respectively. However, distinguishing between these mechanisms can be challenging in both behavioral and neural studies. This review introduces a new conceptualization in which both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms are viewed as aspects of the same process. This unified approach aims to prepare the organism to face stimuli and events based on its prior experiences, immediate (the current task that he/she is aware of), and innate (to be alive) demands.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"441624ac09f7e5814b8fe159bec7c0ef180e095eeda2b39763b1fe57483f13ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
