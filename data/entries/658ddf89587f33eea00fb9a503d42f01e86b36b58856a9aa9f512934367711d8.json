{"title":"PSII-28 Comparative analysis on dietary Quillaja Saponin and/or phytase additive on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal gas emission, and carcass grade in growing- finishing pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/703/7757646?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Quillaja saponin (QS) is a substitute for antibiotics which is obtained from the wood and bark of the soap tree and contains a triterpenoid structural component. It has been demonstrated that QS can increase productivity, boost the immune system, promote intestinal health, and improve meat quality in monogastric animals without changing production costs. On the other hand, phytase (PHY), an enzyme that catalyzes the release of phosphorus from phytate has been used in swine diet for many decades. To date, there are no studies on the analysis of the comparative effect of QS and PHY supplementation in swine. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the comparative effects of low doses of QS and/or PHY on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal gas emissions, and carcass grade in growing-finishing pigs. A total of 72 [(Landrace×Yorkshire) ×Duroc] pigs [initial body weight (BW) = 25.82 ± 1.68kg] were selected and randomly allocated to 3 dietary treatments with 6 replicates of 4 pigs/pen for 110 d. The test treatments were CON-basal diet, and the basal diet supplemented with 0.02% of PHY and 0.01% of QS. Experimental data were analyzed using GLM procedure of SAS and the difference between the treatments was determined using contrast. <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 denotes significance. During the overall experimental period pigs fed a diet supplemented with 0.01% QS supplement showed increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) BW, daily feed intake (ADFI), and reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) gain to feed ratio (G: F) compared with those fed CON and PHY. While pigs fed a diet supplemented with 0.02% PHY had only improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) with no adverse effect on BW, ADFI, and G:F. The results of nutrient digestibility, fecal gas emission, and carcass grade were similar between the test treatments, and no significant effects were found until d 110. In conclusion, instead of adding 0.02% of PHY, adding 0.01% of QS to growing-finishing pig diets would be more beneficial to enhance their growth rate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"658ddf89587f33eea00fb9a503d42f01e86b36b58856a9aa9f512934367711d8","category":"Environment"}
