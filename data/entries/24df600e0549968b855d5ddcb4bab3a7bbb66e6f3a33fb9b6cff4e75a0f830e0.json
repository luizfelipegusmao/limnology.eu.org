{"title":"Conserved transcription factors NRZ1 and NRM1 regulate NLR receptor-mediated immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/832/7597527?rss=1","date":1706832000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant innate immunity mediated by the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) class of immune receptors plays an important role in defense against various pathogens. Although key biochemical events involving NLR activation and signaling have been recently uncovered, we know very little about the transcriptional regulation of NLRs and their downstream signaling components. Here, we show that the Toll-Interleukin 1 receptor homology domain containing NLR (TNL) gene <span>N</span> (<span>Necrosis</span>), which confers resistance to <span>Tobacco mosaic virus</span>, is transcriptionally induced upon immune activation. We identified two conserved transcription factors, <span>N</span> required C3H zinc finger 1 (NRZ1) and <span>N</span> required MYB-like transcription factor 1 (NRM1), that activate <span>N</span> in an immune responsive manner. Genetic analyses indicated that NRZ1 and NRM1 positively regulate coiled-coil domain-containing NLR- and TNL-mediated immunity and function independently of the signaling component Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1. Furthermore, NRZ1 functions upstream of <span>NRM1</span> in cell death signaling, and their gene overexpression induces ectopic cell death and expression of NLR signaling components. Our findings uncovered a conserved transcriptional regulatory network that is central to NLR-mediated cell death and immune signaling in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"24df600e0549968b855d5ddcb4bab3a7bbb66e6f3a33fb9b6cff4e75a0f830e0","category":"Environment"}
