{"title":"Pollutant Dispersion of Aircraft Exhaust Gas during the Landing and Take-Off Cycle with Improved Gaussian Diffusion Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1834/v1","date":1727145911000,"content":"Evaluating aviation emissions and examining the dispersion properties of contaminants are crucial for understanding atmospheric pollution.  To more properly assess the pollutant emissions and dispersion of aircraft during the landing and take-off (LTO) cycle, and to more effectively address air pollution surrounding the airport resulting from flight operations, this study assessed emissions throughout the LTO phase utilizing Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data in conjunction with the first-order approximation method. An improved Gaussian diffusion model for mobile point sources is employed to examine the diffusion characteristics of contaminants. Additionally, CFD calculation outcomes for various exhaust velocities and wind speeds were utilized to validate the trustworthiness of the improved Gaussian model. The discussion also encompasses the influence of diffusion time, wind direction, wind speed, temperature gradient, and particle deposition on the concentration distribution of contaminants. The findings indicated that the Gaussian diffusion model aligned with the results of the CFD calculations. The diffusion distribution of contaminants around airports varies over time and is significantly influenced by atmospheric environmental factors, including wind direction, wind speed, and atmospheric stability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac1e93ff2768e5f79990c821f92c0fb58a8ee1e0962b7ffd9e5f0f4e75f24d94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
