{"title":"The Multi-Scalar Inequities of Climate Adaptation Finance: A Critical Review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40641-024-00195-7","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Purpose of Review</h3>\n                      <p>Following a multi-scalar analytical approach, this critical literature review explores the factors that determine adaptation finance accessibility and allocation with particular attention to how the needs of climate-vulnerable communities are considered.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Recent Findings</h3>\n                      <p>Our review reveals that climate vulnerability is not a primary determinant in the accessibility and allocation of climate adaptation finance at inter-state, sub-national and local scales. Instead, factors such as institutional capacities and financial and political interests exert significant influence. This leads to maladaptation and multi-scalar inequities where climate finance favours relatively resilient groups across scales with less support for more vulnerable populations.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Summary</h3>\n                      <p>We argue that finance does not trickle down, but “ripples” within a climate finance arena – where we define the latter as a messy space of competition, negotiation and collaboration. To unlock equitable adaptation finance patterns, future research should focus on the multi-scalar configurations of adaptation finance beyond the international level and consider local and regional territorial and scalar politics.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"50016a6e862bd4b9267cc5e167d12c6bce804a0df42986ffea91ddf33bcc6b19","category":"Environment"}
