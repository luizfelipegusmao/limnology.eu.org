{"title":"Wildlife resilience in an urban landscape: understanding land-use impacts in Cape Town","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11252-024-01606-1","date":1733011200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Urbanisation is rapidly transforming and fragmenting natural habitats, disrupting ecosystems and negatively impacting biodiversity. The City of Cape Town (CoCT) is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, but sustained anthropogenic activities have resulted in the local extirpation of most medium and large mammals. A recent survey of mammals within urban protected areas of CoCT revealed that a few, mostly medium-sized generalist species, persist. It is uncertain which native mammal species, if any, inhabit the unprotected green belts and parks in suburban and urban areas of the city. A total of 37 camera trap sites were established along four transects for a period of four months between 31 January and 31 May 2022. A total of 12 terrestrial mammal species were detected, nine of which were wild native mammals and three domestic species. Most detections were in natural habitat followed by suburban, with urban areas having the lowest detection rate of wildlife. Single season hierarchical multi-species occupancy models revealed that tree cover had a significant positive effect on both community and individual species occupancy. Contrary to our predictions, neither human population density nor the extent of the impervious surface at sites significantly affected occupancy. Cape grysbok (<em>Raphicerus melanotis</em>) were significantly more likely to occur at sites with a higher proportion of impervious surfaces supporting other recent research, which showed this species together with water mongoose (<em>Atilax paludinosus</em>) and Cape porcupine (<em>Hystrix africaeaustralis</em>) are one of only a few native mammals that appear to persist and may even thrive in human-modified landscapes. Our findings underscore the complexity of urban biodiversity conservation and the species-specific responses to environmental factors, emphasising the importance of tree cover in urban wildlife management.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"4fcdfff44d4d2eba53be9f54f6c9e3ca92839e1bcd17a605cbeb506e790ec97f","category":"Environment"}
