{"title":"280 Feeding a combination of feed additives before and during farrowing of sows reduces inflammation and oxidative stress and increases blood calcium to support uterine contraction","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/176/7665013?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Farrowing is associated with inflammation and increasing oxidative stress status. In addition, during farrowing, calcium requirement increases to support uterine contraction. We have previously observed that feeding a combination of feed additives (FA), that contains inulin, <span>Bacillus velezensis</span>, extracts of olive oil and artichoke, and calcitriol, reduced the duration and assistance of farrowing in sows, and the number of stillborn piglets. It was hypothesized that feeding the combination of FA would reduce inflammation and oxidative stress and provide Ca to support uterine contractions during farrowing. A total of 34 sows from d 107 of gestation until 2 d post-farrowing were randomly allotted (balanced by parity 3.8 ± 2.5) to two treatments: without (control -CON) or with the FA combination (FA, Adicare Vita, 200 g/d). At the starting d (D 107 of gestation) and 24 h post-farrowing, blood samples were obtained to analyze for pig major acute-phase protein (Pig-MAP as an inflammation biomarker) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx as an antioxidant biomarker). During farrowing, sows were monitored, and blood samples were collected at 0 h, 2.5 h and 5 h to analyze for ionized Ca (iCa). Data was analyzed using SAS 9.4. Mean values were calculated using LSMeans statement. <span>P</span>-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant while tendencies were considered at 0.05 ≤ <span>P</span> &lt; 0.10. Pig-MAP and GPx were analyzed using the MIXED procedure and iCa concentrations as repeated measures using the MIXED procedure. Sows fed the FA combination compared with CON sows tended to have decreased post-farrowing Pig-MAP l concentrations (2.52 vs. 4.29 mg/mL, respectively; <span>P</span> = 0.08) and greater GPx concentrations (2,112 vs. 1,588 U/L, respectively; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). FA sows had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) blood Ca concentrations during farrowing compared with CON sows (0.90, 1.10, and 1.01 vs. 0.85, 0.98, and 0.96 mmol/L at 0, 2.5 and 5h, respectively). To conclude, feeding a combination of FA during the last week of gestation might provide antioxidant effects, reduce inflammation caused by farrowing, and increase blood Ca to favor the uterine contractions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"975e5ffeb1d1abab267e0a642813c239a17348498f4c9b1ad6efe73ad3861f0a","category":"Environment"}
