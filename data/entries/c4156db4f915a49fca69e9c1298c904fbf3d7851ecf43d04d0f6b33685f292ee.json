{"title":"Risk factors for critical COVID-19 illness during Delta- and Omicron-predominant period in Korea; using K-COV-N cohort in the National health insurance service","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300306","date":1710424800000,"content":"<p>by Kyung-Shin Lee, Min Jin Go, Youn Young Choi, Min-Kyung Kim, Jaehyun Seong, Ho Kyung Sung, Jaehyun Jeon, Hee-Chang Jang, Myoung-Hee Kim</p>\r\nBackground <p>This study evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Korea, and examined the relationship between severe COVID-19 cases and underlying health conditions during the Delta (September 20, 2021 to December 4, 2021) and the Omicron (February 20, 2022 to March 31, 2022) predominant period.</p> Methods <p>This study assessed the association between critical COVID-19 illness and various risk factors, including a variety of underlying health conditions, using multiple logistic regression models based on the K-COV-N cohort, a nationwide data of confirmed COVID-19 cases linked with COVID-19 vaccination status and the National Health Insurance claim information.</p> Results <p>We analyzed 137,532 and 8,294,249 cases of COVID-19 infection during the Delta and the Omicron variant dominant periods, respectively. During the Delta as well as the Omicron period, old age (≥80 years) showed the largest effect size among risk factors for critical COVID-19 illness (aOR = 18.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.71–22.23 for the Delta; aOR = 24.07; 95% CI = 19.03–30.44 for the Omicron period). We found that patients with solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, unvaccinated, and interstitial lung disease had more than a two-fold increased risk of critical COVID-19 outcomes between the Delta and Omicron periods. However, risk factors such as urban residence, underweight, and underlying medical conditions, including chronic cardiac diseases, immunodeficiency, and mental disorders, had different effects on the development of critical COVID-19 illness between the Delta and Omicron periods.</p> Conclusion <p>We found that the severity of COVID-19 infection was much higher for the Delta variant than for the Omicron. Although the Delta and the Omicron variant shared many risk factors for critical illness, several risk factors were found to have different effects on the development of critical COVID-19 illness between those two variants. Close monitoring of a wide range of risk factors for critical illness is warranted as new variants continue to emerge during the pandemic.</p>","author":"Kyung-Shin Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c4156db4f915a49fca69e9c1298c904fbf3d7851ecf43d04d0f6b33685f292ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
