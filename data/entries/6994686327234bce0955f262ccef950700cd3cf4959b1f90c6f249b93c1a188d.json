Photodynamic therapy uses local light delivery to activate systemically delivered photosensitizer to produce reactive oxygen species, which induce biological changes. Since its initial characterization, VP has required lipids for its delivery as its hydrophobic nature leads to uncontrollable aggregation in biological systems, which can reduce its photoactivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.467-B2\">2</a>]. In recent years, interest in VP has renewed due to its light-independent ability to inhibit Hippo pathway-mediated signaling [<a href=\"#ozae044.467-B3\">3</a>], making cancer cells to be less invasive [<a href=\"#ozae044.467-B4\">4</a>]. Considering significant drawbacks of lipid-mediated drug delivery [<a href=\"#ozae044.467-B5\">5</a>] and new light-independent applications of VP, research to formulate a carrier-free formulation of verteporfin has thus been taking place. This paper reports the study of a nanosuspension of VP and its evaluation of stability in human serum using TEM.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6994686327234bce0955f262ccef950700cd3cf4959b1f90c6f249b93c1a188d","category":"Environment"}
