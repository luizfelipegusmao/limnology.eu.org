{"title":"Pathways to Rural Sustainability: Opportunities and Challenges in the Creation of an Agrotechnological District in Inga&iacute; (MG), Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1162/v1","date":1728977883000,"content":"An agrotechnological district (ATD) integrates sustainable agricultural practices and technologies, aiming to transform rural communities by stimulating socioeconomic development and addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Ingaí, a dairy-producing municipality in Minas Gerais, Brazil, stands to benefit from the implementation of an ATD. This study aimed to identify the opportunities and challenges for the implementation of an ATD in the municipality, considering its socioeconomic characteristics, level of producers' technological adoption, connectivity infrastructure, support networks, rural and market management. Through an exploratory case study, using semi-structured group interviews with agricultural stakeholders, key challenges emerged: limited connectivity infrastructure; ineffective property management; rural family succession problems; barriers in accessing credit; resistance to the adoption of technologies; and dependence on the local government. Opportunities included strengthening of support networks among the agents of rural productive activity; promoting technology adoption by producers; and creating training and rural extension programs. The adoption of these initiatives can stimulate the Ingaí´s economic and social development, generate multiplier effects in its region of influence, and serve as a model for other initiatives in the state of Minas Gerais, the main dairy hub in the country, and one of the primary drivers of Brazilian agribusiness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7dda489aefa8c5e71bb72222faf5c981fc2d8d8034db9f20daee0da1af338855","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
