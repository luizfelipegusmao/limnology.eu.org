{"title":"Development of Epidemiological Research Guidelines for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in Canada","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1571/v1","date":1716466678000,"content":"The Interdisciplinary Canadian Collaborative ME Research Network (ICanCME), established in 2019, aims to foster research in Canada and contribute to finding the causes and possible treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis /chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), thereby reducing the impact of ME/CFS on the health of Canadians. The main objectives of this paper are to suggest standards for ME/CFS research for the collection of data from participants (Recommended Data Elements) and to consider other factors, such as design, language, cultural issues, equity, and diversity. Consensus of the relevant contents of this research guideline was reached during the ICanCME working group meetings and were based on existing guidelines. Members of the working group contributed to guideline development based on their respective expertise. The proposed research guidelines could improve research quality and advance knowledge in the field of ME/CFS, and ultimately benefit ME/CFS patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"957e1b7adcfc055f468779577b446b53d0ae0623d510a006e8a8bc38f7c5f396","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
