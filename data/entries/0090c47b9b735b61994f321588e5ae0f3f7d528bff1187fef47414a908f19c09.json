However, upon alloying with Mg, the polarization can be reversed with an electric field, transforming the material into a novel class of ferroelectrics [<a href=\"#ozae044.594-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.594-B2\">2</a>]. Notably, these materials can be grown at low processing temperatures, including room temperature, making them highly appealing for integration into CMOS-compatible devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.594-B3\">3</a>]. Utilizing transmission electron microscopy techniques, such as electron diffraction, bright-field and dark-field imaging, high-angle annular dark-field STEM, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, we investigate the microstructure and local chemical composition of Zn<sub>1−x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O thin films and heterostructures across various compositions. Fig. 1, for example, shows that Zn<sub>1−x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O grown on {111} platinized Si grows in a columnar morphology with a c-axis growth direction and orientation with in-plane fiber texture. Fig. 2, shows the diffraction contrast induced by stacking faults, which are common defects in ZnO thin films [<a href=\"#ozae044.594-B4\">4</a>]. Even with these structural defects, EDS measurements show that Zn<sub>1−x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub>O films maintain chemical homogeneity up to 35% Mg content in the as-deposited state, which is far beyond the equilibrium thermodynamic solubility. Understanding the thermal stability of these highly metastable samples is essential for their integration into microelectronic devices. Furthermore, 4D STEM experiments employing the center-of-mass technique [<a href=\"#ozae044.594-B5\">5</a>] provide insights into the local electrical fields near electrodes in heterostructured films. The electron microscopy analyses provide essential information for understanding the nanoscale structural, chemical, and electrical properties of these films, crucial for understanding polarization switching in novel wurtzite materials and their thermal stability [<a href=\"#ozae044.594-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0090c47b9b735b61994f321588e5ae0f3f7d528bff1187fef47414a908f19c09","category":"Environment"}
