However, conventional imaging processes [<a href=\"#ozae044.171-B2\">2</a>] are plagued by extended durations, often extending up to 60 days [<a href=\"#ozae044.171-B3\">3</a>]. This manuscript introduces a comprehensive framework that tackles these challenges through the development of a fully automated imaging station, with an emphasis on optimization based on feature size and repetition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0ffd8ab73a179133d4134fbb4254170cbedbeaf085f9655694479f8517dcf140","category":"Environment"}
