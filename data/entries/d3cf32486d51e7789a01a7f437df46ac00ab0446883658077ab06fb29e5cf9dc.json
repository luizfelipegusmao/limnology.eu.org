{"title":"Characterization of polyphosphate dynamics in the widespread freshwater diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum under varying phosphorus supplies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13423?af=R","date":1718080861000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Polyphosphates (polyP) are ubiquitous biomolecules that play a multitude of physiological roles in many cells. We have studied the presence and role of polyP in a unicellular alga, the freshwater diatom <i>Achnanthidium minutissimum.</i> This diatom stores up to 2.0 pg·cell<sup>−1</sup> of polyP, with chain lengths ranging from 130 to 500 inorganic phosphate units (P<sub>i</sub>). We applied energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman/fluorescence microscopy, and biochemical assays to localize and characterize the intracellular polyP granules that were present in large apical vacuoles. We investigated the fate of polyP in axenic <i>A. minutissimum</i> cells grown under phosphorus (P), replete (P<sub>(+)</sub>), or P deplete (P<sub>(−)</sub>) cultivation conditions and observed that in the absence of exogenous P, <i>A. minutissimum</i> rapidly utilizes their internal polyP reserves, maintaining their intrinsic growth rates for up to 8 days. PolyP-depleted <i>A. minutissimum</i> cells rapidly took up exogenous P a few hours after P<sub>i</sub> resupply and generated polyP three times faster than cells that were not initially subjected to P limitation. Accordingly, we propose that <i>A. minutissimum</i> deploys a succession of acclimation strategies regarding polyP dynamics where the production or consumption of polyP plays a central role in the homeostasis of the diatom.</p>","author":"Adrien Lapointe, \nMustafa Kocademir, \nPaavo Bergman, \nImaiyan Chitra Ragupathy, \nMichael Laumann, \nGraham J.
