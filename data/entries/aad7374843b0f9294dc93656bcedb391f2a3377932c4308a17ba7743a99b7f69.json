{"title":"Relationships among the fish passage efficiency, fish swimming behavior, and hydraulic properties in a vertical‐slot fishway","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12681?af=R","date":1714971767000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Three-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical simulation and laboratory fish-passage experiment with juvenile grass carp (<i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>) were used to systematically estimate hydrodynamic parameters, fish passage efficiency, fish swimming behavior, and fish swimming trajectories in a vertical-slot fishway (VSF) under five different flow discharges. The spatial-mean time-averaged velocity magnitude along the slot section determined passage success rate. The absolute value of the time-averaged Reynolds-shear-stress component in the <i>X</i>–<i>Y</i> direction played a decisive role in selecting the swimming path. In addition, fish energy expenditure along the mean-50% swimming route indicated that higher mainstream velocity did not necessarily signify larger energy consumption, because successfully-migrating fish selected the relatively lower velocity zone during the migration process. Our findings for fish swimming behavior in response to velocity and turbulence can be used to develop high-efficiency fishways for grass carps or other species with similar traits.</p>","author":"Di Zhang, \nYuanhui Xu, \nJun Deng, \nXiaotao Shi, \nYakun Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"aad7374843b0f9294dc93656bcedb391f2a3377932c4308a17ba7743a99b7f69","category":"Environment"}
