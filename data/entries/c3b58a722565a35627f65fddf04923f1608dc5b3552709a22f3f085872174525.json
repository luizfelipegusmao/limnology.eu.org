{"title":"A Liquid Well Barrier Element for Temporary Plug &amp;amp; Abandonment Operations: A Breakthrough Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0572/v1","date":1723112680000,"content":"Plug and abandonment (P&amp;amp;A) operations demand valuable time and resources with operational procedures and materials to establish the well barrier element. This study proposes the use of a water-based fluid as a liquid well barrier element for temporary abandonment, based on esti-mates of its lifespan and survival probability on downhole conditions acquired through acceler-ated life tests. For that, the water-based formulation was tested and exposed to 95, 110, 140 and 150°C, for time intervals ranging from 1 to 10 days. After temperature exposure, the fluid prop-erties were verified and failure was detected by accounting for any deterioration in rheological parameters and/or a substantial increase in filtrate volume. Statistical analysis of failure data was performed in R software using Weibull Model, and fluid average lifespan and survival probability were estimated for P&amp;amp;A temperatures. The results obtained demonstrates that the degradation of the fluid only was observed for 140 and 150°C and is mostly related to the CMC deterioration. The reliability metrics shows that until 80°C the fluid is a promising alternative for temporary abandonment, with no need of monitoring. For higher downhole temperatures, theses metrics should be considered to define the maximum time of operation and requirements for monitoring management in the operation design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3b58a722565a35627f65fddf04923f1608dc5b3552709a22f3f085872174525","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
