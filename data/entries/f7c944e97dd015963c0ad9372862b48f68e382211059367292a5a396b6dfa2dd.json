{"title":"Current Knowledge and Regulatory Framework on the Use of Hyaluronic Acid for Aesthetic Injectable Skin Rejuvenation Treatments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0883/v1","date":1710489243000,"content":"Dermal injections of hyaluronic acid gel for aesthetic skin rejuvenation are increasingly popular nowadays. Although these products are classified as medical devices, the regulations on their administration by licensed practitioners are still weak, whereas their manufacturers increasingly highlight and advertise the cellular effects that underpin the efficacy of these injections. In this re-view, we discuss all current knowledge on the mode of action of dermally injected hyaluronic acid and the potential toxicological implications especially from crosslinked gels in conjunction with the current global regulations. We conclude that dermal injections of hyaluronic acid have several therapeutic implications that warrant further research, and that strict regulations must be applied on their manufacture/quality control and the required qualifications of licensed aesthetic injectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7c944e97dd015963c0ad9372862b48f68e382211059367292a5a396b6dfa2dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
