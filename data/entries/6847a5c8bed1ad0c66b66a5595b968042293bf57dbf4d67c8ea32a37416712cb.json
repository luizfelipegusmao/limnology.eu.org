{"title":"Housing conditions in European one-person households","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303295","date":1715954400000,"content":"<p>by Marlena Piekut</p>\r\n\r\nThis study addresses the satisfaction of housing-related needs in single-person households across European countries. The primary objective is to assess the housing satisfaction of single-person households in European countries, specifically within the Visegrad Group. The study seeks to identify trends in housing conditions, create a ranking of countries based on these conditions, and categorize countries with similar levels of unmet housing needs. The study employs statistical measures and methods to achieve its objectives. Time series are constructed for European countries, and linear trends are analyzed to identify statistically significant changes in selected housing aspects from 2005 to 2022. Various research tasks, including ranking countries and grouping them based on housing conditions, are accomplished using established methods like linear ranking and Wardâ€™s cluster analysis. Key findings include significant variations in financial burdens related to housing costs, thermal comfort, environmental pollution, and safety issues across European countries. The study reveals both improvements and challenges in housing conditions from 2005 to 2022 in one-person households. For instance, financial stress due to housing costs decreased in some countries, while thermal comfort issues improved in several nations. The results also highlight the heterogeneity within the Visegrad Group. The study concludes that there is a need for targeted actions to address housing-related issues in single-person households. The findings underscore the importance of investments in building energy efficiency, initiatives for affordable housing construction, and environmental policies. The research emphasizes the impact of housing conditions on health, well-being, and overall community life, urging policymakers to consider these factors for holistic improvement in the housing sector.","author":"Marlena Piekut","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6847a5c8bed1ad0c66b66a5595b968042293bf57dbf4d67c8ea32a37416712cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
