{"title":"Rapid, Selective, and Ultra-Sensitive Electronic Field Effect Detection of Escherichia coli","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1630/v1","date":1719211430000,"content":"We report the detection of live Escherichia coli (E. coli) in liquid samples using a biosensor based on a field effect transistor (FET) biosensor with B/N co-coped graphene oxide (GO) gel (BN-GO) as the transducer material. The FET was functionalized with antibodies to detect E. coli K12 O-antigens in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The biosensor detected the presence of planktonic E. coli bacterial cells within a mere 2 minutes. The biosensor exhibited a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 cells per sample, which can be extrapolated to a limit of detection at the level of a single cell per sample and a detection range of at least 10â€“ 108 CFU/mL. The selectivity of the biosensor for E. coli was demonstrated using Bacillus thuringiensis (B. thuringiensis) as a sample contaminant. We also present a comparison of our functionalized BN-GO FET biosensor with established detection methods of E. coli k12 bacteria, as well as with state-of-the-art detection mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f39f5926b12047416b86a4993b5d575e3811e4eeaa6ec7335d38b218b292de6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
