{"title":"Why Should Diabetes Women Be Active?- the Role of Personality, Self-Esteem, Body- Esteem and Imagery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1079/v1","date":1710828167000,"content":"Diabetes is one of the fastest spreading diseases of civilisation in the 21st century. The aim of the study was twofold: 1) to find differences in personality traits, self-esteem, body- esteem, and imagery betweenÂ healthy women and women with diabetes 2) to check whether there are differences in analyzed factors in women with diabetes who participate in sports compared to women who do not. We used 3 questionnaires: Imagination: in sport - short form, Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and BFIS Personality, which were tested online. We found that women with diabetes were characterised by significantly higher neuroticism and lower extraversion and higher conscientiousness (marginally significant). We also found that women with diabetes who practice sport rated their bodies more highly in terms of sexual attractiveness and made better use of imagined affirmations than healthy women who were not active. Our study provides new insights into diabetics in terms of coping with the disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b713f4fc7d845c8014aab1bf24bdbf97755877ebb07d705105bec6214820e67d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
