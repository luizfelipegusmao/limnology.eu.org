{"title":"Design of a Novel Multiepitope Vaccine against Glioblastoma by In-Silico Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2058/v1","date":1724918278000,"content":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, with a median survival rate of less than two years. Currently, there is no cure for GBM, underscoring the urgent need for innovative treatment approaches. Vaccine design emerges as a crucial strategy, offering a safe and effective means for both preventive and therapeutic interventions against GBM. In this study, we targeted four GBM-associated mutated surface proteins—urokinase plasminogen activator sur-face receptor (PLAUR), integrin beta-3 (ITGB3), and the B-41 alpha chain (HLA-B) and A-24 alpha chain (HLA-A) of the HLA class I histocompatibility antigens—to design a peptide-based vaccine. The vaccine construct includes cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and T helper cell (Th cell) epitopes, and was meticulously evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. The results indicate that the vaccine is antigenic and non-allergenic, making it a promising candidate. Additionally, the physico-chemical properties of the vaccine suggest stability and suitability for further de-velopment. Immune simulation studies predict efficient immune responses upon vaccine ad-ministration. Our vaccine shows promise as a potential tool in the fight against GBM, offering new hope for patients facing this devastating disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc966c8ad8bf4290ef6b502048eb3c8c39672722b5b6649707a4a5be78eb681c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
