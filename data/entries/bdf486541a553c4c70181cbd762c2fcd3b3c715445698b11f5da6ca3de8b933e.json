{"title":"Synergistic Effects of Graphene Oxide and Nanocellulose on Water-Based Drilling Fluids: Improved Filtration and Shale Stabilization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1496/v1","date":1729254744000,"content":"Shale formations pose significant challenges to traditional drilling fluids, including issues such as fluid invasion, cutting dispersion, and shale swelling, which contribute to wellbore instability. While oil-based drilling fluids (OBM) effectively address these challenges, concerns over their environmental impact and cost limit their widespread adoption. Nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising frontier in enhancing the performance of water-based drilling fluids (WBDFs) in shale applications. This study explores the potential of Graphene Oxide (GO) modified with Nanocellulose (NC) in comparison to WBDFs with and without non-modified GO additives. The combination of GO and NC is chosen for its synergistic effects: GO provides enhanced mechanical strength and barrier properties, while NC serves to stabilize the dispersion and improve compatibility with WBDF matrices. The modification with NC aims to optimize the interaction between GO and the drilling fluid components, enhancing performance in shale inhibition and fluid loss control.\nThe research involved the successful synthesis and characterization of a GO/NC nanocomposite, which underwent examination through FTIR, PSD, and SEM analyses. Also we evaluated the filtration properties of water-based drilling fluids (WBDF) enhanced with a graphene oxide/nanocellulose (GO/NC) nanocomposite and compared the results to conventional WBDF. Filtration performance was assessed under both low-temperature low-pressure (LTLP) and high-temperature high-pressure (HTHP) conditions, and contact angle measurements were conducted to examine the wettability of shale. The results demonstrated that incorporating GO/NC into the WBDF reduced filtrate volume by 17% under LTLP conditions and by 23.75% under HTHP conditions, indicating a significant improvement in filtration control. Furthermore, the GO/NC-WBDF increased the hydrophobicity of the shale, as shown by a 61Â° increase in contact angle. These findings suggest that GO/NC enhances the performance of WBDF by reducing fluid loss and improving wellbore stability, particularly in unconventional shale formations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdf486541a553c4c70181cbd762c2fcd3b3c715445698b11f5da6ca3de8b933e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
