Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis, X-ray diffraction, ICP-MS, and Raman spectroscopy were used in this study. High concentrations and a wide range of rare and rare-earth elements were found in siliceous rocks. Silicates (quartz, moganite, and opal-crystobalite/tridymite opal), oxides (hematite and anatase), hydroxides (goethite), carbonates (calcite with Fe and Mn impurities), sulfates (barite with Sr impurity and gypsum), sulfides (pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, and chalcocite), phosphates (xenotime-Y, YPO<sub>4</sub> with impurities of lanthanides, S, Ca, and As; berlinite, AlPO<sub>4</sub> with the V impurity), and apatite were identified. Structures of anatase replacement by quartz often in association with pyrite were identified. The mineralization of SKC siliceous rocks reflects the physicochemical specificity of deep metal-bearing solutions.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"bf61b86760463eb62a9467453714f9f6690b807cb7bbba13f35af7594e1844b6","category":"Environment"}
