However, high energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) has recently been used to measure both the curvature and velocity of individual grain boundaries in polycrystalline Ni [<a href=\"#ozae044.218-B1\">1</a>], SrTiO<sub>3</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.218-B2\">2</a>], and Î±-Fe [<a href=\"#ozae044.218-B3\">3</a>] during grain growth. Surprisingly, no correlation is found between the measured velocity and curvature.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6c09d50cb50c5d0759ee890fb7160b06ca15919c44fca1c3805e59dc7249855b","category":"Environment"}
