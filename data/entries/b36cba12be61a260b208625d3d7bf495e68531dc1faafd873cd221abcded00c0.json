{"title":"CLUSTERDC: A New Density-Based Clustering Algorithm and its Application in a Geological Material Characterization Workflow","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11053-024-10379-5","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The ore and waste materials extracted from a mineral deposit during the mining process can have significant variations in their physical and chemical characteristics. The current approaches to geological material characterization are often subjective and usually involve a significant human workload, as there is no optimized, well-defined, and robust methodology to perform this task. This paper proposes a robust, data-driven workflow for geological material characterization. The methodology involves selecting relevant features as a starting point to discriminate between material types. The workflow then employs a robust, state-of-the-art nonlinear dimension reduction (DR) algorithm when the dataset is multidimensional to obtain a two-dimensional embedding. From this two-dimensional embedding, a kernel density estimation (KDE) function is derived. Subsequently, a new clustering algorithm, named ClusterDC, is employed to generate clusters from the KDE function, accurately reflecting geological material types while achieving scalable clustering performance on large drillhole datasets. ClusterDC is a density-based clustering algorithm capable of delineating and ranking high-density zones corresponding to clusters of data samples from a two-dimensional KDE function. The algorithm reduces subjectivity by automatically determining optimal cluster numbers and minimizing reliance on hyperparameters. It also offers hierarchical and flexible clustering, allowing users to group or split clusters, optimally reassign data samples, and identify cluster core points as well as potential outliers. Two case studies were carried out to test the algorithm and demonstrate its application to geochemical drill-core assay data. The results of these case studies demonstrate that the application of ClusterDC in the presented workflow supports the characterization of geological material types based on multi-element geochemistry and thus has the potential to help mining companies optimize downstream processes and mitigate technical risks by improving their understanding of their orebodies.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"b36cba12be61a260b208625d3d7bf495e68531dc1faafd873cd221abcded00c0","category":"Environment"}
