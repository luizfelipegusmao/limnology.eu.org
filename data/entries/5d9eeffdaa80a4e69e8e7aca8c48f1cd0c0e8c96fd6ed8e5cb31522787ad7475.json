{"title":"The Control of Septin Dynamics for Budding Yeast Cytokinesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2333/v1","date":1722316027000,"content":"Cytokinesis, the process by which the cytoplasm divides to generate two daughter cells after mitosis, is a crucial stage of the cell cycle. Successful cytokinesis must be coordinated with chromosome segregation and requires the fine orchestration of several processes, such as constriction of the actomyosin ring, membrane reorganisation, and, in fungi, cell wall deposition. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as budding yeast, septins play a pivotal role in the control of cytokinesis by assisting the assembly of the cytokinetic machinery at the division site and controlling its activity. Yeast septins form a collar at the division site that undergoes major dynamic transitions during the cell cycle. This review will discuss the functions of septins in yeast cytokinesis, their regulation and the implications of their dynamic remodelling for cell division.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d9eeffdaa80a4e69e8e7aca8c48f1cd0c0e8c96fd6ed8e5cb31522787ad7475","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
