{"title":"The cochlear hook region detects harmonics beyond the canonical hearing range","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae280/7712567?rss=1","date":1720742400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ultrasound, or sound at frequencies exceeding the conventional range of human hearing, is not only audible to mice, microbats, and dolphins, but also creates an auditory sensation when delivered through bone conduction in humans. Although ultrasound is utilized for brain activation and in hearing aids, the physiological mechanism of ultrasonic hearing remains unknown. In guinea pigs, we found that ultrasound above the hearing range delivered through ossicles of the middle ear evokes an auditory brainstem response and a mechano-electrical transduction current through hair cells, as shown by the local field potential called the cochlear microphonic potential (CM). The CM synchronizes with ultrasound, and like the response to audible sounds is actively and nonlinearly amplified. In vivo optical nano-vibration analysis revealed that the sensory epithelium in the hook region, the basal extreme of the cochlear turns, resonates in response both to ultrasound within the hearing range and to harmonics beyond the hearing range. The results indicate that hair cells can respond to stimulation at the optimal frequency and its harmonics, and the hook region detects ultrasound stimuli with frequencies more than two octaves higher than the upper limit of the ordinary hearing range.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"c0dfef913194148f49178cf5a8592c40ca89274a27e7c1eaf9719cc613ae814c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
