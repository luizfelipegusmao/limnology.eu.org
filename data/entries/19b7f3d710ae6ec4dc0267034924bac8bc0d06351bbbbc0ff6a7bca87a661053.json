{"title":"Exorbital Lacrimal Gland Ablation and Regrafting Induce Local, Corneal and Trigeminal Ganglion Inflammation but Not Regeneration or Dry Eye","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2020/v1","date":1714525121000,"content":"The study evaluated the regenerative responses of the lacrimal functional unit (LFU) after Lacrimal Gland (LG) ablation. The LG of Wistar rats were submitted to G1) partial LG ablation, G2) partial ablation and transplantation of an allogeneic LG, or G3) total LG ablation, (n=7-10/group). The eye wipe test, slit-lamp image, tear flow, and histology were evaluated. RT-PCR analyzed inflammatory and proliferation mediators. The findings were compared to naïve controls after 1 and 2 months (M1 and M2). G3 presented increased corneal sensitivity, and the 03 groups have shown corneal neovascularization. Histology revealed changes in LG, and corneal inflammation. In the LG, there was an increase in MMP-9 mRNA of G1 and G2 at M1 and M2 and RUNX-1 at M1 and M2 in G1 and RUNX-3 mRNA at M1 in G1, and in G2 at M2. TNF-α mRNA rose in the corneas of G1 and G2 at M2. There was an increase in the IL-1β mRNA in the Trigeminal Ganglion of G1 at M1. Without changes in tear flow or evidence of LG regeneration, LG ablation or grafting are unreliable models for dry eye or LG repair in rats. The surgical manipulation extended inflammation to the LFU.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19b7f3d710ae6ec4dc0267034924bac8bc0d06351bbbbc0ff6a7bca87a661053","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
