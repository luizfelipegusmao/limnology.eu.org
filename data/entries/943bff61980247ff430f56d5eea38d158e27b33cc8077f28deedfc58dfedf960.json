{"title":"Evolutionary Trends in Decision Sciences Education Research From Simulation and Games to Data Analytics and Generative Artificial Intelligence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1294/v1","date":1721111422000,"content":"Decision sciences (DSC) involve studying complex dynamic systems and processes to aid informed choices subject to constraints in uncertain conditions. It integrates multidisciplinary methods, techniques, and strategies to evaluate decision engineering processes, identifying alternatives and providing insights towards enhancing prudent decision-making. This study analyzes the evolutionary trends and innovation in DSC education and research to uncover the transformations over the years. We employ the science mapping method, text analytics, and metadata from bibliographic databases to evaluate thematic and social structures. The results highlight data science methods, including data mining and business/learning analytics as essential components. The evolutionary trends in DSC education and research mirror the development in practice, including technological transformation, computer science advances, and engineering processes. Sustainable education through virtual/online learning also constitutes a significant component of scientific production. The evolutionary trends in DSC education and research highlight innovative pedagogical approaches and strategies, including computer simulation and games ('play and learn'). The current era witnessed generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) adoption (e.g., ChatGPT) in teaching, learning, and scholarly activities amidst challenges (academic integrity, plagiarism, intellectual property violations, and other ethical and legal issues). Future research will implement and integrate AI automatic detection systems to address some GenAI adoption challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"943bff61980247ff430f56d5eea38d158e27b33cc8077f28deedfc58dfedf960","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
