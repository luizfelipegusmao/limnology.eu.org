{"title":"Are we preparing healthy & responsible adolescents? Exploratory qualitative study to understand the health and social issues of adolescent living in Karachi, Pakistan","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003736","date":1729000800000,"content":"<p>by Narjis Rizvi, Sarah Saleem, Jawaria Mukhtar Ahmed, Sayyeda Ezra Reza, Rawshan Jabeen, Saleem Jessani</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to understand the lives of adolescents living in squatter settlements of Karachi, Pakistan regarding their assigned roles and responsibilities, health and social issues, their decision-making process, and mechanism and channels of information. An exploratory descriptive qualitative study design was employed. Purposive sampling techniques were used to carry out Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with adolescents (n = 10, Participants = 190), adolescents’ parents (n = 10, Participants = 180), and In-Depth Interviews of with key adolescent stakeholders (n = 20). Adolescent stakeholder mapping was conducted for enrolling participants. The data were analysed thematically using deductive and inductive approaches. Based on gender norms parents assign specific roles and responsibilities to adolescent girls and boys. Due to societal norms, communication gap exists between adolescents and their parents. The most popular information channels are social media platforms and friends. Adolescents reported being subjected to a variety of physical, sexual, mental, social, and environmental pressures. Lack of guidance from parents, inadequate knowledge and skills to deal with physical, sexual, mental, social and environmental hazards, and misuse of social media lead to risky decisions, injuries, and social instability. This study underlines the urgent need for targeted interventions for addressing gender issues and improving adolescents’ decision-making and life skills. We recommend Behavior Change Communication interventions to dismantle gender stereotypes and support a balanced domestic environment for children’s education and well-being, awareness raising among parents, teachers, and healthcare providers about adolescent risks emphasizing their role in youth guidance, and advocacy for youth-led forums to co-create educational content engaging parents, educators, and health professionals focusing on life skills. These strategies would turn demographic transitions into productive dividends.","author":"Narjis Rizvi","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"8c78c89f533a97de0a613048997d5450523cedeb72082c6c387cb2658f44fea7","category":"Environment"}
