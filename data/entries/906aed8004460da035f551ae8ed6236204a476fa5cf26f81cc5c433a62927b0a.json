{"title":"Causal associations of particulate matter 2.5 and cardiovascular disease: A two-sample mendelian randomization study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301823","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Ye Cao, Yi Feng, Nan Xia, Jiancheng Zhang</p>\r\nBackground <p>According to epidemiological studies, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, making causal inferences is difficult due to the methodological constraints of observational studies. In this study, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine the causal relationship between PM 2.5 and the risk of CVD.</p> Methods <p>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics for PM2.5 and CVD were collected from the FinnGen and UK Biobanks. Mendelian randomization analyses were applied to explore the causal effects of PM2.5 on CVD by selecting single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) as instrumental variables.</p> Results <p>The results revealed that a causal effect was observed between PM2.5 and coronary artery disease(IVW: OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.35, 3.14), and hypertension(IVW: OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03, 1.12). On the contrary, no causal effect was observed between PM2.5 and myocardial infarction(IVW: OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44, 1.22), heart failure(IVW: OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96, 2.47), atrial fibrillation(IVW: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71, 1.48), and ischemic stroke (IS)(IVW: OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.54, 1.77).</p> Conclusion <p>We discovered that there is a causal link between PM2.5 and coronary artery disease and hypertension in the European population, using MR methods. Our discovery may have the significance of public hygiene to improve the understanding of air quality and CVD risk.</p>","author":"Ye Cao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"906aed8004460da035f551ae8ed6236204a476fa5cf26f81cc5c433a62927b0a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
