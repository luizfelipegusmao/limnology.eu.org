Diamond and cubic boron nitride (c-BN) are ultrawide-bandgap materials that can dissipate the heat due to their intrinsic thermal conductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.546-B1\">1</a>]. Combination of single crystalline diamond (SCD) and c-BN will allow us to use them in thermal regulation, as diodes or insulators in the high-power semiconductor technologies [<a href=\"#ozae044.546-B1\">1</a>], [<a href=\"#ozae044.546-B2\">2</a>]. However, epitaxial growth of c-BN on top of diamond remains a challenge due to complex kinetics of this process, long and costly process of substrate polishing and functionalization, and existing strains between the diamond and c-BN interfaces. In this work, we are demonstrating the results of c-BN grown on top of SCD via pulse laser deposition (PLD). We analyze the change in lattice constants around the interface, calculate the strain distribution, and use negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, applied to electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) elemental maps and signals, to distinguish c-BN layer from the mixed phase area around it.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"925ca18c0b244c5b4e9629b4b43a3f9c6663f1f87fd035abdd51781653327652","category":"Environment"}
