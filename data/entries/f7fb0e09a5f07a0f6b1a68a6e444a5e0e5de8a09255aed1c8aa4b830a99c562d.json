{"title":"Dynamics of Team Based Learning in Molecular Biology: Insights and Reflections from Undergraduate Medical Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2537/v1","date":1722408387000,"content":"The objective of the study was to investigate the dynamics of collaborative learning in TBL through students’ reflections and feedback. The study utilized a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data collection was done via feedback structured questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected from reflections submitted by 107 first-year MBBS students at the end of TBL session. We found five main themes related to students’ engagement with the session i.e. ( 1) conceptual clarity as the foundation, (2) collaborative learning culture, (3) communication skills, (4) informative and useful team discussions and (5) interactive learning for team development. The majority of the respondents (93%) listened to classmates and coordinated with group members in discussion, (77%)  were willing to learn from other group members and contributed ideas to them, (79%) came prepared for session, (75%) found learning material assigned to them as appropriate. Respondents had positive perceptions regarding their participation in group work with a strong inclination towards agreement with the statements provided. The study highlights the positive effects of TBL in promoting peer to peer engagement, active engagement, teamwork skills, and knowledge sharing among undergraduate medical students, ultimately contributing to an effective learning experience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7fb0e09a5f07a0f6b1a68a6e444a5e0e5de8a09255aed1c8aa4b830a99c562d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
