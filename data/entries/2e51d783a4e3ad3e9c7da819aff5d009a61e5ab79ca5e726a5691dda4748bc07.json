{"title":"Role of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway on infection of <i>Francisella novicida</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310120","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Sonoko Matsumoto, Takashi Shimizu, Akihiko Uda, Kenta Watanabe, Masahisa Watarai</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Francisella tularensis</i> is a causative agent of the zoonotic disease tularemia, and is highly pathogenic to humans. The pathogenicity of this bacterium is largely attributed to intracellular growth in host cells. Although several bacterial factors important for the intracellular growth have been elucidated, including the type VI secretion system, the host factors involved in the intracellular growth of <i>F</i>. <i>tularensis</i> are largely unknown. To identify the host factors important for <i>F</i>. <i>tularensis</i> infection, 368 compounds were screened for the negative regulation of <i>F</i>. <i>tularensis</i> subsp. <i>novicida</i> (<i>F</i>. <i>novicida</i>) infection. Consequently, 56 inhibitors were isolated that decreased <i>F</i>. <i>novicida</i> infection. Among those inhibitors, we focused on cucurbitacin I, an inhibitor of the JAK2/ STAT3 pathway. Cucurbitacin I and another JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, Stattic, decreased the intracellular bacterial number of <i>F</i>. <i>novicida</i>. However, these inhibitors failed to affect the cell attachment or the intrasaccular proliferation of <i>F</i>. <i>novicida</i>. In addition, treatment with these inhibitors destabilized actin filaments. These results suggest that the JAK2/STAT3 pathway plays an important role in internalization of <i>F</i>. <i>novicida</i> into host cells through mechanisms involving actin dynamics, such as phagocytosis.","author":"Sonoko Matsumoto","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2e51d783a4e3ad3e9c7da819aff5d009a61e5ab79ca5e726a5691dda4748bc07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
