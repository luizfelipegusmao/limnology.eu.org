{"title":"Assessment of Procrastination Levels and Demographic Associations Among Nursing Students in Bengaluru Colleges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1561/v1","date":1726803889000,"content":"Procrastination among students in higher education is a widely recognized problem, with significant effects on academic performance and personal well-being. This descriptive study aims to assess the level of procrastination among nursing students in Bengaluru and determine the association between procrastination and selected demographic variables, such as age, gender, and parental education. A total of 100 nursing students from Sneha College of Nursing participated in the study. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and a 16-item procrastination scale. The results revealed that 55% of the students had low levels of procrastination, while 45% exhibited high levels. However, no significant association was found between procrastination and demographic variables like age, gender, religion, year of study, or parental education. The findings suggest that while procrastination is a common issue among nursing students, demographic variables may not be reliable predictors of procrastination behavior. These results call for interventions to improve time management and reduce procrastination among nursing students to enhance their academic outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33c2b5b74ab981dd0c6b5a4342f70fa1fe86836b9cdebac5899fb6ec3e159da2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
