{"title":"Analyzing Green/Open Space Accessibility by Using GIS in Kyrenia Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1626/v1","date":1711467507000,"content":"Green open spaces (GOS) are well known to be vital to enhancing the standard of living conditions in urban environments. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is important to have at least nine square meters per citizen. The European Environment Agency (EEA) stipulates that 5000 square meters of green space will be reachable within 300 meters to residents. GOS pattern in Kyrenia Region is not adequate or successful in that regard. The process of urban planning has been neglected in the Kyrenia region and these areas have lost their significance and value. This research evaluates the level of accessibility of green spaces in Kyrenia Region. Three urban areas, Kyrenia, Karavas and Agios Epiktitos have been analyzed within this framework. In order to do that, GOS areas and their pattern are researched by deploying geographical information analysis. Accessibility to these areas is measured by using Euclidean and network distance analysis based on 300, 800 and 5000 meters. Mainly, Euclidean distance and network distance methods are measured from building units and results showing accessibility values are constructed. According to the results, network accessibility is very low within the study region. Additionally, Kyrenia, Karavas and Agios Epiktitos have shortage in GOS per capita. To offer effective strategies for urban planning, the factors influencing the accessibility and also the usage of GOS are addressed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5479b30c5208721a7c2baa946caeb64846ad588db29f9630a6c054f52585c736","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
