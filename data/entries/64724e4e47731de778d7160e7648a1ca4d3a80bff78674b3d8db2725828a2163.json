{"title":"A Rare Case of Breast Metastasis from a Primary Lung Tumor: Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1852/v1","date":1721798550000,"content":"Breast cancer (BC) is a prevalent malignancy with various subtypes, each presenting unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which comprises 12-17% of breast cancers, is particularly aggressive due to its lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 expression. This case report details the management of a 64-year-old woman with TNBC. Initially presenting with a left breast nodule, she underwent a biopsy that confirmed triple-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Despite negative BRCA genetic testing, her significant family history of cancer and a newly detected right breast lesion led to a bilateral mastectomy. Post-surgery imaging revealed multiple hypodense nodules and a spiculated pulmonary nodule, prompting further investigation. An endoscopic lung biopsy identified a primary pulmonary carcinoma with histological features similar to the breast cancer, indicating the lung as the primary source. This case underscores the complexity of TNBC, the importance of comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, and the need for considering extramammary origins in metastatic cases. The findings emphasize the role of multidisciplinary teams in managing such rare and challenging cases and highlight the necessity for thorough and repeated evaluations in atypical BC presentations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64724e4e47731de778d7160e7648a1ca4d3a80bff78674b3d8db2725828a2163","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
