{"title":"Remote Sensing in Space Analog Missions for Future Life Support Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2138/v1","date":1727388590000,"content":"Human space exploration is evolving, with private and government organizations working to develop the new generation of astronauts and technology for future colonization of the Moon and other extreme locations. The coming decade is promising, which is reflected in a number of emerging habitats to simulate analog missions around the world. Analog missions have always been at the forefront of advancing knowledge and now this method is widely used by space enthusiasts and professionals. The Analog Astronaut Training Center is designed to simulate one of the major challenges of human space exploration, namely isolation with limited resources, and focuses on collecting data based on various parameters such as environment, physiology and psychology. The environmental monitoring of the habitat conditions is remotely controlled, allowing the Mission Control Center to receive the mission data in real time. The data obtained, together with physiological and psychological inputs, allow monitoring of human adaptations to limited resources and sustainable living in extreme conditions. This paper presents an overview of the sensors used and the data collected during organized analogue simulations, which help to optimize the design of future life-support systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7bdceffcbfd0c97ebd995a4f2c8c65996ed5ccd5417d1ea489c7282c35f7ccb2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
