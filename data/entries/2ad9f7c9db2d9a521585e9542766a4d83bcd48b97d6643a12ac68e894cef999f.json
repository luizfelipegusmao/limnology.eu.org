{"title":"Climate Impacts, Changing Patterns of Land Use and Loss of Traditional Fulani Cattle Management Practices: Drivers of Antimi-Crobial Resistance in Kwara State, Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1801/v1","date":1727097479000,"content":"This paper presents a case study of Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria, whose traditional ethnoveteri-nary practices risk being lost as the country transitions to more intensive and enclosed livestock practices. We use a planetary health framing to make visible the value of indigenous practices that are less damaging to the environment, animal welfare and human health. Through ethnographic observation, focus group discussions (FGD) and key stakeholder interviews, we show that the Fulani use a complex system of herbal medicines and traditional herding practices to maintain herd health, manage and treat animal disease when it arises. However, their traditions often sit uncomfortably with commercial farming practices. As traditional Fulani grazing lands are eroded, dispossessed Fulani take employment from businessmen farmers but both parties’ inex-perience with shed hygiene, artificial feed and less environmentally resilient crossbreeds leads to increased incidence of infectious disease. This in turn drives higher use of antibiotics. There is a ‘causal chain’ of underlying drivers that leads, through poorer environmental, animal and hu-man health, to increased use of antibiotics. The antibiotic resistance that emerges from this chain threatens human health now and into the future. Through a planetary health framing we advocate for more respect for Fulani herdsmen and their traditional ethnoveterinary practices as an alter-native to increasing antibiotic use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ad9f7c9db2d9a521585e9542766a4d83bcd48b97d6643a12ac68e894cef999f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
