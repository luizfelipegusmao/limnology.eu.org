{"title":"Flexible females: nutritional state influences biparental cooperation in a burying beetle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae009/7613798?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In species that provide biparental care, there is a sexual conflict between parents over how much each should contribute toward caring for their joint offspring. Theoretical models for the resolution of this conflict through behavioral negotiation between parents assume that parents cannot assess their partner’s state directly but do so indirectly by monitoring their partner’s contribution. Here, we test whether parents can assess their partner’s state directly by investigating the effect of nutritional state on cooperation between parents in the burying beetle <span>Nicrophorus vespilloides</span>. We used a two-by-two factorial design, in which a well-fed or food-deprived female was paired with a well-fed or food-deprived male. We found that females adjusted their level of care in response to both their own nutritional state and that of their partner and that these decisions were independent of their partner’s contribution. We found no evidence that males responded directly to the nutritional state. Males instead responded indirectly based on the contribution of their partner. Our results suggest that parents are able to assess the state of their partner, in contrast to what has been assumed, and that these assessments play an important role in the mediation of sexual conflict between caring parents.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"63de5666e0d9fbf3320b2f42064ad49452dfe06a77c122d79de7533050067172","category":"Environment"}
