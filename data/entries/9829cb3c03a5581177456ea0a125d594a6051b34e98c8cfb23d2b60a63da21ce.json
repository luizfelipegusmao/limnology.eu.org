{"title":"Coupling Fault Diagnosis Based on Dynamic Vertex Interpretable Graph Neural Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0101/v1","date":1714644854000,"content":"Mechanical equipment is composed of several parts, the interaction between the parts exists throughout whole life cycle leads to the widespread phenomenon of fault coupling and the diagnosis of independent faults cannot meet the requirements of the health management of mechanical equipment under actual working conditions. In this paper, the topological structure of graph neural network is used to describe the correlation of coupling faults and multiple fault types are regarded as network nodes respectively. The fault features are fused and extracted by graph convolution to achieve the classification of coupling faults. In this paper, dynamic vertexes are defined in data topology and the parameters of DIGNN classification model are optimized by changing the fault type of dynamic vertexes during training stage. The data is loaded into dynamic vertexes for classification and analysis during testing stage. The one-dimensional vibration data is converted into two-dimensional time-frequency domain data by wavelet transform making the input features of the model interpretable to reduce the uncertainty of model training. The data topology is then fed into DIGNN for fault classification, and GCN's node aggregation gives interpretability to each layer of network data processing. The method proposed in this paper can realize accurate diagnosis of independent faults on the data set, and can effectively judge the coupling mode of coupling faults, which is suitable for coupling fault analysis of mechanical equipment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9829cb3c03a5581177456ea0a125d594a6051b34e98c8cfb23d2b60a63da21ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
