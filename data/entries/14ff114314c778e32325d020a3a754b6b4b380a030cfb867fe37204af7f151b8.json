Typical lattice-averaging methods [<a href=\"#ozae044.655-B2\">2</a>] can improve signal to noise but may present issues when unit cell sizes or ordering are the object of interest. Here we show an analysis of fast large field of view acquisitions that accounts for different length scales of chemical ordering in pre- and post-irradiated FeNiAlTi alloy samples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"14ff114314c778e32325d020a3a754b6b4b380a030cfb867fe37204af7f151b8","category":"Environment"}
