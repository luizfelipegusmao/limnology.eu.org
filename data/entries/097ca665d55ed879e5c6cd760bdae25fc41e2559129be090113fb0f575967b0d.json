This study discovered a new biomarker: elevated mineralization levels of the vertebrae in the caudal region of perch <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>. The study was conducted in northern Sweden in lakes receiving discharges from an iron ore mine and adjacent reference lakes. The field observation was followed up with an egg-hatching experiment showing a similar lake-specific pattern in hatching and deformation frequencies in larvae.</p>","author":"O.
