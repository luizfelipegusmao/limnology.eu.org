{"title":"Protist ubiquitin ligase effector PbE3-2 targets cysteine protease RD21A to impede plant immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1764/7456213?rss=1","date":1701302400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Clubroot, caused by the soil-borne protist pathogen <span>Plasmodiophora brassicae</span>, is one of the most devastating diseases of <span>Brassica</span> oil and vegetable crops worldwide. Understanding the pathogen infection strategy is crucial for the development of disease control. However, because of its obligate biotrophic nature, the molecular mechanism by which this pathogen promotes infection remains largely unknown. <span>P. brassicae</span> E3 ubiquitin ligase 2 (PbE3-2) is a Really Interesting New Gene (RING)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase in <span>P. brassicae</span> with E3 ligase activity in vitro. Yeast (<span>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>) invertase assay and apoplast washing fluid extraction showed that PbE3-2 harbors a functional signal peptide. Overexpression of <span>PbE3-2</span> in <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) resulted in higher susceptibility to <span>P. brassicae</span> and decreases in chitin-triggered reactive oxygen species burst and expression of marker genes in salicylic acid signaling. PbE3-2 interacted with and ubiquitinated host cysteine protease RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 21A (RD21A) in vitro and in vivo. Mutant plants deficient in <span>RD21A</span> exhibited similar susceptibility and compromised immune responses as in <span>PbE3-2</span> overexpression plants. We show that PbE3-2, which targets RD21A, is an important virulence factor for <span>P. brassicae</span>. Two other secretory RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases in <span>P. brassicae</span> performed the same function as PbE3-2 and ubiquitinated RD21A. This study reveals a substantial virulence functional role of protist E3 ubiquitin ligases and demonstrates a mechanism by which protist E3 ubiquitin ligases degrade host immune-associated cysteine proteases to impede host immunity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4c44ec37f4608f94b4fd3647ca4e5cd6416e83eb9c3e3595eea6aa8b03430af2","category":"Environment"}
