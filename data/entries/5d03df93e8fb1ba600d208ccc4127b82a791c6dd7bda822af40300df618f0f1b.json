{"title":"Bacterial and Viral Co-Infections in COVID-19 Patients: Etiology and Clinical Impact","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1995/v1","date":1724814800000,"content":"The risk of a fatal outcome was 41% in unvaccinated patients (p = 0.713), which increased by 2.66% with co-infection with two pathogens (p = 0.342) and by 26% with three pathogens (p = 0.005). Additionally, 50% of ICU patients had a triple infection, compared with only 1.3% in the inpatient unit (p = 0.0029). The risk of death and/or ICU admission was 12 times higher (p = 0.042) with an additional pathogen and increased by 95% (p = 0.003) with a third concomitant pathogen. Regular multiplex testing is important for prompt treatment and targeted antibiotic use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d03df93e8fb1ba600d208ccc4127b82a791c6dd7bda822af40300df618f0f1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
