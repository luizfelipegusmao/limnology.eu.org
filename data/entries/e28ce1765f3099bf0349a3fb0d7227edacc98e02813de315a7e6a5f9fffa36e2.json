{"title":"Resolving fusilier puzzles: The identity of Squamosicaesio marri and Pterocaesio flavifasciata, and a new record of Flavicaesio suevica from the Western Indian Ocean","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15808?af=R","date":1717035889000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A phylogenetic analysis incorporating mitochondrial cox1 gene sequences of members of the family Caesionidae revealed the conspecificity of <i>Pterocaesio flavifasciata</i> and <i>Squamosicaesio marri</i>, which was also supported by the absence of any clear morphological diagnostic characters and meristic counts to separate the two species. Additionally, we provide the first record of the Suez fusilier, <i>Flavicaesio suevica</i>, from outside the Red Sea, based on specimens collected from the Laccadive archipelago, Western Indian Ocean. Together, these results show that the taxonomy, diversity, and distribution of members of the family Caesionidae continue to be poorly known, necessitating a comprehensive range-wide study.</p>","author":"Chinmay Kar, \nRajeev Raghavan, \nAmeen Ummath, \nNaseeba Puthiyaalikom, \nKonham Kakkada Idreesbabu, \nSivanpillai Sureshkumar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"e28ce1765f3099bf0349a3fb0d7227edacc98e02813de315a7e6a5f9fffa36e2","category":"Environment"}
