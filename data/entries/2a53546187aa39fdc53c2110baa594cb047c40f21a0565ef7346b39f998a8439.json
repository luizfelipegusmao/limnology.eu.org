{"title":"Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors for Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas: From Biology to Real-World Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0744/v1","date":1723432024000,"content":"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are being recognized as a potentially effective treatment approach for peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), which is a diverse group of aggressive lymphomas with a bleak prognosis. Recent evidence has shown that HDACi are effective in treating PTCL, especially in cases where the disease has relapsed or is resistant to other treatments, and there are few available options. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that HDACi, such as romidepsin and belinostat, can elicit long-lasting positive outcomes in individuals with PTCL, either when used alone or in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy. They exert their anti-tumor actions by regulating gene expression through inhibiting histone deacetylases, which results in the halting of cell division, programmed cell death, and the transformation of cancerous T-cell, as indicated by gene expression profile studies. Importantly, besides clinical trials, real-world evidence indicated that the utilization of HDACi presents a significant and beneficial treatment choice for PTCL. However, although HDACi showed potential effectiveness, they couldnâ€™t cure most patients. Therefore, new combination with conventional drugs as well as new targeted agents are under investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a53546187aa39fdc53c2110baa594cb047c40f21a0565ef7346b39f998a8439","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
