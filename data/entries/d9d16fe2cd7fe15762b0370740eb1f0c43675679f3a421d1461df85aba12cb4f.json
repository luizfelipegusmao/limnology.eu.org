However, variation in RCO2$$ {R}_{{\\mathrm{CO}}_2} $$ remains a major knowledge gap in terms of its drivers and how it is quantified by the empirical and vegetation modeling communities. Here, we demonstrate that the inter- and intraspecific variation in cumulative leaf respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> efflux at a standard temperature over a night scales linearly with the inter- and intraspecific variation in leaf respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> efflux at the beginning of the night, which will enable easy time integrals of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Leaf respiratory carbon loss decreases independent of temperature as the night progresses. Detailed nighttime measurements needed to quantify cumulative respiratory carbon loss at night are challenging under both lab and field conditions. We provide a simple yet accurate approach to represent variation in nighttime temperature-independent leaf respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> efflux in environments with both stable and fluctuating temperatures, which requires no detailed measurements throughout the night. We demonstrate that the inter- and intraspecific variation in the cumulative leaf respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> efflux at constant temperature, at any length of night, scales linearly with the inter- and intraspecific variation in initial measurement of leaf respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> efflux at the same temperature at the beginning of the night. This approach informs large-scale predictions of cumulative leaf respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> efflux, which is needed to understand plant carbon economy in global change studies as well as in global modeling and eddy covariance monitoring of the land–atmosphere exchange of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>","author":"Dan Bruhn, \nMartijn Slot, \nLina M.
