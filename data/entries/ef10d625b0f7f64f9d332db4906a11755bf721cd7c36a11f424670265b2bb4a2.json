In this work, we model infection spreading in tissue with a delay reaction-diffusion system of equations for the concentrations of uninfected cells, infected cells and virus. We prove the wave existence, determine its speed of propagation and introduce a simplified one-equation model obtained from the complete model using a quasi-stationary approximation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"ef10d625b0f7f64f9d332db4906a11755bf721cd7c36a11f424670265b2bb4a2","category":"Environment"}
