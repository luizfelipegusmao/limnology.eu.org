{"title":"Characterization of Different Mango (Mangifera indica) Varieties of South Punjab","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1020/v1","date":1728886369000,"content":"One of the great and popular fruit produces in tropical and subtropical areas of the world is the mango (Mangifera indica Linn.), stated as the \"King of Fruits,\". Varietal description is a vital constituent of mango enhancement and breeding. Objective of this study was choosing important morphological and biochemical indicators for mangos to serve as future reference points for varietal identification and breeding efforts was another objective. These varieties include Anwar Ratol, Azeem Chaunsa, Alishan, Dusehri, Haiden. The results of this investigation support the hypothesis that there is substantial variance among genotypes depending on physical and biochemical attributes.  South Punjab has a varied germplasm that can be castoff for crossbreeding, and effective exploration will be carried out to fully realize the probable. Description is therefore a crucial prerequisite for initiating a breeding effort.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f706534a3249e04978941a64a06d9760ab620f145c3cd7fe7b5b77e758b111fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
