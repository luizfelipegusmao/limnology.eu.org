{"title":"Factors Affecting the Effectiveness of DIBH (Deep Inspiration Breath Hold) in Patients with Left Breast Cancer.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0024/v1","date":1719824475000,"content":"Deep inhalation breath hold (DIBH) has become a valuable technique in left breast cancer radiotherapy, offering the possibility to reduce radiation exposure to organs at risk (OARs) and minimize the risk of cardiac complications. The treatment method involves patients stopping breathing during irradiation to temporarily distance the heart from the radiation field, reducing potential cardiac and other complications. Research shows that DIBH reduces the radiation dose to the heart and lungs. However, the effectiveness of DIBH is determined by a variety of factors, including the patient's training, cooperation, anatomical features, age and choice of radiotherapy technique. Additionally, cardiovascular risk factors: diabetes, smoking, hypertension can affect the effectiveness and potential complications of DIBH. Moreover, lack of consent, fear, anxiety, depression and comorbid psychiatric disorders disqualify some patients from the DIBH treatment method. Careful patient selection, comprehensive training and optimization of treatment parameters are essential to maximize the benefits of DIBH while minimizing potential side effects. DIBH enhancement techniques, such as IMRT or VMAT, also have an important role to play. The purpose of this review article is to summarize the factors affecting the efficacy and side effects of DIBH in radiation therapy for left breast cancer, with the aim of optimizing its clinical application while minimizing side effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bbf7b80b1ac2027befd7fd9712a818fbe2e8ca2cd5025a3c8c762e9c7e9f48e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
