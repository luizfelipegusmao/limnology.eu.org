{"title":"Open-Source DC-DC Converter Enabling Direct Integration of Solar Photovoltaics with Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer for Green Hydrogen Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1698/v1","date":1721635690000,"content":"Fully sustainable hydrogen production demands renewable energy sources. This study uses an approach that combines solar photovoltaic (PV) systems with minimal batteries to tailor the energy supply to the unique demands of anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers. An open source DC-DC adjustable converter is designed, prototyped, and tested to enable an AEM to operate at its optimum efficiency without disrupting the continuous operation of existing loads. A structured operating schedule is simulated to align PV performance with AEM electrolyzer characteristics. The results show the &gt;90% efficiency open-source converter was able to directly power the electrolyzer while taking advantage of solar energy surplus for hydrogen production.  By strategically scheduling the electrolyzer to maximize output and minimize waste the system only utilizes excess solar energy. By employing this sustainable method, the study highlights a scalable solution that not only enhances the efficiency of hydrogen production, but also promotes the deployment of PV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95dad89e5d535f09b08515f58273b69c257a5810777f39dc117673a68a7406f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
