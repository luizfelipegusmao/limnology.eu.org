{"title":"In Silico and In Vivo Evaluation of Novel 2-Aminobenzothiazole Derivative Compounds as Antidiabetic Agents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2205/v1","date":1725003515000,"content":"Currently, there are several drugs used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, all of them have adverse effects. Benzothiazoles have a broad spectrum of biological activities such as antidiabetic. This study aimed to evaluate in silico and in vivo two series of 2-aminobenzothiazole derivatives linked to isothioureas (3a-w) or guanidines (4a-z) for the treatment of T2D. The ADMET properties were determined in silico from which it was possible to select compounds 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4r, 4s, 4x, and 4y and, with molecular docking, it was shown that 3b and 4y showed high affinity for PPAR gamma (Î”G = -7.8 and -8.4 kcal/mol, respectively). In vivo, the LD50 value was estimated in rat based on OECD Guideline 425, being &gt; 1750 mg/kg for both compounds. The pharmaco-logical effect of 3b and 4y was evaluated in the T2D rat model, showing that after oral admin-istration in equimolar ratio to pioglitazone (15 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, both compounds were able to reduce blood glucose levels (&lt; 200 mg/dL) and improve the lipid profile. Therefore, 3b and 4y could be used in the future as antidiabetic agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a515f089c78304db3a2b0a0576be786ae16f2957ccb79522e8ad03694e6fceb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
