{"title":"Evaluating the 3D printability of pearl millet flour with banana pulp blends","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13389?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Three-dimensional (3D) food printing is a promising method for developing nutritious snack foods with complex and customized structures. In this study, to develop a pearl millet-based snack formulation, the printability of pearl millet flour (PMF) was assessed, without and with the addition of banana pulp (BP), a natural taste and flavor enhancer, at five different levels (PMF:BP of 100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80 and 0:100).</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The water activity significantly decreased with increases in the proportion of BP; higher water activity was exhibited at 100:0 (0.99). The BP proportion influences all the color values (redness: 2–11; yellowness: 17–31.87; total color difference: 2–17). All formulations exhibited shear-thinning behavior (<i>n</i> = 0.02–0.49) and higher hardness (0.2–0.4 N), but not all were printable. A significant decrease in adhesiveness (−0.2 to −0.03 N s) and higher storage modulus (2000–6000 Pa) occurred with an increased proportion of BP. Findings from detailed rheological behavior assessment (static, dynamic and three-interval thixotropy tests) better correlated with trends observed during 3D extrusion printing. The highest yield stress was attained (80 Pa) in the 100:0 formulation. From the thixotropy test, more deformation (&gt;80%) and recovery (&gt;100%) were attained by three of the formulations (100:0, 80:20, 60:40). Overall, the best constructs were obtained (based on the visual sensory characteristics) for the 60:40 formulation printed at 600 mm min<sup>−1</sup> printing speed and 240 rpm extrusion motor speed through a 1.22 mm nozzle.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The findings of this work will provide valuable insights into the development of novel millet-based 3D printed foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Paramasivam Santhoshkumar, \nVijayakumar Raja, \nSanthi Rajkumar Priyadarshini, \nJeyan Arthur Moses","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c522badda54dad88425fea6a47fda4e4226916bbb4fd2aedb2e7f3ffcf328775","category":"Environment"}
