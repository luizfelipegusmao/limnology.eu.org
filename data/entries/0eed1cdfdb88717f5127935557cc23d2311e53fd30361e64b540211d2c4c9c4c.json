Shao</p>\r\nBackground <p>Africa has consistently had the highest prevalence (70.1%) of <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i>, and this has led to significant cases of dyspepsia, gastric cancers, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, most studies have used sero-prevalence, which might not give the current state of the infection. Among the tests, the stool antigen test is simple, quick, and effective. The study aimed to determine the feco-prevalence, endoscopic pattern, and associated factors of <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection among symptomatic adult patients in Northern Tanzania.</p> Materials and methods <p>A hospital-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2022 to April 2023 among adults attending the gastroenterology clinic at Kilimanjaro Chistian Medical Centre. A systematic random sampling was used to select the participants with indications of undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Questionnaires, stool and blood samples, and endoscopy were used to collect variable data. Numerical and categorical variables were summarized into narrations and tables. Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i>.</p> Results <p>The feco-prevalence of <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> was 43.4%. Chronic gastritis (51.1%) was the most common endoscopic pattern, whereas duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers were significantly associated with <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection. Increasing in age (p &lt;0.001) and blood group (p &lt;0.001) were significantly associated with <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection in the adjusted analysis.</p> Conclusion <p>The feco-prevalence of <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> is high in this setting. <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> stool antigen can be used as the initial workup for symptomatic patients before the initiation of proton pump inhibitors. Additionally, due to other causes of dyspepsia, it is advised that <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> stool antigen testing be part of the initial evaluation and esophagogastroduodenoscopy be considered in the absence of other alarm symptoms if symptoms persist despite an appropriate trial of medical therapy.</p>","author":"Ibrahim Ali Ibrahim Muhina","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0eed1cdfdb88717f5127935557cc23d2311e53fd30361e64b540211d2c4c9c4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
