{"title":"Clinical prognostication and immunotherapy response prediction in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using the DNA damage repair‐associated signature","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24155?af=R","date":1713250800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The relationship between DNA damage repair (DDR) and cancer is intricately intertwined; however, its specific role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains enigmatic.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Employing single-cell analysis, we delineated the functionality of DDR-related genes within the tumor microenvironment (TME). A diverse array of scoring mechanisms, including AUCell, UCell, singscore, ssgsea, and AddModuleScore, were harnessed to scrutinize the activity of DDR-related genes across different cell types. Differential pathway alterations between high-and low-DDR activity cell clusters were compared. Furthermore, leveraging multiple RNA-seq datasets, we constructed a robust DDR-associated signature (DAS), and through integrative multiomics analysis, we explored differences in prognosis, pathways, mutational landscapes, and immunotherapy predictions among distinct DAS groups.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Notably, high-DDR activity cell subpopulations exhibited markedly enhanced cellular communication. The DAS demonstrated uniformity across multiple datasets. The low-DAS group exhibited improved prognoses, accompanied by heightened immune infiltration and elevated immune checkpoint expression. SubMap analysis of multiple immunotherapy datasets suggested that low-DAS group may experience enhanced immunotherapy responses. The “oncopredict” R package analyzed and screened sensitive drugs for different DAS groups.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Through the integration of single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data, we have developed a DAS associated with prognosis and immunotherapy response. This signature holds promise for the future stratification and personalized treatment of ESCC patients in clinical settings.</p>","author":"Pengpeng Zhang, \nBing Wen, \nJialin Gong, \nZuo Liu, \nMengzhe Zhang, \nGuangyao Zhou, \nLianmin Zhang, \nZhenfa Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"689e0d9f013a7398a0990e8896ca6c6feaec4099356cfe723f4824232105c085","category":"Environment"}
