{"title":"Metabolic and Functional Interaction of H2S and Sucrose in Maize Thermotolerance through Redox Homeodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1263/v1","date":1716191490000,"content":"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel gasotransmitter, sucrose (SUC) is both cellular energy and signaling molecule. However, their signaling interaction in maize thermotolerance is poorly known. In this study, using maize seedlings as materials, metabolic and functional interaction of H2S and SUC in maize thermotolerance was investigated. Data show that under heat stress survival rate and tissue viability were increased by exogenous SUC, while malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage were decreased by SUC, indicating SUC could upraise maize thermotolerance. Also, SUC-upraised thermotolerance was enhanced by H2S, while weakened by inhibitor (propargylglycine) and scavenger (hypotaurine) of H2S and SUC-transport inhibitor (N-ethylmaleimide). To figure out underlying mechanism of H2S-SUC interaction-upraised thermotolerance, redox parameters in mesocotyls of maize seedlings were measured before and after heat stress. The data display that activity and gene expression of H2S-metabolizing enzymes were up-regulated by SUC, whereas H2S had no significant effect on activity and gene expression of SUC-metabolizing enzymes. Besides, activity and gene expression of catalase, glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and superoxide dismutase were reinforced by H2S, SUC, and their combination under non-heat and heat conditions in varying degrees. Similarly, content of ascorbic acid, flavone, carotenoid, and polyphenol was increased by H2S, SUC, and their combination, whereas production of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide level were impaired by these treatments to different extent. These results imply that the metabolic and functional interaction of H2S and sucrose exists in the formation of maize thermotolerance through redox homeodynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f42f2904dee8cc564805003c388df42f5deb40fd686dd126638b4dd36f9e7657","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
