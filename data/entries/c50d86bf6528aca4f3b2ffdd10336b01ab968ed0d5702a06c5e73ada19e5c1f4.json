{"title":"Indirect Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (iCLEM): A Novel Pipeline for Multiscale Quantification of Structure From Molecules to Organs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/318/7634489?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Correlative light and electron microscopy (<span>CLEM</span>) methods are powerful methods that combine molecular organization (from light microscopy) with ultrastructure (from electron microscopy). However, CLEM methods pose high cost/difficulty barriers to entry and have very low experimental throughput. Therefore, we have developed an <span>indirect</span> correlative light and electron microscopy (<span>iCLEM</span>) pipeline to sidestep the rate-limiting steps of CLEM (i.e., preparing and imaging the same samples on multiple microscopes) and correlate multiscale structural data gleaned from separate samples imaged using different modalities by exploiting biological structures identifiable by both light and electron microscopy as intrinsic fiducials. We demonstrate here an application of <span>iCLEM</span>, where we utilized gap junctions and mechanical junctions between muscle cells in the heart as intrinsic fiducials to correlate ultrastructural measurements from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) with molecular organization from confocal microscopy and single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We further demonstrate how <span>iCLEM</span> can be integrated with computational modeling to discover structureâ€“function relationships. Thus, we present <span>iCLEM</span> as a novel approach that complements existing CLEM methods and provides a generalizable framework that can be applied to any set of imaging modalities, provided suitable intrinsic fiducials can be identified.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c50d86bf6528aca4f3b2ffdd10336b01ab968ed0d5702a06c5e73ada19e5c1f4","category":"Environment"}
