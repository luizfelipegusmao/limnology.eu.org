{"title":"Differences in the Impact of Economic Structure Evolution on Educational Ecological Carrying Capacity: A Case Study of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2109/v1","date":1727355741000,"content":"Basic education is a foundational component of the national education system and human resource development, providing crucial support for the sustainable development of various aspects of human society, including economy, social welfare, and technology. The advancement of basic education is intrinsically linked to national innovation, the well-being of the populace, and the sustainable high-quality development of society. Enhancing the ecological carrying capacity of basic education at the provincial level is critical and pragmatically significant for the coordinated, sustainable, and high-quality development of the region's socioeconomic landscape.Based on panel data from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (hereinafter referred to as Guangxi) from 2013 to 2022, and utilizing the DPSIR theoretical model, a comprehensive evaluation index system has been established. Through statistical analysis and spatial analysis methods, this study explores the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of the ecological carrying capacity of basic education in various regions under Guangxi's jurisdiction. A multiple linear regression model is employed to analyze the differential impacts of changes in economic structure on the ecological carrying capacity of basic education.The findings reveal a steady upward trend in the ecological carrying capacity of basic education across the municipal districts of Guangxi. The development of five subsystems—Pressure, Driving-force, and others—has also become increasingly balanced; however, the impact of each subsystem on the overall carrying capacity varies. From a formation mechanism perspective, the ecological carrying capacity of basic education in Guangxi is the result of the complex interactions of multiple factors, with notable differences in influencing factors at various stages of development.Therefore, to bridge the regional disparities in the ecological carrying capacity of basic education across the different areas of Guangxi, it is essential to adopt a range of measures that promote coordinated, balanced, and high-quality educational development among regions, effectively ensuring the long-term sustainable development of Guangxi's economy and society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce722c937fd3ca66a5540f26a6e49f8afe62db809d70a9e5b3f03a2378834ba1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
