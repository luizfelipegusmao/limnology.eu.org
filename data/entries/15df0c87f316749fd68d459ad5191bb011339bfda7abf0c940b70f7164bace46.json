However, their ecology and behavior remain poorly understood. We investigated site fidelity and social structure of rough-toothed dolphins using photo-identification data collected between 2014 and 2022 in the continental shelf waters of the southwestern coast of Mexico. A total of 133 groups of rough-toothed dolphins were recorded. Mean group size was 4.9 individuals (<i>SD</i> = 4.5), and dolphins were encountered in waters of a mean depth of 110 m (<i>SD</i> = 188). Of 228 individuals identified, 55% were observed once, 39% were seen between two and four times, and 6% were seen five times or more. Site fidelity analysis suggests three levels of site fidelity: transients, occasional visitors, and regular visitors, which are likely to affect the social structure. Through network analysis, nonrandom social patterns were identified (<i>S</i> = 1.25 ± 0.26) and dolphins exhibited both preferences and avoidances of social partners. Cluster analysis suggested significant divisions within the population (<i>Q</i> = 0.43 ± 0.05). Despite limitations related to sample size and design, this preliminary study suggests that rough-toothed dolphins are best characterized by a fission-fusion society, which is similar to most coastal delphinid populations.</p>","author":"Victoria Pouey‐Santalou, \nMichael Weiss, \nEric Angel Ramos, \nJeremy J.
