{"title":"A Comparative Review of Models for All-Solid-State Li-Ion Batteries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1245/v1","date":1710945475000,"content":"In recent times, there has been significant enthusiasm for the development of all solid state batteries. This interest stems from a dual focus on safety—addressing concerns related to toxic and flammable organic liquid electrolytes—and the pursuit of high energy density. \\cite{SCHNELL2018160,Zheng2018}. While liquid electrolyte batteries constitute for now the vast majority of commercial cells, solid electrolyte batteries show great promise.\nIn parallel with experimental research, computational models \\cite{GrazioliEtAlCM2016} clarify the several fundamental physics \\cite{LiMonroeARCBM2020} that take place throughout battery operations.\nWe review some classical models, emphasizing the conceptual advancements documented in the most recent works.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc24f9b74ce93a894af6d082e21f93f6d5a8723d9bac89b33a106dea10d2faa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
