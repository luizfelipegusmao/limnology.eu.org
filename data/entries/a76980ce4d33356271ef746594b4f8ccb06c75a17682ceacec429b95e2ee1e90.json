The purpose of this research is to search for the factors that determine HRD through the implementation of the Internship program among the students of Democritus University of Thrace and reveal the correlation between the factors. Also, this paper investigated the impact of the COVID-19 Eras on Human Resource Development (HRD) Factors and finally, investigated the correlation between the two variables \"Recruitment in the specialization\" and \"Covid Eras\". The sample of the research consisted of 1398 students of DUTh who implemented Internships during the academic years 2015-2016 to 2021-2022. A questionnaire with 60 variables was created for data collection. A random sampling method was applied to collect the sample. From the results of the survey, ten factors were extracted for human resource training that explained 75.512% of the total variance and for each one, Cronbach's Alpha reliability was tested, which was high. In detail, the factors revealed were Learning Outcomes, Efficacy, Emotional Commitment, Satisfaction, Participation, Empowerment, Role Ambiguity, Role Conflict, Supervisor and Collaboration. From the results of the study, it was evident that HR development - training is a multi-dimensional concept and is a necessary condition for the competitiveness of the firms. Training can help to improve the flexibility of the firm, but also to motivate the staff by implementing multidisciplinary training programs. In general, internship programs are valuable ways for students to acquire broad competences, where the practical knowledge gained supports and complements the theoretical studies acquired in educational institutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a76980ce4d33356271ef746594b4f8ccb06c75a17682ceacec429b95e2ee1e90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
