{"title":"Seaweeds as holobionts: Current state, challenges, and potential applications","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13485?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Seaweeds play a strong ecological and economical role along the world's coastlines, where they support industries (e.g., aquaculture, bioproducts) and essential ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity, fisheries, carbon capture). Evidence from wild and cultured seaweeds suggests that microorganisms play crucial roles in their health and functioning, prompting the need for considering seaweeds and their microbiome as a coherent entity or “holobiont.” Here we show that the number of studies investigating seaweed hosts and their microbiome have increased in the last two decades. This likely reflects the increase in the appreciation of the importance of microbiomes for eukaryotic hosts, improved molecular approaches used to characterize their interactions, and increasing interest in commercial use of seaweeds. However, although increasing, most studies of seaweed holobionts have focused on (i) a few seaweed species of ecological or commercial significance, (ii) interactions involving only bacteria, and (iii) descriptive rather than experimental approaches. The relatively few experimental studies have mostly focused on manipulating abiotic factors to examine responses of seaweeds and their microbiome. Of the few studies that directly manipulated microorganisms to investigate their effects on seaweeds, most were done in laboratory or aquaria. We emphasize the need to move beyond the descriptions of patterns to experimental approaches for understanding causation and mechanisms. We argue that such experimental approaches are necessary for a better understanding of seaweed holobionts, for management actions for wild and cultivated seaweeds, and to better integrate studies of seaweed holobionts with the broader fields of seaweed ecology and biology, which are strongly experimental.</p>","author":"Ezequiel M.
