There are two possible precipitation pathways: through the C solubility gradient by cooling, and through the segregation from the intermediate carbide phase [<a href=\"#ozae044.819-B1\">1-5</a>]. In this study, through in situ heating transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we present the graphitization mechanism of stacked Ni and amorphous carbon (a-C) film.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bc36e11121a13f9918b915dfb94b0d3c33cf3ebb7a2569f38348bda038d952f4","category":"Environment"}
