How MYCN orchestrates global gene expression remains incompletely understood. Our study finds that MYCN binds promoters to up-regulate canonical MYC targets but binds to both enhancers and promoters to repress differentiation genes. MYCN binding also increases H3K4me3 and H3K27ac on canonical MYC target promoters and decreases H3K27ac on neuronal differentiation gene enhancers and promoters. WDR5 facilitates MYCN promoter binding to activate canonical MYC target genes, whereas MYCN recruits G9a to enhancers to repress neuronal differentiation genes. Targeting both MYCNâ€™s active and repressive transcriptional activities using both WDR5 and G9a inhibitors synergistically suppresses NB growth. We demonstrate that MYCN cooperates with WDR5 and G9a to orchestrate global gene transcription. The targeting of both these cofactors is a novel therapeutic strategy to indirectly target the oncogenic activity of <i>MYCN</i>.","author":"Zhihui Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"0edebaa8321a8c2a25edfdf03987487b45aaf73d5bdcdd5a38c4d0f042d50bb8","category":"Environment"}
