{"title":"Advanced Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Solar Cells: Enhancing Efficiency and Stability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0002/v1","date":1722506195000,"content":"Perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells represent a significant advancement in photovoltaic technology, aiming to overcome the efficiency limitations of traditional silicon-based solar cells. This paper explores recent developments in the fabrication and optimization of these tandem cells, focusing on improving both efficiency and long-term stability. The combination of perovskite materials with silicon allows for broader spectrum absorption, which enhances the overall power conversion efficiency. Key strategies include optimizing the perovskite layer's composition, improving the interface between layers to reduce recombination losses, and incorporating advanced encapsulation techniques to mitigate degradation from environmental factors such as moisture and UV exposure. The review also highlights the challenges faced in scaling up production while maintaining high performance and stability. Emerging trends in material engineering and device architecture are discussed, providing insights into future directions for making perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells a viable commercial technology. This study underscores the potential of these hybrid systems to significantly boost the efficiency of photovoltaic systems, offering a promising pathway towards more sustainable and costeffective solar energy solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd87ff7c216e385027ec323a589b6937ad6791e58b31bca77bc63295c9209bbc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
