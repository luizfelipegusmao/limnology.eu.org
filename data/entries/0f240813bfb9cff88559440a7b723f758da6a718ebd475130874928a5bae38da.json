{"title":"Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Classify Twitter Sentiments Using Vectorization Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1395/v1","date":1724138641000,"content":"The advancements in social networking have empowered open expression on micro blogging platforms like Twitter. Traditional Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA) faced challenges due to rule-based or dictionary algorithms, dealing with feature selection, ambiguity, sparse data, and language variations. This study proposed a classification framework for Twitter sentiment data using word count vectorization and machine learning techniques to reduce the difficulties addressed on annotated sentiment-labelled tweets. Various classifiers (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest) were evaluated based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Specificity. Random Forest outperformed others with an Area under Curve (AUC) value of 0.96, and an Average Precision (AP) score of 0.96 in sentiment classification, especially effective with minimal Twitter-specific features.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f240813bfb9cff88559440a7b723f758da6a718ebd475130874928a5bae38da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
