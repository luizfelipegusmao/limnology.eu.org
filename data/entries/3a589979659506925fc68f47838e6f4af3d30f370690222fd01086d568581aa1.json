{"title":"3D Microfluidic Channel Development for a Microdosing System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0902/v1","date":1713167805000,"content":"In the last decade, three-dimensional (3D) printing has allowed the field of complex microfluidic channels to expand rapidly towards channels with variable cross-sections (i.e., beyond simple rounded media with a constant diameter) and channels. Whose trajectory can be outside a single plane and has gained numerous macro- and nanoscale manufacturing advances. Three-dimensional printing is being explored for various biomedical applications and the fabrication of nanomedicines using additive manufacturing techniques. Employing 3D-printed templates for macro-to-micro interfacing, a passively operated microfluidic device was designed. The research seeks to fabricate a biodevice that enables insulin microdosing, creating a subsystem like a microvalve and a microchannel matrix using additive manufacturing techniques. Our systems feature designs that enhance fluid dynamics without affecting the stability of the insulin. We propose using Humalog insulin in tropical climates (up to 30°C) without refrigeration for 28 days. The microvalve has a spiral trajectory with four outlet channels distributed along it. These channels align with the microchannels organized in a 10 mm x 15 mm matrix with 25 microchannels, each with a 770 µm internal diameter. The system delivers a dose of 2,3 mL in 6 minutes. We designed these systems for insulin micro-dosing, but they can also serve similar devices for other drugs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a589979659506925fc68f47838e6f4af3d30f370690222fd01086d568581aa1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
