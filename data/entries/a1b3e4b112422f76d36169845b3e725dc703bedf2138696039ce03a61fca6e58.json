Therefore, Schottky-emitter electron gun has been widely used in advanced electron microscope due to its good properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a1b3e4b112422f76d36169845b3e725dc703bedf2138696039ce03a61fca6e58","category":"Environment"}
