{"title":"Salidroside as a Modulator of Bone Metabolism: Insight Into the Active Constituent of Rhodiola rosea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0257/v1","date":1720000005000,"content":"Rhodiola rosea, a perennial herb from the Crassulaceae family, contains the bioactive compound salidroside, recognized as an adaptogen with significant therapeutic potential for bone metabolism. Salidroside promotes osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by activating critical signaling pathways, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, essential for bone formation and growth. It enhances osteogenic activity by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization markers, while upregulating key transcription factors such as runt-related transcription factor 2 and osterix. Additionally, salidroside facilitates angiogenesis via the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, crucial for coupling bone formation with vascular support. Its antioxidant properties offer protection against bone loss by reducing oxidative stress and promoting osteogenic differentiation through the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 pathway. Salidroside's ability to counteract the negative effects of glucocorticoids on bone cells and prevent steroid-induced osteonecrosis, along with its anti-inflammatory properties, enhances its potential in treating conditions like osteoarthritis. These attributes underscore its multifaceted role in bone metabolism. This article reviews the literature, including in vitro and in vivo studies primarily on rodent models, demonstrating salidroside's efficacy in mitigating bone loss, preserving bone microarchitecture, and accelerating fracture healing. Future research directions to explore salidroside’s applications in bone-related diseases are also highlighted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"290543ba03a0920e850f2aadf5c39a7cfbbfce9e7321f55be64500db40e69536","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
