{"title":"Atlantic salmon Salmo salar do not prioritize digestion when energetic budgets are constrained by warming and hypoxia","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15693?af=R","date":1719289824000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>During summer, farmed Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) can experience prolonged periods of warming and low aquatic oxygen levels due to climate change. This often results in a drop in feed intake; however, the physiological mechanism behind this behaviour is unclear. Digestion is a metabolically expensive process that can demand a high proportion of an animal's energy budget and might not be sustainable under future warming scenarios. We investigated the effects of elevated temperature and acute hypoxia on specific dynamic action (SDA; the energetic cost of digestion), and how much of the energy budget (i.e. aerobic scope, AS) was occupied by SDA in juvenile Atlantic salmon. AS was 9% lower in 21°C-acclimated fish compared to fish reared at their optimum temperature (15°C) and was reduced by ~50% by acute hypoxia (50% air saturation) at both temperatures. Furthermore, we observed an increase in peak oxygen uptake rate during digestion which occupied ~13% of the AS at 15°C and ~20% of AS at 21°C, and increased the total cost of digestion at 21°C. The minimum oxygen tolerance threshold in digesting fish was ~42% and ~53% at 15 and 21°C, respectively, and when digesting fish were exposed to acute hypoxia, gut transit was delayed. Thus, these stressors result in a greater proportion of the available energy budget being directed away from digestion. Moderate environmental hypoxia under both optimal and high temperatures severely impedes digestion and should be avoided to limit exacerbating temperature effects on fish growth.</p>","author":"Barbara Nuic, \nAlyssa Bowden, \nCraig E.
