{"title":"Microstructure and Elemental Composition of Coffea arabica L. Roasted Medium of Specialty and with &ldquo;Pluma&rdquo; Denomination of Origin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0234/v1","date":1714975903000,"content":"The state of Oaxaca, Mexico obtained the “Pluma” designation of origin in 2022 and has stood out for the production of specialty coffee. Within its process, roasting is one of the stages that contributes to the physical, chemical and sensory quality of the coffee bean. Therefore, the microstructure and elemental chemical composition of special medium-roasted Coffea arabica L beans from six locations with this denomination were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The average values of roughness Rz (25.93±2.69-34.18±1.15 and 13.85±1.66-21.85±6.63) and Ra (5.20±0.47- 8.27±0.82 and 6.55±0.94-11.53±1.65) were obtained at 400 and 2000x, respectively. The roasted Coffea arabica L. beans from MAP and HUA are the ones with the greatest roughness and both are located at a lower altitude compared to the rest. PLU and PTO roasted beans showed the highest physical and structural integrity. In all grains, 6C (66.48-81.14%), 8O (18.86-28.69%) and only 20Ca (4.5%) were found on the outside. This research constitutes a standard of authenticity and microstructural and elemental quality of Coffea arabica L. beans with designation of origin \"Pluma\".","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca69a66d75436573972baebe442a4ccfbeb94760274bc4b08c6c9b821d6248ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
