{"title":"Phenolic Acid – β-cyclodextrin Complexation Study to Mask Bitterness in Wheat Bran: A Machine-Learning-based QSAR Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0330/v1","date":1717652968000,"content":"The need for solvating and encapsulating hydro-sensitive molecules drives noticeable trends in the applications of cyclodextrins in pharmaceutical industry, food, polymer, materials, and agricultural science. Among them, β-cyclodextrin is one of the most used for the entrapment of phenolic acid compounds to mask the bitterness of wheat bran. In this regard, there is still a need for a good predictive model that assesses β-cyclodextrin bitterness masking capabilities for various phenolic compounds. This study uses a dataset of 20 phenolic acids docked to the β-cyclodextrin cavity to generate three different binding constants. The data from docking study were combined with topological, topographical and quantum-chemical features from the ligands in a machine learning-based structure-activity relationship study. Three different models for each binding constant were computed using a combination of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) approaches. The developed ML/QSAR models showed a very good performance, with high predictive ability and correlation coefficients of 0.969 and 0.984, for training and test sets, respectively. The models revealed several factors responsible for a binding with cyclodextrin, showing positive contributions toward the binding affinity values, including such features as presence of six-membered rings in the molecule, branching, electronegativity values, and polar surface area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03b6572ec221891cd0fa03b45dc8b57201a741935edf0c9ec5b690fa95c9acf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
