We explored public-sector physicians’ experiences and perceptions of the organizational structures and characteristics needed to help them thrive in a resource-limited practice setting. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 24 public sector physicians across Western Area Urban (Freetown), Bo, Kono, and Kambia districts in Sierra Leone. Thematic content analysis was carried out using both deductive and inductive techniques to generate codes and identify key themes. Physicians in Sierra Leone face multifaceted challenges that significantly impact both healthcare delivery and personal well-being. Our findings reveal that overwhelming workload and stringent schedules contribute to burnout, directly compromising patient care quality. The emotional burden of caring for patients with economic constraints in accessing treatment further exacerbates physician stress. Limited resources, such as insufficient medical supplies and personnel, foster a sense of helplessness among clinicians, leading to detachment and cynicism towards their ability to effect change. In the absence of formal institutional support, physicians often rely on peer support to manage burnout. These challenges collectively undermine physicians’ ability to provide optimal care, as the emotional and physical toll affects their decision-making and engagement with patients. Within Sierra Leone’s resource-constrained healthcare context, systemic reforms are necessary to address the root causes of physician burnout, and to improve patient care. Our findings suggest that implementing formal support structures, including counselling services and mentorship programs, is crucial. Improving working conditions through better resource allocation and infrastructure development is essential. Developing strategies to address the emotional burden of care, including robust training programs, could enhance physician well-being, reduce burnout, and consequently improve the overall quality of patient care in Sierra Leone’s public health sector.","author":"Mohamed B.
