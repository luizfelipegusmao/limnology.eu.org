{"title":"Applications of Blockchain and Smart Contracts to address challenges of Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0493/v1","date":1720163991000,"content":"Transportation plays an important role in urban development. Population growth and environmental burden have turned the efforts of cities globally towards smarter and greener mobility. Cooperative and Connected Automated Mobility (CCAM) serves as a concept with the power and potential to help achieve these goals building upon technological fields like Internet of Things, computer vision and distributed computing. However, its implementation is hindered by various challenges covering technical parameters such as performance and reliability in tandem with other issues, such as safety, accountability and trust. To overcome these issues, new distributed and decentralized approaches like blockchain and smart contracts are needed. This paper aims at identifying a comprehensive inventory of CCAM challenges and use it as a framework to describe methodologies using blockchain and smart contracts to address them. It provides a comparative analysis of the findings to draw useful conclusions and discuss future directions in CCAM and relevant blockchain applications. The paper contributes to intelligent transportation systemsâ€™ research by offering an integrated view of the difficulties in substantiating CCAM and providing insights on the most prominent blockchain and smart contract technologies that tackle them.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6bfabbe73ad46f22b7091d90fa3a7eac8878cb2fe8c1877e867e41480038cc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
