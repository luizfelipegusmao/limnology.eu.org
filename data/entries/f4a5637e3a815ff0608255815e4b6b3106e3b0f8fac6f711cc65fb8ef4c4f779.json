{"title":"Visualizing Defects and Amorphous Materials in 3D with Mixed-State Multislice Electron Ptychography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.909/7720039?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>As devices continue to get smaller, reliable and dose-efficient 3D visualization of structures at the atomic scale is ever more critical. Here we show through both simulations and experiments how mixed-state multislice electron ptychography meets this challenge. Moreover, we show that ptychography outperforms both annular dark field (ADF) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) through-focal imaging modes at recovering the structure of both crystalline and amorphous materials in 3D, even in the presence of aberrations and noise. Experimentally, we demonstrate the use of multislice ptychography for imaging crystalline materials, amorphous materials, interfaces in 3D, and buried defects. With a deep sub-Ã… lateral resolution and a depth resolution of a few nanometers, these results enable a new perspective for understanding the formation and nature of defects in materials and the nature of amorphousness in various compounds.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f4a5637e3a815ff0608255815e4b6b3106e3b0f8fac6f711cc65fb8ef4c4f779","category":"Environment"}
