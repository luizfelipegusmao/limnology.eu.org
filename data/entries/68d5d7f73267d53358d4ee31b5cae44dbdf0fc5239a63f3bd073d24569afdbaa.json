{"title":"Analysis and Applications of the Two Phases Closed Thermosyphon Technology in the Highways in Permafrost Regions: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0121/v1","date":1712037073000,"content":"Permafrost covers about 23% ~ 25% of the land in the northern hemisphere, mainly in Russia, Canada, Alaska, Northeast and Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP) in China. Many engineering especially the transportation has been in the permafrost regions above. Under the action of highways construction and global warming, permafrost under infrastructures is degraded and causes serious damage. Two phases closed thermosyphon (TPCT) is a widely accepted green countermeasure against the problem in permafrost regions. Although it has been applied to prevent permafrost degradation, their application presents significant challenges on account of the stronger endothermic action of asphalt pavement. This paper focused on the thermosyphon technology and application in the permafrost. Moreover, the article highlighted the excellent working performance of the TPCT that improving the stability of the infrastructures and prevent it degrading due its excellent efficiency of heat transfer. The industrial applications of the TPCT were also summarized, along with their limitations. Finally, the results reported in this paper can provide a valuable guidance for the design of the TPCT and construction of the permafrost regions in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68d5d7f73267d53358d4ee31b5cae44dbdf0fc5239a63f3bd073d24569afdbaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
