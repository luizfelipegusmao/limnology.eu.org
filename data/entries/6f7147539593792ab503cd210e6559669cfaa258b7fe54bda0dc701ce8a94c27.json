{"title":"Probabilistic Assessment of Safety Performance of Composite Pile Foundation Using Symmetrical FEM Reliability Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1268/v1","date":1724122817000,"content":"In this paper, aiming at the safety evaluation of ultimate bearing safety capacity of composite pile bridge foundation, the symmetrical reliability method with forward and inverse analysis con-sidering the randomness of parameters is proposed to evaluate the safety performance of com-posite pile foundation. The proposed method, considering the randomness of parameters, was used to calculate the safety factor of ultimate bearing capacity of composite pile foundation to meet the prescribed target reliability requirements. Through the example calculation of the safety coefficient of pile foundation, the results show that the statistical characteristics of random vari-ables that affect the safety coefficient of pile foundation have a significant impact. The degree of the safety coefficient depends on the probability distribution type and distribution parameters of the random parameters, among which the more important is the variation characteristics of the random variables. The stronger the parameter variability, the lower the safety level of the struc-ture. During design and evaluation, it is necessary to measure the safety reserve of pile founda-tions in accordance with engineering practice to ensure the safe construction and well operation of the pile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f7147539593792ab503cd210e6559669cfaa258b7fe54bda0dc701ce8a94c27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
