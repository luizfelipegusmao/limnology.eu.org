{"title":"Landauer Bound in the Context of Minimal Physical Principles: Meaning, Experimental Verification, Controversies and Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0430/v1","date":1712306884000,"content":"The physical roots, interpretation, controversies and precise meaning of the Landauer Principle are surveyed. Landauer's principle is a physical principle pertaining to the lower theoretical limit of energy consumption of computation. It states that an irreversible change in information stored in a computer, such as merging two computational paths, dissipates a minimum amount of heat kBTln2 per a bit of information to its surrounding. The Landauer Principle is discussed in the context of fundamental physical limiting principles, such as the Abbe diffraction limit, the Margolus-Levitin limit and the Bekenstein limit. Synthesis of the Landauer bound with the Abbe, Margolus-Levitin limit and Bekenstein limits yields the minimal time of computation, which scales as τmin~hkBT. Decrease in a temperature of a thermal bath will decrease the energy consumption of a single computation, but, in parallel, it will slow the computation. The Landauer principle bridges between John Archibald Wheeler “it from bit” paradigm and thermodynamics. Experimental verifications of the Landauer Principle are surveyed. Interrelation between thermodynamic and logical irreversibility is addressed. Generalization of the Landauer principle to the quantum and non-equilibrium systems is addressed. Landauer Principle represents the powerful heuristic principle bridging the physics, information theory and computer engineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"858ab976528c5e835a1a25ff96c21681a85186710e5ff370fe64ec6d27605279","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
