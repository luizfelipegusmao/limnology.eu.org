{"title":"Neurotensin and Its Involvement in Female Hormone-Sensitive Cancers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2086/v1","date":1727343229000,"content":"Neurotensin (NT) is a peptide involved in digestion, neuromodulation, and cancer progression. NT and its receptors (NTR1 and SORT1 mainly) have been widely studied in oncology. Data show NT expression is under the control of sex steroid hormones, in particular estradiol. We focused on its involvement in three main female hormone-sensitive cancers: breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer in a narrative review. NT, NTR1 and SORT1 are mostly expressed in these three cancers and their involvement in oncologic processes such as proliferation and invasion seems to match, as does their impact on prognosis for most. The development of NT receptor-targeted therapies, including theranostics and radioligand treatments, presents a promising avenue for personalized cancer treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57a362fc7793e6eb1e741cd3a2e5e664eae94c32916cfef36fd745f68efa2e61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
