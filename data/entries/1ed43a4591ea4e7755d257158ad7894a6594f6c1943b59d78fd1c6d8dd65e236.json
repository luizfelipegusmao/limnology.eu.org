{"title":"Levitating Control System of Maglev Ruler Based on Active Disturbance Rejection Controller","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0422/v1","date":1722994446000,"content":"The autonomous displacement and displacement measurement functions of the maglev ruler are performed by the mover core. The stability of the four magnetic field in air gaps and the levitation position of the maglev ruler is one of the key factors for the stability of the thrust force on the power core, and it is also one of the key factors for ensuring the precision of the maglev ruler. There is cross-coupling between the two ends of the mover core of the maglev ruler, resulting in a strongly coupled, nonlinear, multi-input and multi-output system for the levitating system of the maglev ruler. This paper establishes a mathematical model for the levitating system of the maglev ruler, and designs a levitating control system for the maglev ruler based on ADRC control algorithm to achieve decoupling and disturbance suppression. Through simulation analysis and experimental testing of the levitating system with starting and disturbance, it is proved that the levitating control system of the maglev ruler has good dynamic characteristics, static characteristics, and robustness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ed43a4591ea4e7755d257158ad7894a6594f6c1943b59d78fd1c6d8dd65e236","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
