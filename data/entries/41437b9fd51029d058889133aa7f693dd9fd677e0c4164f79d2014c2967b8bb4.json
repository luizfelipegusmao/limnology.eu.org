Groundwater safety is the premise of residents' health. Therefore, studying the sustainable utilization and health risks of groundwater quality is important. The groundwater quality and potential health risks were evaluated in the Shijiazhuang area, which is located in the North China Plain in this paper. Based on 159 groundwater samples collected in the study area, the potential health risks of As, Cr<sup>6+</sup>, Ni, Pb, F<sup>−</sup>, and NO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup> to humans were evaluated from oral and skin contact. Results of the human health risk assessment showed that the average carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic risk of children are higher than those of adults. According to the spatial distribution of the total risk value, adults and children in the southwest of the study area face higher risks. Because of the uncertainty of USEPA, Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the probability of health risk assessment and prioritization of contaminant treatment. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation showed that the acceptable range for children is 6.82%, and the acceptable range for adults is 18.07%. According to the HRWM model, carcinogenic pollutants mainly include As, Cr<sup>6+</sup>, and Ni. The most important chemical species of As is HAsO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup>, followed by H<sub>2</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>. Similarly, CrO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> are the main forms of Cr<sup>6+</sup> and Ni. The results of this study can provide data support for the protection and management of groundwater quality in the North China Plain.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nChildren are more susceptible to carcinogenic risk than adults.\nAfter calculation, the main influencing elements are Ni and Cr.\nMetal morphology analysis was carried out, and the results showed that HAsO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup>, CrO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup>, and Ni<sup>2+</sup> were the main types.\n</p>","author":"Di You, \nYahong Zhou, \nBin Wang, \nKunyuan Li, \nJi Xuan Chang, \nChangyu Lu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"41437b9fd51029d058889133aa7f693dd9fd677e0c4164f79d2014c2967b8bb4","category":"Environment"}
