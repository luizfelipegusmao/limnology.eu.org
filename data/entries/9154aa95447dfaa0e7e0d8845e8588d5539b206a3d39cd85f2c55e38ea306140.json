First, the memristive characteristic is analyzed. Next, based on it, spike waveforms are determined. Finally, the STDP characteristic is successfully confirmed. This is the first report on the realization of a STDP characteristic using a thin film deposited by the mist-CVD method, which is achieved by the GTO properties and a well-designed clear methodology to realize a STDP characteristic from a memristive characteristic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9154aa95447dfaa0e7e0d8845e8588d5539b206a3d39cd85f2c55e38ea306140","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
