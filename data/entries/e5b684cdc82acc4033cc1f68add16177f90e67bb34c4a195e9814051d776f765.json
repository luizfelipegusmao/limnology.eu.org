This study focused on 16 prefecture-level cities in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau region. The critic weighting method assessed the 2007–2018 human well-being index (HWI). The Tapio decoupling model allowed the study of the human well-being decoupling state. Finally, the drivers of decoupling between economic development and human well-being were analyzed using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. The results indicated that (1) almost all cities in the study region had an upward 2007–2018 HWI trend, but there were significant differences in growth magnitude and change trend. (2) Economic development and human well-being in the study region in 2007–2018 had expansion negative decoupling, thus, human well-being increased with economic growth, but not as fast as gross domestic product. 9 cities in 2007 showed weak decoupling, expansion connection, and expansion negative decoupling, increasing to 13 cities by 2018, indicating that human well-being development gradually improved from 2007 to 2018. (3) For most cities, the economic scale effect was the most influential factor in the decoupling of economic development and human well-being. Therefore, this study provided policy recommendations for decoupling economic development and human well-being.","author":"Weiguo Fan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e5b684cdc82acc4033cc1f68add16177f90e67bb34c4a195e9814051d776f765","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
