{"title":"Amyloid, a Jekyll and Hyde Molecule Inducing Neuronal Decline and Cognitive Dysfunction is Also a Unique Molecular Template used in Nano-electronics, Light Capture Photovoltaics, and Biosensors in Neuromorphic Computing.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1275/v1","date":1718880178000,"content":"Amyloid self-assembled from amyloid peptides βΑ40 or βΑ42 is notorious for its neurotoxic effects in plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formations leading to neuron dysfunction and diseases of cognitive decline (e.g. Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington's disease).  This contrasts with so-called functional amyloids which are non-toxic ordered template structures amenable to applications in tissue engineering.  Amyloid fibrils of variable morphology including long and hollow fibres and flattened tube and spiral ribbon-like structures have been used in engineering applications in nano-biology. Protein assemblies based on amyloid core structures display diverse biological functionalities could be applied in futuristic self-assembling biomaterials in nano-electronics.  These possibilities have revolutionized the development of next generation computers and biosensors, ultracapacitors, memristors, actuators, molecular switches and could also be used to develop artificial synapses. Amyloid fibril assemblies have also been used in photoelectric and photon capture light harvesting technologies and been applied in innovative nano-photoelectronics and photovoltaics. Hybrid Aβ(16–22)-α-synuclein amyloid fibrils also exhibit light-harvesting and electron-transfer properties.  Engineered amyloid assemblies are thus facilitating innovative futuristic advances in nano-technology. Furthermore, with a better understanding of amyloid fibril assembly processes it may be possible to develop therapeutic methods that prevent the toxic build up of this polymer in brain tissues that leads to diseases of cognitive decline.  With the ever-expanding prevalence of these diseases in the ageing general global population, there certainly is a clear and present need to find a remedy for these debilitating conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b2945ff666a9071b61bced46c3d0e536c722d4e7b41a0666516ff3e41e579bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
