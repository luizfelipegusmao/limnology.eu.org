Ashley, Yiping He</p>\r\n\r\nTargeting endolysosomes is a strategy extensively pursued for treating cancers, including glioblastomas (GBMs), on the basis that the intact function of these subcellular organelles is key to tumor cell autophagy and survival. Through gene expression analyses and cell type abundance estimation in GBMs, we showed that genes associated with the endolysosomal machinery are more prominently featured in non-tumor cells in GBMs than in tumor cells, and that tumor-associated macrophages represent the primary immune cell type that contributes to this trend. Further analyses found an enrichment of endolysosomal pathway genes in immunosuppressive (pro-tumorigenic) macrophages, such as M2-like macrophages or those associated with worse prognosis in glioma patients, but not in those linked to inflammation (anti-tumorigenic). Specifically, genes critical to the hydrolysis function of endolysosomes, including progranulin and cathepsins, were among the most positively correlated with immunosuppressive macrophages, and elevated expression of these genes is associated with worse patient survival in GBMs. Together, these results implicate the hydrolysis function of endolysosomes in shaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM. We propose that targeting endolysosomes, in addition to its detrimental effects on tumor cells, can be leveraged for modulating immunosuppression to render GBMs more amenable to immunotherapies.","author":"Michael A.
