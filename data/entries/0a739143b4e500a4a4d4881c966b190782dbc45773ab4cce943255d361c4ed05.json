{"title":"Cellular and Molecular Immunity to Influenza Viruses and Vaccines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1671/v1","date":1711548181000,"content":"Immune responses to influenza (flu) antigens reflect memory to prior infections or vaccinations, which might influence immunity to new flu antigens.  Memory of past antigens has been termed “original antigenic sin” or more recently “immune imprinting” and “seniority”. We have researched a comparison between the immune response to live flu infections and inactivated flu vaccina-tions. A brief history of antibody generation theories is presented culminating in new findings about the immune-network theory suggesting that a network of clones exists between an-ti-idiotypic antibodies and T cell receptors. Findings regarding the 2009 pandemic flu strain and immune responses to it are presented, including memory B cells and conserved regions within the hemagglutinin protein. The importance of CD4+ memory T cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells responding to both infections and vaccinations are discussed and compared. Innate immune cells like natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages are discussed regarding their roles in adaptive immune responses. Antigen presentation via macroautophagy processes are described. New vaccines in development are mentioned along with the results of some clinical trials. The manu-script concludes with how repeated vaccinations are impacting the immune system and a sketch of what might be behind the imprinting phenomenon, including future research directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a739143b4e500a4a4d4881c966b190782dbc45773ab4cce943255d361c4ed05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
