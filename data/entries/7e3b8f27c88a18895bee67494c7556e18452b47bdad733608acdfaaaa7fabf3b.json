Environmental impacts are increasing and energy resources more expensive, which requires the development of alternative energy resources such as solid biofuels [<a href=\"#ozae044.408-B1\">1-2</a>], which are a key component on the path to a sustainable and just energy transition and can contribute to complementing the demand for biomass used for energy purposes. which is present in millions of families worldwide. The use of bioenergy in Mexico comes almost entirely from firewood, and incipiently from solid biofuels, most of which is the use of wood for cooking and water heating in rural areas [<a href=\"#ozae044.408-B3\">3</a>], which maintains a rootedness towards biomass fuels, and makes the use of organic materials for combustion purposes interesting, such as agricultural and agro-industrial waste. In this sense, the present investigation shows an analysis of the energy content of agro-industrial waste of <span>Mangifera indica</span> L. generated in the city of Zamora, in the state of Michoac√°n, in western Mexico, one of the multiple agro-industrial regions of the country [<a href=\"#ozae044.408-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7e3b8f27c88a18895bee67494c7556e18452b47bdad733608acdfaaaa7fabf3b","category":"Environment"}
