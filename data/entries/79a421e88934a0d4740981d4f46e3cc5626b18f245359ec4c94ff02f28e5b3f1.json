{"title":"Growth and longevity of the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera): Implications for conservation and management","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4205?af=R","date":1718351105000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Key life-history data, such as growth and age, are necessary to effectively manage and conserve threatened freshwater mussel species. Traditionally growth and age studies require large yet destructive sample sizes covering all age classes. Such methods pose a risk to populations of conservation concern, and therefore, alternative methods that need only limited sample sizes are necessitated to prevent further threats to such populations. We applied retrospective shell growth at age reconstructions to 98 critically endangered freshwater pearl mussel (FPM) individuals from 34 populations across Finland and Sweden, enabling the use of extremely small sample sizes (<i>n</i> = 1–6 per population). We compared the performance of six different growth models with the reconstructed size-at-age data across FPM juvenile (&lt;20 years old) and adult life stages. The growth reconstruction model showed reasonable skill in reconstructing FPM growth patterns. The von Bertalanffy model showed to be a good general descriptor of growth for FPM, but it systematically underestimated the asymptotic size. The power law model was the most accurate in estimating juvenile growth (lowest deviances from the size-at-age data). FPM showed great variability in longevity (<i>A</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>max</i>\n</sub> = 54–254 years) and growth constant <i>k</i> (0.018–0.057 year<sup>−1</sup>). Our results show that reasonable estimates of growth can be attained even when sample sizes are extremely limited. The results can be further applied to gain knowledge on the population's age structure, size at maturation, and recovery potential. The methodology is applicable to other freshwater mussel species of conservation concern.</p>","author":"Sabrina Nykänen, \nJouni Taskinen, \nMahsa Hajisafarali, \nAnna Kuparinen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"79a421e88934a0d4740981d4f46e3cc5626b18f245359ec4c94ff02f28e5b3f1","category":"Environment"}
