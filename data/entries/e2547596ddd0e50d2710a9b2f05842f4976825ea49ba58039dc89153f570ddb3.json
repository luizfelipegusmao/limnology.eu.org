{"title":"Evaluating UAV‐based multispectral imagery for mapping an intertidal seagrass environment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4230?af=R","date":1724747944000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nWorldwide seagrass habitats are under severe anthropogenic threat. In the United Kingdom (UK), the health of habitats of the widely distributed <i>Zostera</i> species is particularly threatened by eutrophication that can lead to detrimental macroalgae overgrowth. To manage and conserve seagrass habitats, effective monitoring tools are required.\nWe use an off-the-shelf consumer-grade multispectral (RGB, red edge, and near-infrared) camera mounted on an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) to map an intertidal multispecies seagrass environment in Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve, Northumberland, UK.\nField surveys were undertaken of three seagrass areas, including those dominated by <i>Zostera noltii</i>, <i>Zostera marina</i> and macroalgae. Using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), results indicated an overall accuracy (OA) between 84% and 91% across classified habitat maps. As expected, the red edge and near-infrared bands offered an advantage beyond RGB imagery to discriminate between the vegetation types for accurate habitat mapping.\nOur research provides a foundation for accurately mapping a complex intertidal seagrass environment through the utilisation of an off-the-shelf multispectral UAV. The study may aid the implementation and development of effective monitoring programmes for the management of <i>Zostera</i> spp. decline and macroalgae proliferation to prevent seagrass degradation and conserve these valuable yet fragile ecosystems.\n</p>","author":"Eylem Elma, \nRachel Gaulton, \nThomas R.
