Measure your inseam</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/02153438/how_to_change_your_seat_height_step_1-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take your shoes off and grab a book. Next, line yourself up against a wall. Pop the book spine upwards between your legs. Give it a good squish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the book level, make a mark on the wall at the top of the book. Now measure the distance between the mark and the floor. This is your inseam.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Get out the calculator</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/02153441/how_to_change_your_seat_height_step_2-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are numerous formulae for working out correct saddle height. One of the most commonly used is the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/no-slowing-down-greg-lemond-profile\" target=\"_blank\">LeMond</a> method, named after the American Tour de France champ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take your inseam measurement and multiply it by 0.883. For example, 860mm x 0.883 = 759.38mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Measure from the bottom bracket centre to saddle top</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/02153444/how_to_change_your_seat_height_step_3-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Work out exactly where your sit bones (the bony bits of your backside) rest on the saddle. Next, find the centre point of your cranks (the spindle around which they turn) and measure the distance between the two points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare the number with the one the equation gave you in step 2. If it’s significantly different you’ll need to adjust your saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Clean and re-grease your seatpost</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/02153446/how_to_change_your_seat_height_step_4-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adjusting your saddle height is a good excuse to clean your seatpost. Loosen the seatpost clamp and remove the seatpost. Wipe it down with a rag and clean the inside of the seat tube using silicone spray or a light solvent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it is a metal seatpost in a metal frame, apply a fresh smear of grease or anti-seize. If it’s a carbon seatpost in a carbon frame, leave it bare or, if slipping might be an issue, use carbon paste to increase grip between the seatpost and frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Adjust your seatpost</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/02153449/how_to_change_your_seat_height_step_5-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Return the seatpost to the frame and push it in until the distance from the centre of the cranks to the top of the saddle matches the number you calculated in step 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may help if you ask someone else to hold the tape measure while you adjust the seatpost height and tighten the clamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Torque</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/02153452/how_to_change_your_seat_height_step_6-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tightening to the right torque setting (which should be marked on the frame or seatpost clamp) is especially important with carbon parts. And it’s absolutely essential if your bike uses a wedge-type tensioner to hold the post in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s well worth investing in a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/its-good-to-torque\" target=\"_blank\">torque wrench</a> to do the job properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our guide to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-measure-a-bike-frame\" target=\"_blank\">how to measure a bike frame </a>to understand more about bike sizing and setup.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-change-your-saddle-height\">Watch: How to set and change your saddle height</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"441d7a8a29104cda16cb47dbea7cdc64667f6ee2917e211d66bc12183fd555af","category":"Cycling"}
