{"title":"Lung and Colon Cancer Detection Using Deep AI Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1042/v1","date":1726218463000,"content":"Lung and colon cancers are among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early and accurate detection of these cancers is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. False or incorrect detection is more harmful. Accurately detecting cancer in a patient's tissue is crucial to their effective treatment. While analyzing tissue samples is complicated and time-consuming, deep learning techniques have made it possible to complete this process more efficiently and accurately. As a result, researchers can study more patients in a shorter amount of time and at a lower cost. Much research has been conducted to investigate deep learning models that require great computational ability and resources. However, None of these have had a 100% accurate detection rate for these life-threatening malignancies. Misclassified or falsely detecting cancer can have more harmful consequences. \nThis research proposes a new lightweight, parameter-efficient, and mobile-embedded deep learning model based on a 1D convolutional neural network with Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for efficient lung and colon cancer detection. This proposed model diagnoses and classifies lung squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinoma of the lung and colon from digital pathology images. Extensive experiment demonstrates that our proposed model achieves 100% accuracy for detecting lung, colon, and lung and colon cancers from the histopathological (LC25000) lung and colon datasets, which is considered the best accuracy for around 0.35 million trainable parameters and around 6.4 million flops. Compared with the existing results, our proposed architecture shows state-of-the-art performance in lung, colon, and lung and colon cancer detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54fe3c8379511da211a9f2fcc5c22ba74fe42afa904d242d93811b1c25cc0e26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
