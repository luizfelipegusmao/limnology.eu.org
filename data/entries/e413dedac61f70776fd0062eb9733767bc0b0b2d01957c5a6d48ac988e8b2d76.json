{"title":"Research on the Uplift Characteristics of Pantographs of High-Speed Trains Under Crosswind Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1227/v1","date":1724035144000,"content":"Through the geometric relationships and force analysis of the main components of the panto-graph on high-speed trains, coefficients of aerodynamic forces and lift transmission between the pantograph and main components under crosswind conditions were derived. Based on the aer-odynamic forces acting on the pantograph at different crosswind speeds, wind angles, and oper-ating speeds, the aerodynamic lift of the pantograph and main components was ultimately de-termined. The results indicate that the aerodynamic lift of the pantograph is mainly distributed on the bow structure, with the aerodynamic lift of the upper frame all being negative values, while the absolute value of the aerodynamic lift of the lower arm rod is the smallest. The oper-ating speed of the pantograph and the wind angle of the crosswind have a significant impact on the aerodynamic lift of the main components, while the impact of the crosswind speed is rela-tively small. At the same operating speed of the pantograph, the lower the corresponding crosswind speed, the smaller the aerodynamic lift of the pantograph. The aerodynamic lift of the pantograph tends to decrease gradually with the increase of crosswind speed, and the impact of crosswind speed decreases gradually with the increase of pantograph operating speed. A com-prehensive relationship formula between the aerodynamic lift of the pantograph and the oper-ating speed, crosswind speed, and wind angle is obtained, and the empirical formula for the contact force of the bow net and train operating speed is modified. The research results are of great significance and value for the study and application of lift forces on pantographs under crosswind conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e413dedac61f70776fd0062eb9733767bc0b0b2d01957c5a6d48ac988e8b2d76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
