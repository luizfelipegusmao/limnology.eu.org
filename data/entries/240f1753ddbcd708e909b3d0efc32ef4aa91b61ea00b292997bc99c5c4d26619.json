{"title":"Dark Energy and Dark Matter from Extra Dimensional Symmetry as Different Manifestations of Vacuum Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202309.1002/v5","date":1716304932000,"content":"Dark energy and dark matter are described as different manifestations of vacuum energy in a new cyclic universe framework of Extra Dimensional Symmetry (EDS) that doubles large spatial dimensions with microscopic partners. In this testable framework, vacuum energy, constrained by a Planck density constraint, exists in a gravitationally dark state where actual gravitational constant Go = 0G. While a small repulsive component is constrained by an asymptotically evolving asymmetry to the active state where Go = 2G, some components in the inert state are enabled to gravitationally attract by neutrino induced gravitational constant with light and shear activated heavy components. Observational and experimental tests are briefly discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"240f1753ddbcd708e909b3d0efc32ef4aa91b61ea00b292997bc99c5c4d26619","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
