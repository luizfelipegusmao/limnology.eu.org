{"title":"Perceived Obstacles in Land Use Change for Hybrid Sweetgum Plantations: Landowner Opinions from the South Central United States","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/122/3/215/7609947?rss=1","date":1708128000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hybrid sweetgum (<span>Liquidambar styraciflua</span> × <span>L. formosana</span>) has received considerable attention as a potential feedstock for traditional and nontraditional forest-based enterprises due to its fast growth and large specific gravity. However, the perceptions of landowners are important to understand the degree of acceptance concerning land use change to consider this opportunity in the United States. We administered a survey instrument to three thousand landowners representing the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas where hybrid sweetgum plantations would be feasible. A seemingly unrelated regression analysis was used to explore the attributes that may influence the environmental and economic obstacles in land use change for hybrid sweetgum plantations. Study results suggest that landowners who perceived higher importance of marketing aspects of hybrid sweetgum expressed greater economic concerns for land use change. In contrast, those having higher planted pine acres had higher environmental concerns about land use change. Female landowners were more concerned than their male counterparts. Landowners need access to accurate information from their trusted sources to make informed management decisions, especially when making decisions to adopt new opportunities such as hybrid sweetgum.<strong>Study Implications:</strong> Study results reveal the need for outreach to landowners in the south central United States, as many were not aware of fast-growing hardwood species such as hybrid sweetgum. Information on growth potential, economics, and management techniques can help facilitate the adoption of hybrid sweetgum. Field visits and peer-to-peer learning facilitated by early adopters can be effective strategies for outreach.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Forestry Current Issue","siteHash":"f325018648ab04fba35e6e1191e9c9d953f9458bd233a7a41545c2e465328e3b","entryHash":"44e199d9c143538c078c26b9795f8fb82bd1b59a2e2d5d5d26f2ca74ff409848","category":"Environment"}
