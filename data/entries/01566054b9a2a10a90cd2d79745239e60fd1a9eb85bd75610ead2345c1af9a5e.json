{"title":"Graphene Monolayer Nanomesh Structures and Their Applications in Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting for Solving the Matching Conundrum of Rectennas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1582/v1","date":1724257149000,"content":"In this paper, we investigate various graphene monolayer nanomesh structures (diodes) formed only by nanoholes, with a diameter of just 20 nm and etched from the graphene layer in different shapes (such as rhombus, bow-tie, rectangle, trapezoid, and triangle), and their electrical properties targeting electromagnetic energy harvesting applications. In this respect, the main parameters characterizing any nonlinear device for energy harvesting are extracted from tens of measurements performed on a single chip containing the fabricated diodes. The best nano-perforated graphene structure is the triangle nanomesh one, which exhibits remarkable performance in terms of its characteristic parameters, i.e., a 420 Ω differential resistance for optimal impedance matching to an antenna, a high responsivity greater than 1000 V/W, and a low noise equivalent power of 847 pW/√Hz at 0 V.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01566054b9a2a10a90cd2d79745239e60fd1a9eb85bd75610ead2345c1af9a5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
