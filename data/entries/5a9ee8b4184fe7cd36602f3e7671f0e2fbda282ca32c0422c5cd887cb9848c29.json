The current study aimed to assess the effects of vitamin B6 on the incidence of corticosteroid-induced cleft palate model. Eighteen pregnant mice were divided into three groups. Mice of control group were injected with sterile physiological saline from 11th - 14th days of gestation. Mice of group II were injected with 125 mg/kg hydrocortisone from 11th - 14th days of gestation. Mice of group III were injected with hydrocortisone as in group II and given drinking water containing 500 Âµg/ml of vitamin B6 from day zero of gestation until delivery. Two days after delivery, the offspring were counted, and their head circumferences were taken for statistical analysis. The heads of the offspring were fixed and processed for paraffin sectioning and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cleft palates were counted and statistically analyzed using ANOVA test to determine any significances (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a9ee8b4184fe7cd36602f3e7671f0e2fbda282ca32c0422c5cd887cb9848c29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
