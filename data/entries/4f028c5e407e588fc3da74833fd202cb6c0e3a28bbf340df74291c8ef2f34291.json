{"title":"Chemical tolerance related to the ABC transporter gene and DNA methylation in cladocera (Daphnia magna)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24077?af=R","date":1709898124000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We performed multigenerational tests to clarify the chemical tolerance mechanisms of a nontarget aquatic organism, <i>Daphnia magna</i>. We continuously exposed <i>D. magna</i> to a carbamate insecticide (pirimicarb) at lethal or sublethal concentrations (0, 3.8, 7.5, and 15 μg/L) for 15 generations (F0-F14). We then determined the 48 h-EC<sub>50</sub> values and mRNA expression levels of acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, and ATP (Adenosine triphosphate)-binding cassette transporter (ABCt) in neonates (&lt;24 h old) from F0, F4, F9, and F14. To ascertain the effects of DNA methylation on pirimicarb sensitivity, we measured 5-methylcytosine levels (DNA methylation levels) in neonates of parents in the last generation (F14). In addition, we cultured groups exposed to 0 and 7.5 μg/L (the latter of which acquired chemical tolerance to pirimicarb) with or without 5-azacytidine (de-methylating agent) and determined methylation levels and 48 h-EC<sub>50</sub> values in neonates (&lt;24 h old) from the treated parents. The EC<sub>50</sub> values (30.3–31.6 μg/L) in F14 of the 7.5 and 15 μg/L groups were approximately two times higher than that in the control (16.0 μg/L). A linear mixed model analysis showed that EC<sub>50</sub> and ABCt mRNA levels were significantly increased with generational alterations; further analysis showed that the ABCt mRNA level was positively related to the EC<sub>50</sub>. Therefore, ABCt may be associated with altered pirimicarb sensitivity. In addition, the EC<sub>50</sub> value and DNA methylation levels in pirimicarb-tolerant clones decreased after exposure to 5-azacytidine, suggesting that DNA methylation contributes to chemical tolerance. These findings improved our knowledge regarding the acquisition of chemical tolerance in aquatic organisms.</p>","author":"Makoto Ishimota, \nMebuki Kodama, \nNaruto Tomiyama, \nKazutoshi Ohyama","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"4f028c5e407e588fc3da74833fd202cb6c0e3a28bbf340df74291c8ef2f34291","category":"Environment"}
