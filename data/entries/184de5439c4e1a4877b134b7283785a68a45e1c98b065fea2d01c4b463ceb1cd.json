{"title":"Genotype-phenotype correlation of ocular von Hippel-Lindau disease in Koreans","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311665","date":1728309600000,"content":"<p>by Sungsoon Hwang, Se Woong Kang, Jong-Won Kim, Sang Jin Kim</p>\r\n\r\nThis scientific report aims to investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations of retinal hemangioblastoma (RH) in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. The study included 77 patients with genetically confirmed VHL disease who visited an ophthalmology clinic for the evaluation of RH. The presence, location, and size of RH were evaluated, Patients were categorized into three groups based on variants: HIF-1α binding site missense (HM), non-HIF-1α binding site missense (nHM), and truncating (TR) mutations. Fifty-six patients (72.7%) had RH in either eye, and 24 had bilateral RH. Sixteen patients (20.8%) had juxtapapillary RH in either eye. Nine patients had RH ≥ 2.0 disc diameters in size. <i>VHL</i> c.208G&gt;A variant was the most frequent single mutation. Compared with patients having nHM mutations (15 patients) in VHL gene, patients with HM mutations (33 patients) or TR mutations (26 patients) presented a greater number of eyes affected (p = 0.007 and 0.004, respectively), a greater number of RH (p = 0.012 and 0.003, respectively), and more frequent presentation of large RH ≥ 2.0 disc diameters (p = 0.012, and 0.013, respectively). In conclusion, this study provides a deeper understanding of the genetic spectrum of VHL disease in Korean VHL disease and highlights the importance of the location of missense mutations regarding the risk of RH.","author":"Sungsoon Hwang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"184de5439c4e1a4877b134b7283785a68a45e1c98b065fea2d01c4b463ceb1cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
