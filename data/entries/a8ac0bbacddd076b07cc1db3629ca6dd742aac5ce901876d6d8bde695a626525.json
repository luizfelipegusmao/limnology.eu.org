Plants possess different adaptive mechanisms, such as developing tolerance to low temperatures to thrive in harsh freezing conditions, a process known as cold acclimation. One of the major players in cold acclimation is C-REPEAT BINDING FACTORS (CBFs), a family of three tandemly duplicated CBF paralogs that activate cold-inducible genes (<a href=\"#kiae057-B5\">Novillo et al. 2007</a>). The CBF family is induced during low temperatures, and its expression reaches the maximum in the initial phase of low temperatures, further decreasing in the later stages of low temperatures (<a href=\"#kiae057-B4\">Medina et al. 1999</a>). Although the role of CBFs in cold induction has been extensively investigated, the underlying mechanisms of decline in CBF expression in later stages of low-temperature conditions remain elusive.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a8ac0bbacddd076b07cc1db3629ca6dd742aac5ce901876d6d8bde695a626525","category":"Environment"}
