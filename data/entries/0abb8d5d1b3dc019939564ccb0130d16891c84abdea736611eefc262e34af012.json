We found (i) that males preferred longer material, while female did not; (ii) that older males preferred longer material, while younger males did not; and (iii) that males were more repeatable than females in their preference. Together, these results emphasize the need to include individual attributes when performing individual-based study to understand the evolution of traits.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Many animals build structures that are used for shelter, reproduction or to capture prey. The type of material used to build these structures is likely to influence their solidity, thermoregulation capacity and, in some species, may influence the attractiveness of the builders. In the case of animal nests, evidence for preference of nesting material has been documented in several species but, to date, few field experiments have been conducted, and it was seldom investigated whether individuals' attributes affected those preferences. We investigated these preferences in relation to individual attributes on sociable weavers (<i>Philetairus socius</i>) that build communally one of the largest known nest structures, using dry grass. We conducted an experiment where we presented two piles of straws, long and short, to wild individuals. We recorded 900 h of video and used a deep learning method to automatically detect images where birds were present (266 colour-ringed individuals). Our results showed that males picked more straws than females and showed a preference for longer straws, while no preference was found for females. In addition, older males showed a preference for long straws compared to younger males. Finally, males displayed higher repeatability than females in their preference for longer straws. In conclusion, we show that choice of nesting material is not random, and that preferences are associated with individual attributes. Future studies should assess how building is associated with social status, mating and reproductive success of the individuals building, to investigate which of these factors could have shaped the evolution of these preferences.</p>","author":"Nicolas J.
