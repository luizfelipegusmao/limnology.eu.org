{"title":"Neutrophils Expressing Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Play an Indispensable Role in Effective Bacterial Elimination and Resolving Inflammation in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1792/v1","date":1711700116000,"content":"Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a co-inhibitory molecule expressed on the surface of various\ncell types, known for its suppressive effect on T cells through interaction with PD-1. Neutrophils also express \nPD-L1, and its expression is elevated in specific situations; however, the immunobiological role of PD-L1+ \nneutrophil has not been fully characterized. Here, we report that PD-L1-expressing neutrophils increased in \nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection are highly functional in bacterial elimination and \nsupporting inflammatory resolution. The frequency of PD-L1+ neutrophils was dramatically increased in\nMRSA-infected mice, and this population exhibited enhanced activity in bacterial elimination compared to \nPD-L1- neutrophils. An administration of PD-L1 monoclonal antibody did not impair PD-L1+ neutrophil\nfunction suggesting that PD-L1 expression itself does not influence neutrophil activity. However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade significantly delayed liver inflammation resolution in MRSA-infected mice, as indicated by increased plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) level and frequencies of inflammatory leukocytes in the liver implying that neutrophil PD-L1 suppresses the inflammatory response of these cells during the acute phase of MRSA infection. Our results reveal that elevated PD-L1 expression can be a marker for enhanced anti-bacterial function of neutrophils. Moreover, PD-L1+ neutrophils are an indispensable population attenuating inflammatory leukocyte activities assisting in a smooth transition into the resolution phase in MRSA infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28de26dcc9acc9625c80b674acedf416fcdcdaeb73f08ea75938bbf7a3939692","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
