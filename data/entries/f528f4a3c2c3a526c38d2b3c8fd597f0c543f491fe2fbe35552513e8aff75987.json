{"title":"Diversity and Conservation of Mangrove and Associate Species \nwith Anticancer Properties: An Overview","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0045/v1","date":1727775560000,"content":"In this article, the diversity of mangrove and associate species with anticancer properties are reviewed. Information included their scientific names, synonyms, common names, families and life-forms. Their anticancer properties are documented with description on cancer cell types, effects and mechanisms. Mangroves are exclusive species confined to the mangrove habitat. Plants that occur in the coastal environment and also in mangroves are associates or non-exclusive species. In this article, species with anticancer properties are 25 mangrove species belonging to 17 genera and 11 families, and 31 associate species belonging to 28 genera and 20 families possess. Most reported mangrove species are Avicennia marina and Ceriops tagal with five and four studies, respectively. Associate species most reported are Talipariti tiliaceum or Hibiscus tiliaceus with five studies, followed by Anacardium occidentale, Artocarpus altilis, Ceriops manghas, Pluchea indica and Pongamia pinnata with four studies each. In the conservation of mangrove and associate species with anticancer properties, in in-situ conservation, species are protected in their natural surroundings as ecosystems (e.g., virgin jungle reserves and Ramsar sites) while in ex-situ conservation, species are protected outside their natural habitats (e.g., arboreta and botanical gardens).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f528f4a3c2c3a526c38d2b3c8fd597f0c543f491fe2fbe35552513e8aff75987","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
