{"title":"The Effect of Exercise on Reducing Lymphedema Severity in Breast Cancer Survivors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1231/v1","date":1710983905000,"content":"Abstract: Exercise has been repeatedly shown to be safe and beneficial for cancer survivors. However, there is no normative guideline for exercise prescription, and it is under exploration. Therefore, this literature review aims to provide some advice for the formulation of exercise prescriptions for patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) from the perspective of reducing lymphedema severity. A review of relevant studies published before November 2023 was conducted using three scientific databases PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. A total of 2696 articles were found. Eventually, 13 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this literature review. We concluded daily, or nearly daily exercise at home can be recommended. Moreover, reduced lymphedema severity may not be maintained after ceasing the exercise program, so exercise should be a lifelong practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f535334e356180141f39eed865916351fb6ac47ed3f4fc107b989db40d707110","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
