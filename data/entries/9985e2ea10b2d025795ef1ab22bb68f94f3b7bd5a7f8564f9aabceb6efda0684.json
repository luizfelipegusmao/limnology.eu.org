{"title":"COVID-19 in Children and Vitamin D","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1182/v1","date":1728981660000,"content":"In December 2019, the so-called “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) began. This disease is characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations, ranging from an asymptomatic process to life-threatening conditions associated with a “cytokine storm”. This article (narrative review) summarizes the epidemiologic characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The effect of the pandemic confinement on vitamin D status and the hypotheses proposed to explain the age-related difference in the severity of COVID-19 are discussed. The role of vitamin D as a critical regulator of both innate and adaptive immune responses and the COVID-19 cytokine storm are analyzed. Vitamin D and its links to both COVID-19 (low levels of vitamin D appear to worsen COVID-19 outcomes) and the cytokine storm (anti-inflammatory activity) are detailed. Finally, the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 is evaluated, but the evidence supporting vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 remains uncertain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9985e2ea10b2d025795ef1ab22bb68f94f3b7bd5a7f8564f9aabceb6efda0684","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
