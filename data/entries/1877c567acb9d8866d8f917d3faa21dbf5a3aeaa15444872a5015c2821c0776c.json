{"title":"Arabidopsis transcription factor TCP4 controls the identity of the apical gynoecium","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2668/7641784?rss=1","date":1712361600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The style and stigma at the apical gynoecium are crucial for flowering plant reproduction. However, the mechanisms underlying specification of the apical gynoecium remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Class II TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factors are critical for apical gynoecium specification in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>).

TCP4 interacts with CRC to synergistically upregulate the expression level of <span>NGAs</span>, and NGAs further form high-order complexes to control the expression of auxin-related genes in the apical gynoecium by directly interacting with TCP4. Our findings demonstrate that TCP4 physically associates with CRC and NGAs to control auxin biosynthesis in forming fine structures of the apical gynoecium.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"1877c567acb9d8866d8f917d3faa21dbf5a3aeaa15444872a5015c2821c0776c","category":"Environment"}
