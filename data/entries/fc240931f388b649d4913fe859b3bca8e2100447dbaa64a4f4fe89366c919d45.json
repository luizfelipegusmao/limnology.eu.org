{"title":"Challenges That Impact the Development of a Multi-generational Low-Carbon Passive House in a Small City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1977/v1","date":1714469071000,"content":"The built environment sectorâ€™s growing impact on climate change is becoming increasingly important due to its share in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Global efforts have been undertaken to design and develop residential dwellings that aim towards zero energy and carbon emission, but there remains a multitude of obstructions to efficient construction processes. This study is focused on the gaps and barriers that have emerged during the pre-construction phase of a low-environmental-impact Passive House in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The technical, management, regulatory, and supply chain obstacles to the construction of a new three-story residential Passive House are documented to engage knowledge transformation in the design and construction of sustainable buildings of interest to developers and property owners. Primary data are collected by direct observation as well as open-ended interviews and secondary data collected through a literature review to understand the barriers and gaps faced by different key actors during the pre-construction phase in different regions. This local study highlighted the lack of interest, knowledge, and experience in sustainable building design among professionals having a significant influence on the project goals and timeline and was mentioned by participants as a common barrier as well as the inconsistency and inadequacy of regulatory framework of existing building codes to implement sustainable building design. These barriers along with other identified barriers are discussed and recommendations to overcome these barriers are provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc240931f388b649d4913fe859b3bca8e2100447dbaa64a4f4fe89366c919d45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
