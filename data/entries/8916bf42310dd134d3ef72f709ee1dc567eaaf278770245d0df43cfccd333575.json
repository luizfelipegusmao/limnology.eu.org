{"title":"In-Situ Microstructural Evolution and Precipitate Analysis of High-Nickel Shipbuilding Steel Using High Temperature Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0179/v1","date":1722827699000,"content":"This study investigates the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of high-nickel shipbuilding steel during thermal processing using High Temperature Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (HTCLSM). The in-situ observation of the heating and holding processes reveals critical insights into phase transformations, grain growth behavior, and the formation of precipitates. The experimental results demonstrate that austenitization begins at approximately 700°C, with significant grain boundary nucleation. At 900°C, the formation of black precipitates was observed, and their persistence up to temperatures exceeding 1000°C was confirmed. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses identified these precipitates as chromium carbides (Cr7C3), which significantly contribute to the material's strength. The comprehensive analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence and distribution of Cr7C3 within the grains and along grain boundaries. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the microstructural dynamics in high-nickel steels, guiding the optimization of heat treatment processes to enhance mechanical properties for maritime applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8916bf42310dd134d3ef72f709ee1dc567eaaf278770245d0df43cfccd333575","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
