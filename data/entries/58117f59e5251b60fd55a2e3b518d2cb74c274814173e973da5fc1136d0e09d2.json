{"title":"Relationship between sensory attributes and instrumental texture properties in meat analog patty system substituted with sweet potato stem","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13533?af=R","date":1714125258000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Understanding the relationship between perceived sensory attributes and measurable instrumental properties is crucial for replicating the distinct textures of meat in plant-based meat analogs. In this study, plant-based patties composed of textured vegetable protein (TVP) and 10%, 20% and 30% TVPs were substituted with fibers from sweet potato stem (SPS), and their instrumental texture and sensory properties were evaluated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Samples with 20% SPS showed hardness, cohesiveness and chewiness, which are the mechanical indicators most similar to those of meat. A descriptive sensory analysis by ten trained participants indicated that the SPS-supplemented meat analog patties exhibited characteristics similar to pork patties in terms of firmness, toughness, cohesiveness and smoothness compared to the TVP-only sample. A strong positive correlation between instrumental hardness and sensory firmness was observed (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01); however, cohesiveness, springiness and chewiness did not show any correlation between instrumental and sensory analyses. Warner–Bratzler shear force (WBSF) values showed positive correlations with sensory cohesiveness, chewiness, toughness, fibrousness, moistness, firmness and springiness (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results demonstrated the feasibility of physically treated fibers from SPS as a partial substitute for TVP in developing meat analogs. Additionally, this study suggested that instrumental hardness and WBSF measurements can be sound parameters for representing sensory texture characteristics while further developing plant-based meat analogs. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"You Young Lee, \nSuyoon Lee, \nSeung Hwan Ham, \nMin Gyu Lee, \nJungwoo Hahn, \nYang Kim, \nYoung Jin Choi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"58117f59e5251b60fd55a2e3b518d2cb74c274814173e973da5fc1136d0e09d2","category":"Environment"}
