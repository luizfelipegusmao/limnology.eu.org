{"title":"Soft super-continuity and soft delta-closed graphs","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301705","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Dina Abuzaid, Samer Al Ghour, Monia Naghi</p>\r\n\r\nIntroducing a strong form of soft continuity between soft topological spaces is significant because it can contribute to our growing understanding of soft topological spaces and their features, provide a basis for creating new mathematical tools and methods, and have significant applications in various fields. In this paper, we define soft super-continuity as a new form of soft mapping. We present various characterizations of this soft concept. Also, we show that soft super-continuity lies strictly between soft continuity and soft complete continuity and that soft super-continuity is a strong form of soft <i>δ</i>-continuity. In addition, we give some sufficient conditions for the equivalence between soft super-continuity and other related concepts. Moreover, we characterize soft semi-regularity in terms of super-continuity. Furthermore, we provide several results of soft composition, restrictions, preservation, and products by soft super-continuity. In addition to these, we study the relationship between soft super-continuity and soft <i>δ</i>-continuity with their analogous notions in general topology. Finally, we give several sufficient conditions on a soft mapping to have a soft <i>δ</i>-closed graph.","author":"Dina Abuzaid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"33718a5bef3c043f7933d8daf6cd4e234711143e155e490b18dcf4ac461379d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
