{"title":"Design and Development of Miniature Measuring Instrument for Parachute Cords Dynamic Load for Stepless Parachute Opening","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0084/v1","date":1725263774000,"content":"Spacecraft recovery technology is crucial in the field of aerospace, in which the parachute plays a key role in slowing down the descent speed of the spacecraft and realizing a smooth landing. In order to construct a dynamically adjustable parachute deployment strategy, it is necessary to measure the parachute dynamic load accurately in real time. However, the existing sensor measurement scheme is difficult to meet the measurement requirements due to its large structure and complex wiring. In order to meet the current demand for real-time measurement of parachute cords dynamic load, a miniature measuring instrument is designed.According to the function and technical requirements of the miniature measuring instrument, the hardware modules of the acquisition system are selected and designed, and the integration debugging and performance optimization of the microcontroller module, A/D sampling module, signal acquisition circuit and power supply module are carried out. The software of the parachute cords tension acquisition system based on the miniature measuring instrument is developed. The elastomer is modeled by using SolidWorks and statically analyzed by using AnsysWorkbench finite element analysis software. Then the final structure of the elastomer and the pasting position of the strain gage are determined through the results analysis as well as experimental verification. The hardware module of the signal acquisition system for the miniature measuring instrument is then encapsulated. The force value of the miniature measuring instrument is calibrated and tested many times by using the microcomputer-controlled electronic universal testing machine. The experimental results show that the designed miniature measuring instrument has accurate data, strong stability and good real-time performance, which meets the demand for real-time accurate measurement of miniature measuring instrument, and can provide reliable data for parachute cords parameter validation and stepless unfolding design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a1fc48beea087c58a596d242238fcc41e4e7712ce011c5ecab7545d55bf84ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
