{"title":"Gilbert&rsquo;s Syndrome: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0500/v1","date":1715216239000,"content":"Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is a common hereditary condition characterized by mild increases in serum bilirubin levels due to inherited defects in bilirubin metabolism. This review, based on data from peer-reviewed articles and journals spanning from 1977 to January 2024, provides a comprehensive overview of over four decades of research on GS. Early studies primarily focused on defining the clinical and genetic characteristics of the syndrome, laying the foundation for subsequent investigations. More recent research has delved into the genetic mechanisms underlying the reduced expression of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which has significantly enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of GS. Furthermore, recent studies have shed light on the clinical implications of GS, including its association with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and mortality risk, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic factors, bilirubin metabolism, and clinical outcomes. Despite its generally benign nature, thorough research is essential to fully understand the impact of GS on patients' lives. This review emphasizes the importance of ongoing research to deepen our understanding of GS and its broader implications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cf1d0d5b30df1dd58c6ba7254cebb8b3f8e51a410f60fcf739a0ca1a82c23ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
