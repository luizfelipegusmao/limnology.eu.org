{"title":"In-situ heating-and-electron tomography for materials research: from 3D (in-situ 2D) to 4D (in-situ 3D)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/2/133/7625269?rss=1","date":1709164800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>In-situ</span> observation has expanded the application of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and has made a significant contribution to materials research and development for energy, biomedical, quantum, etc. Recent technological developments related to <span>in-situ</span> TEM have empowered the incorporation of three-dimensional observation, which was previously considered incompatible. In this review article, we take up heating as the most commonly used external stimulus for <span>in-situ</span> TEM observation and overview recent <span>in-situ</span> TEM studies. Then, we focus on the electron tomography (ET) and <span>in-situ</span> heating combined observation by introducing the authors’ recent research as an example. Assuming that <span>in-situ</span> heating observation is expanded from two dimensions to three dimensions using a conventional TEM apparatus and a commercially available <span>in-situ</span> heating specimen holder, the following <span>in-situ</span> heating-and-ET observation procedure is proposed: (i) use a rapid heating-and-cooling function of a micro-electro-mechanical system holder; (ii) heat and cool the specimen intermittently and (iii) acquire a tilt-series dataset when the specimen heating is stopped. This procedure is not too technically challenging and can have a wide range of applications. Essential technical points for a successful 4D (space and time) observation will be discussed through reviewing the authors’ example application.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"7096ae500c7035ccf04e432fa6262bdee390867ebff21f20e1870956163fd176","category":"Environment"}
