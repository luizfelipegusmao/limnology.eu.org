Dogs can also identify humans by body odor, and in some instances, humans can identify other humans by body odor as well. Despite the potential for a powerful biometric tool, smell has not been systematically used for this purpose. A question arising in the application of smell to biometrics is which bodily odor source should we measure. Breath is an obvious candidate, but the associated humidity can challenge many sensing devices. The armpit is also a candidate source, but it is often doused in cosmetics. Here, we test the hypothesis that the ear may provide an effective source for odor-based biometrics. The inside of the ear has relatively constant humidity, cosmetics are not typically applied inside the ear, and critically, ears contain cerumen, a potent source of volatiles. We used an electronic nose to identify 12 individuals within and across days, using samples from the armpit, lower back, and ear. In an identification setting where chance was 8.33% (1 of 12), we found that we could identify a person by the smell of their ear within a day at up to ~87% accuracy (~10 of 12, binomial <span>P</span> &lt; 10<sup>âˆ’5</sup>), and across days at up to ~22% accuracy (~3 of 12, binomial <span>P</span> &lt; 0.012). We conclude that humans can indeed be identified from the smell of their ear, but the results did not imply a consistent advantage over other bodily odor sources.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"92706c848270f58240c8e939d0082a55646e88fc84f4dbf5f714278537a0e1ee","category":"Environment"}
