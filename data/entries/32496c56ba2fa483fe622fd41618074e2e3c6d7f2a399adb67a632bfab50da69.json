There are too few control and experimental volumes to utilize statistics and test null hypotheses. To help overcome this limitation Health Technology Innovations, Inc. (HTI) seeks to automate data collection and improve data handling and processing. vEM image acquisition and processing relies on a suite of software tools. For image acquisition, software packages like SerialEM and Leginon facilitate the automated control of electron microscopes, allowing for the collection of image stacks. These tools include real-time visualization and navigation features. While there are multiple open source software packages for image processing, there are few to no open source software solutions that allow for real time image processing with automated microscope control.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"32496c56ba2fa483fe622fd41618074e2e3c6d7f2a399adb67a632bfab50da69","category":"Environment"}
