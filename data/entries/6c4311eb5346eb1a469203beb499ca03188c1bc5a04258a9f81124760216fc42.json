{"title":"An Updated Comprehensive Review on Diseases Associated with Nephrotic Syndromes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0619/v1","date":1725877623000,"content":"There have been exciting advances in our knowledge of primary glomerular diseases and nephrotic syndromes in recent years. Beyond the histological pattern from renal biopsy, more precise phenotyping of the diseases and the use of modern nephrogenetic helps to improve treatment decisions and sometimes also to avoid unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic immunosuppression. New Biomarkers led to easier and more accurate diagnoses and more targeted therapeutic decisions. The treatment landscape is getting wider with a pipeline of promising new therapeutic agents with more sophisticated approaches. This review focuses on all aspects of entities that are associated with nephrotic syndromes with updated information on recent advances in each field. This includes podocytopathies (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis and Minimal-Change Disease), Membranous Nephropathy, Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis, IgA-Nephropathy, Fibrillary Glomerulonephritis, Amyloidosis and monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance in the context of the nephrotic syndrome, but also renal involvement in systemic diseases, diabetic nephropathy, and drugs that are associated with nephrotic syndromes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c4311eb5346eb1a469203beb499ca03188c1bc5a04258a9f81124760216fc42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
