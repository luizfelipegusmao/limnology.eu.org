{"title":"Spatiotemporal Graph Autoencoder Network for Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1998/v3","date":1721960940000,"content":"The task of human action recognition (HAR) based on skeleton data is a challenging yet crucial technique owing to its wide-ranging applications in numerous domains, including patient monitoring, security surveillance, and observation of human-machine interactions. While numerous algorithms have been proposed in an attempt to distinguish between a myriad of activities, most practical applications necessitate highly accurate detection of specific activity types. This study proposes a novel and highly accurate spatiotemporal graph autoencoder network for HAR based on skeleton data. Furthermore, an extensive investigation was conducted employing diverse modalities. To this end, a spatiotemporal graph autoencoder was constructed to automatically learn both spatial and temporal patterns from human skeleton datasets. The powerful graph convolutional network, designated as GA-GCN, developed in this study, notably outperforms the majority of existing state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on two common datasets, namely NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120. On the first dataset, the proposed approach achieved accuracies of 92.3\\% and 96.8\\% for the cross-subject and cross-view evaluations, respectively. On the more challenging NTU RGB+D 120 dataset, GA-GCN attained accuracies of 88.8\\% and 90.4\\% for the cross-subject and cross-set evaluations, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a992dbc98ae371d0531e57adff91cbcfbd2d283ef3df2609cea1c2c43875459","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
