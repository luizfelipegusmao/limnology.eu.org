{"title":"Quantitative Imaging that Makes Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy with Nanorods a Tool for Characterization of Nanoliter Droplets and Thin Films","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.172/7719547?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Materials scientists often need to perform optical microscopy and simultaneously measure and characterize fluids of varied viscosity and volumes. <span>In situ</span> rheological characterization of minute volumes of complex liquids, such as surfactants, biopolymers, and salt solutions, can be achieved using the Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy (MRS), introduced by our group. Magnetic nanorods are attractive materials that enable the assembly, ordering, control, and reconfiguration of different magnetic lattices within milliseconds. MilliTesla magnetic fields are sufficient to manipulate these nanorods. This talk will introduce Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy (MRS), where remote-controlled rotation of magnetic nanorods coupled with advanced image processing provides a new nanoscale tool to probe different properties of liquids and solids at the micrometer scale. We introduced a novel optical microscope stage design that contains five magnetic coils and a microTesla rotating magnetic field applied within the focal plane of the microscope objective. The optical microscope stage allows to achieve on-demand cancellation of the Earthâ€™s 3D magnetic field and other ambient bias fields to more precisely analyze samples; create a minimized magnetic gradient and uniform magnetic field; and control or maintain sample exposure to environmental factors like gas content and humidity in an environmental chamber.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"991d79f4f8ca01a21fbf9b4cf9169f5c815f94896c42da1c8c1c45d16025f2e2","category":"Environment"}
