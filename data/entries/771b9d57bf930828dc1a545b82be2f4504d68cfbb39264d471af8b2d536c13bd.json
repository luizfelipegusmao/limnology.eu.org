{"title":"<i>Fruit-In-Sight</i>: A deep learning-based framework for secondary metabolite class prediction using fruit and leaf images","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308708","date":1723125600000,"content":"<p>by Neeraja M.

Analytical measurement of the metabolites is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Additionally, metabolite concentrations vary greatly from tree to tree, making it difficult to choose trees for fruit collection. The current study tested whether deep learning-based models can be developed using fruit and leaf images alone to predict a metabolite’s concentration class (<i>high</i> or <i>low</i>). We collected fruits and leaves (<i>n = 1045</i>) from neem trees grown in the wild across <i>0</i>.<i>6</i> million sq km, imaged them, and measured concentration of five metabolites (azadirachtin, deacetyl-salannin, salannin, nimbin and nimbolide) using high-performance liquid chromatography. We used the data to train deep learning models for metabolite class prediction. The best model out of the seven tested (<i>YOLOv5</i>, <i>GoogLeNet</i>, <i>InceptionNet</i>, <i>EfficientNet</i>_<i>B0</i>, <i>Resnext</i>_<i>50</i>, <i>Resnet18</i>, and <i>SqueezeNet</i>) provided a validation <i>F1</i> score of 0.93 and a test <i>F1</i> score of 0.88. The sensitivity and specificity of the fruit model alone in the test set were 83.52 ± 6.19 and 82.35 ± 5.96, and 79.40 ± 8.50 and 85.64 ± 6.21, for the <i>low</i> and the <i>high</i> classes, respectively. The sensitivity was further boosted to 92.67± 5.25 for the <i>low</i> class and 88.11 ± 9.17 for the <i>high</i> class, and the specificity to 100% for both classes, using a multi-analyte framework. We incorporated the multi-analyte model in an Android mobile App <i>Fruit-In-Sight</i> that uses fruit and leaf images to decide whether to ‘pick’ or ‘not pick’ the fruits from a specific tree based on the metabolite concentration class. Our study provides evidence that images of fruits and leaves alone can predict the concentration class of a secondary metabolite without using expensive laboratory equipment and cumbersome analytical procedures, thus simplifying the process of choosing the right tree for fruit collection.","author":"Neeraja M.
