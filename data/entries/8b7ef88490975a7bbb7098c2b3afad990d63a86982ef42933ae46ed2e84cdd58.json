{"title":"Integrated Benefits to Agriculture with Trichoderma and Other Endophytic Microbes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1475/v1","date":1713864516000,"content":"The use of endophytic microbes is increasing in commercial agriculture. This review will describe the endophyte-plant relationship and the fungi and bacteria involved. Their abilities to alleviate biotic (diseases and pests) and abiotic stresses (drought, salt and flooding), remediate pollution and increase photosynthetic capabilities will be described. Their mechanisms of action will be elucidated. These frequently result in increased plant yields. Finally, methods and practices for formulation and commercial use will be described.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b7ef88490975a7bbb7098c2b3afad990d63a86982ef42933ae46ed2e84cdd58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
