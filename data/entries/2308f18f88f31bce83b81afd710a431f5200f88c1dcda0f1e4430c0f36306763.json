{"title":"Virtual and Augmented Reality Games in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: Systematic and Bibliographic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0139/v1","date":1727859557000,"content":"The following systematic and bibliographic review investigates the intersection between the treatment of cognitive impairments and virtual and augmented reality-based game-oriented applications. The review provides a view into the last 12 years of research. The PubMed Database served as the main source for the review. We defined a comprehensive set of investigation variables and classified three main topics: bibliography, medical, and technical. Of a total of 61 identified articles, 19 were included. The findings from these studies indicate the positive effects of using virtual and augmented reality applications to improve cognitive function and depression. There is also a gap in high-quality evidence since clinical trials have been conducted only with a few patients. Preliminary results indicate positive cognitive and physical well-being effects, but the field demands further investigation to determine the effectiveness. Future research needs to focus on larger studies and the quality of the developed applications. Further, it is important to look at scores like Quality of Living and Satisfaction in Daily Activities to create a functioning environment for the patient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2308f18f88f31bce83b81afd710a431f5200f88c1dcda0f1e4430c0f36306763","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
