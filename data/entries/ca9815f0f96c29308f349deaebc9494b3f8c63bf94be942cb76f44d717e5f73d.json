{"title":"Transcriptomic characterization of the response to a microalgae extract in Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13422?af=R","date":1718692178000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The steady world population growth and the current climate emergency crisis demand the development of sustainable methods to increase crop performance and resilience to the abiotic and biotic stresses produced by global warming. Microalgal extracts are being established as sustainable sources to produce compounds that improve agricultural yield, concurrently contributing during their production process to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> abatement through the photosynthetic activity of microalgae.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In the present study, we characterize the transcriptomic response in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the plant of horticultural interest <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> to the foliar application of a microalgae-based commercial preparation LRM™ (AlgaEnergy, Madrid, Spain). The foliar spray of LRM™ has a substantial effect over both transcriptomes potentially mediated by various compounds within LRM™, including its phytohormone content, activating systemic acquired resistance, possibly mediated by salicylic acid biosynthetic processes, and drought/heat acclimatization, induced by stomatal control and wax accumulation during cuticle development. Specifically, the agronomic improvements observed in treated <i>S. lycopersicum</i> (tomato) plants include an increase in the number of fruits, an acceleration in flowering time and the provision of higher drought resistance. The effect of LRM™ foliar spray in juvenile and adult plants was similar, producing a fast response detectable 2 h from its application that was also maintained 24 h later.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study improves our knowledge on the transcriptomic effect of a novel microalgal extract on crops and provides the first step towards a full understanding of the yield and resistance improvement of crops. © 2024 The Authors. <i>Journal of The Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Christina Arvanitidou, \nMarcos Ramos‐González, \nAna B.
