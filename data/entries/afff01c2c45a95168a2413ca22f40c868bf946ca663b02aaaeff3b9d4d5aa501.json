{"title":"A Methodical Framework for Integrating Serverless Cloud Computing into Microservice Architectures","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0494/v1","date":1728313836000,"content":"In todayâ€™s world of software development technologies, serverless cloud computing with microservices is a big deal. Microservices gives modularity, agility and scalability, while serverless allows to code without having to maintain any internal hardware infrastructure, so processes are streamlined and costs are reduced by 60% compared to traditional server based systems. In this paper we looked at the challenges of microservices and serverless architecture and how to address them. We analyzed existing architectures and proposed a conceptual framework that will give you a complete solution for building scalable and efficient cloud native applications that reduces costs by 30-50%, improves resource utilization by 15-20%. Cold start latency, a common issue in serverless computing is reduced by 25% using standardized optimization techniques. This paper also compares server based and serverless technologies on scalability, resource efficiency and cost. These findings will give you a serverless approach to cloud software development and supports the trend of architectural adoption so you can have more dynamic and efficient systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afff01c2c45a95168a2413ca22f40c868bf946ca663b02aaaeff3b9d4d5aa501","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
