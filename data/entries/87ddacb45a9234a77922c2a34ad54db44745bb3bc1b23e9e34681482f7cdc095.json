Studies mainly focused on the microbial communities and functions in groundwater contaminated by PHC only. However, due to diverse raw and auxiliary materials and the complex production processes, in some petrochemical sites, groundwater suffered multi-component contamination, but the microbial structure remains unclear. To solve the problem, in the study, a petrochemical enterprise site, where the groundwater suffered multi-component pollution by PHC and sulfates, was selected. Using hydrochemistry, 16S rRNA gene, and metagenomic sequencing analyses, the relationships among electron acceptors, microbial diversity, functional genes, and their interactions were investigated. Results showed that different production processes led to different microbial structures. Overall, pollution reduced species richness but increased the abundance of specific species. The multi-component contamination multiplied a considerable number of hydrocarbon-degrading and sulfate-reducing microorganisms, and the introduced sulfates might have promoted the biodegradation of PHC.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe compound pollution of the site changed the microbial community structure.\nSulfate can promote the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms.\nThe combined contamination of petroleum hydrocarbons and sulfates will decrease the species richness but increase the abundance of endemic species.\n</p>","author":"Jinjin Ti, \nZhuo Ning, \nMin Zhang, \nShuaiwei Wang, \nShuang Gan, \nZhe Xu, \nHe Di, \nSiyu Kong, \nWeichao Sun, \nZe He","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"87ddacb45a9234a77922c2a34ad54db44745bb3bc1b23e9e34681482f7cdc095","category":"Environment"}
