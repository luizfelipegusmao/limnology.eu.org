{"title":"PSIX-9 Reciprocal Outcomes: Does companion animal-based community engaged learning provide a mutually beneficial partnership between community partners and students?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/576/7757752?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Community engaged learning (CEL) is a pedagogical approach that creates a partnership between community partners and the classroom. Students provide valuable service to their community, and in turn, develop a public purpose where they learn about respect and empathy along with learning the value of collaboration that builds on the idea of belonging. Further, CEL offers a wide range of opportunities for students to learn firsthand from industry leaders allowing community partners to become the teacher; however, documentation of the value of this relationship for both the student and community partner is based off of anecdotal evidence, rather than measured outcomes. Thus, the objective of this study was to document utilizing qualitative measures the perceived impacts of CEL activities for both the students enrolled in a CEL companion animal management course and the community partners working with the students. Students (n = 58) enrolled in a CEL companion animal management course completed a total of 10 volunteer hours during the semester working with designated community partners that included shelters/rescues, association sanctioned competitions, and animal assisted therapy programs. Students were able to select where they completed their hours with students documenting the location of their activities and number of hours spent at each location. Qualitative survey methodology was utilized for determining impacts for students and community partners. For the students, a survey was done in the form of a self-reporting open-ended question where for each hour students reported what they did and reflected on what they gained from the experience. Community partners (n = 16) were interviewed face to face by a member of the research team with questions focused on motivation concerning participation, views as to impacts, areas requiring changes, and future participation. As for student responses, all students completed the required hours with the majority of students (63.8%) spending their volunteer hours at association sanctioned competitions. The most common terms utilized within the reflections of the students concerning what they gained from the experience had to do with development of skills and confidence (Table 1). As for the community partners, the majority (56.3%) indicated they were willing to work with these students in the future that included offering internships. All community partners planned to continue working with the CEL course in future semesters and recommended additional required hours. As for reasons reported for continuing this relationship, the most common was that community partners were able to start early training potential future employees (43.8%) and that they were able to give back to the industry by working with the students (50.0%). These results support the conclusion that this pedagogical approach promotes a reciprocal relationship that is mutually beneficial for both the students and community partners engaged within companion animal-based CEL activities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"bfcbaa84e1b056935284883eed964495ad70a20967233b678bc64af6c1fb2ddc","category":"Environment"}
