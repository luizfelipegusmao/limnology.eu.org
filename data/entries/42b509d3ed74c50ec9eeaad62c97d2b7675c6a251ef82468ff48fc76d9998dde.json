{"title":"Cancer-Induced Resting Sinus Tachycardia: An Overlooked Clinical Diagnosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0359/v1","date":1715073841000,"content":"Elevated resting heart rate is frequently observed in cancer patients, and is associated with increased mortality. Although specific chemotherapeutic agents can induce cardiotoxicity, the presence of sinus tachycardia in chemotherapy-naive patients suggests other factors likely contribute to this clinical presentation. Despite its prevalence, cancer-associated resting sinus tachycardia has not been fully recognized and comprehensively described as a separate clinical entity. Secondary effects of cancer, especially structural cardiac changes, secretory factors (inflammatory cytokines), and thromboembolic disease can cause resting tachycardia. Alternatively, rapid heart rate may reflect compensatory mechanisms responding to increased metabolic demands, raised cardiac output states, and even pain. Hence, cancer-associated tachycardia presents a clinical dilemma; acute life-threatening conditions (such as sepsis, pulmonary embolism, etc.) must be ruled out, but cancer itself can explain resting sinus tachycardia and more conservative management can avoid unnecessary testing, cost and patient stress. Furthermore, identification and management of cardiac conditions associated with cancer may improve survival and the quality of life of cancer patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42b509d3ed74c50ec9eeaad62c97d2b7675c6a251ef82468ff48fc76d9998dde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
