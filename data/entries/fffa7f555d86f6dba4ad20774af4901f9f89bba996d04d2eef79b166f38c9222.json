{"title":"Seasonal patterns of phytoplankton photoacclimation in a dimictic oligotrophic lake over 5 yr: Implications for chlorophyll as an estimate of biomass","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12547?af=R","date":1710486000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Chlorophyll <i>a</i> is commonly used as a surrogate for algal biomass in lakes and oceans even though phytoplankton can readily adjust intracellular chlorophyll concentration to changes in the environment through a cellular process termed photoacclimation. Marine studies have documented fluctuations in cellular chlorophyll to year-round changes in light intensity and nutrients using the chlorophyll : carbon ratio to estimate cellular pigment density. However, similar freshwater studies are almost exclusively limited to chlorophyll : carbon ratios at the summertime deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) depth in less productive water. This study expands direct estimates of freshwater photoacclimation to all seasons of the year utilizing optically derived estimates of algal carbon and chlorophyll fluorescence from high-frequency (daily) data. We describe patterns of photoacclimation at daily, seasonal, and interannual time scales over a 5-yr period. We show that increases in chlorophyll density at the cellular level not only occurred at the DCM depth during summer stratification but were a dominant and recurring feature when the lake was vertically mixing in fall, winter, and spring. Pigment density within the mixed layer was negatively correlated with light level, indicating a photoacclimation driven response to reduced light intensity. Predicting how cellular pigment density is affected by the surrounding environment in a replicated range of lake systems is needed if chlorophyll is to be accurately used as an estimate of algal biomass in freshwaters.</p>","author":"Scott Girdner, \nJoshua Sprague","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"fffa7f555d86f6dba4ad20774af4901f9f89bba996d04d2eef79b166f38c9222","category":"Environment"}
