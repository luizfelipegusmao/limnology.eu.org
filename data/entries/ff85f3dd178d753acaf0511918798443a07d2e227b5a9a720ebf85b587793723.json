{"title":"Integrating Suspended Sludge and Fixed Film into a Biological Wastewater Treatment System to Enhance Nitrogen Removal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0668/v1","date":1725882645000,"content":"Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) technology greatly enhances nitrogen removal effectiveness and treatment capacity in municipal wastewater treatment plants, addressing the issue of limited land availability. Hence, this method is appropriate for treating household wastewater from office buildings. The research was conducted at the wastewater treatment plant in an office building in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Experiments were conducted to ascertain the most favorable working conditions, including Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), alkalinity dosage, and Dissolved Oxygen (DO). According to the study, the IFAS system had the highest nitrogen removal effectiveness when operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 hours, an alkalinity dose of 7.14 mgCaCO3/mgN-NH4+, and a dissolved oxygen (DO) value of 6 mg/L. The nitrification efficiency ranges from 89.2% to 98.8%. The nitrate concentration post-treatment is within the range of 27 â€“ 45 mg/L, which is lower than the allowable discharge limit of 60 mg/L as per Vietnam's wastewater discharge requirements. The research findings have enhanced the efficiency of the office building management process, thereby promoting the sustainable growth of society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff85f3dd178d753acaf0511918798443a07d2e227b5a9a720ebf85b587793723","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
