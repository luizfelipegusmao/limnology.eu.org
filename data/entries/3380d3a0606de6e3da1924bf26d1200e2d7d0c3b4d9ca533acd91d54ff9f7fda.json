The environmental changes-induced change in the temporal stability of above- or belowground multifunctionality was mainly derived from the temporal asynchrony of plants or soil biota, but not from species diversity.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The role of plant biodiversity in stabilizing ecosystem multifunctionality has been extensively studied; however, the impact of soil biota biodiversity on ecosystem multifunctional stability, particularly under multiple environmental changes, remains unexplored. By conducting an experiment with environmental changes (adding water and nitrogen to a long-term grazing experiment) and an experiment without environmental changes (an undisturbed site) in semi-arid grasslands, our research revealed that environmental changes-induced changes in temporal stability of both above- and belowground multifunctionality were mainly impacted by plant and soil biota asynchrony, rather than by species diversity. Furthermore, changes in temporal stability of above- and belowground multifunctionality, under both experiments with and without environmental changes, were mainly associated with plant and soil biota asynchrony, respectively, suggesting that the temporal asynchrony of plant and soil biota has independent and non-substitutable effects on multifunctional stability. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering both above- and belowground biodiversity or functions when evaluating the stabilizing effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functions.</p>","author":"Bing Wang, \nShuaifei Wang, \nLiji Wu, \nYing Wu, \nShaopeng Wang, \nYongfei Bai, \nDima Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"3380d3a0606de6e3da1924bf26d1200e2d7d0c3b4d9ca533acd91d54ff9f7fda","category":"Environment"}
