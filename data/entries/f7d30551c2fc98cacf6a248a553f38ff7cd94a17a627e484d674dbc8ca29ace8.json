{"title":"Comparative Genomics of an Emerging Multidrug-Resistant blaNDM-Producing ST182 Lineage in Enterobacter cloacae complex","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1199/v1","date":1715962512000,"content":"Background: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) are increasingly identified in hospital-acquired infections. They usually belong to four main multilocus sequence types (STs) named ST114, ST93, ST90, and ST78. Instead, ST182 has been sporadically reported, and recently outbreaks of blaNDM-producing ST182 strains have emerged. Herein, we aimed to investigate the presence of ST182 and explore its evolution and modes of blaNDM acquisition. Methods: A phylogenetic analysis of 646 MLST STs identified among 4,685 E. hormaechei WGS assemblies deposited in public repositories was performed, as well as an in silico comparative and phylogenomic analyses for 55 WGS assemblies of ST182. blaNDM-harboring contigs were also compared to published plasmid sequences. Results: ST182 E. hormaechei strains were recovered from patients in five continents during 2011-2021. They were divided into three major genomic clusters, comprising a separate clonal complex with six other STs. In 30 out of 55 ST182 WGS assemblies, blaNDM-harboring structures were identified similar to plasmids predominant in Gram-negative bacteria, harboring resistance genes to multiple antibiotic classes and virulence genes. No associations between the genomic clusters and the country/continent of isolation, the presence and the plasmid types of the blaNDM-harboring contigs were observed. Conclusions: Our findings show that ST182 E. hormaechei strains were identified the past decade worldwide; 54.5% of them carried diverse blaNDM genetic structures, suggesting recent acquisition of the blaNDM alleles. Thus, blaNDM-producing ST182 is an emerging multidrug-resistant and virulent lineage in ECC that requires close monitoring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7d30551c2fc98cacf6a248a553f38ff7cd94a17a627e484d674dbc8ca29ace8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
