{"title":"Effect of in vitro simulated digestion on the physicochemical properties and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity of fucoidan","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13297?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Fucoidan has an anti-obesity effect. However, there are few studies on its mechanism. In this study, we investigated the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> inhibitory properties of fucoidan against pancreatic lipase for the first time. We examined the changes in composition, structure, and pancreatic lipase inhibition of fucoidan during <i>in vitro</i> digestion.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Simulated saliva-gastrointestinal digestion resulted in a slight decrease in the molecular weight of fucoidan but no significant changes in the monosaccharide composition, sulfate content, and functional groups. Moreover, the digestion process significantly increased the inhibition of pancreatic lipase by fucoidan. The study on the type of inhibition showed that the inhibition of pancreatic lipase by fucoidan belonged to mixed inhibition with competitive inhibition. Molecular docking analysis showed that fucoidan could bind to the active site of pancreatic lipase.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study indicates that fucoidan can be a potential functional food for anti-obesity.
