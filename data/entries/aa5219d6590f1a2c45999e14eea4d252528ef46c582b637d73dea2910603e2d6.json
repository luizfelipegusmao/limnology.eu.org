{"title":"Nonlinear relationship of red blood cell indices (MCH, MCHC, and MCV) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality: A cohort study in U.S. adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307609","date":1722607200000,"content":"<p>by Dan Li, Aiting Wang, Yeting Li, Zhishen Ruan, Hengyi Zhao, Jing Li, Qing Zhang, Bo Wu</p>\r\nBackground <p>In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on the impact of red blood cell indices (RCIs) on disease prognosis. We aimed to investigate the association of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with mortality.</p> Methods <p>The study used cohort data from U.S. adults who participated in the 1999–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome during follow-up, with secondary cardiovascular mortality outcomes. COX regression was applied to analyze the connection between RCIs and mortality. We adopted three models to minimize potential bias. Smooth-fit curves and threshold effect analyses were utilized to observe the dose-response relationship between RCIs and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses.</p> Results <p>21,203 individuals were enrolled in our research. During an average 166.2 ± 54.4 months follow-up, 24.4% of the population died. Curve fitting indicated a U-shaped relationship between MCV and MCH with all-cause mortality, and the relationship of MCHC to all-cause mortality is L-shaped. We identified inflection points in the relationship between MCV, MCH, and MCHC and all-cause mortality as 88.56732 fl, 30.22054 pg, 34.34624 g/dl (MCV &lt;88.56732 fl, adjusted HR 0.99, 95 CI% 0.97–1.00; MCV &gt;88.56732 fl, adjusted HR 1.05, 95 CI% 1.04–1.06. MCH &lt;30.22054 pg, adjusted HR 0.95, 95 CI% 0.92–0.98; MCH &gt;30.22054 pg, adjusted HR 1.08, 95 CI% 1.04–1.12. MCHC &lt;34.34624 g/dl, adjusted HR 0.88, 95 CI% 0.83–0.93). Besides, the MCV curve was U-shaped in cardiovascular mortality (MCV &lt;88.56732 fl, adjusted HR 0.97, 95 CI% 0.94–1.00; MCV &gt;88.56732 fl, adjusted HR 1.04, 95 CI% 1.01–1.06).</p> Conclusion <p>This cohort study demonstrated that RCIs (MCH, MCHC, and MCV) were correlated with mortality in the general population. Three RCIs were nonlinearly correlated with all-cause mortality. In addition, there were nonlinear relationships between MCH and MCV and cardiovascular mortality.</p>","author":"Dan Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"aa5219d6590f1a2c45999e14eea4d252528ef46c582b637d73dea2910603e2d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
