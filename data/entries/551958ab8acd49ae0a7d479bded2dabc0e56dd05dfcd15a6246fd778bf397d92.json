{"title":"Analyzing Impacts of Marble Industry on Public Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1382/v1","date":1729168968000,"content":"A vast amount of non-biodegradable waste is generated during mining and processing operations of dimensional stones such as marble. This, over the years has become a global nuisance by damaging the environment through means of more than one. Therefore it has become necessary to find a technique to safely dispose or reuse marble waste. This paper reviews the impact of replacement of the conventional materials by marble waste was studied in terms of fresh, mechanical and durability properties of concrete. The air pollution caused by the dust generated in the process of crushing and extracting marble can cause serious problems to the general physiological functions of plants and it affects human life as well. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the air quality of areas with marble factories and areas without marble factories, where the concentration of particulate matter in terms of total suspended particles (TSP) was determined. This paper also reviews some eco-innovation options considering the pollution caused, consumption of water and electricity and the disposal of marble waste and their waste.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"551958ab8acd49ae0a7d479bded2dabc0e56dd05dfcd15a6246fd778bf397d92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
