{"title":"Thermodynamic Factors Controlling Electron Transfer amongst the Terminal Electron Acceptors of Photosystem I: Insight from Kinetic Modelling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0661/v1","date":1723426283000,"content":"Photosystem I is a key component of primary energy conversion in oxygenic photosynthesis. Electron transfer reactions in Photosystem I take place across two, parallel, electron transfer chains that converge after a few electron transfer steps, sharing both the terminal electron acceptors, that are a series of three Iron-Sulphur (Fe-S) clusters known as , and , and the terminal donor, . The two electron transfer chains show kinetic differences which are, due to their close geometrical symmetry, mainly attributable to the tuning of the physical-chemical reactivity of the bound cofactors, exerted by the protein surroundings. The factors controlling the rate of electron transfer between the terminal Fe-S clusters are still not fully understood because of the difficulties of monitoring these events directly. Here we present a discussion concerning the driving forces associated to electron transfer between and as well as and , employing a tunnelling-based description of the reaction rates coupled to the kinetic modelling of forward and recombination reactions. It is concluded that the reorganisation energy for oxidation shall be lower than 1 eV. Moreover, it is suggested that the analysis of mutants with altered redox properties can also provide useful information concerning the upstream, phylloquinone, cofactor energetics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"172be792b19f2f798e4c0e4ab1f50efcef514b13ea615e26e05afa3907d009ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
