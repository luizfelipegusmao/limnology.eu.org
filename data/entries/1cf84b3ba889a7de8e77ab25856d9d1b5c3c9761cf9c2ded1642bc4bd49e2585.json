Here, we test the importance of tolerance and resistance in multiple populations of boreal toads (<i>Anaxyrus boreas boreas</i>) against <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (Bd), the amphibian fungal pathogen responsible for the greatest host biodiversity loss due to disease.\n\nBoreal toads have severely declined in Colorado (CO) due to Bd, but toad populations challenged with Bd in western Wyoming (WY) appear to be less affected. We used a common garden infection experiment to expose post-metamorphic toads sourced from four populations (2 in CO and 2 in WY) to Bd and monitored changes in mass, pathogen burden and survival for 8 weeks. We used a multi-state modelling approach to estimate weekly survival and transition probabilities between infected and cleared states, reflecting a dynamic infection process that traditional approaches fail to capture.\n\nWe found that WY boreal toads are more tolerant to Bd infection with higher survival probabilities than those in CO when infected with identical pathogen burdens. WY toads also appeared more resistant to Bd with a higher probability of infection clearance and an average of 5 days longer to reach peak infection burdens. Our results demonstrate strong intraspecific differences in tolerance and resistance that likely contribute to why population declines vary regionally across this species.\n\nOur multi-state framework allowed us to gain inference on typically hidden disease processes when testing for host tolerance or resistance. Our findings demonstrate that describing an entire host species as ‘tolerant’ or ‘resistant’ (or lack thereof) is unwise without testing for intraspecific variation.\n</p>","author":"Bennett M.
