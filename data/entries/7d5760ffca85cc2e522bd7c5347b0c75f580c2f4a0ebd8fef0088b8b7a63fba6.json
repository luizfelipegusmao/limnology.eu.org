{"title":"Analytical solution of fuzzy heat problem in two-dimensional case under Caputo-type fractional derivative","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301719","date":1713535200000,"content":"<p>by Muhammad Nadeem, Chen Yilin, Devendra Kumar, Yahya Alsayyad</p>\r\n\r\nThis work aims to investigate the analytical solution of a two-dimensional fuzzy fractional-ordered heat equation that includes an external diffusion source factor. We develop the Sawi homotopy perturbation transform scheme (SHPTS) by merging the Sawi transform and the homotopy perturbation scheme. The fractional derivatives are examined in Caputo sense. The novelty and innovation of this study originate from the fact that this technique has never been tested for two-dimensional fuzzy fractional ordered heat problems. We presented two distinguished examples to validate our scheme, and the solutions are in fuzzy form. We also exhibit contour and surface plots for the lower and upper bound solutions of two-dimensional fuzzy fractional-ordered heat problems. The results show that this approach works quite well for resolving fuzzy fractional situations.","author":"Muhammad Nadeem","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7d5760ffca85cc2e522bd7c5347b0c75f580c2f4a0ebd8fef0088b8b7a63fba6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
