{"title":"Red Code Management in Pediatric Emergency Department: A Retrospective Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1265/v1","date":1710990656000,"content":"The “red code” (RD) represents the highest levels of emergency in the emergency department (ED). The study retrospectively analyzed RDs in the Regina Margherita Children’s Hospital ED, a regional referral center in north Italy, between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2023. The aim was to describe RD characteristics and to identify significant correlations between presenting complaints and clinical management. The study includes 934 RDs (0.9% of overall ED admissions); 64% were assigned based on the Pediatric Assessment Triangle alteration. Most patients, 86.5%, followed the medical pathway, while 13.5% were surgical cases. Admission complaints were respiratory (46.9%), neuropsychiatric (26.7%), traumatic (11.8%), cardiologic (9.3%), metabolic (3.8%), and surgical (1.5%). Seventy-six per cent of patients received vascular access, and intraosseous access was obtained in 2.2% of them. In one-third of RDs, an urgent critical care evaluation was necessary, and 19% of cases required admission to the intensive care unit. The overall mortality rate was 3.4% (0.4% in ED setting). The study identified six distinct diagnostic pathways, each associated with specific characteristics in clinical presentation, management, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes: this underscored the significance of a systematic approach in improving outcomes in pediatric RD management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df81bca79550fa23928b1c702baf23425b66c38b9dc7d7a31bf736aebe6afaef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
