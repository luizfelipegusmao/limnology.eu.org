{"title":"Exploring Seizure Dynamics: A Computational Model of Epilepsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1557/v1","date":1713928334000,"content":"This article encapsulates an exploration of seizure dynamics through the lens of computational modeling in epilepsy. Starting with a foundational understanding of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, asimplified representation of neuronal activity, we try to understand the intricacies of epileptic seizures. We methodically demonstrated the transition from normal neuronal activity to a seizure-like state by altering key parameters in the model, such as external current and coupling strength. This was followed by an extension of the model to a network of neurons, simulating the complex interactions and synchronization patterns indicative of seizure propagation. Numerical simulations were conducted to visualize the impact of varying coupling strengths on network dynamics, offering insights into the mechanisms of seizure initiation and spread. The study was complemented by a discussion on the implications of these findings for understanding epilepsy, highlighting the bridging of theoretical models with clinical understanding. Our approach not only illuminates the potential of computational models in epilepsy research but also underscores the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing our comprehension of neurological disorders. Through this article, we aim to provide a nuanced perspective on the modeling of epileptic seizures, offering a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27cc6051255821e104d5bb29ebf7bffec30ac658bafcc15c8e9e4623e4103106","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
