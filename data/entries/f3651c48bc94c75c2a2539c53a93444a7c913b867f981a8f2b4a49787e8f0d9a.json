{"title":"A Study of the Ecological Security Based on the DPSIR (Driver Pressure State Impact Response) Framework Fit for Marine Environmental Protection Evaluation Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0266/v1","date":1727954228000,"content":"This research uses the DPSIR framework to analyse and anticipate Taiwan's marine ecosystems' ecological security. The goal is to understand how human-induced pressures including pollution, overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change affect Taiwan's marine habitats. For Taiwanese maritime ecological security assessments, the DPSIR framework, case studies, and assessment models are used. The DPSIR model classifies human activities, environmental pressures, marine ecosystem states, effects, and reactions. Assessment models complement the DPSIR framework for systematic and quantitative evaluation, while case studies are practical. This systematic literature review follows PRISMA guidelines for thoroughness and organisation. The research shows the DPSIR framework's adaptability and efficacy in analysing Taiwan's complex marine biological processes. Human-induced stressors on marine states are revealed via a comprehensive examination of causes, pressures, states, consequences, and responses, contributing to ecological security discourse. The DPSIR model helps Taiwan identify environmental change sources, analyse pressures, and provide sustainable marine environmental management solutions. The research concludes that the DPSIR framework is crucial to Taiwan's maritime environmental preservation. Despite its strengths, the DPSIR framework has to be refined and customised to Taiwan's unique maritime environments. Taiwan's maritime protection policies are shaped by the study's evidence-based findings. The report also recommends combining the DPSIR framework with SWOT analysis to improve evaluation and decision-making in Taiwan's marine environmental protection setting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3651c48bc94c75c2a2539c53a93444a7c913b867f981a8f2b4a49787e8f0d9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
