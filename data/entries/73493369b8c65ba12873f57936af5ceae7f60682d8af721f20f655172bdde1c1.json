{"title":"Fluid dynamics and leukocyte transit in the lymphatic system","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae195/7675726?rss=1","date":1715904000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The lymphatic system plays a vital role in maintaining fluid balance in living tissue and serves as a pathway for the transport of antigen, immune cells, and metastatic cancer cells. In this study, we investigate how the movement of cells through a contracting lymphatic vessel differs from steady flow, using a lattice Boltzmann-based computational model. Our model consists of cells carried by flow in a 2D vessel with regularly spaced, bi-leaflet valves that ensure net downstream flow as the vessel walls contract autonomously in response to calcium and nitric oxide levels regulated by stretch and shear stress levels. The orientation of the vessel with respect to gravity, which may oppose or assist fluid flow, significantly modulates cellular motion due to its effect on the contraction dynamics of the vessel, even when the cells themselves are neutrally buoyant. Additionally, our model shows that cells are carried along with the flow, but when the vessel is actively contracting, they move faster than the average fluid velocity. We also find that the fluid forces cause significant deformation of the compliant cells, especially in the vicinity of the valves. Our study highlights the importance of considering the complex, transient flows near the valves in understanding cellular motion in lymphatic vessels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"73493369b8c65ba12873f57936af5ceae7f60682d8af721f20f655172bdde1c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
