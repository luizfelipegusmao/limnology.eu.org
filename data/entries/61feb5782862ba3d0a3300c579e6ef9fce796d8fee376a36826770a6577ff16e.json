{"title":"Transforming the rhetoric of Just Energy Transition Partnerships into reality: The devil lies in the details","link":"https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/article?id=10.1371/journal.pstr.0000121","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Aparajita Banerjee</p>\r\n\r\nUrgent political action is required to arrest the rise in global temperature within the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement. Rising to this challenge, a series of Just Transition Energy Partnerships (JETPs) was launched between individual Global South and a group of Global North countries since COP 26 in Glasgow. Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union (International Partner Group or IPG countries) have established plurilateral partnerships with individual countries like South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Senegal in each JETP. These partnerships aim to help IPG countries provide long-term support to partner countries in the Global South to disengage from coal and convert to renewables for electricity generation. However, though ’just transitions’ and ’partnerships’ are potent ideas to drive such processes, it is challenging to translate these ideas from political rhetoric to policies. This paper argues that JETPs are treading on a narrow edge with a high chance of re-instantiating some of the criticism of partnerships between Global North and Global South countries that can detrimentally affect the chances of just transition. Based on academic literature on partnerships and just transition, the paper concludes that the devil lies in the details. Formalizing processes that deliver a just and fair energy transition should align with the Global South countries’ social, economic, and political realities.","author":"Aparajita Banerjee","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"61feb5782862ba3d0a3300c579e6ef9fce796d8fee376a36826770a6577ff16e","category":"Environment"}
