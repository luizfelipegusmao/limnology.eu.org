{"title":"Elucidating Electrostatics at Grain Boundaries in Perovskite Solid Electrolytes Using 4D-STEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.926/7720199?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are poised to become the next generation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [<a href=\"#ozae044.926-B1\">1-3</a>], where solid electrolytes play a critical role in determining their properties. Grain boundaries (GBs), which can significantly hinder Li-ion transport, are the bottleneck in improving the ionic conductivities of solid electrolytes. Thus, the atomic structure and electrostatic characteristics of GBs have become pivotal areas of study in materials science. Recently, compositionally complex ceramics, including high-entropy materials, have garnered interest for developing high-performance solid electrolytes [<a href=\"#ozae044.926-B3\">3-5</a>]. For example, (Li<sub>0.375</sub>Sr<sub>0.4375</sub>)(Ta<sub>0.375</sub>Nb<sub>0.375</sub>Zr<sub>0.125</sub>Hf<sub>0.125</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> (LSTNZH) has shown potential in enhancing GB ionic conductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.926-B6\">6</a>], which can be further improved through quenching. By applying state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), specifically four-dimensional (4D) STEM, we present an in-depth study of the atomic structure and electrostatic properties of GBs in quenched LSTNZH. Our work reveals the reasons for the enhanced ionic conductivity of air-quenched LSTNZH, providing deeper insights into the development of next-generation solid-state electrolytes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"340d6f6892429a1d5662c2556ec1e9920eb114485e4ef63b6946b3c1a13d0902","category":"Environment"}
