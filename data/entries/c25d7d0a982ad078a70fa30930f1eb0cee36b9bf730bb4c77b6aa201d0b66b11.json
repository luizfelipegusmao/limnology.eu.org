{"title":"From Investigating a Case of Cellulitis to Exploring Nosocomial Infection Control of ST1 Legionella pneumophila Using Genomic Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0136/v1","date":1712035596000,"content":"Legionella pneumophila can cause a large panel of symptoms beside the classic pneumonia presentation. We present here a case of fatal nosocomial cellulitis in an immunocompromised patient followed, a year later, by a second case of legionnairesâ€™ disease in the same ward. While the first one was easily assumed as nosocomial based on the date of symptoms onset, the other case needed to rely on clear typing results to be either assigned as nosocomial and related to the same environmental source as the first one, or community acquired. To untangle this specific question, we applied Core-genome MultiLocus Typing (MLST), whole-genome Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and whole-genome MLST methods to a collection of 36 Belgian and 41 international sequence-type 1 (ST1) isolates using both thresholds recommended in the literature and tailored threshold based on local epidemiological data. Based on the thresholds applied to cluster isolates together, the three methods gave different results and no firm conclusion about the nosocomial setting of the second case could been drawn. Our data highlight that despite promising results in the study of outbreaks and for large scale epidemiological investigations, NGS typing methods applied to ST1 outbreak investigation still need standardization regarding both wet-lab protocols and bioinformatics. A deeper evaluation of L. pneumophila evolutionary clock is also required to increase our understanding of genomic differences between isolates sampled during a clinical infection and in environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c25d7d0a982ad078a70fa30930f1eb0cee36b9bf730bb4c77b6aa201d0b66b11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
