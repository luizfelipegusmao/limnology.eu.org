{"title":"Tolerance Mechanisms of Olive Tree (Olea europaea) Under Saline Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2016/v1","date":1717050834000,"content":"The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is an evergreen tree that occupies 19% of the woody crop area and is cultivated in 67 countries on five continents. The largest olive production is concentrated in the Mediterranean basin, where the olive tree has had an enormous economic, cultural and environmental impact since the 7th century BC. In the Mediterranean region, salinity stands out as one of the main abiotic stress factors significantly affecting agricultural production. Moreover, climate change is expected to lead to increased salinisation in this region, threatening olive productivity. Salt stress causes combined damage by osmotic stress and ionic toxicity, restricting olive growth and interfering with multiple metabolic processes. A large variability in salinity tolerance among olive cultivars has been described. This paper aims to synthesize information from the published literature on olive adaptations to salt stress and its importance in salinity tolerance. The morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of olive tolerance to salt stress are reviewed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9772a77b5ea2d1333f6f39adb2b524fd821f2695aff2ae6e77a1254d9b5f44c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
