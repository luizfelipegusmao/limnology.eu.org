{"title":"Production of Oncolytic Measles Virus in Vero Cells: Impact of Culture Medium and Multiplicity of Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1845/v1","date":1727146143000,"content":"Oncolytic measles virus (MeV) is a promising anti-cancer treatment. However, the production of high titers of infectious MeV (typically 107–109 TCID50 per dose) is challenging because the virus is unstable under typical production conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate how the multiplicity of infection (MOI) and different media – serum-containing (SCM), serum-free (SFM) and chemically-defined (CDM) – affect MeV production. We infected Vero cells at MOIs of 0.02, 0.2 or 2 TCID50 mL-1 and the lowest MOI resulted in the largest number of infected cells towards the end of the production period. However, this did not equate to higher maximum MeV titers, which were similar for all MOIs. The medium had a moderate effect, generating maximum titers of 0.89–2.17 × 106, 1.08–1.25 × 106 and 4.58–9.90 × 105 TCID50 mL‑1 for SCM, SFM and CDM, respectively. Infection at a low MOI often required longer process times to reach maximum yields. Our findings show that SCM, SFM and CDM are equally suitable for MeV production in terms of yield and process time. This will allow MeV production in serum-free conditions, addressing the safety risks and ethical concerns associated with the use of serum.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2e61739f8a7bcf7ba988bf0adbd026527c2e2202df147987affa02bc1f0fe05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
