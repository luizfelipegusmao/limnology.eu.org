{"title":"Molecular Mechanisms of Cadmium Toxicity on Living Organisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1332/v1","date":1729152570000,"content":"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal primarily found as a by-product of zinc production. Cd was a proven carcinogen, and exposure to this metal has been linked to various adverse health effects, which were first reported in the mid-19th century and thoroughly investigated by the 20th century. The toxicokinetics and dynamics of Cd reveal its propensity for long biological retention and predominant storage in soft tissues. Cd pollution, primarily from industrial activities, strongly contaminates soil and water and affects human health and ecosystems. Cd enters the human body mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with food and tobacco smoke being the primary sources. It accumulates in various organs, particularly the kidney and liver, and is known to cause severe health problems, including renal dysfunction, bone diseases, cardiovascular problems, and many others. On a cellular level, Cd disrupts numerous biological processes, inducing oxidative stress generation and DNA damage. This comprehensive review explores Cd pollution, accumulation, distribution, and biological impacts on bacteria, fungi, edible mushrooms, plants, animals, and humans on a molecular level. Molecular aspects of carcinogenesis, apoptosis, autophagy, specific gene expression, stress protein synthesis, and ROS formation caused by Cd were discussed as well. This paper also summarizes how Cd is removed from contaminated environments and the human body.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d79fde7cc8d28408f24be9d9594ae03eaa8a10fe73e7dada51addaa6f11f269d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
