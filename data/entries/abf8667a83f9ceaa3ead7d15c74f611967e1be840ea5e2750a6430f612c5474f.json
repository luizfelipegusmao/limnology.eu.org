{"title":"Exploring the Integration of a Nuptial Bond Between Neuroprediction and AI in Criminal Justice: A Review Study Conducted for Indian Judiciary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0409/v1","date":1715247148000,"content":"The prognostic abilities of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience in the forensics and the criminal justice system stand as a reformatory paradigm for understanding any criminal conduct. While the use of Artificial Intelligence has been labeled as having transformational data analytical capabilities, neural predictive approaches also enable an intricate understanding of culpability and criminal propensities. Literature on the complex nature of Neuroprediction and Artificial Intelligence, its ethical deliberations and its usability in curving recidivism are analyzed. This review study elucidates their complex interplay, nuptial relationship and convergence of such in the quest for Justice. Consequences of not protecting  individual rights in the criminal justice system are surveyed using grounded theory. Degree of acceptability and dependability of AI-generated evidences in legal proceedings are also reviewed. All these topics are yet to be contemplated under one roof to offer an argumentative view. The author expects to prompt readers and new commers to embrace more sociolegal and technological researches before incorporating such in Indian Judiciary. The review focuses on the quandary of whether to blame such technology inclusion wholly or rather to prioritize the acquisition of bias-free pretrained datasets and processing models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abf8667a83f9ceaa3ead7d15c74f611967e1be840ea5e2750a6430f612c5474f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
