{"title":"Investigating the <i>in vitro</i> antibacterial, antibiofilm, antioxidant, anticancer and antiviral activities of zinc oxide nanoparticles biofabricated from <i>Cassia javanica</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310927","date":1727791200000,"content":"<p>by Mohammed S.

Salem</p>\r\n\r\nIt is thought to be risk-free, environmentally benign, and safe for biological processes to produce zinc oxide nanoparticles from renewable resources. This study examined <i>Cassia javanica’s</i> ability to create ZnONPs. The generated ZnONPs were analyzed using a variety of techniques, such as TEM, FTIR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and XRD analysis. The antibacterial potential of ZnONPs has been investigated using both Agar well diffusion and microtitreplate (MTP) methods. One method used to evaluate ZnONPs’ capacity to scavenge free radicals at different concentrations was the DPPH method. The permanent zinc oxide (ZnO) shape and the naturally occurring crystal structure of ZnONPs were validated by the XRD data. ZnONPs showed antibacterial activity with MICs of 31.7 μg/mL toward <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, 62.5 μg/mL for <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> while <i>Clostridium sporogenes</i> and <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> was 125μg/mL. Furthermore, ZnONPs demonstrated a range of antibiofilm activities toward <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). ZnONPs showed an intriguing antioxidant capacity, achieving IC<sub>50</sub> of 109.3 μg/ml μg/mL. Additionally, ZnONPs demonstrated low toxic effect on Vero cell with IC<sub>50</sub> 154.01 μg/mL as well as possible anticancer action when applied to the carcinoma cell lines HepG2 with IC<sub>50</sub> of 47.48 μg/mL. Furthermore, ZnONPs at 62.5 μg/mL had a promising antiviral impact against HSV1 and COX B4, with antiviral activities of 75.4% and 65.8%, respectively.","author":"Mohammed S.
