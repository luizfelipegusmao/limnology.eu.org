{"title":"Water-Filling Characteristics and Water Source of Weakly Rich Water and Weakly Conducting Water Aquifers in the Changxing Formation after Mining Damage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0266/v2","date":1715567416000,"content":"The escalation of mining activities in the karst regions of Guizhou Province has heightened the occurrence of water-inrush incidents in deep coal mines. This study focused on water-inrush phenomena within the Xinhua mining area of Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, aiming to investigate the sources of these incidents. The findings indicated that the overlying limestone of the Changxing Formation in the coal seam served as a vulnerable aquifer under certain conditions, leading to water inrushes. The analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of water-inrush incidents at the working face indicated that previous mining operations damaged the shallow Changxing Formation limestone, resulting in the accumulation of goaf water and the formation of numerous mining-induced fractures. These fractures served as rapid conduits for water inrushes from both atmospheric precipitation and underground sources at the deep working face. The examination of surface water and mine water quality demonstrated that both exhibited similar characteristics, predominantly featuring bicarbonate, sulfate, and sodium compositions. Investigation into the relationship between mine water inflow and atmospheric precipitation established that atmospheric precipitation influenced the mine water supply cycle, with a replenishment period of ~10 months during the operational phase of the Jinyuan Coal Mine and about one month post-closure. The fractures induced by mining activities within the Changxing Formation limestone facilitated water flow, with atmospheric precipitation serving as the primary water source for the mine. This study offered a valuable scientific foundation for addressing water-related damage resulting from atmospheric precipitation in mines susceptible to water inrushes under analogous hydrogeological conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0337a08af9ac0cbe7a4e918322a7a1513c6e9826c22d326624b23f8132148f63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
