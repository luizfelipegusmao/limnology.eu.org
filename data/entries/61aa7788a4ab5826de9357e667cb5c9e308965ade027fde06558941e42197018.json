Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces of infected individuals, and high volume of passengers travelling by air, make it possible to detect virus from aircraft wastewater, lending itself to the potential identification of a novel pathogen prior to clinical diagnosis. In this study, we estimated the likelihood of detecting the virus through aircraft wastewater from the probabilities of air travel, viral shedding, defecation, testing sensitivity, and sampling. We considered various hypothetical scenarios, with diverse sampling proportions of inbound flights, surveillance airports, and sources of outbreaks. Our calculations showed that the probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 would increase exponentially against time in the early phase of the pandemic, and would be much higher if the 20 major airports in Asia, Europe, and North America cooperated to perform aircraft wastewater surveillance. We also found other contributors to early detection, including high sampling proportion of inbound flight at destination airports, small population size of the epicentre relative to the travel volume, and large volume of outbound travelers to major airports around the globe. We concluded that routine aircraft wastewater monitoring could be a feasible approach for early identification and tracking of an emerging pathogen with high faecal shedding rates, particularly when implemented through a global surveillance network of major airports.","author":"Shihui Jin","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"61aa7788a4ab5826de9357e667cb5c9e308965ade027fde06558941e42197018","category":"Environment"}
