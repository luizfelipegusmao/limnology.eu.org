{"title":"Based on the Concept of Absolute Airspace Reference System Revision and Unification of Space-Time Transformation Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0603/v1","date":1718088249000,"content":"This paper is based on the concept of absolute airspace and its local absolute stationary reference system proposed by the author, on the premise of abandoning space concept and the relativity principle of relativity theory, It is proposed that general relativity and special relativity can be unified into Simple and practical a space-time transformation theory which fully includes other basic physical principles of relativity. And the unified and simple expression of the time transformation effect is proved and deduced. By comparing with the theoretical derivation and checking calculation of Hafele-Keating experiment in an ideal state, It is proved that the expression of time transformation effect proposed in this paper is completely correct. Compared with the theory of relativity, the calculation is simpler and more accurate. The paper also puts forward two checking prediction of physical cases about the time transformation effect, which are left for the capable competent unit or individual to verify in practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba205e8277c0aa4cd0ef386dd6fe95641dfe6862faca4bc7f8a912a2b432e9bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
