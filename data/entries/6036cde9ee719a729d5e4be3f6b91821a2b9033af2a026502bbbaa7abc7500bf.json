{"title":"Revision of Robotic Prostheses Manufactured with 3D Printing: Advances, Challenges and Future Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1220/v1","date":1726482404000,"content":"3D printing has significantly transformed the design and manufacture of robotic prostheses, making these devices more accessible, customized, and functional. This paper examines the historical evolution of prosthetic technology, tracing its development from rudimentary mechanical devices to the integration of advanced technologies, such as 3D printing. This innovation has enabled the production of prostheses at lower costs while enhancing their adaptability and performance. The review highlights how 3D printing has driven a disruptive shift in prosthetic customization, and how emerging technologies—including smart materials and artificial intelligence—have expanded the capabilities of prosthetic devices, offering more adaptive and natural movement. However, challenges persist, particularly regarding the need for standardization and infrastructure expansion to ensure equitable access to these technologies. Future research into novel materials and manufacturing techniques holds the potential to improve further the functionality, affordability, and accessibility of prosthetic devices. In conclusion, while 3D printing has marked a significant milestone in the evolution of robotic prosthetics, overcoming existing challenges is essential to realize its global impact and benefits fully.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6036cde9ee719a729d5e4be3f6b91821a2b9033af2a026502bbbaa7abc7500bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
