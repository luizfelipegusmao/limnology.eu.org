{"title":"Post-Translational Modifications of Cysteine Residues in Plant Proteins and Their Impact on the Regulation of Metabolism and Signal Transduction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0509/v1","date":1723032587000,"content":"Cys is one of the least abundant amino acids in proteins. However, it is often highly conserved and usually found in important structural and functional regions of proteins. Its unique chemical properties allow it to undergo several post-translational modifications, many of which mediated by reactive oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or carbonyl species. Thus, in addition to their role in catalysis, protein stability and metal binding, Cys residues are crucial for redox regulation of metabolism and signal transduction. In this review, we discuss Cys post-translational modifications (PTMs) and their role in plant metabolism and signal transduction. These modifications include oxidation of the thiol group (S-sulfenylation, S-sulfinylation and S-sulfonylation), the formation of disulfide bridges, S-glutathionylation, persulfidation, S-cyanylation S-nitrosation, S-carbonylation, S-acylation, prenylation, CoAlation as well as the formation of thiohemiacetal. For each of these PTMs, we discuss the origin of the modifier, the mechanisms involved in PTM, as well as their reversibility. Examples of the involvement of Cys ​​PTMs in the modulation of protein structure, function, stability, and localization are presented to highlight their importance in the regulation of plant metabolic and signaling pathways.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc4245546f317273c819fc2e382349495f27ca72d315f8410419e732abc8f314","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
