{"title":"Lack of Efficacy of Albenzole Against Dicrocoelium dendriticum Infection in a Sheep Farm in France","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1922/v1","date":1716958727000,"content":"Dicrocoeliosis is a common parasitic disease in European sheep farming. The prevalence of infec-tion by this parasite can reach almost 70% in areas where the environment is favourable to inter-mediate hosts. In France, only one drug is currently available for the treatment of dicrocoeliosis, albendazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg in a single administration. However, a control coproscopy fol-lowing a routine treatment led us to suspect that the efficacy of albendazole against Dicrocoelium dendriticum had diminished. \nWe therefore carried out an efficacy test on 15 animals by treating them with albendazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg and performing a coproscopy on D0 and a control coproscopy 14 days later. \nWe obtained a 38% reduction in the excretion of Dicrocoelium dendriticum eggs. This shows a re-duction in the expected efficacy of albendazole, which is normally more than 90% in other studies involving this molecule at a dosage of 15 mg/kg.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e0baee4261f53263d53d069c4eccbb0e29e84ae55c9219516ab1513e938f82f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
