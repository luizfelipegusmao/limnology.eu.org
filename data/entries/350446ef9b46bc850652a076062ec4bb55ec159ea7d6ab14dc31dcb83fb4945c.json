{"title":"In Search of Easily Accessible and Reliable Malignancy Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsies: The Case of miRNAs in Extracellular Vesicles in the Plasma of Patients with Papillary Thyroid Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0157/v1","date":1722594088000,"content":"Background: The incidence of various types of cancer, for example papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), is on the rise. Since therapeutic success depends greatly on early diagnosis, reliable diag-nostic biomarkers must be identified and easy-to-apply tools for detecting them must urgently be standardized. Here, we contribute to solving this medical challenge by assessing miRNAs sus-pected of promoting carcinogenesis in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be routinely obtained via liquid biopsy. We profit from current progress in cancerology that provides innovations in liquid biopsy and EVs analysis along with identification of miRNAs and chaperone system (CS) components implicated in carcinogenesis. Methods: We measured in EVs obtained from circulat-ing blood plasma from PTC patients the levels of three miRNAs implicated in thyroid cancer, miR-1, miR-206, and miR-221, and most likely involved in the regulation of two members of the CS, Hsp60 and CCT. EVs were isolated from the plasma of patients with PTC and controls with benign goiter (BG), and from the culture medium of a PTC cell line (MDAT32) and were duly characterized. Results: The levels of miRNAs determined by RT-qPCR were consistently higher in PTC patients and decreased down to control levels after thyroidectomy. Bioinformatics showed that the miRNAs target genes were associated to the molecular pathogenesis of PTC. Conclusions: Thus, our exploratory study reaffirms the potential in clinics of the selected miRNAs in EVs as useful biomarkers of PTC easily accessible via liquid biopsy, which is minimally invasive and amenable to periodic repetition, an improvement compared to the established fine-needle aspirate biopsy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"350446ef9b46bc850652a076062ec4bb55ec159ea7d6ab14dc31dcb83fb4945c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
