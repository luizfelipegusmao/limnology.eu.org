By establishing new theoretical estimates, we delve into the intricate dynamics of fluid flow, aiming to unveil previously obscured aspects of the Navier-Stokes equations. Through a rigorous mathematical framework, we explore how these new potential estimates can provide a fresh perspective on fluid mechanics, contributing to the ongoing quest to solve some of its most persistent challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d51de1638704933d066796c3a2bffb97290b12f8e05dd05b740aceb05186da9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
