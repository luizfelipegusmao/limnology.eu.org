{"title":"Viruses in Marine Invertebrate Holobionts: Complex Interactions Between Phages and Bacterial Symbionts","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-marine-021623-093133?TRACK=RSS","date":1705449600000,"content":"<div><p>Marine invertebrates are ecologically and economically important and have formed holobionts by evolving symbiotic relationships with cellular and acellular microorganisms that reside in and on their tissues. In recent decades, significant focus on symbiotic cellular microorganisms has led to the discovery of various functions and a considerable expansion of our knowledge of holobiont functions. Despite this progress, our understanding of symbiotic acellular microorganisms remains insufficient, impeding our ability to achieve a comprehensive understanding of marine holobionts. In this review, we highlight the abundant viruses, with a particular emphasis on bacteriophages; provide an overview of their diversity, especially in extensively studied sponges and corals; and examine their potential life cycles. In addition, we discuss potential phageâ€“holobiont interactions of various invertebrates, including participating in initial bacterial colonization, maintaining symbiotic relationships, and causing or exacerbating the diseases of marine invertebrates. Despite the importance of this subject, knowledge of how viruses contribute to marine invertebrate organisms remains limited. Advancements in technology and greater attention to viruses will enhance our understanding of marine invertebrate holobionts.</p></div>","author":"Kun Zhou, Ting Zhang, Xiao-Wei Chen, Ying Xu, Rui Zhang and Pei-Yuan Qian","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Marine Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9eb80ab726f60a02bd9b08dee9e5b6f873ef8500c163afcb3b194d4141df1bd1","entryHash":"b5600a2181755285def247246c1df77f8cdcceb4688dab5f23b25080c499f3e3","category":"Environment"}
