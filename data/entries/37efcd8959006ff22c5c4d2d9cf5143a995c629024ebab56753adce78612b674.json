{"title":"DeClEx-Processing Pipeline for Critical Healthcare Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0947/v1","date":1715684852000,"content":"Over the last decade, the prevalence of health issues has increased by approximately 29.1%, putting a substantial strain on healthcare services. This has accelerated the integration of machine learning in healthcare, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. The utilization of machine learning in healthcare has grown significantly, however many present approaches are unsuitable for real-world implementation due to high memory footprints and lack of interpretability. We introduce DeClEx, a pipeline designed to address these issues. DeClEx ensures that data mirrors real-world settings by incorporating gaussian noise and blur and employing autoencoders to learn intermediate feature representations. Subsequently, our convolutional neural network, paired with spatial attention, provides comparable accuracy to state of the art pre-trained models while achieving threefold improvement in training speed.   Furthermore, we provide interpretable results using explainable AI techniques. We integrate denoising and deblurring, classification and explainability in a single  pipeline called  DeClEx.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37efcd8959006ff22c5c4d2d9cf5143a995c629024ebab56753adce78612b674","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
