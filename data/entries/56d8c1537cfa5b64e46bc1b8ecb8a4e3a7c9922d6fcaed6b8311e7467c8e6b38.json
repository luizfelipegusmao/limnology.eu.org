{"title":"Dietary supplementation with short‐ and long‐chain structured lipids alleviates obesity via regulating hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation and gut microbiota in high‐fat‐diet‐induced obese mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13344?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Obesity is closely associated with lipid accumulation, inflammation and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. Short- and long-chain type structured lipids (SLCTs) are kinds of low-calorie structured lipids and demonstrate anti-obesity and hypolipidemia bioactivity. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential effects of dietary supplementation of SLCTs rich in short-chain fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids on high-fat-diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota modulation in C57BL/6J mice.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Results showed that SLCTs supplementation ameliorated body weight, dyslipidemia, liver lipid accumulation, liver injury and systemic inflammation in obese mice. As expected, immunohistochemical analysis showed that SLCTs significantly increased the expression of proliferator-activated receptor alpha and decreased the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 in liver tissue. Furthermore, SLCTs supplementation significantly downregulated the expression level of liver inflammation-related genes while upregulating the expression level of liver lipid metabolism-related genes. Additionally, SLCTs supplementation markedly enhanced the diversity of gut microbiota, reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased the diversity and richness of beneficial intestinal microorganisms, such as <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group</i>, <i>Alloprevotella</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-014</i>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our work suggested that SLCTs may have the potential to reduce obesity associated with a high-fat diet by regulating liver metabolism, inflammation and gut microbiota. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Chonghui Yue, \nYu Tang, \nMenghan Chang, \nYueyue Wang, \nHuainan Peng, \nXin Wang, \nZiyu Wang, \nXiaodan Zang, \nHongyan Ben, \nGuoping Yu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"56d8c1537cfa5b64e46bc1b8ecb8a4e3a7c9922d6fcaed6b8311e7467c8e6b38","category":"Environment"}
