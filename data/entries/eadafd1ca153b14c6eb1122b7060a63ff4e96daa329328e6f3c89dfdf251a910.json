Kobayashi</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>This study aimed to assess the localization of chondroitin sulfate (CS), a primary extracellular matrix component, in the stromal region of endometrial carcinoma (EC).</p> Methods <p>Immunostaining was performed on 26 endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) samples of different grades and 10 endometrial serous carcinoma (ESC) samples to evaluate CS localization. This was further confirmed by Alcian Blue (AB) staining as well.</p> Results <p>In the G1-EEC samples, CS showed reactivity with fibrovascular stroma, supporting closely packed glandular crowding and papillary structures. As the grade increased, the original interstitial structure was re-established, and the localization of CS in the perigulandular region decreased. In the ESC samples, the thick fibrous strands supporting the papillary architecture showed reactivity with CS; however, the delicate stromal region branching into the narrow region showed poor reactivity. The AB staining results showed similar characteristics to the immunostaining ones.</p> Conclusions <p>The characteristic localization of CS in various EC types was elucidated. The present study provides new information on endometrial stromal assessment.</p>","author":"Sho Hosokawa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"eadafd1ca153b14c6eb1122b7060a63ff4e96daa329328e6f3c89dfdf251a910","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
