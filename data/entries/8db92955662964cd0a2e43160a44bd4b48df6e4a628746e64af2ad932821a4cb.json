{"title":"Coprological Survey of Helminths in Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in 50 Selected Zoos and Menageries in Russia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0827/v1","date":1718189063000,"content":"Zoo conditions are unique for reindeer, since even domestic reindeer are not kept in captive facilities like cattle. In the zoo, reindeer are usually surrounded by many different animals they would never encounter naturally. Thus they might pick up some new helminths. Numerous petting zoos raise an issue of safety of tactile communications for human visitors. Out study is the first large-scale one. Qualitative and quantitative fecal analysis was carried out for 233 reindeer distributed over 50 Russian zoos according to National Standard of the Russian Federation (GOST R 54627-2011) Ruminant animalsâ€”Methods of Laboratory Helminthological Diagnostics. Where possible, DNA analyses of helminths were performed targeting internal transcribed spacer region. In result, F. hepatica, Paramphistomum sp., Moniezia sp. (including M. expansa), gastrointestinal strongylids (including Nematodirus spp.), Dictyocaulus sp., E. rangiferi, Trichuris sp., and Capillaria sp. were found in 106 (45%) zoo reindeer. All these helminths were previously reported for reindeer and pose no direct danger for humans. Intensity of invasions was mostly low. Fecal examination might be considered as an indirect method for mange diagnostics, as Chorioptes and Demodex mites were found in reindeer fecal samples. The latter may represent a novel species of mite specific for reindeer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8db92955662964cd0a2e43160a44bd4b48df6e4a628746e64af2ad932821a4cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
