The results from morphological observation, thermal degradation behavior, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) clearly revealed the success of PEI-immobilizing on fiber surface with no significant change in intrinsic properties of the fiber after modification. The modified fiber exhibited fast and efficient adsorption with the adsorption capacity &gt;90 mg/g which was much higher than that of the unmodified adsorbent (did not exceed 10 mg/g). The results from kinetic and isotherm studies showed that the adsorption process conformed to the pseudo-second-order, intra-particle diffusion and Langmuir models. Adsorption temperatures have less effect to the adsorption performance of the modified adsorbent. Electrostatic ion-dipole interaction between protonated amines of PEI and negative charged sites of lac dye was the main proposed mechanism. Good resistance of color changes for ABF-<i>e</i>-PEI was confirmed by the color-fastness assessment (grade 4–5), suggesting efficient method of PEI-immobilizing using ECH crosslinker. The binding reaction of between amine groups of PEI and hydroxyl groups of the cellulosic fiber using ECH crosslinker can be expected to have a broad potential application in dyeing processes or pollution treatments due to its simple, cost-effective, flexible and efficient method.</p>","author":"Onanong Cheerarot, \nSunan Saikrasun","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"3bffcc504f1ddd4b299a721a985a0499a0b1eb0fd5a009b3935d0330bc6bb715","category":"Environment"}
