{"title":"Hysteroscopy and ART: Defying Clinical Indications Based on Current Evidence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0623/v1","date":1725866242000,"content":"Embryo’s Implantation is a question that we are not in the position to answer in full details. We know that it depends on embryo’s quality and uterine receptivity. It is possible to access uterine cavity before in vitro fertilisation by a variety of tools, however hysteroscopy is the gold standard in evaluation of uterine cavity and potential pathology. The frequencies of unrecognised uterine pathology revealed by hysteroscopy are 18-50% and 40-43% in patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation or after recurrent implantation failure respectively. Data is inconclusive regarding the role of hysteroscopy on pregnancy outcome after in vitro fertilisation. This review aims to evaluate the validity of office hysteroscopy in subfertile population before or after IVF treatment","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c69254011370c57675e89636a7a245598b94a95c5e42561603773ef0b75c5052","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
