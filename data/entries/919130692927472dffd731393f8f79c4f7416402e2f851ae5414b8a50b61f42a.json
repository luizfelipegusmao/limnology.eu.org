{"title":"151 Use of a clay and algae-based decontaminant on sows naturally exposed to mycotoxins in gestation and lactation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/120/7664879?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mycotoxin contamination in pig feed is a recurring problem leading to chronic exposure of the animals, even when mycotoxin levels are below official guidance (FDA, EFSA). Deoxynivalenol (DON) and its derivates are among the main mycotoxins impacting pig production in the United States. This study evaluated the effect of a clay- and algae-based mycotoxin decontaminant on the reproductive performance of sows (n = 207) exposed to chronic natural mycotoxin contamination from 35 d of gestation to weaning. The level of mycotoxins in the feed was measured using LC-MS/MS. A mean contamination of 956 ppb DON, 125 ppb 15-o-acteyl-DON, 338 ppb fumonisins B1 + B2 and 62 ppb zearalenone was reported. Despite a comparable starting body weight (BW) between the control (without decontaminant) and test (with decontaminant) groups at allotment (<span>P</span> = 0.67), sows in the test group had a greater BW than the control sows at entry in farrowing (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), and a body condition score of 0.12 points greater (<span>P</span> = 0.04). More live-born piglets were observed in supplemented sows than in control sows (+4%; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), as well as a smaller proportion of mummified and stillborn piglets (-39%; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 and -34%, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01, respectively). In contrast, the BW and growth of piglets before weaning did not differ between groups (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). These results indicate that the tested decontaminant can improve the body condition and farrowing performance of mycotoxin-exposed sows at levels below current recommendations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"919130692927472dffd731393f8f79c4f7416402e2f851ae5414b8a50b61f42a","category":"Environment"}
