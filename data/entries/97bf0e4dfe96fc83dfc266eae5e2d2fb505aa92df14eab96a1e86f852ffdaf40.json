Knowledge of the swimming performance of target species in specific regions is critical for designing fishways with a high passage efficiency. Substrate roughening with river stones of fishways is considered to improve fish swimming capacity by benefiting from reduced-velocity zones with lower energetic costs. However, the effectiveness of rough substrates in energy metabolism is rarely tested. We investigated the effect of substrate roughening on the swimming capacity, oxygen consumption and behaviour of <i>Schizothorax wangchiachii</i> from the Heishui River in a flume-type swimming respirometer. The results showed that substrate roughening improved critical and burst swimming speed by ~12.9% and ~15.0%, respectively, compared to the smooth substrate. Our results demonstrate that increased reduced-velocity zones, lowered metabolic rate and tail-beat frequency support our hypothesis that lower energetic costs improve fish swimming performance in rough substrate compared to smooth treatment. The traversable flow velocity model predicted that maximum traversable flow velocity and maximum ascent distance were higher over rough compared to smooth substrate fishways. Fishway substrate roughening may be a practical approach to improve fish swimming upstream for demersal riverine fish.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>利用鱼道恢复河流的自然连通性将减轻水坝建设对生物多样性和淡水鱼类资源的不利影响。了解目标物种在特定水域的游泳特征，对设计高通过率的鱼道至关重要。利用自然河石构建粗糙化的底质可以在鱼道中形成相对低流速的区域，这种低流速区域将降低鱼类在上溯过程中的能量消耗，从而提高其游泳能力。然而，粗糙底质对鱼类能量代谢效率影响的有效性研究还十分匮乏。本研究在水槽式游泳呼吸仪中测试了底质粗糙化对黑水河短须裂腹鱼的游泳能力、耗氧量和行为的影响。结果显示，与光滑底质相比，粗糙底质使临界游泳速度和爆发游泳速度分别提高了约12.9%和15.0%。本研究的假设为，与光滑底质相比，粗糙底质条件下鱼类较低的能量消耗可提高其游泳性能。本结果显示在粗糙底质条件下，游泳区域增加了低流速区域面积，降低了鱼类的能量消耗和摆尾频率。通过鱼道流速模型预测显示，与光滑底质鱼道相比，粗糙底质鱼道的鱼类最大可通过流速更高，最大上溯距离更远。由此可见，鱼道底质粗糙化可能是提高底栖性河流鱼类上溯成功率的有效手段。</p>","author":"Yiqing Song, \nSongguang Xie","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"97bf0e4dfe96fc83dfc266eae5e2d2fb505aa92df14eab96a1e86f852ffdaf40","category":"Environment"}
