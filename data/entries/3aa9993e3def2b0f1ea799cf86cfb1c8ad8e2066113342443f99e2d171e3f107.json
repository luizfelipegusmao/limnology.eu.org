{"title":"Biomass Productivity and Photosynthetic Activity in Ulva compressa (Chlorophyta) in Raceway Photobioreactors Under Stress Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0090/v1","date":1727805533000,"content":"Research in seaweed cultivation technologies aims to increase production and reduce costs, leading to more efficient and sustainable processes. In this study, we analyzed the outdoor production of Ulva compressa cultured in summertime at different stocking densities of 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 kg Fresh weight (FW) m-2 in a raceway photobioreactor with 30 m2 surface (3000L) and its relation to pho-tosynthetic activity. Under the experimental conditions of high temperature (&gt; 28-30 oC) and pH &gt; 9 in culture water, higher seaweed density resulted in lower specific growth rate. The biomass pro-duction has been related to photosynthetic activity by using in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence. Dynamic photoinhibition was observed at noon, which was less severe in cultures with higher algal densities. However, photosynthesis recovered in the afternoon. Seaweeds that were acclimatized for a week to the conditions of 1.0 kg FW m-2 stocking density showed an increase in biomass growth and absence of photoinhibition compared to non-acclimatized thalli. In conclusion, by using high densities (1.0 kg FW m-2), U. compressa presented the highest growth rate in a mid-scale raceway photobioreactor under stressed conditions related to the increase of photosynthetic capacity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3aa9993e3def2b0f1ea799cf86cfb1c8ad8e2066113342443f99e2d171e3f107","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
