{"title":"Research on collaborative innovation optimization strategies for digitally enabled higher education ecosystems","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302285","date":1713448800000,"content":"<p>by Yan Zhao, Zheng Yang</p>\r\n\r\nDigitally enabled higher education involves the in-depth use of new-generation digital technology, which has subverted and innovated the traditional teaching mode, driven the development of high-quality teaching and learning, and improved teachers’ teaching experience, and increased efficiency. Based on ecosystem theory, this paper constructs a higher education ecosystem with the government, enterprises, and universities as the core participating subjects. It considers the participating subjects’ effort level and the ecosystem’s overall benefits under the three scenarios of noncooperative research and development (R&amp;D), cost sharing, and cooperative R&amp;D. The results show that (1) the service innovation effort level of the three parties increases with increasing human resource level and technology maturity, and the government’s benefit decreases with increasing cost of fulfilling social responsibility. (2) The government’s cost subsidies to universities and enterprises can enhance the service innovation level of both parties and increase the optimal returns of the three parties and the ecosystem as a whole. (3) In the cooperative R&amp;D game scenario, the effort level of the three parties and the total ecosystem returns are greater than those in the noncollaborative R&amp;D scenario, and after determining the subsidy coefficients of the government, Pareto optimality of the three parties and the ecosystem as a whole can be achieved. The conclusions of this study can aid in understanding the dynamic evolution mechanism of digitally enabled higher education and provide a realistic decision-making reference for higher education ecosystem managers.","author":"Yan Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"20d05f951a93bb35f55f2cc172a74aec782dbfc6998ec2819208908e29ab4e13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
