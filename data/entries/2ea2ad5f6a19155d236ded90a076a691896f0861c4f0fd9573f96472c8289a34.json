In this study, we present an innovative application of a rule-based classification model to identify the main causes of chronic cough-related quality of life (QoL) impairment in a cohort of asthmatic patients. The proposed approach first involves the design of a suitable symptoms questionnaire and the subsequent analyses via XAI. Specifically, feature ranking, derived from statistically validated decision rules, helped in automatically identifying the main factors influencing an impaired QoL: pharynx/larynx and upper airways when asthma is under control, and asthma itself and digestive trait when asthma is not controlled. Moreover, the obtained <i>if-then</i> rules identified specific thresholds on the symptoms associated to the impaired QoL. These results, by finding priorities among symptoms, may prove helpful in supporting physicians in the choice of the most adequate diagnostic/therapeutic plan.","author":"Sara Narteni","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2ea2ad5f6a19155d236ded90a076a691896f0861c4f0fd9573f96472c8289a34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
