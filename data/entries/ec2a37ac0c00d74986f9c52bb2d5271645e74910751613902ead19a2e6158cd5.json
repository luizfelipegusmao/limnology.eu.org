{"title":"The Use of Remote Sensing for Maritime Surveillance for Security and Safety","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1571/v1","date":1724307745000,"content":"Maritime surveillance technology faces challenges of astronomical size in this vast ocean world—challenges vital to global security and environmental protection alike. Such as these may be reversible or not. Remotely sensed monitoring also uses photos taken from satellites, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) equipment, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fully monitor maritime activities but also ferret out suspicious behaviour like piracy, bootleg shipments, and illegal fishing. This mixed-method approach--quantitatively and qualitatively——measures the efficiency of difficulties associated with, and legal implications behind aerospace-monitored maritime surveillance. The results show that remote sensing provides a great deal of sea-level situational awareness; however, there are also many complex technical, operational, and legal issues, including information overcrowding, complications in integration, privacy issues, as well as the need for worldwide legal harmonisation. It ends with recommendations on ways to ultimately increase capacity, how to write standard procedures for secondary development and proposals for revising laws to absorb these new technologies. Its goal, therefore, is to benefit the global anti-maritime crime effort. Ultimately, though, it dreams that we might construct an entirely marine environment where all marine activities are conducted both safely and freely, without fear.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec2a37ac0c00d74986f9c52bb2d5271645e74910751613902ead19a2e6158cd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
