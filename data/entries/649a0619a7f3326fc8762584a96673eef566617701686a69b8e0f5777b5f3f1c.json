{"title":"Life Cycle Analysis in the Dairy Industry: Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0637/v1","date":1725864998000,"content":"In this paper, we reviewed 42 studies on applied Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) in dairy products published since 2015. Such a systematic review of the literature contributes to addressing the gap regarding the usefulness of the LCA methodology and the need for additional research due to limited studies, data, variables, and the magnitude of environmental impact. We analyzed various environmental impacts generated in the environment, compared methods and results, and highlighted emerging issues affecting society, the economy, and the environment, warranting further investigation. Additionally, we statistically analyzed the effects that the choice of functional unit and allocation rule could have on the results. LCA is a key tool for assessing the environmental sustainability of the agri-food sector. This review aims to summarize case study research on LCA in dairy processing, disseminating potential environmental impacts and providing specific examples of research in dairy processing demonstrating how the representative end product is associated with environmental impacts on air, water, and land.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"649a0619a7f3326fc8762584a96673eef566617701686a69b8e0f5777b5f3f1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
