This presentation highlights the key role of multimodal and operando synchrotron X-ray characterization in advancing our understanding of these complex systems. We will discuss three categories of materials as examples, including beyond Li-ion batteries, materials used in extreme environments, such as those involving molten salts and thermal cycling, and nanoarchitecture thin films created by solid-state dealloying.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"231d11b75cbf39ebe3835ca9b39a007b5a0d2d58cb74c779d1c7a65db15bd118","category":"Environment"}
