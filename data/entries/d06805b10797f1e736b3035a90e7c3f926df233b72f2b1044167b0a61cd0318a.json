{"title":"A Study on the Prioritization of Competencies for Remote Operator of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS): An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1735/v1","date":1714117666000,"content":"The introduction of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS) through the development of autonomous navigation technologies is expected to bring about new technologies, new vessel types, and new job roles such as remote operation center (ROC) and remote operator (RO). The MASS Code are currently being discussed through Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) of International Maritime Organization (IMO). This code is expected to be adopted in the form of non-mandatory guidelines until 2025, with the goal of establishing mandatory requirements by 2028. Additionally, revisions to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) related to crew training and qualifications are planned for adoption by 2027, which will include requirements for MASS operators. This paper aims to examine the fundamental competencies required for safe MASS operation by remote operators using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, considering the emergence of the new profession of RO. Building upon the 66 Knowledge, Understanding &amp;amp; Proficiencies (KUPs) outlined for marine officer in the STCW Convention, the study seeks to identify the additional competencies necessary for RO and contribute to the development of a training model for the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d06805b10797f1e736b3035a90e7c3f926df233b72f2b1044167b0a61cd0318a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
