{"title":"Instrument Selection in Panel Data Models with Endogeneity: A Bayesian Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1805/v1","date":1727097145000,"content":"This paper proposes the use of Bayesian inference techniques to search for and obtain valid instruments in dynamic panel data models where endogenous variables may exist. The use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows for obtaining a reduced number of instruments in comparison to the high number of instruments commonly used in the literature, and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods enable efficient exploration of the instrument space, deriving accurate point estimates of the elements of interest. The proposed methodology is illustrated in a simulated case and in an empirical application, where the partial effect of a series of determinants on the attraction of international bank flows is quantified. The results highlight the importance of promoting and developing the private sector in these economies, as well as the importance of maintaining good levels of credit worthiness","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7deacda0807cc5a7592fe7656303d90e87a08849aa58e0b97b240ba9c175eff0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
