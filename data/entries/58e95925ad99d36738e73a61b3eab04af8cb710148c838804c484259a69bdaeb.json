{"title":"Vitronectin Levels in Plasma of Neuroblastoma Patients and Culture Media of 3D Models: A Prognostic Circulating Biomarker?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0957/v1","date":1720694094000,"content":"Vitronectin is a glycoprotein, present in plasma and extracellular matrix, implicated in cell migration. The high amount of vitronectin found in neuroblastoma biopsies was associated with poor prognosis. However, there are almost no studies of vitronectin levels in neuroblastoma cell culture media nor in plasma of neuroblastoma patients. Vitronectin concentration in culture media of four neuroblastoma cell lines grown in monolayer and in 3D-models, and in plasma of 114 neuroblastoma patients, was quantified using ELISA. Three of the neuroblastoma cell lines secreted vitronectin to culture media when cultured in monolayer and 3D-models. Vitronectin release was higher by neuroblastoma cells cultured in 3D-models than in monolayer, and was still great when cells grown in 3D-scaffolds with cross-linked vitronectin. Vitronectin secretion occurred independently of cell numbers in cultures. Its concentration in plasma of neuroblastoma patients ranged between 52.4 and 870µg/mL (median, 218µg/mL). A ROC curve was used to establish a cutoff of 361µg/mL, above which patients over 18-months-old had worse prognosis (p=0.0018). Vitronectin could be considered a new plasma prognostic biomarker in neuroblastoma, and warrants confirmation in collaborative studies. Drugs inhibiting vitronectin interaction with cells and/or extracellular matrix could represent a significant improvement in survival for neuroblastoma patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58e95925ad99d36738e73a61b3eab04af8cb710148c838804c484259a69bdaeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
