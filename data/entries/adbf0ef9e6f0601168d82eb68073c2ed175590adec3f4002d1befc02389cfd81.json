{"title":"The Effect of Doping rGO with MnO2 Nanomaterial on Its Gas Sensing Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1611/v1","date":1729558151000,"content":"Manganese dioxide (MnO2) has drawn attention as a sensitizer to be incorporated in graphene-based chemoresistive sensors thanks to its promising properties. In this regard, a rGO@MnO2 sensing material was prepared and deposited on two different substrates (Silicon and Kapton). These sensors were exposed to different dilutions of NO2 under dry and humid conditions at room temperature. Other gases or vapours such as NH3, CO, ethanol and H2 were also tested. FESEM, HRTEM, RAMAN and XRD were used to characterize the prepared sensors. The experimental results showed that the incorporation of MnO2 in the rGO material enhanced its response towards NO2. Moreover, this material showed also very good responses toward NH3 both under dry and humid conditions and showed no cross-responsiveness towards other toxic gases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"adbf0ef9e6f0601168d82eb68073c2ed175590adec3f4002d1befc02389cfd81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
