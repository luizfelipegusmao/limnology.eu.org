{"title":"Theoretical Evaluation on Lubrication Performance of Thrust-Type Foil Bearings in Liquid Nitrogen","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1039/v1","date":1718606654000,"content":"The development requirements for reusable liquid rocket engines have set higher standards for the reliability design of turbopump structures. To address the issue of bearing failure in turbopumps under harsh conditions such as low temperature, high speed, heavy load, and repeated start-stop cycles, this paper proposes replacing ball bearings with thrust foil bearings. We used liquid nitrogen instead of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to simulate the ultralow temperature and low viscosity operating environment of turbopumps, evaluating the potential feasibility of using thrust foil bearings in this context. The numerical calculations primarily include the formulation of the foil deformation equations based on the link-spring model for the wavy foil and the thin plate finite element model for the top foil. These equations are solved by coupling the Reynolds lubrication equation, the fluid film thickness equation, and the foil deformation equations using the finite difference method, Newton-Raphson method, and finite element method. A detailed analysis is conducted on the effects of rotational speed, fluid film thickness, thrust disk inclination angle, and wavy foil interface friction coefficient on the static and dynamic characteristics of thrust foil bearings. The research findings provide guidance for the application of thrust foil bearings in liquid rocket turbopumps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac85805acf2d0b59579b542d03c7ae89e4d26c374481ae91108c3de101732e06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
