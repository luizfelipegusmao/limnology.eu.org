{"title":"A Role for Microglia in Post-Anesthesia Delirium","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/4/8/7718044?rss=1","date":1721606400000,"content":"<span>Microglia were discovered in the central nervous system (CNS) by Pío del Río Hortega over a century ago as tiny cells with branched architecture distinguishable from astrocytes and neurons [<a href=\"#qaae038-B1\">1</a>]. Since then, microglia have been characterized as resident immune cells of the CNS that play key roles in brain homeostasis. Until now, interactions between microglia and neurons while under, and recovering from, anesthesia have been obscure. A recent study by Koichiro Haruwaka, Long-Jun Wu, et al. shows a role for microglia-neuron interactions that has important implications for clinical settings where, during emergence from anesthesia, some patients have undesirable reactions called delirium that include extreme drowsiness or hyperactivity. In this work [<a href=\"#qaae038-B2\">2</a>], Haruwaka et al. imaged conscious animal brain and tissue slices treated with, and recovering from, the anesthetic isoflurane to study microglia behavior using two-photon <span>in vivo</span> imaging. Together with correlative high-resolution 3D electron microscopy, they revealed dynamic tissue architecture that helps explain how microglia may function to shield the action of inhibitory neurons resulting in neuronal hyperactivity during post-anesthesia delirium.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"e6ab27569fcc102d9f30e9716cc68f6c410d1874b4bd367b75c290745550fd4a","category":"Environment"}
