{"title":"Nailing it: Investigation of elephant toenails for retrospective analysis of adrenal and reproductive hormones","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae048/7725879?rss=1","date":1722556800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hormone monitoring of at-risk species can be valuable for evaluation of individual physiological status. Traditional non-invasive endocrine monitoring from urine and faeces typically captures only a short window in time, poorly reflecting long-term hormone fluctuations. We examined toenail trimmings collected from African (<span>Loxodonta africana</span>) and Asian (<span>Elephas maximus</span>) elephants during routine foot care, to determine if long-term hormone patterns are preserved in these slow-growing keratinized tissues. We first measured the growth rate of elephant toenails biweekly for one year, to establish the temporal delay between deposition of hormones into nail tissue (at the proximal nail bed) and collection of toenail trimmings months later (at the distal tip of the nail). In African elephants, toenails grew ~0.18 ± 0.015 mm/day (mean ± SEM) and in Asian elephants, toenails grew ~0.24 ± 0.034 mm/day. This slow growth rate, combined with the large toenail size of elephants, may mean that toenails could contain a ‘hormone timeline’ of over a year between the nail bed and nail tip. Progesterone, testosterone and cortisol were readily detectable using commercial enzyme immunoassays, and all assays passed validations, indicating that these hormones can be accurately quantified in elephant toenail extract. In most cases, variations in hormone concentrations reflected expected physiological patterns for adult females and males (e.g. ovarian cycling and musth) and matched individual health records from participating zoos. Progesterone patterns aligned with our calculations of temporal delay, aligning with female ovarian cycling from over six months prior. Unexpectedly, male testosterone patterns aligned with current musth status at the time of sample collection (i.e. rather than prior musth status). Though this sample type will require further study, these results indicate that preserved hormone patterns in elephant toenails could give conservationists a new tool to aid management of elephant populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"e63b16d8b7f84d0219ff0a2545eb82dba88c67cf702702a776bb99cd48d1c23b","category":"Environment"}
