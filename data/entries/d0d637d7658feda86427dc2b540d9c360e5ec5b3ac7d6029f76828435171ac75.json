Indeed, despite their widespread adoption, the application of LIBs is constrained mainly by capacity limitations and stability as of now. It is widely recognized that even trace amounts of faulted phases and related defects within cathode particles can lead to substantial degradation in battery performance. This underscores the critical importance of precisely characterizing and understanding faulted phases to unlock the full potential of LIB technology. Despite extensive efforts to comprehensively elucidate the phases responsible for failure mechanisms through local nano- and even atomic-scale investigations especially using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.880-B1\">1-3</a>], the precise distribution and relationship of these faulted phases and defects within a single crystal cathode, at the scale of hundreds nanometer scale remains inadequately characterized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d0d637d7658feda86427dc2b540d9c360e5ec5b3ac7d6029f76828435171ac75","category":"Environment"}
