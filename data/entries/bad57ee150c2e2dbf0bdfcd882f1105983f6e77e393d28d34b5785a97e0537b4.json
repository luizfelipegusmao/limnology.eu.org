{"title":"Fat-Based Submicron Particle Formation and Characterization for Food Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0801/v1","date":1723464742000,"content":"One of the most crucial attributes of emulsions is their particle size, which has implication on the stability, rheology as well as sensory properties in different food applications. Homogenization speed is an important parameter that disrupts fat globules into desirable particle sizes. The effect of emulsification composition and homogenization parameters on particle size distribution of palm stearin oil-in-water emulsion was investigated. A palm stearin oil-in-water emulsion was homogenized at different speed (10k-25k rpm) and the particle size distribution was investigated. When the homogenization speed was increased above &gt;10k rpm, the particle size distribution decreased. Increasing concentration of surfactant from 1 wt.% to 3wt.%, in the emulsion showed a decrease in particle size distribution for all homogenisation speed. Oil droplet size could also be minimized by increasing the concentration of sugar in continuous phase.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bad57ee150c2e2dbf0bdfcd882f1105983f6e77e393d28d34b5785a97e0537b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
