{"title":"Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Glycogen Storage Disorders (GSDs)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0143/v1","date":1719849405000,"content":"Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism. Deficiencies in enzymes responsible for glycogen breakdown and synthesis can impair mitochondrial function. For instance, in GSD type II (Pompe disease), acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency leads to lysosomal glycogen accumulation, which secondarily impacts mitochondrial function through dysfunctional mitophagy, which disrupts mitochondrial quality control generating oxidative stress. In GSD type III (Cori disease), the lack of the debranching enzyme causes glycogen accumulation and affects mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis by disrupting the integrity of muscle fibers. Malfunctional glycogen metabolism can disrupt various cascades thus causing mitochondrial and cell metabolic dysfunction through various mechanisms. These dysfunctions include altered mitochondrial morphology, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and defective mitophagy. The oxidative burden typical of GSDs compromises mitochondrial integrity and exacerbates the metabolic derangements observed in GSDs. The intertwining of mitochondrial dysfunction and GSDs underscores the complexity of these disorders and has significant clinical implications. GSD patients often present with multisystem manifestations, including hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and muscle weakness, which can be exacerbated by mitochondrial impairment. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the progression of GSD-related complications, such as cardiomyopathy and neurocognitive deficits. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction thus represents a promising therapeutic avenue in GSDs. Potential strategies include antioxidants to mitigate oxidative stress, compounds that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, and gene therapy to correct the underlying mitochondrial enzyme deficiencies. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of GSDs. Recognizing and addressing this aspect can lead to more comprehensive and effective treatments, improving the quality of life of GSD patients. \nThis review aims to elaborate on the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and various types of GSDs.
