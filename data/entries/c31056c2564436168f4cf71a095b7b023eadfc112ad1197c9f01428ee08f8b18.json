{"title":"Density of Culex quinquefasciatus Associated with Socio‚ÄêEnvironmental Conditions in a Municipality with Indeterminate Transmission for Lymphatic Filariasis in the Northeastern Region of Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0863/v1","date":1723619224000,"content":"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease associated with poverty and poor environmental conditions. With the inclusion of vector control activities in LF surveillance actions, there is a need to develop simple methods to identify areas with higher mosquito density and consequent risk of W. bancrofti transmission. An ecological study was conducted in Igarassu, Metropolitan Region of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. The mosquitoes were captured in 2,060 houses distributed across 117 census tracts. The vector density index (VDI) was constructed, that measures the average number of lymphatic filariasis transmitting mosquitoes per number of houses collected in the risk stratum. Moreover, the social deprivation indicator (SDI) was constructed and was carried out through principal component factor analysis. The average number of female C. quinquefasciatus found in the high-risk stratum was 242, while the low-risk stratum had an average of 108. The overall VDI was 6.8 mosquitoes per household. The VDI for the high-risk stratum was 13.2 mosquitoes per household, while for the low/medium-risk stratum, it was 5.2. This study offers an SDI for the density of C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, which reduces the cost associated with data collection and allows for indicating priority areas for vector control actions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c31056c2564436168f4cf71a095b7b023eadfc112ad1197c9f01428ee08f8b18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
