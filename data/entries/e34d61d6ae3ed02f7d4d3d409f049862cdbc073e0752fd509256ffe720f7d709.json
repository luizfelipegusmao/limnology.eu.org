{"title":"Polygenic, autosomal, and stable spirotetramat resistance in <i>Chrysoperla carnea</i> resulting in increased fitness","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310142","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Shoaib Hassan, Sarfraz Ali Shad</p>\r\n\r\nGreen lacewing, <i>Chrysoperla carnea</i> (Stephens) is a generalist predator used as a biological control agent in agro ecosystems. In order to use chemical and biological control in an integrated way, it is advantageous to know about natural enemy resistance response to a selected chemical. To determine <i>C</i>. <i>carnea</i> spirotetramat resistance potential, a population collected from the field was selected in the laboratory. Then we determined how spirotetramat resistance was inherited and how much it impacts the fitness of <i>C</i>. <i>carnea</i>. After eighteen selections with spirotetramat, the selected population (Spiro-Sel) of <i>C</i>. <i>carnea</i> had a 47-fold of resistance when compared to an UNSEL population. Inheritance results showed that spirotetramat resistance was inherited as an autosomal, incompletely dominant and polygenic trait. The values of effective dominance decreased from 0.87 (incomplete dominant) to 0.00 (complete recessive) as the concentration of spirotetramat increased from 625 mg/L to 10000 mg/L. The Spiro-Sel strain had no cross resistance to chlorfenapyr (1.10-fold), deltamethrin (1.26-fold) and chlorpyrifos (1.27-fold). After 7 generations without selection pressure resistance to all experimental insecticides in the Spiro-Sel strain was stable. Fitness data of the Spiro-Sel, Cross A, Cross B, UNSEL and susceptible strains of <i>C</i>. <i>carnea</i> showed that spirotetramat resistance increased the fitness of the selected green lacewing population. Life history parameters like fecundity, net reproductive rate, and relative fitness of the Spiro-Sel strain significantly increased when compared to the susceptible or unselected strains of <i>C</i>. <i>carnea</i>. These findings show that <i>C</i>. <i>carnea</i> is a perfect candidate for integrated pest management (IPM) programmes that combine biological control methods with selective pesticide applications to manage a variety of insect pests. Additionally, it would reduce the possibility of pests developing pesticide resistance despite repeated applications. It would be an excellent choice for widespread releases and be effective in most spray programs.","author":"Shoaib Hassan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e34d61d6ae3ed02f7d4d3d409f049862cdbc073e0752fd509256ffe720f7d709","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
