{"title":"Insecure Attachment, Oxytocinergic System and C Tactile Fibers: An Integrative and Translational Pathophysiological Model of Fibromyalgia and Central Sensitization Syndromes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1012/v1","date":1718366258000,"content":"Abstract: Although the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia syndrome has been better understood in recent decades, a unified model of its pathogenesis and an effective therapeutic approach are still far from being realized. The main aim of this article will be to delve into the fundamental mechanisms of the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia conceptualized as stress intolerance syndrome. Using the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain syndromes, we will describe the potential role of the attachment system, C tactile fibers, and oxytocinergic system dysfunction in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia syndrome and other central sensitivity syndromes. At the end of the article, the therapeutic implications of this new global and translational pathophysiological model will be briefly discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"536ed086b50994154a42216c4f59a853e6a5b654e61479528057afd99aab48ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
