{"title":"Agricultural production and air pollution: An investigation on crop straw fires","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303830","date":1715954400000,"content":"<p>by Kai Zhao, Xiaohui Tian, Wangyang Lai, Shuai Xu</p>\r\n\r\nIn numerous developing nations, the pervasive practice of crop residue incineration is a principal contributor to atmospheric contamination in agricultural operations. This study examines the repercussions of such biomass combustion on air quality during the autumnal harvest season, utilizing data acquired from satellite-based remote sensing of fire events and air pollution measurements. Employing wind direction information alongside difference-in-difference and fixed-effects methodologies, this investigation rectifies estimation inaccuracies stemming from the non-random distribution of combustion occurrences. The empirical findings reveal that agricultural residue burning precipitates an elevation in average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by approximately 27 and 22 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup> during the autumnal incineration period, respectively. Furthermore, air pollution attributed to residue burning in prominent grain-producing regions exceeds the national average by approximately 40%. By integrating economic paradigms into agri-environmental inquiries, this study offers novel insights and substantiation of the environmental expenditures engendered by crop residue burning, juxtaposed with extant meteorological and ecological research findings.","author":"Kai Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e54443afd2c93500561ddf0d170d963f5ee34ed679bbb6e1d768e7054d5872bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
