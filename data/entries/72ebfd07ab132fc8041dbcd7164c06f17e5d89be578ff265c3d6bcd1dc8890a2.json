{"title":"CO2 response screen in grass Brachypodium reveals the key role of a MAP kinase in CO2-triggered stomatal closure","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/495/7665566?rss=1","date":1714953600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants respond to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations through stomatal closure, which can contribute to increased water use efficiency. Grasses display faster stomatal responses than eudicots due to dumbbell-shaped guard cells flanked by subsidiary cells working in opposition. However, forward genetic screening for stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> signal transduction mutants in grasses has yet to be reported. The grass model <span>Brachypodium distachyon</span> is closely related to agronomically important cereal crops, sharing largely collinear genomes. To gain insights into CO<sub>2</sub> control mechanisms of stomatal movements in grasses, we developed an unbiased forward genetic screen with an EMS-mutagenized <span>B. distachyon</span> M5 generation population using infrared imaging to identify plants with altered leaf temperatures at elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Among isolated mutants, a “<span>chill1</span>” mutant exhibited cooler leaf temperatures than wild-type Bd21-3 parent control plants after exposure to increased CO<sub>2</sub>. <span>chill1</span> plants showed strongly impaired high CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure despite retaining a robust abscisic acid-induced stomatal closing response. Through bulked segregant whole-genome sequencing analyses followed by analyses of further backcrossed F4 generation plants and generation and characterization of sodium azide and CRISPR-cas9 mutants, <span>chill1</span> was mapped to a protein kinase, <span>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 5</span> (<span>BdMPK5</span>). The <span>chill1</span> mutation impaired BdMPK5 protein-mediated CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> sensing together with the High Temperature 1 (HT1) Raf-like kinase in vitro. Furthermore, AlphaFold2-directed structural modeling predicted that the identified BdMPK5-D90N <span>chill1</span> mutant residue is located at the interface of BdMPK5 with the BdHT1 Raf-like kinase. BdMPK5 is a key signaling component that mediates CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal movements and is proposed to function as a component of the primary CO<sub>2</sub> sensor in grasses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"72ebfd07ab132fc8041dbcd7164c06f17e5d89be578ff265c3d6bcd1dc8890a2","category":"Environment"}
