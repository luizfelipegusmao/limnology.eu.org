{"title":"Recent advances in the multifaceted functions of Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins in plant growth, development, and stress responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5501/7697757?rss=1","date":1719187200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Recent research has highlighted the importance of Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins (C2H2-ZFPs) in plant growth and in responses to various stressors, and the complex structures of C2H2-ZFP networks and the molecular mechanisms underlying their responses to stress have received considerable attention. Here, we review the structural characteristics and classification of C2H2-ZFPs, and consider recent research advances in their functions. We systematically introduce the roles of these proteins across diverse aspects of plant biology, encompassing growth and development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and in doing so hope to lay the foundations for further functional studies of C2H2-ZFPs in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"4c777cdd3e60e3a54b8826216a2ea038ebf8471f092bcd2b46c00b77f855e829","category":"Environment"}
