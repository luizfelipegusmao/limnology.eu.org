{"title":"Regional Profiling for the Frequency, Patterns, and Factors of Hearing Loss Reveals, Geriatric Age, Noise, and Inheritance History as Major Potential Predispositions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1819/v1","date":1727102657000,"content":"Hearing-loss (HL) is a major public health issue albeit data is limited. Objectives: were to determine the frequency and factors. Design: was descriptive cross-sectional using web-based self-administered google-form questionnaire. Data analyzed by-IBM SPSS-V-24-Windows. Results: In 789 responses, 6.6 % reported HL, 62.4% from Eastern-region of which 41.2% were employed and 31.7% students. Despite 36.5% reported HL &amp;gt; 5-years, 21.2% sought treatments. 19.2% reported diabetes and 51.9% had family-history. Ages 11â€“ 50 years showed female predominance (females 59.1%, males 41%). Age was significant in HL (P &amp;lt;0.001) irrespective of gender (males 6.8%, females 6.4%, P value =0.838) reaching peaks at 17.2% 51-60 years and 25% in 71-80 implying a potential risk (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.78-2.81, p = 0.032). 34.6% indicated genetics then noise (26.9%), while infections, stroke, and fevers made 19.2%. Air or sea travels (7.7%) were insignificant (P = 0.628) while head injuries (11.5%), or low- and high-altitudes showed 21.2%. Noise-hazard (P = 0.048) and medications (P = 0.017) were significant in HL. Conclusion: thus, we show geriatric age, noise, and inheritance-history as major predispositions. However, the study was limited by small sampling. Future large cohort multicenter studies on factual clinical data would gain more insights into the HL.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08fa50807c90f08ed8dae5591ff397d545e8bceaf62fec4c93e823d93e127160","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
