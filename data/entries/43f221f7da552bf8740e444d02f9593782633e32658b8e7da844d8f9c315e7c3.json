But then as the fork compresses, that Plushport is gradually closed, stiffening up the fork to resist trail impacts for more support through the middle and end of fork travel. And once fully closed, the Plushport effectively diverts oil in the damper through the high-speed compression damping circuit instead making for a progressive, bottomless feel that DT says complements the revised large-volume air springs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Effectively, the progressive Plushport compression damping should allow you to ride the 535 forks with normal low air spring pressure, and benefit from extra small bump control and plush early travel, while maintaining support in the middle travel which you use most of the time out on the trail, and smoother bottom-out protection as you push the fork to its limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top 535 One forks pair the Plushport damper with ODL 3-position compression damping lock-out remotes, while the standard 535 keeps it simpler with OL 2-position open or locked levers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Coilpair combination between coil &amp; air spring benefits </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1802\" height=\"1201\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 535 trail all-mountain bike suspension upgrades, new ONE &amp; standard forks, CoilPair x-ray\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray.jpg 1802w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-get-Coilpair-coilair-spring_x-ray-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the left leg, DT Swiss gets a little creative (at least on the 535 One) by combing a coil spring and an air spring for the best of both worlds – their patented Coilpair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tiny ~25mm long steel coil spring doesn’t add much weight, but since it starts to move immediately and linearly when any force impacts the axle, the little coil eliminates the lag of an air shock that must overcome seal stiction. Together, the Coilpair (coil + air) both work to smooth out the first 30mm of fork travel. Working side-by-side with the Plushport in the oil damper side, the result is better small bump sensitivity without having to run extra low pressure or suffer from compromised mid-travel support &amp; pedaling efficiency to get real sensitivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 535 trail all-mountain bike suspension upgrades, fork Coilpair spring detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_coilpair-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look a bit closer at the Coilpair tech, and like us you might notice that it looks similar in concept to a Buttercup – that’s because the DT Swiss patented design is licensed by RockShox for their premium trail and all-mountain forks, too.

Essentially revised large-volume air spring chambers are able to provide more linear suspension travel both front &amp; rear in a lightweight setup, better mimicking coil shock performance. And the bigger space inside can always be reduced with volume spacers to create a more progressive feel for riders looking to ramp up support through their travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 535 trail all-mountain bike suspension upgrades, new ONE &amp; standard shocks, Lineair upgrade\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-shock-Lineair-air-spring-bypass-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the rear shocks, the tech sounds a bit less hi-tech, but follows the same line of updates. Larger volume positive &amp; negative Lineair air springs improve the linear spring curve to better mimic coil shock performance. The shocks also get an updated self-balancing bypass that provides higher negative pressure at top-out for reduced breakaway force and better small bump sensitivity, while then delivering more support from mid-stroke to the end of rear wheel travel. It’s a bit simpler on the air side, but works in a similar, complimentary way to Plushport up front. Damping-wise the new 535 shocks get 3-position ODL compression damping – Open, Drive &amp; Locked-out – for maximum pedaling and descending efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DT Swiss 535 Suspension – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 535 trail all-mountain bike suspension upgrades, new ONE &amp; standard forks and shocks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DT-Swiss-535-trail-all-mountain-bike-suspension-upgrades_new-forks-and-shocks_F535-One-fork-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>updated F 535 One fork</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 535 series forks are now 29″ only with 120-160mm of travel in 10mm increments to fit all disciplines from XC &amp; trail to enduro.
