{"title":"Semantic Training for Cognitive Stimulation in Healthy Aging: Motives, Dimensions, and Usability of the CerUp Online Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0379/v1","date":1717670485000,"content":"Background: Aging impacts semantic abilities, therefore semantic exercises might be a valuable tool for cognitive stimulation in healthy older adults. However, programs in this area are limited. Methods: In the current paper, we adapted the BOX linguistic semantic program for online use via the CerUp platform. Our goal was to prepare the optimization future experience of CerUp users, including potential changes in task structure, level of difficulty and instructions, and participants’ adherence, engagement, performance accuracy, perceived difficulty, and adequacy ratings assigned to the instructions we provided that might guide future changes. Additionally, we created a map of hypothesized task-specific features that may guide tailor-made uses of the program. Results: To that end, we present preliminary results on the usability of CerUp. By analyzing task-specific usability data alongside the hypothesized map of task-specific features, we also tested the validity of the latter. Conclusions: These preliminary results on the usability of the CerUp platform highlight the potential of programs for semantic stimulation. Such findings can inform future optimizations of the program, tailored to users’ needs and effectively supporting overall language skills and general cognition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61c891125940d1940467be7212762fe00a78607b9271386c64cc03a0f92d1996","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
