{"title":"Accuracy and Precision of the Geopy&ouml;r&auml; Breakage Test","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0934/v1","date":1720693254000,"content":"The Geopyörä breakage test uses two counter-rotating wheels to nip and crush rock specimens with a tightly controlled gap between rollers. The force applied and energy consumed during breakage are measured with instrumentation. In contrast to drop weigh test (DWT) methods, the breakage energy is a response to the rock compressive strength and degree of compression, not a controlled test input, such as the kinetic input energy of a falling weight. This paper presents the detailed measures conducted to evaluate the accuracy and precision of energy measurements across various ore types using the Geopyörä device. While force measurement was assessed just for its precision. The outputs are compared directly to the DWT measures of fragmentation at the same energy and fitted A and b parameters. The test reproducibility was evaluated using a Round-Robin methodology, testing several samples in multiple laboratories. The results confirmed that the new test has sufficient accuracy to match DWT results and excellent precision to assure reproducibility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"810e36acf16e58fa40b909edb4b37e999718a9c4669674854f9f7581a30236d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
