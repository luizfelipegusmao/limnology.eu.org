{"title":"Genomic Analysis and Mechanisms Exploration of a Stress Tolerance and High-Yield Pullulan Producing Strain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0513/v1","date":1720176842000,"content":"Pullulan is a kind of natural polymer, which is widely used in medicine and food because of its solubility, plasticity, edible, non-toxicity and good biocompatibility. It is of great significance to improve the yield of pullulan by genetic modification of microorganisms. It was previously reported that Aureobasidium melanogenum TN3-1 isolated from honey-comb could produce high-yield of pullulan, but the molecular mechanisms of its production of pullulan had not been completely solved. In this study, the reported strains of Aureobasidium spp. were further compared and analyzed at genome level. It was found that genome duplication and genome genetic variations might be the crucial factors for the high yield of pullulan and stress resistance. This particular phenotype may be the result of adaptive evolution, which can adapt to its environment through genetic variation and adaptive selection. In addition, the TN3-1 strain has a large genome, and the special regulatory sequences of its specific genes and promoters may ensure a unique characteristics. This study is a supplement of the previous studies, and provides basic data for the research of microbial genome modification in food and healthcare applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3eba90157f5b052a514e96256642de707b17e3b3f1d7009c80af6fa2d70cbe37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
