In India, professional medical associations (PMAs) play a crucial role in shaping policy agenda in the health sector, but very little is known about gender diversity in their leadership. Therefore, we analysed the gender representation of current and past leaderships of Indian PMAs. Data of the current and past national leadership and leadership committees of 46 leading PMAs representing general, specialities, and super-specialities were extracted from their official websites. Gender composition of leadership was analysed using a sequential approach. For Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest Indian PMA, an analysis of its 32 sub-chapters was also undertaken. The findings revealed that only 9 (19.5%) out of 46 associations are currently led by a woman. Leadership committees of half the associations have less than 20% women, while there were no women in the central committee of nine PMAs. Among past presidents, information was publicly available for 31 associations and all of them have had less than 20% of women presidents till date. Among the 64 individuals currently serving as presidents and secretaries of 32 sub-chapters of IMA, only three (4.6%) are women. Even in associations closely related to womenâ€™s health, such as obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and neonatology, unequal representation persists, highlighting male dominance. These results demonstrate significant gender disparities in PMA leadership in India, necessitating urgent efforts to promote gender equality. Gender-transformative leadership is crucial to develop gender-sensitive health care policies and practices which can serve as a catalyst for broader societal change.","author":"Pratishtha Singh","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c859b899b2ab212580f18d1408ef447ff66ba4b15783f29428829c7a670585a6","category":"Environment"}
