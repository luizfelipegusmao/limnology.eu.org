{"title":"Numerical simulation of local and upwind temperature stratification on flow and dispersion in a bi-dimensional street canyon","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305739","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Xiaohui Huang, Lizhen Gao</p>\r\n\r\nThe thermal effect mainly includes boundary temperature stratification and the local thermal effect. The combined effect of these factors on flow and dispersion in a bi-dimensional canyon was investigated by the RANS and LES methods to evaluate their performance. The results, including the flow field, turbulent kinetic energy, temperature, heat flux, pollutant concentration and fluxes, were compared with the data from wind tunnel experiments. The comparison results showed that the RANS method severely overestimated the impact of windward heating on the flow in the canyon because of the lack of simulated flow separation ability and the limitation of the Boussinesq model, leading to an incorrect flow field and an incorrect temperature and concentration. In contrast, LES performed better mainly because of its ability to simulate flow separation. LES regenerated the right vortexes, flow field and low wind velocity. LES slightly overestimates the overall temperature in the canyon because heat exchange is eliminated in LES but difficult to avoid in the experiment. The difference in the air exchange rate at the roof level between the LES and wind tunnel data was no more than 5%, and the pollutant concentration distribution of the LES was almost the same as that of the experiments. This work emphasizes that the RANS method has limited ability to simulate flow and dispersion when the thermal effect is considered even at a reduced-scale, while LES can simulate the combined effects of incoming flow temperature stratification and local thermal effects. It is therefore suggested that if computing resources are limited and the temperature difference is not large, a steady-state calculation RANS can be used. Otherwise, LES must be performed.","author":"Xiaohui Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4a2da9bc9c44b29fd6d41fab76d0258192f64443c57c3a4d9da4bc801d68042c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
