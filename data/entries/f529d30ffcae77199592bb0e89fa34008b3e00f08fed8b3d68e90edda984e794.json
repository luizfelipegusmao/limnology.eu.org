{"title":"Distinct development trajectories and symbiosis modes in vent shrimps","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/3/413/7465036?rss=1","date":1702080000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Most animal species have a singular developmental pathway and adult ecology, but developmental plasticity is well-known in some such as honeybees where castes display profoundly different morphology and ecology. An intriguing case is the Atlantic deep-sea hydrothermal vent shrimp pair <span>Rimicaris hybisae</span> and <span>R. chacei</span> that share dominant COI haplotypes and could represent very recently diverging lineages or even morphs of the same species. <span>Rimicaris hybisae</span> is symbiont-reliant with a hypertrophied head chamber (in the Mid-Cayman Spreading Centre), while <span>R. chacei</span> is mixotrophic with a narrow head chamber (on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge). Here, we use X-ray micro-computed tomography and fluorescence in situ hybridization to show that key anatomical shifts in both occur during the juvenile–subadult transition, when <span>R. hybisae</span> has fully established symbiosis but not <span>R. chacei</span>. On the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the diet of <span>R. chacei</span> has been hypothetically linked to competition with the obligatorily symbiotic congener <span>R. exoculata</span>, and we find anatomical evidence that <span>R. exoculata</span> is indeed better adapted for symbiosis. We speculate the possibility that the distinct development trajectories in <span>R. hybisae</span> and <span>R. chacei</span> may be determined by symbiont colonization at a “critical period” before subadulthood, though further genetic studies are warranted to test this hypothesis along with the true relationship between <span>R. hybisae</span> and <span>R. chacei</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"f529d30ffcae77199592bb0e89fa34008b3e00f08fed8b3d68e90edda984e794","category":"Environment"}
