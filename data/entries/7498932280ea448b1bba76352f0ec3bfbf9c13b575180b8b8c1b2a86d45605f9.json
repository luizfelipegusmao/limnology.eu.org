{"title":"Optimization of the Oxygen Permeability of Non-Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lenses Through Crosslinking Modifications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0578/v1","date":1728436165000,"content":"The main weakness of non-silicone hydrogel contact lenses is their low oxygen permeability (Dk). Hence, we have tried to optimize their Dk using various concentrations and lengths of the ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) crosslinker in a mixture of N, N- Dimethylacrylamide and Cyclohexyl methacrylate monomers. After synthesizing the different contact lenses, we evaluated the impact of the different EGDMA conditions on their chemical, optical, and mechanical properties. The water content, the contact angle, the refractive index, the transmittance, and the young moduli of the synthesized lenses were slightly affected by crosslinker conditions. On the contrary, the elongation at break and, more importantly, the oxygen permeability, which reached values of up to 74.93 Fatt units, were considerably impacted by crosslinker conditions. This study demonstrates, for the first time toÂ our knowledge, that, in addition to water, other usual hydrogel components, like crosslinkers, can modulate the Dk of non-silicone contact lenses. It also provides a simple and scalable method to fabricate more permeable non-silicone lenses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7498932280ea448b1bba76352f0ec3bfbf9c13b575180b8b8c1b2a86d45605f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
