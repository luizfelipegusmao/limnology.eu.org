{"title":"Medical Ozone. Redox Regulation and a New Mechanism in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0288/v1","date":1728022487000,"content":"Medical ozone is a redox regulator with beneficial effects in oxidative etiology diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to conduct a holistic review from different pharmacological trials involving ozone in model diseases as well as the clinical response of RA patients. The ROS involved in RA and its relationship to the main pathological pathways of this autoimmune disease were here considered. The integrator analysis of experimental results from animals with clinical findings have revealed that both methotrexate (MTX) and medical ozone share common mechanisms via adenosinergic regulation. This finding has enabled us to propose a new pharmacological mechanism in the treatment of RA. We concluded that MTX + medical ozone combined therapy reduces ROS overproduction and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreases anti-cyclic citrullinate peptide levels by a mutual mechanism involving adenosine A1 receptors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58e633ffeb1d91f3c68ef9ca614039ec1780cf17a8c19b66972351b8c85c8f6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
