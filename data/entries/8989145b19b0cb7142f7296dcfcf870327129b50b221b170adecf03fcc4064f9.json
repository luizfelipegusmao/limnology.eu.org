{"title":"High-Resolution Satellites Expose Critical Deforestation and Carbon Loss in Costa Rica","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0134/v2","date":1729232260000,"content":"The Gandoca-Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge in Costa Rica is facing significant threats from deforestation, raising concerns about its impact on forest health and carbon sequestration. This study utilized high-resolution satellite data from Sentinel-2 and Planet NICFI to assess forest degradation and quantify deforestation from January 2023 to August 2024. Multiple vegetation indices, including NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, and MSI, were applied to monitor changes in forest health. Deforestation was calculated using relative NDVI change detection and thresholding techniques, while CO₂ emissions were estimated based on biomass loss derived from NDVI. The results show a 5% decrease in NDVI from Planet NICFI and a 2-3% decline from Sentinel-2, leading to the loss of 3.5 hectares of forest cover. Carbon dynamics revealed a CO₂ loss of 33,322.64 tons between January 2023 and January 2024, followed by a gain of 100,834.54 tons by August 2024, indicating partial recovery. The integration of Sentinel-2 and Planet NICFI data detected 13.22% deforestation with Sentinel-2 and 16.76% with Planet NICFI, emphasizing the importance of multi-source satellite imagery for accurate monitoring. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and effective management to sustain carbon storage and combat deforestation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8989145b19b0cb7142f7296dcfcf870327129b50b221b170adecf03fcc4064f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
