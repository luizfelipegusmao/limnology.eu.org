{"title":"Six Dimensions for Proof of Riemann Hypothesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1612/v3","date":1724835072000,"content":"This paper presents proof of Riemann's hypothesis by utilizing the golden ratio and the ellipse's eccentricity in six dimensions. This proof extends across all scientific fields. this research introduces logical and mathematical principles for distributing, recognizing, and categorizing prime numbers. It also explores the relationship between prime numbers and the complex conjugate of five prime numbers in various dimensions. Accordingly, it delves into the classification of even numbers based on prime numbers. This study examines the proof of Riemann's hypothesis from a geometric dimension perspective. Based on this, the mathematical structure of an integrated theory is defined. properties and principles associated with prime numbers reveal connections between quantum mechanics and general relativity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28f2364580d8dce95e4526259d43d6887ea5f700fc055da8f913bd92da180f60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
