{"title":"Early Single Center Experience of DaVinci&reg; Single-Port (SP) Robotic Surgery in Colorectal Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0974/v1","date":1713228607000,"content":"Background \nDaVinci Single-Port (SP) robotic surgery offers several benefits compared to traditional multiport laparoscopic or robotic surgeries. One of the main advantages is that it allows for a minimally invasive approach, resulting in a single, smaller incision and reduced trauma to the patient’s body leading to less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and reduced risk of complications. The cosmesis of a single port with minimal visible scarring is also an attractive aspect to the patients; however, many surgeons use an additional port for energy device, stapler use, and drain insertion. Pure single port surgery with one incision is still rare. Here we share our experience of first 10 cases using SP robotic platform in colorectal surgery. \n\nMethods \nFrom May 2023 to December 2023, colorectal patients who underwent SP-robotic surgery were analyzed. Placement of the incision was umbilicus for 8 patients, and right lower quadrant for 2 patients through which ileostomy maturation was performed. Data including perioperative parameters and postoperative outcomes were analyzed with a median follow-up of 4.6months (range 0.6-7.4months).\n\nResults \nA total number of 10 colorectal patients underwent DaVinci Single-Port robotic colorectal surgery at our institution during this period. Demographics of the patients showed 4 males (40%) and 6 females (60%) with a median age of 63.5years (range 50-75years). Median body mass index (BMI) was 22.89kg/m2 (range 19.92-26.84kg/m2), and 9 patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 1 patient was diagnosed with rectal gastrointestinal tumor. One patient underwent anterior resection and cholecystectomy simultaneously. Mean operation time was 222min (range 142-316min), and mean wound size was 3.25cm (range 2.5-4.5cm). Nine patients underwent surgery with single incision through which single port trocar was inserted, and one patient had one additional port for drain insertion. Mean hospital stay was 6 days (range 4-8 days) with 1 postoperative complication of bleeding requiring transfusion, but there was no re-admission within 30 days. \n\nConclusion \nOverall, our experience with single-port robotic colorectal surgery has been promising. With only one patient with additional port for drain insertion, all nine patients underwent SP-robotic surgery with single incision for colon as well as rectal surgeries. Compared to an average postoperative length of stay of 6.5-8 days in laparoscopic colorectal surgeries reported in literature, SP-robotic surgery showed faster recovery of 6 days highlighting its benefits in patient recovery and satisfaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84be9619e1edf8cd0dbdec3e2f4e39c4012125ff8e5b3d9c4cf852128630d99e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
