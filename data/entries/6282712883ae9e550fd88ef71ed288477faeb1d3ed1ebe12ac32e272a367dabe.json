{"title":"Assessing the breadth and multidisciplinarity of the conservation curriculum in the United Kingdom and Australia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/9/652/7725542?rss=1","date":1722470400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>There have been repeated calls to train conservationists capable of transcending disciplinary boundaries. However, little empirical work has been done to document conservation teaching. We investigate the content taught in conservation higher education across the United Kingdom and Australia. Using data from an online survey and content analysis of module descriptions, we assess the prevalence of subject areas in 146 conservation modules and topics in 368 conservation modules and 62 conservation degrees. Biological sciences subject areas were represented in 92% of the modules, whereas social sciences subject areas only featured in 60% and humanities in 24%. Of the modules teaching biological sciences subject areas, 84% included biological sciences faculty but only 31% of the modules covering social sciences subject areas included faculty from the social sciences. Who teaches matters. The disciplinary expertise in conservation education needs to diversify to train conservationists capable of addressing conservation challenges. This requires institutional changes and support from prominent societies to promote interdisciplinary education.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"6282712883ae9e550fd88ef71ed288477faeb1d3ed1ebe12ac32e272a367dabe","category":"Environment"}
