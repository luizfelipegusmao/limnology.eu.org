Hypocotyl length varies tremendously depending on the conditions. This developmental plasticity and the simplicity of the organ explain its success as a model for growth regulation. Light and temperature are prominent growth-controlling cues, using shared signaling elements. Mechanisms controlling hypocotyl elongation in etiolated seedlings reaching the light differ from those in photoautotrophic seedlings. However, many common growth regulators intervene in both situations. Multiple photoreceptors including phytochromes, which also respond to temperature, control the activity of several transcription factors, thereby eliciting rapid transcriptional reprogramming. Hypocotyl growth often depends on sensing in green tissues and interorgan communication comprising auxin. Hypocotyl auxin, in conjunction with other hormones, determines epidermal cell elongation. Plants facing cues with opposite effects on growth control hypocotyl elongation through intricate mechanisms. We discuss the status of the field and end by highlighting open questions.</p></div>","author":"Johanna Krahmer and Christian Fankhauser","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Plant Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f9af7703a9e08f35edcf21995cc07f36402e9892411dd5042fb57fa6c1c4e57d","entryHash":"2c203e04055c526f714dd7ced63418b8f38e4bbb041acc5dc526160d74c6f654","category":"Environment"}
