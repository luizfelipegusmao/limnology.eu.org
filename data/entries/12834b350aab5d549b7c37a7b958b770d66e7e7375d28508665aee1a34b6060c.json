What about modern CSS and JavaScript? What’s the state of HTML Email? And what are new, smart design patterns we could use? What will it take us to move to TypeScript or Vue.js? With our line-up of online workshops, we try to answer these questions well. </p>\n<p>Our workshops bring in knowledgeable, kind folks from the community to explore <strong>real-life solutions</strong> to real-life problems, live, with you. All sessions are broken down into <strong>2.5h-segments</strong> across days, so you always have time to ask questions, share your screen and get immediate feedback.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#all-workshops\">Jump to all workshops →</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1a95c729-8b29-4b44-90b0-d38183b367c0/online-workshops-2021-opt.png\" /></a>\nMeet <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Smashing Online Workshops</a>: live, interactive sessions on frontend &amp; UX.\n\n\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/\">live discussions and interactive exercises</a> are at the very heart of every workshop, with group work, homework, reviews and live interaction with people around the world.

After all, who really wants to spend more time in front of their screen? That’s exactly why we’ve <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/\">designed the online workshop experience from scratch</a>, accounting for the time needed to take in all the content, understand it and have enough time to ask <em>just</em> the right questions.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/394a4d0e-4c57-4d55-a72a-87f244ab1320/kececypa-1.png\" /></a>\nIn <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">our workshops</a>, everybody is just a slightly blurry rectangle on the screen; everybody is equal, and invited to participate.\n\n\n<p>Our online workshops take place <strong>live</strong> and span <strong>multiple days across weeks.</strong> They are split into 2.5h-sessions, and in every session there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We don’t rush through the content, but instead try to create a welcoming, friendly and inclusive environment for everyone to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/\">things to expect from a Smashing workshop</a>, but the most important one is focus on <strong>practical examples</strong> and techniques. The workshops aren’t talks; they are <strong>interactive</strong>, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work.</p>\n<p>Of course, you get all workshop materials and <strong>video recordings</strong> as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.</p>\n<h4>TL;DR</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshops span <strong>multiple days</strong>, split in <em>2.5h-sessions</em>.</li>\n<li>Enough time for live Q&amp;A every day.</li>\n<li>Dozens of <strong>practical examples</strong> and techniques.</li>\n<li>You’ll get all workshop materials &amp; recordings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops\">All workshops</a> are focused on frontend &amp; UX.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/bundles\">Get a workshop bundle</a> and <strong>save $250</strong> off the price.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Jump to all workshops →</a></div>\n\n<h3>Thank You!</h3>\n<p>We hope that the <strong>insights from the workshops</strong> will help you improve your skills and the quality of your work.
