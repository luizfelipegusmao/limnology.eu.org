{"title":"Catheter ablation of atrial arrhythmias in cardiac amyloidosis: Impact on heart failure and mortality","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301753","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Philippe Maury, Kevin Sanchis, Kamila Djouadi, Eve Cariou, Hubert Delasnerie, Serge Boveda, Pauline Fournier, Romain Itier, Pierre Mondoly, Quentin Voglimacci-Stephanopoli, Maxime Beneyto, Tarvinder S. Dhanjal, Anne Rollin, Thibaud Damy, Olivier Lairez, Nicolas Lellouche</p>\r\nBackground <p>Atrial arrhythmias (AA) commonly affect patients with cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and are a contributing risk factor for the development of heart failure (HF). This study sought to investigate the long-term efficacy and impact of catheter ablation on HF progression in patients with CA and AA.</p> Methods <p>Thirty-one patients with CA and AA undergoing catheter ablation were retrospectively included (transthyretin—ATTR CA 61% and light chain—AL CA 39%). AA subtypes included atrial fibrillation (AFib) in 22 (paroxysmal in 10 and persistent in 12), atrial flutter (AFl) in 17 and atrial tachycardia (AT) in 11 patients. Long-term AA recurrence rates were evaluated along with the impact of sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance on HF and mortality.</p> Results <p>AA recurrence was observed in 14 patients (45%) at a median of 3.5 months (AFib n = 8, AT n = 6, AFl = 0). Post-cardioversion, medical therapy or catheter ablation, 10 patients (32%) remained in permanent AA. Over a median follow-up of 19 months, all-cause mortality was 39% (n = 12): 3 with end-stage HF, 5 due to late complications of CA, 1 sudden cardiac death, 1 stroke, 1 COVID 19 (and one unknown). With maintenance of SR following catheter ablation, significant reductions in serum creatinine and natriuretic peptide levels were observed with improvements in NYHA class. Two patients required hospitalization for HF in the SR maintenance cohort compared to 5 patients in the AA recurrence cohort (p = 0.1). All 3 patients with deaths secondary to HF had AA recurrence compared to 11 out of the 28 patients whom were long-term survivors or deaths not related to HF (p = 0.04). All-cause mortality was not associated with AA recurrence.</p> Conclusion <p>This study demonstrates moderate long-term efficacy of SR maintenance with catheter ablation for AA in patients with CA. Improvements in clinical and biological status with positive trends in HF mortality are observed if SR can be maintained.</p>","author":"Philippe Maury","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"542fdd6dc1ecbb6bc4653995f8cdc66783cf1c9f5df3d33fb4911cc4247ad019","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
