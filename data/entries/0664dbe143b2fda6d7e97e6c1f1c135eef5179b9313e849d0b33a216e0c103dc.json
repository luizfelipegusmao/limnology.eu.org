{"title":"On characterization of entropy measure using logarithmic regression model for Copper(II) Fluoride","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300757","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui, Mazhar Hussain, Sana Javed, Sadia Khalid, Tayyaba Noor, Fikadu Tesgera Tolasa</p>\r\n\r\nThe versatile uses of Copper(II) Fluoride (<i>CuF</i><sub>2</sub>) are well known; these include its usage as a precursor in chemical synthesis as well as its contribution to the creation of sophisticated materials and electronics. There are interesting opportunities to study the interactions between these elements because of their unique crystal structure, which contains copper ions and fluoride anions. Its potential in optoelectronic devices and conductive qualities also make it a viable material for next-generation technologies. To better understand the structural properties of <i>CuF</i><sub>2</sub> and how they affect its entropy, we present new Zagreb indices in this study and use them to calculate entropy measures. We also build a regression model to clarify the relationship between the calculated indices and entropy levels. The findings of our investigation offer significant understanding regarding the ability of the suggested Zagreb indices to extract meaningful content and their correlation with entropy in the context of <i>CuF</i><sub>2</sub>. This information is important for understanding <i>CuF</i><sub>2</sub> alloys and for exploring related complex materials.","author":"Muhammad Kamran Siddiqui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0664dbe143b2fda6d7e97e6c1f1c135eef5179b9313e849d0b33a216e0c103dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
