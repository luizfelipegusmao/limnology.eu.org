{"title":"Enhancing ecological success in Yangtze River channel construction: A numerical modelling approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2664?af=R","date":1716538105000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Channel constructions significantly impact river hydrodynamics, subsequently influencing river ecosystems. To mitigate the negative influence of channel construction and protect fish habitat, it is essential to evaluate fish habitat suitability through the integration of hydrodynamic and habitat models. This study models channel constructions on both the left and right riverbanks to evaluate habitat suitability for Four Major Chinese Carps and the Chinese sturgeon. Initially, flow velocity, water depth and grain size are simulated, followed by an assessment of habitat conditions using the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) for three distinct construction strategies. Results reveal that constructing channels on the left bank mitigates adverse effects on fish habitat, while constructions on the right bank and both riverbanks lead to habitat degradation. Long-term effects on riverbed elevation and fish habitat suitability post-construction were also investigated. Notably, the Four Major Chinese Carps consistently demonstrate greater suitability for the studied river, regardless of flow rate or construction strategies, in comparison to the Chinese sturgeon. These findings underscore diverse responses to channel construction, providing valuable insights for identifying critical habitat areas for endemic fish conservation. This research presents a robust framework for assessing fish ecology in river systems, offering support for conservation decision-makers.</p>","author":"Pengcheng Li, \nYike Li, \nYang Yang, \nQianqian Wang, \nWeiwei Yao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"7d670ba1c7d1fe65e71d7f4500e9984f05cf2e4c29dac748b05b559a4a03873f","category":"Environment"}
