{"title":"Resolving Contrast and Detail Trade-Offs in Image Processing with Multi-Objective Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1658/v1","date":1724337356000,"content":"This article addresses the complex challenge of simultaneously enhancing contrast and detail in an image, where improving one property often compromises the other. This trade-off is tackled using a multi-objective optimization approach. Specifically, the proposal's model integrates the sigmoid transformation function and unsharp masking highboost filtering with the NSGA-II algorithm. Additionally, a posterior preference articulation is introduced to select three key solutions from the Pareto front: the maximum contrast solution, the maximum detail solution, and the knee point solution. The proposed technique is evaluated on a range of image types, including medical and natural scenes. The final solutions demonstrated significant superiority in terms of contrast and detail compared to the original images. The three selected solutions, although all are optimal, captured distinct characteristics within the images, offering different solutions according to field preferences. This highlights the method's effectiveness across different types and enhancement requirements and emphasizes the importance of the proposed preferences in different contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a680af46792c2b4823fdfba0b0aa8a36d78450203d38f60807ab3173a61ad68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
