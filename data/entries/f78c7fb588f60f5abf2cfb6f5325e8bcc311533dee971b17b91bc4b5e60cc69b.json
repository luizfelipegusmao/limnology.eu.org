{"title":"Financial Stability and Innovation: The Role of Non-Performing Loans","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0374/v1","date":1722940601000,"content":"The following article analyses the relationship between Non-Performing Loans and innovation systems at a global level. The analysed data were obtained from the World Bank and the Global Innovation Index for the period 2013-2022 for 149 countries. The analysis was conducted using clustering with the k-Means algorithm, optimized with the Silhouette coefficient and the Elbow method. Subsequently, econometric analysis was carried out using panel data with Random Ef-fects and Fixed Effects. The clustering results show that the optimal number of clusters is three. The econometric analysis highlights the positive relationship between Non-Performing Loans, the exports of cultural and creative services, and the Innovation Input Sub-Index. The results also show the negative relationship between Non-Performing Loans, the H-Index, and the exports and imports of ICT services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f78c7fb588f60f5abf2cfb6f5325e8bcc311533dee971b17b91bc4b5e60cc69b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
