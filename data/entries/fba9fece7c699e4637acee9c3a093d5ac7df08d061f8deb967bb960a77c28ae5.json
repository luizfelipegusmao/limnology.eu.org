In exemplar STCH materials a metal oxide is thermally reduced, releasing O<sub>2</sub> and generating oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>) in the crystal lattice, followed by a re-oxidation step in steam resulting in H<sub>2</sub> gas formation as the water molecule is split into H<sub>2</sub> and O to filling V<sub>O</sub> formed during reduction [<a href=\"#ozae044.825-B2\">2</a>]. Recently, our group, using a machine learning model applied to the Materials Project database, predicted an orthorhombic spinel (Bb21m) BaFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (BFO) shown in <strong>Fig. <span>3</span></strong>a. to be a successful water splitting material [<a href=\"#ozae044.825-B3\">3</a>]. We evaluated water splitting behavior of BFO using a stagnation flow reactor (SFR) showing promising results. However, an irreversible phase transformation at low oxygen partial pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>) rendered the material unstable to repeat cycling. To prevent the irreversible phase transformation, Al was substituted for Fe in BFO. The resultant Al-doped BaAl<sub>0.4</sub>Fe<sub>1.6</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (BAFO) with a hexagonal (P6<sub>3</sub>) structure shown in <strong>Fig. <span>3</span></strong>b was synthesized and had increased stability at low pO<sub>2</sub> and high temperature, enabling greater H<sub>2</sub> production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fba9fece7c699e4637acee9c3a093d5ac7df08d061f8deb967bb960a77c28ae5","category":"Environment"}
