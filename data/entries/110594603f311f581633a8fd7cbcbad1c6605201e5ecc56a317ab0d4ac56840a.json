{"title":"Assessing Seismic Vulnerability Methods for RC-Frame Buildings in Pre- and Post-Earthquake","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1201/v1","date":1726480104000,"content":"In metropolitan regions, which are particularly vulnerable to seismic damage, numerous reinforced concrete (RC) buildings are being constructed. Public safety has been an important consideration to safeguard and protect people, buildings, and infrastructure from the potential effects of earthquakes. The assessment of seismic vulnerability within urban areas encompassed an analysis of both building vulnerability and the scale of seismic hazards prevalent in the locality. This assessment aimed to ascertain the likelihood of building damage resulting from ground motion induced by an earthquake of a specific magnitude. In recent decades, considerable efforts have been made to develop and improve methods for assessing earthquake damage to reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. These efforts included the creation of seismic hazard and seismic risk indices that were used to quantify the potential destruction of individual building components or the entire building. This scholarly review article presents an in-depth analysis and concise summary of the primary techniques (including qualitative or empirical, quantitative, analytical, and experimental test methods) devised for appraising the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete frame buildings, pre- and post-earthquake occurrences. It is a valuable reference for policymakers, engineers, researchers, and specialists engaged in earthquake risk mitigation efforts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"110594603f311f581633a8fd7cbcbad1c6605201e5ecc56a317ab0d4ac56840a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
