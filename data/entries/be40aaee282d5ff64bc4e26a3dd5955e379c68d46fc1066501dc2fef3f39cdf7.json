There is a substantial gap in literature on PSIs in African countries, with most studies concentrated in wealthier cities and lacking comprehensive assessments of long-term health impacts. The objective of this study was to synthesise evidence on the typology, location, features, and outcomes of these initiatives as well as the guiding principles that underlie their design and implementation. Employing a mixed-methods model, the study systematically reviews peer-reviewed and grey literature articles, focusing on the types, settings, and outcomes of PSIs. Data is analyzed using the CASP appraisal tool and thematic analysis. We analysed 47 studies, 15 of which were mixed methods, 22 qualitative and 10 quantitative. Sports accounted for 50% of initiatives. 30 of the 47 papers originated from South Africa. Communities viewed initiatives’ wellbeing impacts through social, economic, and ecological lenses, with health being but one dimension. The sustainability of initiatives was often limited by funding, historical marginalization, and competing land uses. Findings underscore the need for more comprehensive, long-term evaluations and cross-sector collaborations to sustain and enhance health-promoting public spaces in African cities.","author":"Thondoo Meelan","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"be40aaee282d5ff64bc4e26a3dd5955e379c68d46fc1066501dc2fef3f39cdf7","category":"Environment"}
