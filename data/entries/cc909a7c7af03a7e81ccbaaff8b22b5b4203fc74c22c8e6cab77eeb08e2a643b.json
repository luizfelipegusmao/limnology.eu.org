Many asterids provide food, spices, and medicines. Phylogenetically, asterids are grouped into 4 clades: Lamiids (e.g. coffee, sweet potato, olive, rosemary, and periwinkle), Campanulids (e.g. carrot, sunflower, and lettuce), Ericales (e.g. tea, kiwifruit, and Brazil nut), and Cornales (e.g. dogwood and hydrangea). The Solanaceae family, belonging to Lamiids, includes major agricultural crops, such as potato, tomato, and pepper. Pathogens and pests attacking these crops substantially reduce yields and qualities. Improving plant disease resistance through breeding is therefore an important strategy for minimizing yield losses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cc909a7c7af03a7e81ccbaaff8b22b5b4203fc74c22c8e6cab77eeb08e2a643b","category":"Environment"}
