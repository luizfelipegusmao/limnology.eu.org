{"title":"Hydrodynamic Diversity of Jets Mediated by Giant and Non-Giant Axon Systems in Brief Squid","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1266/7209892?rss=1","date":1687910400000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Neural input is critical for establishing behavioral output, but understanding how neuromuscular signals give rise to behaviors remains a challenge. In squid, locomotion through jet propulsion underlies many key behaviors, and the jet is mediated by two parallel neural pathways, the giant and non-giant axon systems. Much work has been done on the impact of these two systems on jet kinematics, such as mantle muscle contraction and pressure-derived jet speed at the funnel aperture. However, little is known about any influence these neural pathways may have on the hydrodynamics of the jet after it leaves the squid and transfers momentum to the surrounding fluid for the animal to swim. To gain a more comprehensive view of squid jet propulsion, we made simultaneous measurements of neural activity, pressure inside the mantle cavity, and wake structure. By computing impulse and time-averaged forces from the wake structures of jets associated with giant or non-giant axon activity, we show that the influence of neural pathways on jet kinematics could extend to hydrodynamic impulse and force production. Specifically, the giant axon system produced jets with, on average, greater impulse magnitude than those of the non-giant system. However, non-giant impulse could exceed that of the giant system, evident by the graded range of its output in contrast to the stereotyped nature of the giant system. Our results suggest that the non-giant system offers flexibility in hydrodynamic output, while recruitment of giant axon activity can provide a reliable boost when necessary.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"4d26d8004b94f753fd1a1c2f3a3cbd937dab5e1bc44295c7e7add16dc3e0be5d","category":"Environment"}
