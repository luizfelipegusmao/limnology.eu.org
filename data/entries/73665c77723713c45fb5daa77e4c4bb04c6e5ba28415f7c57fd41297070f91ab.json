{"title":"A review on the present and future of solar power in Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0300/v2","date":1710405299000,"content":"This paper provides a study on the development of solar energy, its prospects, and its impacts in Africa. Although the main focus is on technologies adopted for different uses (solar farms, mini-grids, off-grid, solar houses, irrigation, lighting, etc.), we also consider some aspects that increase the adoption of solar energy, such as legislation and business models. Finally, we will examine current and future solar projects managed by NGOs and international companies and how they benefit to leveraging social and economic standards, quality of life as well as capacity building in Africa. This study shows the plethoric interest of institutions outside Africa in the market of solar energy in the continent and that there is no African strategy to increase its independency toward a sustainable development particularly through energy transition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73665c77723713c45fb5daa77e4c4bb04c6e5ba28415f7c57fd41297070f91ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
