{"title":"Cultural Tourism Interpreter&rsquo;s Service Competence Perceived by Chinese Tourists Visiting Nanjing Museum Influencing Revisit Intention-Moderating Effect of Tourist Empathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1189/v1","date":1721092655000,"content":"The landscape of tourism is undergoing rapid transformation in response to societal shifts, economic fluctuations, and advancements in the tourism sector, particularly in the post-pandemic. Tourists are increasingly inclined towards outdoor activities and natural landscapes, prioritizing experiences that emphasize health and safety. Conversely, cultural tourism emphasizes local heritage and immersive encounters to accommodate evolving preferences. Cultural tour guides play a pivotal role in shaping tourists' perceptions and intentions to revisit. Empirical research conducted among Chinese tourists visiting Nanjing Museum explores this paradigm shift. A questionnaire was distributed to 402 respondents to examine the principal factors influencing intentions to revisit. Factor and regression analyses illustrate the significance of cultural tour guides' competencies, revealing a positive correlation with intentions to revisit. It is noteworthy that tourist empathy moderates this relationship, wherein higher levels of empathy magnify the impact of tour guides' competencies on intentions to revisit. Robustness checks further validate these findings, affirming the nuanced interaction between service competencies, tourist empathy, and intentions to revisit. The study underscores the substantial influence of cultural tour guides on shaping tourist experiences and fostering repeat visits. This is contingent upon both the quality of service provided and the degree of empathy exhibited towards tourists.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a6aee08b5cc25c2988288350728e4738f81e4cfa4df23b6b47b7db824555fda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
