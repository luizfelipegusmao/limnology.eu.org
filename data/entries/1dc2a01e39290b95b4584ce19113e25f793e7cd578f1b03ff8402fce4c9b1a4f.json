{"title":"Association between the Use of Macrolides in Food-Producing Animals and Mycoplasma pneumoniae Macrolide Resistance: A Global Ecological Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1177/v1","date":1713357185000,"content":"In the current study we test the hypothesis that the consumption of macrolides in food-animals is positively associated with the prevalence of macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae at a country-level. The prevalence of M. pneumoniae macrolide resistance was positively associated with the consumption of macrolides for both food animals (Rho = 0.66; P=0.007) and humans (Rho = 0.54; P=0.040). Linear regression analysis revealed that macrolide consumption in food animals but not humans was borderline significantly associated with macrolide resistance (coef. 5547 [95% CI -596-11691] and coef. 0.006 [95% CI -0.008-0.020], respectively).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1dc2a01e39290b95b4584ce19113e25f793e7cd578f1b03ff8402fce4c9b1a4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
