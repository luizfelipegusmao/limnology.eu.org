{"title":"STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor Bt354 exhibits anti‐neoplastic activity in glioblastoma multiforme cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24178?af=R","date":1709126647000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The high mortality rate of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a lethal primary brain tumor, is attributable to postsurgical recurrence. STAT3, an oncogenic protein, is a signal transducer and transcription activator encourages cancer cell migration and proliferation, which results in resistance to therapy. STAT3 inhibition reduces cancer metastasis and improves patient prognosis. Bt354, a small molecule STAT inhibitor, exhibits significant cytotoxic and anti-proliferative activities against certain cancer types. Here, we demonstrated that exposure of GBM cells (U87 MG) to Bt354 had a significant, concentration-dependent growth suppression. Bt354 also induced apoptosis and downregulated the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes. Therefore, this study suggests the potential of Bt354 for treating GBM owing to its ability to induce cytotoxicity.</p>","author":"Yi‐Chun Chiang, \nPadhmavathi Selvam, \nYou‐Xuan Liu, \nPo‐Chang Shih, \nNan‐Fu Chen, \nHsiao‐Mei Kuo, \nHugo You‐Hsien Lin, \nZhi‐Hong Wen, \nWu‐Fu Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"2138bc6c9e97e9c4d946d519b3bc0827eb786ec2dc0868d6177345f65c18c3b1","category":"Environment"}
