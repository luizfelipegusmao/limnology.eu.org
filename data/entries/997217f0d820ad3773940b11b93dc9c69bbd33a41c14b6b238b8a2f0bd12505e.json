{"title":"Prediction of low-addition segmented refractive intraocular lens position and deviation using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305076","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Norihiro Mita, Mai Yamazaki, Yusuke Seki, Yu Sasaki, Eri Shibuya, Tsuyoshi Mito, Natsuko Hatsusaka, Eri Kubo, Hiroshi Sasaki</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to develop and analyze the accuracy of predictive formulae for postoperative anterior chamber depth, tilt, and decentration of low-added-segment refractive intraocular lenses. This single-center, retrospective, observational study included the right eyes of 96 patients (mean age: 72.43 Â± 6.58 years), who underwent a cataract surgery with implantation of a low-added segmented refractive intraocular lens at the Medical University Hospital between July 2019 and January 2021, and were followed up for more than 1 month postoperatively. The participants were divided into an estimation group to create a prediction formula and a validation group to verify the accuracy of the formula. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (CASIA 2, Tomey Corporation, Japan) and swept-source optical coherence tomography biometry (IOL Master 700, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) were used to measure the anterior ocular components. A predictive formula was devised for postoperative anterior chamber depth, intraocular lens tilt, and intraocular lens decentration (p &lt;0.01) in the estimation group. A significant positive correlation was observed between the estimated values calculated using the prediction formula and the measured values for postoperative anterior chamber depth (r = 0.792), amount of intraocular lens tilt (r = 0.610), direction of intraocular lens tilt (r = 0.668), and amount of intraocular lens decentration (r = 0.431) (p &lt; 0.01) in the validation group. In conclusion, our findings reveal that predicting the position of the low-added segmented refractive intraocular lens enables the prognosis of postoperative refractive values with a greater accuracy in determining the intraocular lens adaptation.","author":"Norihiro Mita","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"997217f0d820ad3773940b11b93dc9c69bbd33a41c14b6b238b8a2f0bd12505e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
