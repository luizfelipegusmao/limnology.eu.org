{"title":"Study on Fabrication and Properties of Polyvinyl Alcohol&mdash;Chitosan Nanofibers from Aqueous Solution with Acetic Acid and Ethanol by Electrospinning Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0296/v1","date":1728025617000,"content":"Drug–targeted integrated nanofiber development is a current research trend. Potential materials for the development of such systems include Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and chitosan (CS) nanofibers, which are traditionally fabricated by electrospinning aqueous solutions of these polymers with acetic acid. To improve drug integration, the binary-solvent system was converted into a multi–solvent system by the adding of ethanol. This caused noticeable shifts in the solvent system's solubility parameter, the interaction of the various component forces, and optical and rheological properties of PVA-CS solution. The results show that solution containing 4% PVA, 3% CS, 15% ethanol and 45% acetic acid is optimal for the increasing of manufacturing productivity, improving the morphology and diameter of PVA–CS nanofibers, without changing in chemical bonding composition. The XRD spectrum revealed that the alterations in the crystal lattice and diameter of the PVA–CS nanofibers leaded to the variation in their thermal and tensile properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe78ce87acde1e2c6d0a8287d36e172ab1e51fe3d085c3f9626dfe0590be203a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
