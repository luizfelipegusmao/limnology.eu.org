{"title":"Metal-Ceramic Ultradisperse 3D Composite Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0449/v1","date":1712328742000,"content":"Experimental studies on the development of processes of obtaining ultradispersed metal-ceramic materials and coatings Mo-ZrO2, Mo-Al2O3, W-ZrO2, W-Al2O3 CVD by deposition from the gas phase in CO2 process using low-temperature nonequilibrium plasma were carried out.The structure, microhardness, phase composition, and high-temperature annealing behavior of the materials were studied. It is shown that the choice of parameters of the deposition process and temperature annealing can be controlled by the distribution function of ultradispersed particles in the material and their sizes.High-temperature X-ray studies of \"molecular\" two-phase alloys Mo- Al2O3 and Mo- ZrO2show that, depending on the elastic and thermal properties of the matrix materials and dispersed particles, the molybdenum matrix can be in an all-round tensed or all-round compressed state.In the study of the electro-physical characteristics of the two-phase disperse-strengthened alloys Mo- ZrO2, Mo- Al2O3, W- ZrO2, W- Al2O3 it has been established that in the region of temperatures 1023...1273K anomalous changes of specific electrical resistance and instability of thermal eddy in magnitude are observed apparently connected with the presence of internal stresses in material caused by ultradisperse particles.Theoretical aspects of the problem of increasing the carriers density in nanocomposite materials are reviewedTheoretical analysis of the effect of the ensemble of microparticles on the change of electron density in ultradisperse metal-ceramic materials is carried out. It is shown that the average values of the electron density in the matrix with the introduction of 1% of particles with a radius of 50 A increase by more than two orders of magnitude.The possibilities of creating ultradisperse compositions using radiation-plasma methods are considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e21e78a1a9879356f255a453f796626b6b0e83df860afabc24a9fc0e5279329","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
