{"title":"EV Smart-Charging Strategy for Power Management in Distribution Grid with high penetration of Distributed Generation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1124/v1","date":1728988667000,"content":"Accelerated environmental impacts are a growing concern in the modern world. As a result, electric mobility and the transition to a cleaner energy matrix have become increasingly discussed topics. Several countries and entities have already made medium and long-term commitments related to electric mobility. In this context, this work presents a framework for controlling an electric vehicle (EV) charging station, integrated into a microgrid application, as a basis for creating the infrastructure integrated into a smart grid concept. Considering the future perspectives associated with the electrification of the transportation sector and expected impacts, a brief review is conducted on the prospects for the growth of electric vehicle fleets in different countries and how smart charging technologies are identified as solutions for mitigating the negative effects of energy and power consumption associated with EV charging stations. An analysis of the technical characteristics of EV charging is carried out, and the tools that enable the deployment of a fleet charging operator are examined specifically focusing on the communication protocol for EVs, such as the OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) parameterization/configuration. Additionally, a new charging station control method is proposed, aiming to manage the impacts of integrating distributed solar photovoltaic generation and mitigate the effects of the duck curve. Finally, this work also proposes an integration architecture for these elements, resulting in a practical implementation for variable power control throughout the day, considering different strategies to deal with distributed generation impact using EV fleet charging power demand dynamic management. Finally, a proposal for integration via IEC 61850 using low-cost devices for the implementation of a digital communication system is presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"765f0742ce5d352f6d52f74a9f32dc79d7298313b5b9e45662fab1028efcf826","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
