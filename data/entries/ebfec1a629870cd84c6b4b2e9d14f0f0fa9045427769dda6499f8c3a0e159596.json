Methods: This study focused on preterm infants admitted to our hospital from June 2021 to November 2021. Strict screening was applied to select 54 cases for inclusion. Clinical data were collected for all study subjects, and based on different intervention plans, they were divided into a control group and an experimental group, with 27 cases in each group. The experimental group received intervention based on a developmental sequencing early rehabilitation model in addition to routine care, while the control group only received routine care intervention. The growth and development of the two groups of preterm infants were compared during the study, including physical indicators, intellectual-motor skills, neurobehavioral assessments, and developmental monitoring. Results: The clinical data of the two groups of preterm infants were comparable, with no significant differences (P&gt;0.05). The experimental group exhibited significantly higher values in physical indicators such as weight, head circumference, and height compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05). Intellectual-motor scores (MDI and PDI) of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group (P&lt;0.05). The NBNA scale scores for various dimensions were higher in the experimental group compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05). The DQ values of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Early rehabilitation training based on developmental sequencing has a positive impact on the growth and development of late preterm infants. Through systematic and sequenced rehabilitation interventions, various aspects of development in late preterm infants can be promoted effectively. This approach not only improves physical development but also enhances intellectual-motor skills, neurobehavioral development, and overall developmental levels. The results are significant, indicating the worthiness of widespread application and promotion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ebfec1a629870cd84c6b4b2e9d14f0f0fa9045427769dda6499f8c3a0e159596","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
