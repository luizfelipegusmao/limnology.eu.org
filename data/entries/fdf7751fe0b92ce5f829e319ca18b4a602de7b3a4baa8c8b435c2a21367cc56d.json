The elements found in the particle filters have been C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, K, O and Ba; whose morphology and chemical composition of the particles indicate an important contribution of the natural elements located in the area, such as those of anthropogenic origin, such as Pb and S, which are of interest from the environmental point of view, as well as public health.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fdf7751fe0b92ce5f829e319ca18b4a602de7b3a4baa8c8b435c2a21367cc56d","category":"Environment"}
