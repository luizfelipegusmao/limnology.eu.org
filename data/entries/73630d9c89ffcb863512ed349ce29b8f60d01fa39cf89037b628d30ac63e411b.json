{"title":"Photocatalytic Ammonia Decomposition Using Dye-Encapsulated Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1225/v1","date":1724034898000,"content":"Photocatalytic ammonia decomposition to produce N2 and H2 was achieved using single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) nanohybrids. Physical modification of ferrocene-dye-encapsulated CNTs by amphiphilic C60-dendron yielded nanohybrids with a dye/CNT/C60 coaxial heterojunction. Upon visible light irradiation, an aqueous solution of NH3 and dye@CNT/C60-dendron nanohybrids produced both N2 and H2 in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:3. Action spectra of this reaction clearly demonstrated that the encapsulated dye acted as the photosensitizer, with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 0.22% at 510 nm (the Î»max of the dye). This study presents the first example of dye-sensitized ammonia decomposition and offers a new avenue for developing efficient and sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen production systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73630d9c89ffcb863512ed349ce29b8f60d01fa39cf89037b628d30ac63e411b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
