{"title":"Association of hyperuricemia with coronary heart disease: Protocol for an updated systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308719","date":1724335200000,"content":"<p>by Jinling Chen, Yi Pan, Qun Gao, Rui Zhuang, Liyong Ma</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Hyperuricemia, characterized by elevated serum uric acid levels, has garnered significant attention in cardiovascular research due to its potential association with coronary heart disease (CHD). While some studies suggest hyperuricemia as a risk factor of CHD, others present conflicting findings. A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis is warranted to comprehensively summarize the previous studies and determine the association between hyperuricemia and CHD, thereby supporting clinical practice and future studies in this field.</p> Methods <p>In this study, we will comprehensively search Medline, EMBase, Cochrane Central, ICTRP, and <i>ClinicalTrials</i>.<i>gov</i>, from inception to December 31, 2024. Prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies investigating the association between hyperuricemia and CHD will be included. Two independent reviewers will conduct study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. The primary outcome will be the pooled relative risk of CHD associated with hyperuricemia by using random-effect model. Dose-response meta-analysis will be performed with linear and non-linear model to explore the the magnitude and direction of the association between serum uric acid levels and CHD risk. Subgroup analyses will be conducted based on uric acid test approaches and corresponding cut-off values and human races. Sensitivity analyses will assess the robustness of the results with leave-one-out method, while publication bias will be evaluated using funnel plots, Egger’s test, and Begg’s test. We will further use GRADE to evaluate the quality of the evidences provided by our systematic review.</p> Expected results <p>From this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis, we hope out findings will provide reliable conclusion and data support on the association between hyperuricemia and CHD. The transparent and replicable methodologies outlined in this protocol contribute to advancing understanding of hyperuricemia as a potentially modifiable risk factor for CHD, thus supporting evidence-based strategies for cardiovascular disease management.</p> Conclusions <p>This protocol describes a rigorous plan to systematically review and analyze the quantitative association between hyperuricemia and CHD risk. In a word, we will help further clinical practice and scientific studies in this field.</p> Trial registration <p>This protocol was registered in PROSPERO CRD42024538553.</p>","author":"Jinling Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"81ac8641808914b94e201015b478fa99a20097e1dfa69201ac839e895b731095","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
