{"title":"A Method for Recognition and Coordinate Reference of Autono-Mous Underwater Vehicle to Inspected Objects of Industrial Sub-Sea Structures Using Stereo Images","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0202/v1","date":1722908644000,"content":"To date, the development of unmanned technologies using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) has become an urgent demand for solving the problem of inspection of industrial sub-sea structures. A key issue here is precise localization of AUVs relative to underwater objects. However, the well-known challenges of recognizing and coordinating underwater objects (impossibility to use GPS, undercurrents, etc.) do not allow high-precision navigation if based solely on a standard suite of AUV navigation tools (sonars, etc.). An alternative is a technology of processing of optical images that, at short distances, can provide higher accuracy of AUV navigation compared to a technology of acoustic measurement processing. In this study, in the context of the problem of subsea production system inspection, we propose a method to recognize underwater objects and provide coordinate reference of AUV to them, based on stereo-image processing. Its distinctive features are the use of a non-standard technique for generating a geometric model of an object from its views (foreshortening) taken from positions of a pre-made overview trajectory, the use of various characteristic geometric elements when recognizing objects, and the original algorithms for comparing visual data of the inspection trajectory with an a priori model of the object.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e0a9eef15628e7c7e58d132e34a25e998ee50a65dd4eabec96835003db915a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
