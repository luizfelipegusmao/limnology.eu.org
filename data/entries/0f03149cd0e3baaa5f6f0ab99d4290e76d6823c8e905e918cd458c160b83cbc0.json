Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNMs) have gained growing interest in agriculture due to their potential impact on crop productivity, showcasing effects on plant biological processes at transcriptional levels, yet their impacts chromatin accessibility remains unknown.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>In this study, we found that fullerenol can penetrate seed coat of pea to mitigate the reduction of seed germination caused by osmotic stress. RNA-seq revealed that the application of fullerenol resorted the high expression of genes related to oxidoreduction to the normal level. ATAC-seq corroborated that fullerenol application reduced the overall levels of chromatin accessibility of numerous genes, including those related to environmental signaling, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Collectively, our study suggests that fullerenol alleviates osmotic stress on various fronts, encompassing antioxidant, transcriptional, and epigenetic levels, which advances our understanding on the working mechanism of this nanomaterial within plant cells.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
