{"title":"A Single Center Experience in Combined Oncological-Surgical Treatment for Resectable Locally-Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0680/v1","date":1712664977000,"content":"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most common pulmonary malignancy, most frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage (III/IV). Patients in the Locally-Advanced Stage Subgroup (IIIA) are relatively few, yet compose of heterogenic phenotypes posing a diagnostic and treating challenge, leading to lack of clinical guidelines regarding the optimal standard of care. Several approaches exist, with a general agreement that a combined oncological and surgical modality approach is required. In this current retrospective descriptive study, operable Stage IIIA NSCLC patients who underwent surgery between 2013-2020 were evaluated on several aspects, including initial diagnosis, neoadjuvant regimens, outcomes of surgical intervention, overall survival at 2-years and 5-years following treatment. A total of 35 patients had neoadjuvant oncological treatment (mostly chemoradiation therapy) prior to surgery, out of which 28 patients were diagnosed with Stage IIIA NSCLC. In post-operative assessment of pathological staging, downstaging was reported in 20 patients, of which 7 (25%) cases were defined as complete pathological response. The 2-years overall survival rate was 65% and the 5-years overall survival rate was 60%. The main pattern of disease recurrence was distant metastasis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de5b5b0f471a250a96a684b91ee773c3c86ba85aaec60499490b0d1446b66cd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
