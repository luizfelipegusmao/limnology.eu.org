We hypothesized that in critically-ill patients with SCD receiving cefotaxime during acute chest syndrome, the continuous infusion may outperform the intermittent administration in achieving pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets.</p> Design <p>Prospective before-after study.</p> Settings <p>Intensive-care unit of a French teaching hospital and sickle cell disease referral center.</p> Patients <p>Sixty consecutive episodes of severe acute chest syndrome in 58 adult patients with sickle cell disease.</p> Interventions <p>Patients were treated with intermittent administration during the first period (April 2016 –April 2018) and with continuous infusion during the second period (May 2018 –August 2019).</p> Measurements and main results <p>We included 60 episodes of acute chest syndrome in 58 patients (29 [25–34] years, 37/58 (64%) males). Daily dose of cefotaxime was similar between groups (59 [48–88] <i>vs</i>. 61 [57–64] mg/kg/day, p = 0.84). Most patients (&gt;75%) presented a glomerular hyperfiltration with no difference between groups (p = 0.25). More patients had a cefotaxime trough level ≥2 mg/L with continuous infusion than intermittent administration: 28 (93%) <i>vs</i>. 5 (16%), p&lt;0.001. The median residual concentration was higher in the continuous infusion than intermittent administration group: 10.5 [7.4–13.3] <i>vs</i>. 0 [0–0] mg/L, p&lt;0.001. No infection relapse was observed in the entire cohort. Hospital length of stay was similar between groups.</p> Conclusion <p>As compared to intermittent administration, continuous infusion of cefotaxime maximizes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in patients with SCD. The clinical outcome did not differ between the two administration methods; however, the study was underpowered to detect such a difference.</p>","author":"Keyvan Razazi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"aac1b0653ce8139ae09aa3677c64b8b83b6644e8e129ab2c5da7bc50ac12ffe5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
