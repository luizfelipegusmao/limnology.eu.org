In this pilot study on two shallow water species of CCA collected from Raoul Island (Kermadec Islands; RangitƒÅhua) New Zealand, we investigated two preservation methods (ethanol vs. silica gel), sampled inner and outer regions of the crusts, and used DNA metabarcoding and seven genes/gene regions (16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, 23S rRNA, <i>cox</i>1, <i>rbc</i>L, and <i>tuf</i>A genes and the ITS rRNA region) to develop a protocol for taxa identification. The results revealed immense diversity, with typically more taxa identified within the inner layers than the outer layers. As highlighted in other metabarcoding studies and in earlier work on rhodoliths (nodose coralline algae), reference databases are incomplete, and to some extent, the use of multiple markers mitigates this issue. Specifically, the 23S rRNA and <i>rbc</i>L genes are currently more suitable for identifying algae, while the <i>cox</i>1 gene fares better at capturing the diversity present inclusive of algae. Further investigation of these autogenic ecosystem engineers that likely act as marine seed banks is needed.</p>","author":"Aimee L. van der Reis, \nMary A. Sewell, \nWendy A.
