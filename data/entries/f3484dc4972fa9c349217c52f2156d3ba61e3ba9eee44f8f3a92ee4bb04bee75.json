{"title":"Structure Performance of Integrity Through On-Site: Decision Making Analysis for a Jacket-Type Offshore Platform","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0002/v1","date":1719816845000,"content":"The fixed offshore platforms in Mexico produce approximately 1.90 million barrels of oil daily, valued at about 1.5 million dollars, positioning Mexico as a significant oil-producing nation globally. Ensuring the structural integrity of these platforms is highly complex due to various factors, including operational loads, meteorological conditions, extreme storms, seismic activity, and fatigue in tubular joints. Consequently, in situ studies have been conducted, focusing on operational analysis, static storm conditions, dynamic seismic strength, ductility, ultimate wave resistance, and spectral fatigue analysis. These six analyses (three linear, two nonlinear, and one spectral fatigue) provide insights into the structural behavior under different loading conditions and allow evaluation against current standards to conclude their structural integrity. The results obtained confirm that the structural integrity is adequate, as they meet current regulations and standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3484dc4972fa9c349217c52f2156d3ba61e3ba9eee44f8f3a92ee4bb04bee75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
