The lack of information on human pharmacokinetics hinders the development and application of presumptive and confirmatory tests for reliably detecting HHC consumption. To address this knowledge gap, we report the analytical results obtained from systematic forensic toxicological analysis of body-fluid samples collected from three individuals suspected of drug-impaired driving after HHC consumption. Urine and plasma samples were analyzed using non-targeted liquid chromatography–high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The results provided evidence that HHC undergoes biotransformation reactions similar to other well-characterized cannabinoids, such as ∆<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol. Notably, HHC itself was only detectable in plasma samples, not in urine samples. The observed Phase I reactions involved oxidation of C11 and the pentyl side chain, leading to corresponding hydroxylated and carboxylic acid species. Additionally, extensive glucuronidation of HHC and its Phase I metabolites was evident.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"bfcdf716e9446a36b340cbb123d63930ca4bbe107ebc15cc97632b1562c5bcbe","category":"Environment"}
