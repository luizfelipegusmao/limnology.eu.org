{"title":"The Growth and Stagnation of U.S. Life Expectancy: A Dynamic Simulation Model and Implications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1734/v1","date":1729608692000,"content":"US life expectancy now lags significantly behind the majority of high-income countries, having grown more slowly since 1980 for reasons that are not evident and have been debated. An exploratory system dynamics model is presented that reproduces the full pattern of US life expectancy from 1960 to the present. Multiple socioeconomic and behavioral factors help to explain the historical pattern, two of them apparently most responsible for the stagnation since 1980: the growth of obesity and the leveling off of growth in social spending. Some of the factors in the model are traced back to earlier causes, and obesity’s growth in particular is traced back to excess growth in private health care spending and its adverse effect on workers’ wages. The model’s base run does a good job of reproducing a variety of historical time series data going back to the 1960s, and counterfactual testing produces plausible results. The model may thus be considered a reasonable starting point for more conclusive future modeling of US life expectancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba513191865e34af9df61df32d9910dccbefa8af8e4f02ab998ce8693f83a23c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
