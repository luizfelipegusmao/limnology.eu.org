{"title":"Scale Invariant Parity Doublet Model: Interplay between the Vector Mesons and the Dilatons /Parity Doubling in Dense Baryonic Matter as an Emergent Symmetry and Pseudo-Conformal Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1812/v1","date":1711702666000,"content":"The star matter composed of nucleons deep inside the compact star like a neutron star is believed to be very dense and various new types of concepts and physical phenomena due to the nontrivial strong correlations are naturally expected. Peudo-conformality in dense star matter has been discussed recently assuming the hidden underlying scale symmetry, which is partly supported by the recent discussions of infrared conformal window of QCD. It is found that the appearance of dilaton and the dilatonic mean field calculation of nucleonic matter lead to the density independent nucleon mass at higher density regime than normal nuclear matter density. Non-vanishing constant nucleon mass can be considered as a chiral invariant mass of the parity doublet model, in which the chiral symmetry is manifested even in the massive nucleon sector provided with a parity doubling. In this paper we will discuss how the chiral and scale symmetry are correlated to lead the parity doublet symmetry inside the core of the compact star. A simple schematic model is adopted. The star matter at T=0 is basically composed of the nucleons. As a first approximation, they can be treated as free fermions with the effective mass filled up to fermi surface. There is a nontrivial feature due to the interplay between vector meson and nucleon(or equivalently dilaton, Ï‡). The trace of energy momentum tensor approaches density independent, the pseudo-conformal phase. Local fluctuations inside the star matter will be travelling with the speed of sound which depends on the equation of state. In the pseudo-conformal phase, the speed of sound approaches to the conformal velocity for the scale symmetric matter, vc=13c. The excitations of the parity doublets in the compact star matter as an emerging phenomena in pseudo-conformal phase will be discussed in connection to the chiral symmetry. The possible implication on the corespondence of hadrons to quark degrees of freedom will be briefly discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b8bd188b4b0af9192588987dd6267248d8fc2322c49580e1a633011208392d2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
