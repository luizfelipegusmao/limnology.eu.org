{"title":"The Feit-Thompson Conjecture: An Example for Mathematical Research Based on Contradictory Sources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1214/v1","date":1710982420000,"content":"The present study aims to show on the one hand how easily one can get confused when doing research on the internet. Different platforms, fora and homepages supply the visitor with different - and sometimes contradictory - information. On the other hand, we show how to overcome these contradictions and produce valuable research based on almost all sources. For our study, we use the example of the Feit-Thompson conjecture, which is - in opposite to the well-known Feit-Thompson theorem - not widely known. We try to clarify the scientific literature on this topic and we embed our own result into the present state of art. We prove that pq−1p−1 does not divide qp−1q−1 if p and q are twin primes, i.e. p=q+2. Thus we prove that the Feit-Thompson conjecture is true for twin prime numbers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b8a4d939158f1751bf50d44c249929d7433d6cd1cbd210e799b84ec92e3847c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
