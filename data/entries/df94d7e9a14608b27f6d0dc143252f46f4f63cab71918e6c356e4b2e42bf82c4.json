{"title":"Dietary and Therapeutic Benefits of Edible Insects: A Global Perspective","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-020123-013621?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>Edible insects are gaining traction worldwide for research and development. This review synthesizes a large and well-established body of research literature on the high nutritional value and variety of pharmacological properties of edible insects. Positive benefits of insect-derived products include immune enhancement; gastrointestinal protection; antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory capacities; antibacterial activities; blood lipid and glucose regulation; lowering of blood pressure; and decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of these active components of edible insects in humans have received limited research attention. In addition, we discuss health risks (safety); application prospects; regulations and policies governing their production and consumption with a view to promote innovations, intraglobal trade, and economic development; and suggestions for future directions for further pharmacological functional studies. The aim is to review the current state of knowledge and research trends on edible insects as functional ingredients beneficial to the nutrition and health of humans and animals (livestock, aquatic species, and pets).</p></div>","author":"Chrysantus Mbi Tanga and Sunday Ekesi","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Entomology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a213ec7b64ebddde52fd1163df325e740564b5ca434e1b9e961510d51a3f261","entryHash":"df94d7e9a14608b27f6d0dc143252f46f4f63cab71918e6c356e4b2e42bf82c4","category":"Environment"}
