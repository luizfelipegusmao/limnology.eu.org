It is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia and associated with neurocognitive dysfunction. One hypothesis is that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions could be altered by exosomes. Exosomes are nanovesicles found in biological fluids. Through the study of exosomes and their content in tau and amyloid beta (AÔÅ¢), the aim of this study was to show how exosomes could be used as biomarkers of OSAS and of their cognitive disorders. Methods: Two groups of 15 volunteers from the PROOF cohort were selected: severe apnea (AHI &gt;30) and control (AHI","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41bf57b6b272a875984f60078422a1e19d36dd0f7c75dec166812de143963823","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
