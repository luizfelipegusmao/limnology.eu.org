{"title":"Socioeconomic differences in digital inequality among Chinese older adults: Results from a nationally representative sample","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300433","date":1712066400000,"content":"<p>by Hongchao Hu, Wenqian Xu</p>\r\n\r\nThe current study seeks to investigate digital inequality among older adults in China, specifically examining two socially defined age groups: young-old adults (aged 60â€“74) and old-old adults (aged 75+). Descriptive statistics and multiple regression were used to examine the prevalence of and identify the factors associated with Internet access, usage (frequency and breadth containing 11 activities), skills, and social support. The study used data from the 2018 China Longitudinal Ageing Social Survey (CLASS) which consisted of 11,419 respondents aged 60 years and older. We found that 40.22% of older adults had access to the Internet, and 18.27% used it regularly. Socioeconomic factors played a crucial role in determining Internet access and usage, with young-old adults with higher education using the Internet more frequently, deliberately, and competently. Those with higher economic status had greater social support to use it, and the old-old adults with higher socioeconomic status were more likely to have Internet access. This study has implications for prioritizing targeted policies and interventions aimed at supporting socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults and ensuring equal opportunities for all to access and benefit from the digital world.","author":"Hongchao Hu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3eef9ffe2f96727f312bf2f28f08163c6fb3ee05c4f1c541769a05725bfdeb4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
