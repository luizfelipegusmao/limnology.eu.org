{"title":"Multilevel Quasi-Interpolation on Chebyshev Sparse Grids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0159/v1","date":1719905944000,"content":"This paper investigates the potential of utilising multilevel quasi-interpolation techniques on Chebyshev sparse grids for complex numerical computations. The paper starts by laying down the motivations for choosing Chebyshev sparse grids and quasi-interpolation methods with Gaussian kernels. It delves into the practical aspects of implementing these techniques. Various numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the efficiency and limitations of the multilevel quasi-sparse interpolation methods with dimensions two dimension and three dimension. The work ultimately aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the computational efficiency and accuracy achievable through this approach, comparing its performance with traditional methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b411c2bb1c1a37c314d5ba19a13064274c70505cb9cde30bd37fbba8c449bca8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
