{"title":"Partition refinement of WorldPop population spatial distribution data method: A case study of Zhuhai, China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301127","date":1712325600000,"content":"<p>by Rong Zhao, Shuang Wang, Yu Zhang, Chun Dong</p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, the core idea of the refined method of population spatial distribution is to establish a correlation between the population and auxiliary data at the administrative-unit level and, then, refine it to the grid unit. However, this method ignores the advantages of public population spatial distribution data. Given these problems, this study proposed a partition strategy using the natural break method at the grid-unit level, which adopts the population density to constrain the land class weight and redistributes the population under the dual constraints of land class and area weights. Accordingly, we used the dasymetric method to refine the population distribution data. The study established a partition model for public population spatial distribution data and auxiliary data at the grid-unit level and, then, refined it to smaller grid units. This method effectively utilizes the public population spatial distribution data and solves the problem of the dataset being not sufficiently accurate to describe small-scale regions and low resolutions. Taking the public WorldPop population spatial distribution dataset as an example, the results indicate that the proposed method has higher accuracy than other public datasets and can also describe the actual spatial distribution characteristics of the population accurately and intuitively. Simultaneously, this provides a new concept for research on population spatial distribution refinement methods.","author":"Rong Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5d3a9e15aacb15fd5b59279eff11b4148db762b6ad7f8ee07178cccecf84bafc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
