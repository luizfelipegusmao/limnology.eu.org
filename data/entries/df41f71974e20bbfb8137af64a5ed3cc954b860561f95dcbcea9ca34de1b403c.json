{"title":"Effect of Mechanical Damage on Tritium Permeability Resistance of FeAl/Al2O3 Coating on 316L Stainless Steel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0992/v1","date":1726133685000,"content":"A tritium resistant coating on the surface of materials is one of the main methods to reduce tritium permeability. In actual operating processes, mechanical damage such as spalling and scratches will occur on the surface of tritium resistant coatings. These mechanical damages will affect the hydrogen permeability resistance of the coatings. It is an important engineering problem that evaluate the effect of these damage on the tritium resistance of the coating. In this experiment, the mechanical damage of FeAl/Al2O3 tritium resistant coating on 316L stainless steel was simulated by scratching, debonding and thermal shock, and the gas hydrogen isotope permeation (GDP) test was carried out. The influence of mechanical damage degree on the tritium permeation behaviour of the coating was evaluated and discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df41f71974e20bbfb8137af64a5ed3cc954b860561f95dcbcea9ca34de1b403c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
