{"title":"Terson Syndrome with Roth Spot Resembling Features and Third Nerve Palsy without Radiologically Diagnosed Subarachnoid Haemorrhage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2043/v1","date":1717068828000,"content":"We report an unusual case of Terson's syndrome that resulted in the di-agnosis of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Interest-ingly Terson's syndrome presented with Roth spot resembling features accompanied by third nerve palsy in a patient without any disturbance of consciousness. To our knowledge, the association of Terson's syndrome with third nerve palsy has not been described before in the absence of radiologically diagnosed subarachnoid haemorrhage. We present the case of a 48-year old woman who presented in the De-partment of Emergencies of the University Hospital of Patras with right-sided complete pupil-involving third nerve palsy combined with bilateral Terson's syndrome. More precisely, fundoscopy revealed multi-ple scattered intra- and pre-retinal haemorrhages in both eyes while some retinal haemorrhages had a white-centered pattern resembling Roth spots. Neurological examination revealed no nuchal rigidity or any other neurological signs. The Glasgow coma scale was 15/15. A cerebral computed tomography angiography revealed a 5mm aneurysm of the right posterior communicating artery and the patient underwent a mi-crovascular clipping operation after craniotomy. The significant contribution of the ophthalmological consultation to the appropriate and timely diagnosis and management of a life-threatening condition is highlighted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53d899c8469054009dc909b7d98baf97f9e338dd079d965c607b9798ed70c2d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
