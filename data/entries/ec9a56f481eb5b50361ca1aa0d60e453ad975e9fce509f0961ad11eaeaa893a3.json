{"title":"Bridging the Gap: An Algorithmic Framework for Vehicular Crowdsensing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0701/v1","date":1725964669000,"content":"In this paper, we investigate whether greedy algorithms, traditionally used for pedestrian-based crowdsensing, remain effective in the context of vehicular crowdsensing (VCS). Vehicular crowdsensing leverages vehicles equipped with sensors to gather and transmit data to address several urban challenges. Despite its potential, VCS faces issues with user engagement due to inadequate incentives and privacy concerns. In this paper, we use a dynamic incentive mechanism based on a recurrent reverse auction model, incorporating vehicular mobility patterns and realistic urban scenarios using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and OpenStreetMap (OSM). By selecting a representative subset of vehicles based on their locations within a fixed budget, our mechanism aims to improve coverage and reduce data redundancy. We evaluate the applicability of successful participatory sensing approaches designed for pedestrian data and demonstrate their limitations when applied to VCS. This research provides insights into adapting greedy algorithms for the particular dynamics of vehicular crowdsensing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec9a56f481eb5b50361ca1aa0d60e453ad975e9fce509f0961ad11eaeaa893a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
