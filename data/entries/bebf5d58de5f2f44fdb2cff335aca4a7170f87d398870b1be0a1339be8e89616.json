The disease is linked to areas that are climatically suitable for its freshwater intermediate snail hosts. To predict the potential impact of climate change on the snail, we use snail life-history data obtained from lab-based temperature experiments and snail occurrence data. The models show a net increase in future suitable habitat of up to 17% by the end of the century. This expansion could increase the risk of schistosomiasis transmission, especially in Central Africa and Southern Europe.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The freshwater snail <i>Bulinus truncatus</i> is an important intermediate host for trematode parasites causing urogenital schistosomiasis, a tropical disease affecting over 150 million people. Despite its medical importance, uncertainty remains about its global distribution and the potential impacts of climate change on its future spread. Here, we investigate the distribution of <i>B. truncatus</i>, combining the outputs of correlative and mechanistic modelling methods to fully capitalize on both experimental and occurrence data of the species and to create a more reliable distribution forecast than ever constructed. We constructed ensemble correlative species distribution models using 273 occurrence points collected from different sources and a combination of climatic and (bio)physical environmental variables. Additionally, a mechanistic thermal suitability model was constructed, parameterized by recent life-history data obtained through extensive lab-based snail-temperature experiments and supplemented with an extensive literature review. Our findings reveal that the current suitable habitat for <i>B. truncatus</i> encompasses the Sahel region, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean segment of Africa, stretching from Southern Europe to Mozambique. Regions identified as suitable by both methods generally coincide with areas exhibiting high urogenital schistosomiasis prevalence. Model projections into the future suggest an overall net increase in suitable area of up to 17%. New suitable habitat is in Southern Europe, the Middle East, and large parts of Central Africa, while suitable habitat will be lost in the Sahel region. The change in snail habitat suitability may substantially increase the risk of urogenital schistosomiasis transmission in parts of Africa and Southern Europe while reducing it in the Sahel region.</p>","author":"Tiem van der Deure, \nTim Maes, \nTine Huyse, \nAnna‐Sofie Stensgaard","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"bebf5d58de5f2f44fdb2cff335aca4a7170f87d398870b1be0a1339be8e89616","category":"Environment"}
