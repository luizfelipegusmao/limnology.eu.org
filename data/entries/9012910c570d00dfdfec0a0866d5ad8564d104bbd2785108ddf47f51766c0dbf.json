{"title":"Perception and acceptability of the public towards the use of harvested rainwater in water scarce regions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wej.12944?af=R","date":1720051136000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study discusses the critical importance of sustainable access to clean water, particularly in regions facing severe water shortages. The study investigates the public perception of harvested rainwater as a solution to water scarcity in South Africa's semi arid regions. Conducted with 110 respondents, it explores demographics, rainwater harvesting practices, storage methods, and factors affecting satisfaction. Most households (39.6%) had four to six members, with a balanced gender distribution. Despite widespread unemployment (53.2%), 33.6% were graduates. Rainwater was harvested primarily during rainfall (64.9%), with 94.5% of the respondents collected from their own roofs. Storage methods included JoJo tanks (41.8%) and small buckets (54.5%). Concerningly, 95.5% did not test water quality, yet 64.5% found it acceptable. Regression analysis showed water quality significantly influenced satisfaction (<i>b</i> = 0.623, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). The high prevalence of rainwater harvesting underscores its potential to address water shortages sustainably.</p>","author":"Livhuwani Vele, \nEunice Ubomba‐Jaswa, \nJoshua Nosa Edokpayi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"9012910c570d00dfdfec0a0866d5ad8564d104bbd2785108ddf47f51766c0dbf","category":"Environment"}
