{"title":"Immunogenicity Evaluation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prefusogenic-F Based Virus-like-Particles Consisting of G and M Proteins in Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0513/v1","date":1712558225000,"content":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of severe respiratory disease in infants and young children worldwide. Two vaccines targeting the elderly and pregnant women have been recently approved employing the prefusion form of the RSV-fusion protein (F). However, there are currently no vaccines for infants. Studies have shown a fusion-inactive prefusogenic F form is significantly more immunogenic and produces higher antibody titers to both the prefusion and postfusion structures of the F protein. Here we have developed RSV virus-like particles (RSV-VLPs) consisting of prefusogenic F, RSV glycoprotein and matrix proteins, produced them using the baculovirus expression system, and studied their protective efficacy in Balb/c mice. Morphology and successful assembly of VLPs were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and western blot. Mice immunized with VLPs developed high levels of serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies as compared with mice immunized with inactivated virus. The VLP vaccine also induced higher levels of IFNÎ³ and IL4, elicited limited proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but higher cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte responses. VLP immunization abolished lung pathology in the mice after RSV challenge. Overall, our results indicate that RSV-VLPs consisting of prefusogenic F, glycoprotein and matrix proteins are a potential vaccine candidate against RSV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fda9b69c2d6e6fb678530ac8cc792cd42a99b2e1216af652726907adbc34bc93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
