Here, we estimated the abundances of P-cycling genes from 3321 global soil metagenomic samples and mapped the global distribution of five key P-cycling processes, that is, organic phosphoester hydrolysis, inorganic phosphorus solubilization, two-component system, phosphotransferase system, and transporters. Structural equation modeling and random forest analysis were employed to assess the impact of anthropogenic and environmental factors on the abundance of P-cycling genes. Our findings suggest that although less significant than the climate and soil profile, human-related factors, such as economic activities and population, are important drivers for the variations in P-cycling gene abundance. Notably, the gene abundances were increased parallel to the extent of human intervention, but generally at low and moderate levels of human activities. Furthermore, we identified critical genera, such as <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Lysobacter</i>, which were sensitive to the changes in human activities. This study provides insights into the responses of P-cycling microbes to human activities at a global scale, enhancing our understanding of soil microbial P cycling and underscoring the importance of sustainable human activities in the Earth's biogeochemical cycle.</p>","author":"Jichen Wang, \nYong‐Guan Zhu, \nYuan Ge","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"0c861a7cf9f3999270bda5cd9972e2ad87a0e645689ff6d1b80316ba0b61afae","category":"Environment"}
