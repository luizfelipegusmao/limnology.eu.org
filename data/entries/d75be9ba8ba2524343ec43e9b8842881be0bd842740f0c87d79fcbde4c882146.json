{"title":"The Clinical Antipsychotic Effect of Recently Developed Antipsychotic Drugs in Schizophrenia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1223/v1","date":1716201068000,"content":": Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are generally treated with second-generation antipsychotic drugs. These drugs are mostly D2 and 5-HT2A antagonists. They improve positive schizophrenia symptoms sufficiently well; however, they ameliorate negative schizophrenia symptoms and cognitive functions to a small extent. We review novel antipsychotic drugs exerting a partial agonism at dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors such as cariprazine, brexipiprazole and lumateperone. Besides, the mechanisms of actions of non-anti-dopaminergic antipsychotic drugs are pointed out. Updated neural networks are used to explain the mechanism of action of M4 and M1 receptor agonists, for example xanomeline combined with trospium or emraclidine, and trace-amine-associated receptor 1 agonists (TAAR1), for example ulataront. Phase 3 clinical trials of new third generation antipsychotic drugs are presented. Novel antipsychotic drugs with a partial agonism at D2 and D3 receptors improve positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms better than second generation antipsychotic drugs. Besides, they are well tolerated. M4 and M1 receptor agonists, i.e. xanomeline combined with trospium or emraclidine, and TAAR1 agonists, i.e. ulataront, have promising results in clinical trials; they well improve negative schizophrenia symptoms and cognitive functions. Phase 3 clinical trials offer promising results for anti-dopaminergic and non-anti-dopaminergic novel antipsychotic drugs. These new non-anti-dopaminergic antipsychotic drugs better emend negative schizophrenia symptoms, and they better improve cognitive functions than second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Promising new antipsychotic drugs are cariprazine, brexipiprazole, lumateperone, ulataront, and xanomeline combined with trospium. Although phase 3 clinical studies are not yet completed, they showed a therapeutic effect superior to those achieved by second-generation antipsychotic drugs. They are tolerated very well, and they better treat negative schizophrenia symptoms and improve cognitive functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d75be9ba8ba2524343ec43e9b8842881be0bd842740f0c87d79fcbde4c882146","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
