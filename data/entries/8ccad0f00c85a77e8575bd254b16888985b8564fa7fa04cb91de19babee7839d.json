{"title":"Protocol of a pilot randomized clinical trial to evaluate nutritional support and rehabilitation on prevention of skeletal muscle mass loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302003","date":1713448800000,"content":"<p>by Yuichiro Miki, Satoshi Nishi, Tatsuro Tamura, Takumi Imai, Mikio Nambara, Tatsunari Fukuoka, Mami Yoshii, Takahiro Toyokawa, Shigeru Lee, Hisako Fujii, Hisako Yoshida, Mitsuhiko Ikebuchi, Kiyoshi Maeda</p>\r\nBackground <p>Subtotal esophagectomy with lymph node dissection followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard treatment for stage II–III esophageal cancer. Esophagectomy is still associated with high morbidity rates, and reducing these rates remains challenging. Among several complications, postoperative pneumonia (PP) is sometimes fatal, which has been reportedly caused by sarcopenia. Thus, nutritional support and rehabilitation may be promising for preventing skeletal muscle mass loss and reduce the incidence of PP.</p> Methods <p>This single-center, randomized, open-label, pilot trial will randomize a total of 40 patients with esophageal cancer in a 1:1 ratio either to ISOCAL Clear + rehabilitation arm or only rehabilitation arm. Although all patients will be educated about rehabilitation by a specialized physician and will be asked to undergo the prespecified rehabilitation program, patients treated with ISOCAL Clear + rehabilitation arm will be supplemented by 400 mL of ISOCAL Clear (Nestlé Japan Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) per day during two courses of NAC with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil. Body composition will be assessed using Inbody (Inbody Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) just before starting NAC and surgery. The primary endpoint is the change of skeletal muscle index (SMI) during NAC. Secondary endpoints include (i) body weight, total skeletal muscle mass, appendicular skeletal muscle mass, and lean body mass index changes; (ii) the percentage of ISOCAL Clear continuation; (iii) appetite evaluation; (iv) the percentage of targeted calorie achievement; (v) adverse events of NAC; (vi) postoperative complication rates; and (vii) postoperative hospital stay.</p> Discussion <p>This prospective trial assesses the efficacy of nutritional support in addition to rehabilitation during NAC for patients with esophageal cancer. The results will be utilized in assessing whether the effects of nutritional support by ISOCAL Clear are promising or not and in planning future larger clinical trials.</p>","author":"Yuichiro Miki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8ccad0f00c85a77e8575bd254b16888985b8564fa7fa04cb91de19babee7839d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
