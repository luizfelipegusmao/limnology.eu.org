{"title":"Embryonic and larval development of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and its sensitivity to incubation temperature","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15813?af=R","date":1726548326000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The ontogenetic development in teleost fish is sensitive to temperature, and the developmental rate has a direct relationship with the environmental temperature within a species' thermal tolerance limit. Temperature determines time to and survival at hatching. Yellow perch is a North American species of ecological and commercial importance, and its phenology is vulnerable to climate change. The embryonic development of yellow perch was comparable to closely related members of the family Percidae. Developmental progression was fastest at 18°C and slowest at 12°C, with medial progression at 15°C. Time to hatch and swim-up, feeding onset, and exogenous feeding phases were different across all incubation temperatures regardless of a gradual post-hatch warming of the 12 and 15°C groups to a common garden temperature of 18°C. Incubation temperature may lower the rate of survival to hatch at 15°C and had complex impacts on developmental abnormalities. Temperature had significant effects on the development rate, time of hatch, survival, and incidence of developmental abnormalities. Early ontogenetic thermal history in ectotherms is an important factor determining phenotypic variation. It will be important to link the thermally induced changes in development described here to the physiological and morphological differences and to link the developmental abnormalities to functional performance.</p>","author":"Shamaila Fraz, \nLisa Laframboise, \nRichard Manzon, \nChristopher M.
