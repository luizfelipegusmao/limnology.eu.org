Daily increment deposition was verified in all otolith types and presented clearer fluorescent markings in the lapilli and sagittae than the asterisci, with high stain concentration showing the best clarity. Higher stain concentrations were found to decrease increment width, suggesting care is needed when using stained otoliths as a proxy for growth for this species.</p>","author":"Alexander L.
