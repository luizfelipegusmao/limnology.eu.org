{"title":"Going with the Flow: How Local Water Users Associations Have Shaped Water Resource Management in Chile","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0365/v1","date":1720077381000,"content":"Effective and sustainable water resource management requires flexibility and adaptation to local contexts. Our study analyzes how local water self-governing associations have emerged, using an adapted version of the Combined IAD-SES framework, also known as CIS. Through a compara-tive analysis of two distinct Chilean cases, the research highlights the critical role of historical factors alongside institutional support, political landscapes, and financial realities in shaping current water management practices. The findings suggest that when these elements are aligned and supportive of local water usersâ€™ associations, positive outcomes emerge, leading to more effi-cient, sustainable, and user-centered water resource management. Furthermore, this study reveals how the experiences and successes of these local user associations have shaped national policies, particularly regarding the development of monitoring mechanisms and the promotion of public-private cooperation in water governance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"034f4f33f88048944b2378838200322c54b1b341e445936e800614ddda775bab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
