{"title":"Icarifil in Association with Daily Use of Tadalafil (5 mg) versus Standard Tadalafil Daily Dose (5 mg) or Alone: Results from a Controlled, Randomized Clinical Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1031/v1","date":1710758400000,"content":"Background: The management of erectile dysfunction (ED) shows several grey zones and new treatments for reduce the percentage of patients who discontinued the treatment are required. Here, we aim to evaluate the role of a natural mixture of named Icarifil (L-Citrulline, L-Carnitine, Eruca vesicaria, Panax ginseng, Tribulus terrestris, Turnera diffusa, Taurine, Vitamin E, Zinc) in the management of patients with ED. Methods: From September 2022 to March 2023, all patients attending 3 urological institutions due to ED were randomized to receive: Icarifil 1 sachet every 24 h (Group 1) or Icarifil 1 sachet + tadalafil 5 mg 1 tablet every 24 h (Group 2) or tadalafil 5 mg 1 tablet daily (Group 3), for 3 months. All patients underwent urologic visit and dedicated questionnaires (IIEF-5, SEP-2, SEP-3) at the enrollment and at the follow-up evaluation (3 months). Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) at the follow-up evaluation were used. Primary endpoint was the difference in the questionnaires at the follow-up visit when compared with enrollment among the study groups. Results: In the per-protocol analysis, 52 patients in the Group 1, 55 in the Group 2 and 57 in Group 3 have been analyzed. At the follow-up evaluation, IIEF-5 have been improved in all the 3 Groups between enrollment and follow-up evaluation, but a statistically significant difference has been reported between Group 2 (+7.4) versus Group 1 (+4.1) or 3 (+5.1), (p&amp;lt;0.001; p&amp;lt;0.001). Moreover, 47 patients (94.0%) in the Group 2 showed an improvement in the SEP questionnaires, when compared with the baseline, while 29 in the Group 1 (56.9%) and 42 in the Group 3 (82.3%) with a statistically significant difference (p=0.004; p=0.003) among the Groups. The PROs analysis reported a better efficacy and patients’ satisfaction in Group 2 when compared with Group 1 or 3. Conclusions: In conclusion, Icarifil is able to improve penile erectile function in mild–moderate ED and it is able to significantly improve the clinical efficacy of tadalafil 5 mg daily use. Icarifil could be represent an interesting alternative treatment in patients experiencing adverse effects or with contraindications for chronic treatment with PDE5-is.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38dda33b91090c6d26530f1a2d9954428b0219c2570b154942f6ec613a60da8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
