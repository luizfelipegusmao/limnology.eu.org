Our objective was to assess perceptions of academic global surgery amongst surgeons in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a cross-sectional e-survey among surgical trainees and consultants in 62 LMICs, as defined by the World Bank in 2020. This paper is a sub-analysis highlighting the perception of academic surgery and the association between practice setting and responses using Pearson’s Chi-square test. Analyses were completed using Stata15. The survey received 416 responses, including 173 consultants (41.6%), 221 residents (53.1%), 8 medical graduates (1.9%), and 14 fellows (3.4%). Of these, 72 responses (17.3%) were from low-income countries, 137 (32.9%) from lower-middle-income countries, and 207 (49.8%) from upper-middle-income countries. 286 respondents (68.8%) practiced in urban areas, 34 (8.2%) in rural areas, and 84 (20.2%) in both rural and urban areas. Only 185 (44.58%) were familiar with the term “global surgery.” However, 326 (79.3%) agreed that collaborating with HIC surgeons for research is beneficial to being a global surgeon, 323 (78.8%) agreed that having an HIC co-author improves likelihood of publication in a reputable journal, 337 (81.6%) agreed that securing research funding is difficult in their country, 195 (47.3%) agreed that their institutions consider research for promotion, 252 (61.0%) agreed that they can combine research and clinical practice, and 336 (82%) are willing to train HIC medical students and residents. A majority of these LMIC surgeons noted limited academic incentives to perform research in the field. The academic global surgery community should take note and foster equitable collaborations to ensure that this critical segment of stakeholders is engaged and has fewer barriers to participation.","author":"Arinzechukwu Nwagbata","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"7ce5a72e6bfbdf1171cc94ba8521fc82218ecf83eb71ba01b66f29e326d55a49","category":"Environment"}
