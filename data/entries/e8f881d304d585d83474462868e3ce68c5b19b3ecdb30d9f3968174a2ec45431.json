{"title":"Four Different Build Angles in 3D-Printed Complete Denture Bases: A Comparative In Vitro Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2270/v1","date":1725026133000,"content":"In this study, we aimed to investigate the differences in tissue surface adaptation and the variations in distances between reference points on the polished surfaces of 3D-printed denture bases with different build angles. The build angles were 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90°, with 15 denture bases printed for each angle. Using the Geomagic Control® software, a 3D best-fit alignment was conducted between the denture base tissue surface and the reference shape of the edentulous maxilla model to calculate the root mean square error. The distances between reference points on the polished surface were measured using digital calipers. One-way analysis of variance was conducted for statistical analysis. The adaptation, as measured by the root mean square error, varied significantly among denture bases with different build angles. The distances between the anterior and posterior reference points of the polished surface were also significantly different. However, within the limitations of this study, the variations in adaptations and dimensional accuracy across different build angles were within clinically acceptable ranges. In clinical practice, the print angle can be adjusted based on factors, such as printing time, resin consumption, and the number of denture bases being printed simultaneously.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8f881d304d585d83474462868e3ce68c5b19b3ecdb30d9f3968174a2ec45431","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
