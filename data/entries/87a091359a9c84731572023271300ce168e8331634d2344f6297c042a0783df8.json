One of the most urgent problems is the contamination of water bodies in the world due to the discharge of industrial waste. Among the contaminants in wastewater are heavy metals and organic molecules such as hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) and organic dyes, coming from the effluents of the electroplating and textile industries, respectively. Among the different alternatives proposed to eliminate contaminants in water, the photocatalytic process has been one of the most striking. In this process, it is carried out through the UV or visible photogeneration of electron-hole pairs in a semiconductor material (photocatalyst), promoting the redox reactions necessary to degrade or modify these contaminants [<a href=\"#ozae044.993-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.993-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"87a091359a9c84731572023271300ce168e8331634d2344f6297c042a0783df8","category":"Environment"}
