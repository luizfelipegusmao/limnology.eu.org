{"title":"Philosophy and Practice of Flood Risk Communication and Education Informed by Critical Complexity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1718/v1","date":1714112146000,"content":"Throughout its history Western science has tended to treat complexity as a problem to be avoided or solved.  A philosophy of simplification achieved significant improvements in human life and prevails as a model for achieving societal good.  However, misplaced efforts to control complexity worsen our sustainability challenges.  Effective responses to modern day dilemmas such as floods and climate change require ways of thinking that are more congruent with the complexity of the world.  Further, governmental programs to reduce flood risk depend on the support of an informed and engaged public.  It has proven difficult to communicate risk in ways that align scientific and technical expertise based on an objective worldview, with communal and individual under-standings of risk based on subjective experiences and perspectives.  I introduce Paul Cilliers’ philosophy of critical complexity as the basis of a new conceptual framework that values and balances complexity and simplicity.  This paper shows how objective strategies that rely on analytic and probabilistic thinking can be integrated with subjective approaches that draw on the experiential and possibilistic.  An example depicts how the problematic framing of the “100-year flood” can be replaced by a model of the data that covers a range of possibilities within an experiential time frame.  Cilliers’ work opens an ethical dimension in which we make more intentional choices and acknowledge our limitations.  Complexability – understanding how to live with complexity rather than aiming to simplify it – is a vital component of sustainability communication and education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b40837ce95c592e9eb1ccf5c7ca5902adb0f80ce21cdeb1fc748be2c13bb69c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
