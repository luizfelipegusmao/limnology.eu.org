{"title":"Distinguishing Drivers via Wearable Sensor Data and Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1424/v1","date":1713866059000,"content":"This article uses machine learning analysis of wearable sensor data to explore the topic of driver differentiation. The study focuses on using detailed analyzes of data collected from wearable sensors to identify patterns that differentiate skilled drivers from inexperienced ones. On a predetermined driving route, participants experienced a variety of driving conditions, including parking, navigating cities, driving on highways and driving through residential neighborhoods. The gathered data was analyzed using machine learning techniques, yielding a classification accuracy of 94% overall. The results highlight important differences in sensor data between inexperienced and experienced drivers, providing insight into possible uses for improving safety protocols, driver education, and personalized feedback systems. The article fosters improvements in traffic safety and driver education by offering insightful information on the link between driver behavior analysis and machine learning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"523890734d1198253a4401ad3c73e0664613bf0329062bd3e7db39a24c13023a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
