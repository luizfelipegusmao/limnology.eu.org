The single element antenna design includes a simple T-shaped radiator patch with ring shaped ground plane and transformer impedance feedline. First, the antenna was simulated in free-space, and its resonant frequency is found to be 27 GHz, falling within 5G’s n261 band. The proposed single radiator antenna has a size of 23.375 mm<sup>3</sup>, and it offers a wide impedance bandwidth of 2.0 GHz (26–28 GHz). Parametric studies demonstrated that by increasing the length of slots in patch, the antenna frequency can be reduced further. Single radiator antenna is used as 8-element MIMO structure. Parallel adjacent antenna in X-direction has minimal coupling effect, whereas antenna placed in Y-direction has high coupling effect. Thus, coupling is reduced by etching a wall of slots in ground plane. It alters the surface current interference in Y-direction and limits the coupling effect. The antenna is investigated to use in body area network applications. To evaluate its on-body performance, an equivalent body model is virtually developed. The on-body performance is assessed by placing the antenna in close proximity to body model. Stable and robust performance is achieved for the on-body operation. At the resonant point, the antenna exhibits a reflection coefficient of -30 dB (free space) and -40 dB (on-body), high isolation of above 20 dB between adjacent radiators and above 30 dB for other radiators. Antenna has stable performance for different body tissues and on the non-planar structures. Bidirectional radiation pattern with gain of 2.53 dB and broadside type orientations with gain of 4.64 dB are achieved for free space and on body operations respectively. low specific absorption rate makes antenna safe for health care devices. Further, diversity performance is measured in terms of envelope correlation coefficient (ECC), and diversity gain (DG). Maximum Value of ECC is 0.005 and minimum value DG is 9.97 at 27 GHz which confirms the excellence of antenna for MIMO applications.","author":"Anupma Gupta","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8f6aae561451cc5377d84501cd6cbfb5ccb855cbc94fcb37fb30a237cc0f3362","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
