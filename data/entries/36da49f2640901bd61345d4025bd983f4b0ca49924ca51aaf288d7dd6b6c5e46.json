{"title":"Strategies for Salvage Therapy Post CAR-T Therapy Failure in Refractory/Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1578/v1","date":1729507058000,"content":"Over the past few decades, the landscape for multiple myeloma (MM) therapy has significantly advanced, largely due to the approval and introduction of new-generation proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Despite these advancements, MM remains incurable. In March 2021, the U.S. FDA approved the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM), heralding the advent of cellular therapies for R/R MM. However, due to factors such as the downregulation or loss of tumor antigen expression, T-cell exhaustion, and the influence of the tumor immune microenvironment, most R/R MM patients inevitably experience relapse following CAR-T cell therapy. Consequently, salvage therapy in the post-CAR-T setting has emerged as a critical area of research. This review discusses the potential factors leading to CAR-T therapy failure in R/R MM patients and discusses subsequent salvage therapeutic strategies, offering recommendations for addressing treatment failure in this context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36da49f2640901bd61345d4025bd983f4b0ca49924ca51aaf288d7dd6b6c5e46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
