{"title":"Verification of Nasogastric Tube Positioning Using Ultrasound by an Intensive Care Nurse","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0671/v1","date":1720513078000,"content":"Placing a nasogastric tube (NGT) is a frequent nursing technique in intensive care units. The gold standard for its correct positioning is the chest X-ray due to its high sensitivity but represents a radiation source for critically ill patients. Our study aims to analyze whether the ultrasound performed by an intensive care nurse is a valid method to verify the NGTâ€™s correct positioning and to evaluate the degree of interobserver agreement between this nurse and an intensive care physician in the NGT visualization using ultrasound. Its correct positioning was verified by direct visualization of the tube in the stomach and indirect visualization by injecting fluid and air through the tube (\"dynamic fogging\" technique). 23 critically ill patients participated in the study. A sensitivity of 35% was achieved using direct visualization, increasing up to 85% using indirect visualization. The degree of interobserver agreement was 0.88. Therefore, the NGT indirect visualization by an intensive care nurse using ultrasound could be a valid method to check its positioning. However, the low sensitivity obtained by direct visualization suggests the need for further training of intensive care nurses in ultrasonography. According to the high degree of agreement obtained, ultrasound could be performed by both professionals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56726c511653daafe5071c35c2901034b442195466a23ddf827434eac6bf29ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
