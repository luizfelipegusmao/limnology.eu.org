{"title":"Investigating the Performance and Longevity of Lithium-ion Batteries in Grid-Scale Energy Storage Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0180/v1","date":1712041008000,"content":"As the global transition towards renewable energy accelerates, the integration of grid-scale energy storage systems has become increasingly critical for stabilizing energy supply and enhancing grid reliability. Among various storage technologies, lithium-ion batteries stand out for their high energy density, scalability, and relatively low environmental impact. This study investigates the performance and longevity of lithium-ion batteries in grid-scale applications, focusing on the impact of operational parameters such as cycling frequency, depth of discharge, temperature fluctuations, and charging/discharging rates. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we combined quantitative analysis of performance metrics (cycle life, capacity fade, efficiency) with qualitative assessments from case studies of existing grid-scale projects. Our findings reveal that while lithium-ion batteries exhibit robust performance in grid-scale storage, their longevity and efficiency are significantly influenced by operational conditions. Specifically, temperature management and optimized cycling strategies were identified as key factors in mitigating degradation and extending battery life. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of lithium-ion battery behavior in grid-scale environments, offering valuable insights for the design, optimization, and management of energy storage systems. By addressing the challenges of battery performance and longevity, our study contributes to the development of more sustainable and reliable grid storage solutions, facilitating the broader adoption of renewable energy sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"994fc930787d5d921aee64d96985b95c59121db9a1bbc7f266640b3c5f0884ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
