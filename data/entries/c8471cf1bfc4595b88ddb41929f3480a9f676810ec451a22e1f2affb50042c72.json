{"title":"QCT-Based 3CL Protease Inhibitor: Tollovir","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1888/v1","date":1721817414000,"content":"Beginning in December 2019, a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness termed COVID-19. This disease may cause mild to moderate respiratory illness. However, older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease are more likely to develop serious illnesses (progressive pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death) (1). The main target for antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is the 3CL protease (3CLpro, Main protease, Mpro, Nsp5). The 3CL protease plays an integral role in viral replication and is often known as the “Achilles heel” of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (2). Thus, NLC Pharma utilized a unique and novel technology termed Quantum Core Technology (QCT) to design a mechanism-based potent inhibitor against the SARS-Cov-2 3CL protease. 3CL Pharma has designed an oral anti-viral for COVID-19 called Tollovir. Biochemical assays have revealed that 40uM of Tollovir in PBS can achieve 90% maximum inhibition of 3CL protease. Furthermore, the oral anti-viral has completed clinical trial phase 2b/3. Tollovir has proven to be safe and significantly decreases mortality rates of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8471cf1bfc4595b88ddb41929f3480a9f676810ec451a22e1f2affb50042c72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
