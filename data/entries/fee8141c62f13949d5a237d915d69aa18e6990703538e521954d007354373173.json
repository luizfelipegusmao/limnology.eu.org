Among the key crops targeted for enhanced productivity is maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.), a staple worldwide and presently the most widely cultivated cereal crop. However, urbanization, economic shifts, and increased meat consumption have significantly encroached on and fragmented arable lands. Given the constraints of diminishing arable land for maize cultivation, optimizing maize production per unit area becomes paramount for ensuring food security (<a href=\"#kiae236-B12\">Xin et al. 2023</a>; <a href=\"#kiae236-B15\">Zhang et al. 2023</a>). Planting density emerges as a critical agronomic factor in maize production, with studies indicating that increased planting density can boost maize yield by an average of 17% to 20% (<a href=\"#kiae236-B1\">Assefa et al. 2018</a>; <a href=\"#kiae236-B6\">Luo et al. 2023</a>). This approach facilitates efficient utilization of available sunlight, thereby enhancing the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into grains (<a href=\"#kiae236-B7\">Ma et al. 2020</a>). Nonetheless, dense planting can produce intra-specific competition for essential resources, such as light in aerial tissues and nutrients and water in roots, potentially reducing per-plant growth and yield (<a href=\"#kiae236-B3\">Deng et al. 2012</a>; <a href=\"#kiae236-B14\">Yan et al. 2021</a>; <a href=\"#kiae236-B4\">Duan et al. 2023</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"fee8141c62f13949d5a237d915d69aa18e6990703538e521954d007354373173","category":"Environment"}
