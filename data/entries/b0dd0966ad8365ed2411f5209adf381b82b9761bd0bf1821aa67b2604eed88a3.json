{"title":"Structural and functional properties of whey protein isolate‐inulin conjugates prepared with ultrasound or wet heating method","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13549?af=R","date":1713957598000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Whey protein isolate (WPI) generally represents poor functional properties such as thermal stability, emulsifying activity and antioxidant activity near its isoelectric point or high temperatures, which limit its application in food industry. The preparation of WPI-polysaccharide covalent conjugates based on Maillard reaction is a promising method to improve the physical and chemical stability and functional properties of WPI. In this research, WPI-inulin conjugates were prepared through wet heating method and ultrasound method and their structural and functional properties were examined.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>In conjugates, the free amino acid content was reduced, the high molecular bands were emerged at SDS-PAGE, new C-N bonds were formed in FT-IR spectroscopy, and fluorescence intensity was reduced compared with WPI. Furthermore, the result of CD spectrum also showed that the secondary structure of conjugates was changed. Conjugates with ultrasound treatment had better structural properties compared with those prepared by wet heating treatment. The functional properties such as thermal stability, emulsifying activity index (EAI), emulsion stability (ES) and antioxidant activity of conjugates with wet heating treatment were significantly improved compared with WPI. The EAI and ES of conjugates with ultrasound treatment were the highest, but the thermal stability and antioxidant activity were only close to that of the conjugates with wet heating treatment for 2 h.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This study revealed that WPI-inulin conjugates prepared with ultrasound or wet heating method not only changed the structural characteristics of WPI but also could promote its functional properties including thermal stability, EAI, ES and antioxidant activity.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
