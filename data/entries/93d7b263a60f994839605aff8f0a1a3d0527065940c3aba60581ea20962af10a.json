Mercury (Hg) is a bioaccumulative neurotoxin that poses a threat to high trophic-level species such as marine mammals. We quantified total Hg (THg) concentrations in fur, brain, and liver tissues of necropsied southern sea otters (<i>n</i> = 44) that stranded along the California coast from 2010 to 2019. THg concentrations differed significantly between fur and brain, and between liver and brain. Tissue type explained 64%, and sex explained only 3.3% of overall THg variability (0.48–46.1 μg/g dry weight). All individuals had liver Hg concentrations measuring well under the proposed lower-limit low risk guideline for harp seals, <i>Pagophilus groenlandicus</i>. However, six sea otters exceeded the liver THg moderate risk threshold for terrestrial furbearers to which sea otters are closely related. These data represent baseline THg concentrations in fur, brain, and liver of the southern sea otter and build upon previous studies in various sea otter subspecies. Research on sea otter Hg tolerance and continued monitoring are needed to clarify potential health risks associated with the tissue concentrations observed in this study.</p>","author":"Draven W.
