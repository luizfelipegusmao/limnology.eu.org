{"title":"Studies on Quality of Joints and Phenomena Therein for Welded Vehicle Components Made of Aluminium Alloy &ndash; a Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1458/v1","date":1711352853000,"content":"To fulfil a need of limitation automotive emissions the reduction of vehicle weight is widely recommended and achieved in many ways, both by the construction of individual elements of the vehicle, and by the selection of light materials including Al alloys. Connecting these elements with each other and with elements made of iron alloys can be realized, inter alia, by welding or stir welding. However, the quality of the welds obtained varies widely and depends on many design, operational and environmental factors. The present study focused on a review of various welding technics used to joint both similar and dissimilar Al alloys utilized in automotive industry, the effect of various process parameters on welds quality, and phenomena appeared in such welds..","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8277e0fc603da1f32ce26f3f67d2beda6c184ed525400b13ac1d931d7238776a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
