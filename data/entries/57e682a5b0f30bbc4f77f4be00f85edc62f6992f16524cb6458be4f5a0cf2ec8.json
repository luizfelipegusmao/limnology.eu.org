{"title":"Population genomics resolves cryptic species of the ecologically flexible genus Laspinema (Cyanobacteria)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13475?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Cyanobacterial taxonomy is entering the genomic era, but only a few taxonomic studies have employed population genomics, which provides a framework and a multitude of tools to understand species boundaries. Phylogenomic and population genomic analyses previously suggested that several cryptic lineages emerged within the genus <i>Laspinema</i>. Here, we apply population genomics to define boundaries between these lineages and propose two new cryptic species, <i>Laspinema olomoucense</i> and <i>L. palackyanum</i>. Moreover, we sampled soil and puddles across Central Europe and sequenced the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S ITS region of the isolated <i>Laspinema</i> strains. Together with database mining of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we determined that the genus <i>Laspinema</i> has a cosmopolitan distribution and inhabits a wide variety of habitats, including freshwater, saline water, mangroves, soil crusts, soils, puddles, and the human body.</p>","author":"Petr Dvořák, \nSvatopluk Skoupý, \nHana Jarošová, \nKateřina Páleníčková, \nAleksandar Stanojković","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"57e682a5b0f30bbc4f77f4be00f85edc62f6992f16524cb6458be4f5a0cf2ec8","category":"Environment"}
