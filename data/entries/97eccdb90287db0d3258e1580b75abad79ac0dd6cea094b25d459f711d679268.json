{"title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of developmental assets scales: A study protocol for psychometric properties","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309909","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Mojtaba Habibi Asgarabad, Pardis Salehi Yegaei, Elizabeth Trejos-Castillo, Nazanin Seyed Yaghoubi Pour, Nora Wiium</p>\r\nBackground and aims <p>Application of developmental assets, one of existing Positive Youth Development (PYD) frameworks, has gained momentum in research, policy formulations, and interventions, necessitating the introduction of the most efficient scales for this framework. The present study protocol aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of developmental assets scales to document the underlying logic, objectives, and methodologies earmarked for the identification, selection, and critical evaluation of these scales.</p> Methods and materials <p>In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P), the intended search will encompass databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and PsycINFO, spanning from the inception of 1988 to 1st of April 2024. The review will include articles published published in English language focusing on individuals aged 10 to 29 years and reporting at least one type of reliability or validity of developmental assets scales. The review process will be in compliance with the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN), and the overall quality of evidence will be determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) guidelines.</p> Discussion <p>This comprehensive assessment aims to identify potential biases in prior research and offer guidance to scholars regarding the optimal scales for developmental assets in terms of validity, reliability, responsiveness, and interpretability The evidence-based appraisal of the scales strengths and limitations is imperative in shaping future research, enhancing their methodological rigor, and proposing refinements to existing instruments for developmental assets.</p>","author":"Mojtaba Habibi Asgarabad","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"97eccdb90287db0d3258e1580b75abad79ac0dd6cea094b25d459f711d679268","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
