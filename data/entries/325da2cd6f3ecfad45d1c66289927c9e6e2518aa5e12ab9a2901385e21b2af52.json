{"title":"Thermal Performance Optimization of Building Envelopes in a Low-cost and Energy Saving Rural Dwelling in Severe Cold Region - Taking Central Area of Liaoning as an Example","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1335/v1","date":1721134878000,"content":"In central area of Liaoning province, the thermal performance of rural building envelopes are mostly non-standardized in Northern China, resulting in a significant heat loss. In this study, The objective was to propose some low-cost and energy-efficient solutions. Through a field of inves-tigations, heating energy consumption was saved by 20% and increased construction costs was less than 8000 RMB, which was acceptable for rural residents. In order to achieve this target, NSGA-II algorithm was integrated with Rhino+Grasshopper and EnergyPlus simulation kernel to establish a thermal performance optimization model for heat transfer of the rural building envelopes. Among the above Pareto optimal solutions, the recommended thickness of insulation layer for the room floors, ceilings, and external walls were 70mm, 50mm, and 40mm respectively. Furthermore, try to reduce the window to wall ratio as much as possible. Finally, based on the lower total cost, three technical solutions that rural residents could select according to their specific needs have been put forward.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"325da2cd6f3ecfad45d1c66289927c9e6e2518aa5e12ab9a2901385e21b2af52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
