Conversely, the empirical evidence is not available to validate the contribution of ICT and DFI in promoting trade in environmental goods. Hence, this research work is an attempt to unfold the nexuses of trade in environmental goods, DFI, and ICT globally in Asia, America, and Europe, respectively. The findings infer that DFI and ICT are the primary factors boosting trade in environmental goods globally, in Asia, America, and Europe, respectively. Furthermore, environmental pollution, economic development, and education are also uplifting the trading related to environmental goods in most regions. In the light of empirical estimates, it suggests that policymakers should give ICT infrastructure and digital connectivity priority investments to maintain the accessibility and effectiveness of environmental goods trading.</p>","author":"Zheng Yang Kuang, \nQi Liang, \nFeng Yu, \nWenxiu Hu, \nTolassa Temesgen Hordofa, \nNafeesa Mughal","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"8b13a651c05a9fe1615294a71f657a3c914ea777220a33fd6eedb2f1ba2f1a0a","category":"Environment"}
