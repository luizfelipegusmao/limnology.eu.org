{"title":"363 Effects of supplementation of vitamin B complex on the performance of beef calves during a 42-d preconditioning program","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/77/7757282?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation of vitamin B complex on post-weaning performance of beef calves. The study was conducted during fall of 2023 at Eastern Oregon Agriculture Research Center (EOARC; Burns, OR). At weaning (d 0), 63 calves [Angus × Hereford; body weight (BW) = 252 ± 3.6 kg] were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) Control, 2) VitB1, or 3) VitB2. Calves assigned to Control treatment served as a negative control and were not supplemented with vitamin B complex. Calves assigned to treatment VitB1 were supplemented at 1g/calf daily, while calves assigned to VitB2 treatment were supplemented at 2g/calf daily of vitamin B complex during the 42 d of preconditioning. Upon weaning processing, calves were allocated to 21 pens (3 calves/pen) and treatments were allocated to each pen (7 pens/treatment). Vitamin B complex [Vivalto, pantothenic acid (B<sub>5</sub>; 40,000 mg/kg), pyridoxine (B<sub>6;</sub> 20,000 mg/kg), folic acid (B<sub>9;</sub> 3,200 mg/kg), biotin (B<sub>7</sub>; 3,200,000 mcg/kg), cobalamin (B<sub>12</sub>; 320,000 mcg/kg); Selko USA, Indianapolis, IN] supplementation was offered at pen level beginning on d 1 and until the end of the preconditioning phase (d 42). Vitamin B complex was offered to calves assigned to vitamin B complex treatment mixed with 1.3 kg of dried distiller’s grains. Additionally, calves had free access to chopped alfalfa-grass hay mix and whole corn. Pen intake was recorded daily. On d 0, BW and blood samples were collected from all calves. Additional blood and BW were collected on d 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 42 post-weaning. Body weights were used to calculate calf average daily gain (ADG) and blood samples were assayed for acute phase proteins (ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin). Additional blood samples will be analyzed for cortisol and vitamin B concentrations. Variables were analyzed considering pen as the experimental unit and pen(treatment) as a random effect. Blood variables were evaluated as repeated measures and effects of treatment, day, and treatment the interactions were analyzed with the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC). Significance was set at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05. No treatment effects (<span>P</span> = 0.98) were observed for final BW (283, 283, and 284 kg respectively for Control, Vit1, and Vit2) or for ADG (<span>P</span> = 0.53; 0.735, 0.795, and 0.747 kg/d respectively for Control, Vit1, and Vit2). Similarly, no treatment effects were observed for the acute phase proteins analyzed, ceruloplasmin (<span>P</span> = 0.66; 27, 30, and 33 µg/dL respectively for Control, Vit1, and Vit2) and haptoglobin (<span>P</span> = 0.41; 0.55, 0.62, and 0.59 mg/mL, respectively for Control, Vit1, and Vit2). Supplementation of vitamin B complex to beef calves post-weaning does not seem to affect calf performance, regardless of the level of supplementation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"24736791b8495421e6386f841a355d82d56a55f7ea8c6c2c289c4338296371a7","category":"Environment"}
