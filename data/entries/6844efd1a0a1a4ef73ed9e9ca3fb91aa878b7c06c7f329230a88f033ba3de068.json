{"title":"Performance analysis of refuse‐derived fuel gasification plant with carbon capture and storage for power, heating, and hydrogen production","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14472?af=R","date":1727177642000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Among various waste-to-energy technologies, gasification is one of the most promising, because of high efficiency, feedstock flexibility, and carbon capture potential. This case study is focused on comprehensive analysis of integrated gasification combined cycle-based plant with refuse-derived fuel (RDF) as feedstock and carbon capture. As there are hardly any studies focused on simulation of waste gasification with carbon capture, most of which are lacking important process specifics, this study addresses existing research gap. Process flowsheets are developed in detail according to literature data for various process configurations and simulated in AspenPlus software, while obtained results on material and energy balance were used for estimation of plant efficiency and performance indicators. Waste generation data in Novi Sad, Serbia, were used for determination of RDF flowrate. Configurations include different syngas cleaning pathways, final products (power, heating, and hydrogen) and co-gasification with coal. Cogeneration increases overall plant efficiency from 27%–36% (power production only) to 63%–76%. High net hydrogen efficiencies, around 58%, compensate lower power and thermal energy production in hydrogen-based configurations. Overall, co-gasification produces better results due to higher feedstock heating value. Obtained results will be used in further research for environmental and economic evaluation to provide multi-level assessment of proposed processes.</p>","author":"Dario Balaban, \nJelena Lubura Stošić, \nOskar Bera, \nPredrag Kojić","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"6844efd1a0a1a4ef73ed9e9ca3fb91aa878b7c06c7f329230a88f033ba3de068","category":"Environment"}
