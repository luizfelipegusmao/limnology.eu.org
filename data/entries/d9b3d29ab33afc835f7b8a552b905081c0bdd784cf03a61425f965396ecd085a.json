{"title":"Design and Implementation of a Mobile Based Attendance Register","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0076/v1","date":1725276890000,"content":"Class attendance in institutions of higher learning plays a major role in the success of students and as such putting in measures to curb absenteeism of students would go a long way to help improve their grades. This research sought to design a ‘Bring Your Own Device’ System which will be very suitable for the post-COVID era as well as the fast-growing university community. The research results in a mobile-based attendance infrastructure used by students to prove their presence for class sessions. Flutter, a Software Development Kit (SDK) was used to program the mobile platform and Firebase was used for both the authentication and database. This system also comes in as an improvement on most existing systems as it functions on both Android and iOS. After the testing phase, the models achieved high accuracy and the proposed design has proven to have great potential. This solution stands beyond a research model as a ready-to-use platform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9b3d29ab33afc835f7b8a552b905081c0bdd784cf03a61425f965396ecd085a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
