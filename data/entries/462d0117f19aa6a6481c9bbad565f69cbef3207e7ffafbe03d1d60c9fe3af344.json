{"title":"Fully Aromatic Thermotropic Copolyesters Based on Vanillic, Hydroxybenzoic and Hydroxybiphenylcarboxylic Acids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0927/v1","date":1715676062000,"content":"Several series of new polymers were synthesized: binary copolyesters of vanillic (VA) and hydroxybiphenylcarboxylic (HBCA) acids, as well as ternary copolyesters additionally containing hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) and obtained via three different ways (in solution, in melt and in solid state). The high values of logarithmic intrinsic viscosities and insolubility of several samples proved its high molecular weights. It has been shown that the use of vanillic acid leads to the production of copolyesters with a relatively high glass transition temperature (about 130°C). Thermogravimetric analysis revealed onset of weight loss temperatures of ternary copolyesters occurred at 330-350 °C, the temperature of 5% mass loss is in the range of 390-410 °C. Two-stage thermal destruction is observed for all aromatic copolyester of vanillic acid: decomposition begins with VA units at 420-480 °C, and then decomposition of more heat-resistant units demonstrated above 520 °C. The copolyesters are thermotropic and exhibit a typical nematic type of liquid crystalline order. Mechanical characteristics of copolyesters are close to those for semi-aromatic copolyesters, but are much lower than typical values for fully aromatic thermotropic polymers. Thus, vanillic acid is a mesogenic monomer suitable for the synthesis of thermotropic fully aromatic and semi-aromatic copolyester, but resulting processing temperature must not exceed 280°C.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"462d0117f19aa6a6481c9bbad565f69cbef3207e7ffafbe03d1d60c9fe3af344","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
