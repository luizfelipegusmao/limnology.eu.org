{"title":"Safety evaluation and sublethal effect of broflanilide on Aphidius gifuensis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/629/7696902?rss=1","date":1718928000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ensuring the safety of insecticides to natural enemy insects of pests is crucial for integrating chemical and biological control strategies. Broflanilide, a novel meta-diamide insecticide, exhibits high insecticidal activity against <span>Myzus persicae</span> (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)<span>.</span> To integrate chemical and biological control against <span>M. persicae</span>, we assessed the toxicity of broflanilide to <span>Aphidius gifuensis</span>, and evaluated its safety and sublethal effects. The LC<sub>10</sub>, LC<sub>25</sub>, and LC<sub>50</sub> values of broflanilide against <span>A. gifuensis</span> were 0.733 mg/L, 1.613 mg/L, and 3.852 mg/L, respectively. The selectivity toxicity ratio of broflanilide to <span>A. gifuensis</span> was 1.516, indicating higher toxicity to <span>M. persicae</span> compared to <span>A. gifuensis</span>. The risk quotient of broflanilide to <span>A. gifuensis</span> adults was 6.18. The percent reduction in the emergence of the parasitoid pupae was −1.15, with a risk grade of 1. The sublethal concentration of broflanilide had no significant influence on the intrinsic rate of increase (<span>r</span>), finite rate of increase (<span>λ</span>), net reproductive rate (<span>R</span><sub>0</sub>), and mean fecundity (<span>F</span>) of <span>A. gifuensis</span> in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. The mean generation time (<span>T</span>) increased by 0.51 days and 0.39 days in the LC<sub>10</sub> and LC<sub>25</sub> treatments, respectively; the difference between LC<sub>10</sub> treatment and the control was significant, while the difference between LC<sub>25</sub> treatment and the control was not significant. The results showed that the sublethal concentration of broflanilide did not have a significant inhibitory effect on the population growth of <span>A. gifuensis</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"77338857e3bb2ccbe1ba18d59063625fa0b3f3c34e66b8a5e707709b339b8f1d","category":"Environment"}
