The proposed approach computes the heart rate by analyzing the color fluctuations in the facial region of interest (ROI). This report outlines the math- ematical formulation and results of the implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd02c7e1c0e3fe58bcaeba3dc6a35d06aebd070ad6514ddb42b9271c05c79794","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
