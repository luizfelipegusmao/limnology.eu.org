{"title":"Associations of Amino Acids with the Risk of Prediabetes: a Case-Control Study from Kazakhstan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2213/v1","date":1725003492000,"content":"Background: The high global prevalence of prediabetes requires its early identification. Amino acids have emerged as potential predictors of prediabetes. This study aims to investigate the association between BCAAs and prediabetes in the Kazakh population. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, plasma BCAAs levels were measured using the Trace GC 1310 gas chromatography system coupled with the TSQ 8000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Austin, TX, USA) followed by silylation with the BSTFA + 1% TMCS derivatization method. Biochemical parameters, including total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and creatinine, were assessed for each participant. Anthropometric and physical examinations, including blood pressure, heart rate measurements, and family history collection, were conducted by trained professionals. Results: The final analysis included data from 112 Kazakhs with prediabetes and 55 without prediabetes, aged 36-65 years. Of the thirteen AAs analyzed, only alanine showed a significant association with prediabetes risk. Our findings revealed an inverse relationship between alanine and aspartic acid levels, and direct association of lysine and prediabetes in Kazakh ethnicity. Conclusion: Lower plasma level of alanine and aspartic acid, and higher level of lysine may serve as predictive biomarkers for prediabetes in the Kazakh population. This research is funded by the Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan (grant AP14871855).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9bc10fad7b22eb71ae8bad5810192a3e6063b36641a71c8ab964790e666004a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
