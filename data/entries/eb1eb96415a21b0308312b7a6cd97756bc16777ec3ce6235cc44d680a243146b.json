{"title":"An equatorial mid‐Atlantic Ocean archipelago as nursery area for the cookiecutter shark: Investigating foraging strategies of neonates through bite mark inferences","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15664?af=R","date":1716279641000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study delves into the foraging ecology of the cookiecutter shark (<i>Isistius brasiliensis</i>) in the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (SPSPA), assessing bite marks on pelagic fishes collected between March and September 2018. Examination of 200 individuals from five species revealed the shark's predilection for targeting adult fish, ensuring efficient removal of energy-rich tissue layers. However, a notable exception is <i>Thunnus albacares</i>, preyed on predominantly during its juvenile stage, possibly due to vertical spatial segregation. Recent bites were pervasive across species, with wahoo displaying a distinctive pattern. Cookiecutter shark bites predominantly targeted the lateral body portion (&gt;55%) except for yellowfin tuna, which exhibited a preference for the ventral region (95%). The estimated length distribution suggests the SPSPA as a potential nursery area for cookiecutter sharks. Bite mark positions and frequencies may be linked to fish behavior, swimming velocity, and fishing gear strategy, highlighting the complex interplay in pelagic ecosystems.</p>","author":"Lucas Santos, \nJoão V.
