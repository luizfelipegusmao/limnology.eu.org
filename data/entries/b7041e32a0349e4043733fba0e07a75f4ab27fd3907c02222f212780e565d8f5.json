The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of sodium acetate (SA) on <i>Onychostoma macrolepis</i> fed a high-fat diet. <i>O. macrolepis</i> (2.1 ± 0.1 g) were reared in 12 aquariums (three aquarium/group, 15 fish/aquarium), fed a high-fat diet (control), and a high-fat diet supplemented with 0.5%, 1.0%, or 2.0% SA for 56 days. Diet supplemented with 1.0% SA significantly increased the weight gain of <i>O. macrolepis</i> fed the high-fat diet. Dietary SA reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglyceride (TG) concentrations. The addition of 1.0% and 2.0% SA significantly decreased non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and TG concentrations in liver. Dietary SA (1.0% and 2.0%) significantly improved total antioxidant capacity and total superoxide dismutase activities in the liver. In comparison to the control group, the addition of 1.0% and 2.0% SA significantly up-regulated lipolysis gene expression levels in the liver. These findings suggest that high fat diets supplemented with 1%–2.0% SA can improve growth, liver health, and antioxidant capacity in <i>O. macrolepis.</i></p>","author":"Nina Gou, \nTiezhi Jin, \nBin Yang, \nKaifeng Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"b7041e32a0349e4043733fba0e07a75f4ab27fd3907c02222f212780e565d8f5","category":"Environment"}
