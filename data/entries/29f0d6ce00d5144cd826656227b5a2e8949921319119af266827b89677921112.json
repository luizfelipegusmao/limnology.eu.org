{"title":"Describing the development and implementation of a novel collaborative multidisciplinary approach to deliver foot health supports for individuals experiencing homelessness and its outcomes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302572","date":1714485600000,"content":"<p>by Rajna Ogrin, Mary-Anne Rushford, Joseph Fallon, Rebecca Mannix, Ben Quinn, Anthony Lewis</p>\r\n\r\nBasic foot care is a real need of people experiencing homelessness. To improve access to foot health for this group, three services structured to provide healthcare support for people experiencing homelessness collaborated in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia: an established nurse-led Homeless Persons Program (HPP), a specialty community health podiatry clinic servicing people experiencing homelessness, and a charity supporting disadvantaged communities providing free socks, foot first aid kits and second-hand footwear for distribution by nurses and podiatrists of participating services. This paper outlines the implementation and evaluation of this collaboration. A four stage implementation approach was used, addressing: 1. <i>Who needs to do what differently</i>? 2. <i>What are the barriers and enablers that need to be addressed</i>? 3. <i>Which intervention components could overcome the modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers</i>? 4. <i>How can the changes be measured</i>? The evaluation prospectively collected information about how HPP nurses referred adults to podiatry, and whether the referred individuals accessed the podiatry clinic, the outcomes of the podiatry visit, and how many received footwear, socks and foot first aid kits provided by the non-profit organisation. Over 1<sup>st</sup> June 2019 and 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020, 52 individuals were identified as adults who could potentially benefit from podiatry by the HPP nurses, of which 33 accessed podiatry. Those who did not visit the podiatry clinic were more likely to be born outside of Australia, live in more precarious housing (crisis accommodation and rough sleeping), have slightly more predisposing factors for homelessness, but have fewer medical, psychological and cognitive conditions. A structured approach including processes, education, regular, outreach to youth refuges and formal outcome monitoring enabled foot health care access in people experiencing homelessness. Further research is needed to ascertain how to support participants at risk of foot problems to access podiatry before their foot health issue reaches crisis point.","author":"Rajna Ogrin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"29f0d6ce00d5144cd826656227b5a2e8949921319119af266827b89677921112","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
