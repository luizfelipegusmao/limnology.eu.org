Therefore, this research presents a new and specific water quality index for evaluating the effluent water discharged into the sea by integrating the complex set of wastewater qualities into a single reliable value. Two approaches were utilized for this purpose: experts' opinions and statistical analysis using principal component analysis. In the first approach, the opinions of local experts shortlisted the parameters into six important parameters out of a list of 19 with assigned weights varied from 0.160 to 0.174. In the statistical approach, principal component analysis and correlation analysis reduced the parameters to seven accounting for 75% of the variation in the data. Their weights were calculated based on their eigenvalues and ranged from 0.063 to 0.435. The subindices rating curves were developed based on the Kingdom of Bahrain's legislated standards and the weighted arithmetic mean function was used for the aggregation stage. The established water quality indices were applied to effluents from a local wastewater treatment plant, and the obtained results revealed “Class 1: excellent category” discharge quality maintained throughout the year as per the categories proposed in this work. The developed indices proved their effectiveness and reliability in assessing the treated water. The study provides a comprehensive and reliable assessment of treated water quality, and its approach and outputs could have significant implications globally for ensuring the quality of treated water prior its discharge and promoting sustainable development.</p>","author":"Zainab Mohammed Redha, \nQais Bu‐Ali, \nAnfal Yusuf Janahi, \nMaryam Mohamed AlQahtani, \nReem Anas Buhindi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"ee3f1f06a299f2d7a557303468d8e9d763ce28f422fe0dbb362ea577c6a6df37","category":"Environment"}
