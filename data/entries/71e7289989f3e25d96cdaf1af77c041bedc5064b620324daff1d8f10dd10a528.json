{"title":"The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Nucleoid–Associated Protein WHIRLY2 Is Required for a Proper Response to Salt Stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/576/7642713?rss=1","date":1709856000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In the last years, plant organelles have emerged as central coordinators of responses to internal and external stimuli, which can induce stress. Mitochondria play a fundamental role as stress sensors being part of a complex communication network between the organelles and the nucleus. Among the different environmental stresses, salt stress poses a significant challenge and requires efficient signaling and protective mechanisms. By using the <span>why2</span> T-DNA insertion mutant and a novel knock-out mutant prepared by CRISPR/Cas9–mediated genome editing, this study revealed that WHIRLY2 is crucial for protecting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity during salt stress. Loss-of-function mutants show an enhanced sensitivity to salt stress. The disruption of WHIRLY2 causes the impairment of mtDNA repair that results in the accumulation of aberrant recombination products, coinciding with severe alterations in nucleoid integrity and overall mitochondria morphology besides a compromised redox-dependent response and misregulation of antioxidant enzymes. The results of this study revealed that WHIRLY2-mediated structural features in mitochondria (nucleoid compactness and cristae) are important for an effective response to salt stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"71e7289989f3e25d96cdaf1af77c041bedc5064b620324daff1d8f10dd10a528","category":"Environment"}
