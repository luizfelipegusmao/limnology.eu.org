{"title":"Electronic Approach to Understanding the Wettability of Sodium-Implanted Metal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1535/v1","date":1718975483000,"content":"A change in the wettability of liquid sodium due to sodium implantation was evaluated theoretically. Interface models between sodium and a sodium-implanted substrate metal were created, and their electronic states were calculated. The discrete variational XÎ± cluster method was used in the calculations. The calculations show that the bond order, indicating the strength of the covalent bonds between atoms, decreases within the substrate metal and increases at the interface between sodium and the substrate metal due to sodium implantation. Their ratio, the bond order ratio, increased with the increasing sodium implantation.  Previous studies have shown that wettability is better as the bond order ratio increases. Therefore, from the calculations results, wettability improves with increasing sodium implantation. The wettability of sodium-implanted metals was experimentally evaluated using the contact angle of the sodium droplets. The contact angle decreased, and the wettability improved due to sodium implantation. The change rate in the contact angle increased with the bond order ratio. The experimental and calculation results correlate well, without contradiction. In conclusion, sodium implantation changes the electronic state of the interface, affecting the wettability of liquid sodium.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38480576c25bc5d7a4da799b64b2b38b73923b59d9705d24880515dc106f5e97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
