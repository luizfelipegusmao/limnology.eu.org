{"title":"A Qualitative Assessment to Inform Strategic Improvement of Research and Development within the USDA Forest Service","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/122/1/91/7224666?rss=1","date":1689379200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Past reviews of the USDA Forest Service (Forest Service) Research and Development (R&amp;D) branch have identified several persistent challenges, including unclear strategic direction and a need for greater communication with end users. We conducted research focused on the Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) of R&amp;D to understand current perceptions about the station’s efficacy and strategic direction as well as its engagement with partners both inside and outside of Forest Service. We conducted fifty-eight interviews with Forest Service and RMRS leaders, scientists, and partners. Interviewees said national research priorities are unclear, and there is tension between conducting basic and applied science. Nonscientist partners said they depend on RMRS for scientific expertise. Interviewees recommended clarifying research priorities, improving leadership and communication both inside and outside of the agency, investing more in science communication, and strengthening incentives to conduct applied research. These station-level results provide insight into improvements that could be made to enhance R&amp;D’s ability to pursue its mission.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Forestry Current Issue","siteHash":"f325018648ab04fba35e6e1191e9c9d953f9458bd233a7a41545c2e465328e3b","entryHash":"62c36c8cf2f0b646bcaa5675edc0df791dbbab3035988c2231af365b02707248","category":"Environment"}
