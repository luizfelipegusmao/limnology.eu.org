{"title":"Circulating microRNAs in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2519/v1","date":1722414299000,"content":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic and fatal condition with no effective cure, is a challenging disease within the group of interstitial lung diseases. The pathogenic mechanisms of this disease are still not fully understood. In this context, the research on miRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs that regulate messenger RNAs, is of utmost importance. These miRNAs, released into the circulation outside the cell through exosomes, play a crucial role in the pathogenic pathways and mechanisms involved in IPF development. The analysis of miRNAs in the serum/plasma of IPF patients has opened up new possibilities in the search for biomarkers. This review focuses on circulating miRNAs validated by real-time PCR in IPF and the evidence reported about the pulmonary fibrotic process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"002523e78aeadf5e69b7afe3ce9d7c1b85ec55db90d85d405b98fdff16952a97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
