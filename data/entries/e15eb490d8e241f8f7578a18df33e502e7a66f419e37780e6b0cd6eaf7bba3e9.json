Several papers still exist making use of rainbow colors palette to show output. In such cases, for colorblind people such graphs are meaningless. In this paper, we propose good practices and coding solutions developed in the R Free and Open Source Software to (i) simulate colorblindness, (ii) develop colorblind friendly color palettes and (iii) provide the tools for converting a noncolorblind friendly graph into a new image with improved colors.</p>","author":"Duccio Rocchini, \nLudovico Chieffallo, \nElisa Thouverai, \nRossella D'Introno, \nFrancesca Dagostin, \nEmma Donini, \nGiles Foody, \nSimon Garnier, \nGuilherme G.
