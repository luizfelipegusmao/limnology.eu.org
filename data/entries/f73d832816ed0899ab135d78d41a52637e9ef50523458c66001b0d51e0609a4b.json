{"title":"Epidemiology and Genetic Susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 of Young Children Living in Northwestern Amazon Region Presenting Acute Gastroenteritis and Respiratory Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2398/v1","date":1722404895000,"content":"This study evaluated the epidemiological and genetic susceptibility profile caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children ≤3 years of age with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) or acute respiratory infection (ARI), living in the northwestern region of the Amazon (NWAR). Fecal and saliva sam-ples collected from 202 children (n=404) were subjected to detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE rs4646994) and ACE2 G8780A; rs2285666) genes were detected by SYBR GREEN real-time PCR and PCR/Alul digestion, respec-tively. Secretory and Lewis status of histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) was performed using phenotyping/ELISA. Frequencies for the AGE group: SARS-CoV-2; 8.9%; ARI group: SARS-CoV-2; 2.9%. The ACE I/I homozygous polymorphism gene was majority. Males with the ACE2 G8780A SNP were more susceptible to ARI symptoms than AGE (OR = 3.85; 95% CI-1.42-10.38; P 0.007). Most children were secretory FUT2 phenotype (92.6%). Surveillance of diarrhea and respiratory infections in children, along with understanding their causes, are crucial for identifying preven-tion and control strategies and for prioritizing and developing new vaccines. Clinical manifesta-tions of COVID-19 in children ≤3 years of age include AGE.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f73d832816ed0899ab135d78d41a52637e9ef50523458c66001b0d51e0609a4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
