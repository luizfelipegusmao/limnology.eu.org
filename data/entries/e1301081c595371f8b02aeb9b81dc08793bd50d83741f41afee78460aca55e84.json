{"title":"Evaluation of Different Form Topical Anesthesia Agents in Dental Practice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2068/v1","date":1724893988000,"content":"Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the topical anesthetic effect of a 10% atomized lidocaine spray and an EMLA cream at different time intervals using parameters of visual analogue scale (VAS) score and heart rate (HR).\nMethods: The randomized split-month study included 30 patients (17 boys, 13 girls) aged 8.22 Â± 1.8 years. Application of atomized lidocaine spray or cream was randomly used in the upper second premolar region. The parameters was measured before and at each needle insertion after 10,30,60 and 120 sec. Paired t -test and independent t-test were used for statistic analyses.\nResults: Compared to the first applications (10 sec), atomized lidocaine and EMLA cream applications significantly decreased scores of VAS at the applications at 30 and 120 seconds, respectively. Despite atomized lidocaine showed early effect compared to EMLA, there were no significant differences in VAS scores between the atomized lidocaine and EMLA cream at the 60 and 120 seconds measurements. Although HR significantly increased at first anesthetic administration with the atomized lidocaine spray, HR significantly decreased at 30 and 120 seconds administrations.\nConclusion: Atomized 10% lidocaine-based topical anesthetics significantly reduced pain more rapidly and better than EMLA from needle pricks in the buccal mucosa. Therefore, atomized lidocaine topical anesthesia could be used as a substitute for EMLA cream before buccal anesthetic administration. On the other hand, further comprehensive studies are required to explore the effects of several doses of atomized lidocaine in various areas of the oral cavity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1301081c595371f8b02aeb9b81dc08793bd50d83741f41afee78460aca55e84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
