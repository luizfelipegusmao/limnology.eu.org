However, the mechanisms linking N loss and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (eCO<sub>2</sub>) are not well recognized. In this study, we comprehensively calibrated the SWAT model equipped with a dynamic CO<sub>2</sub> input and response module to investigate the response mechanisms between multiform N losses and eCO<sub>2</sub> in a representative large-scale watershed. Results revealed nitrate loss under eCO<sub>2</sub> exceeding 100% in some upstream zones under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) compared to the constant CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This was directly related to the great increase in hydrological variables, which were the carriers of N losses, and the intensive inputs of N fertilizer. Results also found that nitrate leaching was greater than the other two processes for future periods, peaking at 309.3%, as compared to the baseline period. The findings suggested reducing fertilizer inputs by 10%–20% was promising, especially for reducing nitrate loss through runoff and leaching by up to 17.7% and 12.2%. This study explored the mechanisms of increased N loss in response to eCO<sub>2</sub> and provided scientific evidence for early warning and making decisions to improve water quality at a large watershed scale.</p>","author":"Yingqi Zhang, \nYiwen Han, \nNa Wen, \nJunyu Qi, \nXiaoyu Zhang, \nGary W.
