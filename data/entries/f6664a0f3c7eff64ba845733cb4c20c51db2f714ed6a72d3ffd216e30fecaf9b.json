The first way is an equivalent statement to the Jacobian conjecture using idempotent ideals. The second way is to use an equivalent thesis to the thesis of the Jacobian conjecture. In both cases we will show that the Jacobian conjecture is true.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6664a0f3c7eff64ba845733cb4c20c51db2f714ed6a72d3ffd216e30fecaf9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
