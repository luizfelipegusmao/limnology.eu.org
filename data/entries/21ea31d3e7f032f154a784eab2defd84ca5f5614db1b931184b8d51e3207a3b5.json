{"title":"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Dispersin B: The Quintessential Antibiofilm Enzyme","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1788/v1","date":1721735764000,"content":"The extracellular matrix of most bacterial biofilms contains polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. These biopolymers have been shown to mediate fundamental biofilm-related phenotypes including surface attachment, intercellular adhesion, and biocide resistance. Enzymes that degrade polymeric biofilm matrix components, including glycoside hydrolases, proteases, and nucleases, are useful tools for studying the structure and function of biofilm matrix components and are also being investigated as potential antibiofilm agents for clinical use. Dispersin B is a well-studied, broad spectrum antibiofilm glycoside hydrolase produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Dispersin B degrades poly-N-acetylglucosamine, a biofilm matrix polysaccharide that mediates biofilm formation, stress tolerance, and biocide resistance in numerous Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Dispersin B has been shown to inhibit biofilm and pellicle formation; detach pre-formed biofilms; disaggregate bacterial flocs; sensitize pre-formed biofilms to detachment by enzymes, detergents, and metal chelators; and sensitize pre-formed biofilms to killing by antiseptics, antibiotics, bacteriophages, macrophages, and predatory bacteria. This review summarizes the results of nearly 100 in vitro and in vivo studies that have been carried out on dispersin B since it’s discovery 20 years ago. These include investigations into the biological function of the enzyme, it’s structure and mechanism of action, and its in vitro and in vivo antibiofilm activities against numerous bacterial species. Also discussed are potential clinical applications of dispersin B.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21ea31d3e7f032f154a784eab2defd84ca5f5614db1b931184b8d51e3207a3b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
