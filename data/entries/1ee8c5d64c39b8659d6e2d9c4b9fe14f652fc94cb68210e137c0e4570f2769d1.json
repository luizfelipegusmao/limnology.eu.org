{"title":"Markers of Occult Lymph Node Metastasis in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC): A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1712/v1","date":1714112058000,"content":"Background: The accurate diagnosis of regional lymph node metastasis is critical for guiding treatment decisions in head and neck cancer patients. Despite advances in imaging techniques, detecting nodal metastasis remains challenging, leading to potential undertreatment or overtreatment. This systematic review aims to identify molecular markers associated with occult metastasis in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Methods: The present research was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Prospero registration nr. CRD42024522985. Results: Through a comprehensive literature search and review process, 634 articles were considered, 103 of them were finally included. Conclusions: Several promising markers were identified, including miR-205, DSG3, pan-CK AE1/AE3, HPV-16, Activin-A, Cyclin D1, and NPL that demonstrated effectiveness across multiple studies. Future research should focus on exploring combination scoring systems to improve diagnostic precision and optimize treatment selection in HNSCC patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ee8c5d64c39b8659d6e2d9c4b9fe14f652fc94cb68210e137c0e4570f2769d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
