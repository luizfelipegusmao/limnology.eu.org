{"title":"The Legacy of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact on Infant and Maternal and Health from an Appalachian Academic Medical Center","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1046/v1","date":1718606032000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic period, from 2020 - 2022 had a significant impact on maternal infant health with mothers impacted more than their infants. We questioned whether there have been any lingering effects from the pandemic. We examined intermediate and long-term pandemic effects of maternal and neonatal outcomes before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic period. We reviewed mother-infant pairs from three epochs: 1) the pre-COVID-19 period, 2) the COVID-19 pandemic period, and 3) the post-pandemic period. The Case Mix Index (CMI) for the neonates from all 3 epochs were detailed. Post-pandemic we noted a rising trend of LGA infants (10%), and an increase in SGA infants (13%). For women in 2023 we noted an increase in hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes, and a higher BMI than the pre- pandemic period. There have also been more congenital anomalies (9%), and neonatal CMI increased in the post-pandemic period. Well after the pandemic period, maternal-infant health continues to be affected. For women, increase in hypertension and diabetes during pregnancy is concerning. For the infants, being LGA or SGA may have long-term consequences. The post-pandemic increase in infants with congenital anomalies compared to the pre-pandemic era is an area that needs ongoing review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1aaf8d4cc6bababeac00fc17af56b38ba7793e2d578b1a74aaf83d216ddfa0ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
