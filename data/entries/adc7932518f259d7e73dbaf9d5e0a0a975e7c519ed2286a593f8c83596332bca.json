{"title":"Threshold for increased liver weight is protective of other effects in Peromyscus exposed to PFNA","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/1/38/7693701?rss=1","date":1718323200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) is a commercially relevant, long-chain (8 fully fluorinated carbon) perfluorinated carboxylic acid. PFNA has limited terrestrial ecotoxicity data and is detected in humans, animals, and the environment. This study is the fourth in a series with the objective of investigating the toxicity of a suite of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) detected on military installations in a mammal indigenous to North America. <span>Peromyscus leucopus</span> (white-footed mice, ∼25/sex/dose) were exposed via oral gavage to either 0, 0.03, 0.14, 1, or 3 mg PFNA/kg-d for 112 consecutive days (4 wk premating exposure followed by an additional 12 wk of exposure after onset of mating). Parental generation animals were assessed for potential reproductive and developmental effects, organ weight changes, thyroid modulation, and immunotoxicity. Pup weight and survival were assessed at postnatal days 0, 1, 4, 7, and 10. Change in liver weight was determined to yield the most sensitive dose response according to benchmark dose analysis, and serves as the most protective point of departure (BMDL = 0.37 mg/kg-d PFNA). Other effects of PFNA exposure included reduced formation of plaque-forming cells, which are indicative of functional immune deficits (BMDL = 2.31 mg/kg-d); decreased serum thyroxine (BMDL = 0.93 mg/kg-d) without changes in some other hormones; and increased stillbirths (BMDL = 0.61 mg/kg-d PFNA). Pup weight and survival were not affected by PFNA exposure. Combined with data from previous studies, data from <span>Peromyscus</span> provide a One Health perspective on health effects of PFAS.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"adc7932518f259d7e73dbaf9d5e0a0a975e7c519ed2286a593f8c83596332bca","category":"Environment"}
