This study aims to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the VCTF's financial robustness, growth trajectory, and sustainability over a seven-year period from 2016 to 2022. Through an examination of critical financial metrics, growth indicators, and sustainability benchmarks, we scrutinize the fund's financial health, investment strategies, and capacity to bolster the Ghanaian entrepreneurial ecosystem.The analysis reveals nuanced insights into the VCTF's financial performance over the study period. Despite encountering challenges such as negative net profit margins and subdued asset turnover ratios in previous years, the fund showcases resilience and sustainability, particularly as evidenced by notable improvements in 2022. These findings carry implications for management, policymakers, and various stakeholders within the Ghanaian venture capital landscape, offering valuable insights to inform strategic decision-making and policy formulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a239fed9bf48d231102a09ee844cb780c53b54da49926d9b3ec92f884d0b0b7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
