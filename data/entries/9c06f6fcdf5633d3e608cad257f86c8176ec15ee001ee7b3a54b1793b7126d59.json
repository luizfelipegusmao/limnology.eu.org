{"title":"Fight against Eutrophication of the Lobo River in Daloa (Central‐West Ivory Coast): Methodology for Applying a Pollutant Transfer Model through a Vegetative Filter Strip","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1018/v1","date":1715840033000,"content":"The Lobo reservoir designed to supply water to the Daloa city populations (Central west of Côte d'Ivoire) is facing the phenomenon of eutrophication due to the agricultural plots located upstream the reservoir inputs. Studies have highlighted the reservoir pollution and sedimentation problem. This study was initiated to provide a simple and effective solution to the eutrophication problem. The main objective is to determine the potential optimal dimensions of a grassed strip in order to limit the eutrophication phenomenon of the Lobo reservoir. The sizing of this grassed strip was done using the VFSMOD model. The flow from the pollution source plots was simulated and integrated into the model. The different scenarios tested from the band width variation have concerned the return periods of 1 and 2 years. The results obtained revealed that for the one-year return period, the grassed strip to be installed should have a width of 12.70 m in order to reduce by 70% the flow entering the strip considering the diffuse runoff over a length of 300 m. For the two-year return period, a width of 22.95 m should be required with the same length. The scenarios showed that a grassy strip width equal to 3 m should allow a reduction of 75% of upstream sediments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c06f6fcdf5633d3e608cad257f86c8176ec15ee001ee7b3a54b1793b7126d59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
