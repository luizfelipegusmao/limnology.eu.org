{"title":"All Screen Printed and Flexible Silicon Carbide NTC Thermistors for Temperature Sensing Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1713/v1","date":1711636555000,"content":"In this study, Silicon Carbide (SiC) nano-particle based serigraphic printing inks were\nformulated to fabricate highly sensitive and wide temperature range SiC printed thermistors. Initially,\ncommercial silver ink was screen printed to fabricate inter-digitated electrodes (IDE’s) onto flexible\nKapton® substrate via screen printing. Thermistor inks with different weight ratios of SiC nano-\nparticles dispersed in polyimide resin matrix were fabricated. The SiC-polyimide temperature sensing\ninks were screen printed atop the IDE structures to form fully printed thermistors and encapsulated\nwith a adhesive backed polyimide film for humidity inhibition. The high temperature tolerance\nof the Kapton® allowed the the sensors to be tested over a wide temperature range form 25◦C to\n170◦C. The printed SiC thermistors exhibit excellent repeatability and stability over 15 hours of\ncontinuous operation. Optimal device performance was achieved with 30 wt.% SiC-polyimide ink.\nWe report highly sensitive devices with a temperature coefficient of Resistance (TCR) of -0.556 %/◦C,\na thermal coefficient of 502 K (β-index) and an activation energy of 0.08 eV which are comparable with\nprinted thermistors previous reported. Further, the thermistor demonstrates an accuracy of ±1.35◦C\nwhich is well within the range offered by commercially available high sensitivity thermistors. SiC\nthermistors exhibit a small 6.5% drift due to changes in relative humidity between 10-90 %RH and a\n4.2 % drift in baseline resistance after 100 cycles of aggressive bend testing at a 40°angle. The use of\ncommercially available low cost materials, simplicity of design and fabrication techniques coupled\nwith the chemical inertness of the Kapton® substrate and SiC nanoparticles paves the way to use\nall-printed SiC thermistors towards a wide range of applications where temperature monitoring is\nvital for optimal system performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"805bfde4eeca506116a9caafdf555e8b66cf3353745865552f3954acf68eab3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
