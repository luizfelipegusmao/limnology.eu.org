{"title":"Ultrasound‐assisted extraction of phenolics from Sargassum carpophyllum – A kinetics study","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13477?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The species of the brown macroalgal genus <i>Sargassum</i> are distributed globally and contain many bioactive compounds. In this study, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was applied to obtain phenolic compounds with strong antioxidant activity from <i>Sargassum carpophyllum</i> collected along the coastline of Weizhou Island in the South China Sea. The influence of different variables such as the solid–liquid ratio (1:5–1:30 g · mL<sup>−1</sup>), ultrasonic power (160–280 W), duty circle ratio (DCR, 1/3–1/1), and ethanol concentration (30% to ~90%) were studied using a single factor design. The extraction kinetics were investigated using the Peleg model and second-order kinetics model, and the second-order model described the extraction procedure better than the Peleg model. Total phenol content (TPC) values of 3.316, 2.964, 2.741, and 3.665 mg phloroglucinol (PHG) · g<sup>−1</sup> algae were achieved at a higher solid–liquid ratio (1:30 g · mL<sup>−1</sup>), higher ultrasonic power (280 W), a higher DCR (1/1), and a moderate ethanol concentration (50%), respectively. However, a slightly different result was observed in the extract obtained, with total phenol contents (TPC<sub>extract</sub>) of 52.99, 65.00, 46.22, and 55.10 mg PHG · g<sup>−1</sup> extract and DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC50) of 0.096, 0.066, 0.131, and 0.136 mg extract · mL<sup>−1</sup> observed at 50% ethanol, 1:5 g m· mL<sup>−1</sup>, 2/3 DCR, and 200 W respectively. All variables studied influenced the extraction kinetics by altering the extraction rate and the TPC at equilibrium. As for the bioactivities in the extract, a larger solid–liquid ratio and greater ultrasonic power may not contribute because of their ability to extract non-phenolic components simultaneously, leading to reduced overall bioactivities. The results of the present study provide essential information for future UAE process design and optimization for extracting phenolics from <i>S. carpophyllum</i> through mathematical modeling and could be regarded as important reference for obtaining value-added products from other macroalgae species.</p>","author":"Xin Liu, \nQunjian Yin, \nXuyang Chen, \nPengfei Sun, \nYing Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"704f9519f4f9e2e8df1f9d4be3cb02633814116798231d15d54b25ef4b68a6f6","category":"Environment"}
