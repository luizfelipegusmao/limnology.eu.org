Their most important applications are in aeronautics, aerospace engines, petrochemical industries as well as nuclear reactors [<a href=\"#ozae044.848-B1\">1-2</a>]. A research works have been studied the influence of rare earth elements (REE) additions and fabrication processes in superalloys, its has been observed that some of the most important results are on the solid solution hardening mechanism, lattice mismatch and modifications of eutectic phases and carbides, that provokes improvements in the mechanical and microstructural performance of the superalloys. The mixtures of REE as mischmetals have been employed to fabricate alloys with higher properties to current ones [<a href=\"#ozae044.848-B3\">3-4</a>]. In addition sintering methods like hot isostatic, pressure (HIP) have been explored to develop alloys with a high homogeneity, finer and dense microstructure to improve its mechanical behaviors [<a href=\"#ozae044.848-B2\">2</a>]. This research work is focused on studying, the influence of mixture of REE in conjunction with HIP due to these elements possess high potential to provoke important microstructural modifications as grain refinement, reduction of crystallite size and the HIP process to produce alloys with dense microstructures and higher mechanical performances.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5cc913935935dc8f3a4cee25c3b20ccd630635c750221fe654c85c483fd013b3","category":"Environment"}
