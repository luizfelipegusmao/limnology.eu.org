The use of MWCNTs-CDPs in synergy above plant has not been studied. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of MWCNTs functionalized by non-covalent method with CDPs in <span>Solanum lycopersicum</span> development. The MWCNTs-CDPs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to confirm the union of the CDPs. In addition, we demonstrated the CDPs through the seed germination of <span>S. lycopersicum</span> inhibits, while functionalizing MWCNTs-CDPs counteract this inhibition and increase the germination rate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"37ab1f8a80a97943f6b62794f8f1a40d7d3925520cd00ea9ede7e96ab39f10d4","category":"Environment"}
