{"title":"Differences between oscillometry measurements obtained by MostGraph-01 and MasterScreen-IOS in patients with asthma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309981","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Sonoko Harada, Norihiro Harada, Hitoshi Sasano, Yuki Tanabe, Masaki Kotajima, Yoshihiko Sato, Tomohito Takeshige, Yoko Katsura, Jun Ito, Ryo Atsuta, Hajime Kurosawa, Kazuhisa Takahashi</p>\r\nBackground <p>Oscillometry devices (also termed forced oscillation technique) devices such as MasterScreen-IOS<sup>®</sup> (Jaeger, Hochberg, Germany) and MostGraph-01<sup>®</sup> (Chest, Tokyo, Japan) are useful for obtaining physiological assessments in patients with obstructive lung diseases, including asthma. However, as oscillometry measurements have not been fully compared between MasterScreen-IOS<sup>®</sup> and MostGraph-01<sup>®</sup> in patients with asthma, it is unknown whether there are differences in the measurements between the devices. This study aimed to determine whether there is any difference in oscillometry measurements obtained using the two devices in patients with asthma.</p> Methods <p>Oscillometry measurements obtained using MasterScreen-IOS<sup>®</sup> and MostGraph-01<sup>®</sup> were retrospectively evaluated in 95 patients with asthma at Juntendo University Hospital between October 2009 and November 2009.</p> Results <p>There was a strong positive correlation in the measurements between the two devices. However, the values of R5, R20, ALX and Fres were lower when measured with MostGraph-01<sup>®</sup> than with MasterScreen-IOS<sup>®</sup>, and vice versa for the values of X5. The results were used in correction equations to convert oscillometry parameters measured using MasterScreen-IOS<sup>®</sup> to those measured using MostGraph-01<sup>®</sup>.</p> Conclusions <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report to compare MostGraph-01<sup>®</sup> and MasterScreen-IOS<sup>®</sup> devices using practical clinical data obtained in patients with asthma. The values obtained by both devices can be interpreted in a similar way, although there is slight variation. The conversion equations produced in this study may assist to compare the oscillometry measurements obtained by each of the two devices.</p>","author":"Sonoko Harada","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"95ee7b74bfe906b8e93b585c501875182618d5c045ea4f543c426401cc264229","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
