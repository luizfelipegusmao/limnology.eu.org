{"title":"Anomaly based multi-stage attack detection method","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300821","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Wei Ma, Yunyun Hou, Mingyu Jin, Pengpeng Jian</p>\r\n\r\nMulti-stage attacks are one of the most critical security threats in the current cyberspace. To accurately identify multi-stage attacks, this paper proposes an anomaly-based multi-stage attack detection method. It constructs a Multi-Stage Profile (MSP) by modeling the stable systemâ€™s normal state to detect attack behaviors. Initially, the method employs Doc2Vec to vectorize alert messages generated by the intrusion detection systems (IDS), extracting profound inter-message correlations. Subsequently, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are employed to model the normal system state, constructing an MSP, with relevant HMM parameters dynamically acquired via clustering algorithms. Finally, the detection of attacks is achieved by determining the anomaly threshold through the generation probability (GP). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using three public datasets and compared with three advanced multi-stage attack detection methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an accuracy of over 99% and precision of 100% in multi-stage attack detection. This confirms the effectiveness of our method in adapting to different attack scenarios and ultimately completing attack detection.","author":"Wei Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f7bdadee6a226830d6fa43ed2af624c707cffdf95017f6dfda3d75d0cae20f1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
