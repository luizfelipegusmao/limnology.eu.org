{"title":"Influence of steaming duration, chlorophyll‐a and ‐b content and ratio, and pH on the color of green tea processed from multiple tea (Camellia sinensis L.) cultivars","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13763?af=R","date":1722848111000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The color of green tea is an important quality indicator. In recent years, shading of tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i> L.) plants has been widely adopted for green tea production to enhance its green color and umami taste. In this study, we identified factors that influence green tea color by (i) examining variation in the chlorophyll content of fresh new tea shoots among cultivars, cropping seasons, and the degree of shading, (ii) investigating the rate of conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin during the tea manufacturing process, specifically with steaming duration, and (iii) analyzing the effects of the new tea shoot properties and the steaming process on colorimetric values of the steamed new tea shoots.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Multiple regression analysis revealed that three factors contributed to the rate of conversion of each chlorophyll type to pheophytin in steamed new tea shoots (ranked by importance): steaming duration &gt; each chlorophyll type (chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and chlorophyll-<i>b</i>) content of fresh new tea shoots &gt; pH. The colorimetric hue angle (<i>h</i>) value of steamed new tea shoots was influenced by four factors (ranked by importance): steaming duration &gt; total chlorophyll (chlorophyll-<i>a</i> + chlorophyll-<i>b</i>) content in fresh new tea shoots &gt; pH &gt; chlorophyll-<i>a</i>/chlorophyll-<i>b</i> ratio in fresh new tea shoots.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Differences in the color of new tea shoots can be explained by the aforementioned four factors. The findings will be useful for cultivar selection, and determining the appropriate degree of shading and steaming duration, to produce high-quality green teas with a good appearance. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hisako Hirono, \nShuya Yamashita, \nYuhei Hirono","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f4ef2df1ab91e1805e3836aecfdeb5a0405f9651a44937272b8bdb82b6910dd3","category":"Environment"}
