{"title":"Application of scoby bacterial cellulose as hydrocolloids on physicochemical, textural and sensory characteristics of mango jam","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13827?af=R","date":1725862430000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The <i>scoby</i> pellicle of symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast is a by-product from <i>kombucha</i> fermentation. While a portion is used as starter culture, the remainder is often discarded, yet it can be a valuable source of bacterial cellulose.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p><i>Scoby</i> from black, green and oolong tea <i>kombucha</i> fermentation was assessed for its hydrocolloid effects in mango jam-making through evaluation of physicochemical, textural and sensory characteristics. Quality of jam was significantly improved with water activity reduction up to 22.22% to 0.679, moisture content reduction up to 37.06% to 19.92%, and a pH drop up to 5.9% to 3.19 with the use of 20 to 100 g kg<sup>−1</sup>\n<i>scoby</i>. In colour analysis, presence of <i>scoby</i> led to a brighter jam due to higher L*$$ {L}^{\\ast } $$ values from 30.98 to a range of 31.82 to 40.83. Texture of jam with <i>scoby</i> gave higher gel strength and adhesiveness, with the most prominent effects from the black tea <i>kombucha</i>. Overall acceptability in sensory test scoring was above 70% on a nine-point hedonic scale with the 40 g kg<sup>−1</sup> green tea <i>kombucha scoby</i> jam chosen as the most preferred.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Scoby</i> gave significant contributions to jam stability, appearance and texture, showing potential as a clean-label food ingredient. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ann Qi Chong, \nNyuk Ling Chin, \nRosnita A.
