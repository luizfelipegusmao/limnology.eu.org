The physical properties of the majority of 2D crystals in this large class remain unexplored or poorly explored, especially those beyond the air-stable materials, such as graphene and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In general, many 2D crystals and van der Waals structures are sensitive to their environment, though their bulk phases may or may not be stable in air. Hence, the investigation of 2D crystals requires careful processing to avoid degradation and contamination, which often calls for the development of new synthesis, fabrication, and measurement techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.543-B1\">1-6</a>]. Bulk orthorhombic <span>Td</span>-WTe<sub>2</sub> is a semimetal, while its monolayer counterpart is a 2D topological insulator. Recently, electronic transport resembling a Luttinger liquid state was found in twisted-bilayer WTe<sub>2</sub> with a twist angle of ∼5°. Despite the strong interest in 2D WTe<sub>2</sub> systems, little experimental information is available about their intrinsic microstructure, leaving obstacles in modeling their physical properties. The monolayer, and consequently twisted-bilayer WTe<sub>2</sub>, are highly air-sensitive, and therefore, probing their atomic structures is difficult. Here, we demonstrated a robust method for atomic-resolution visualization of monolayers and twisted-bilayer WTe<sub>2</sub> obtained through mechanical exfoliation and fabrication. We observed the high crystalline quality of mechanically exfoliated WTe<sub>2</sub> samples by using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (no serious beam damage issue [<a href=\"#ozae044.543-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.543-B8\">8</a>]).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a822a513a4c31f7bf2810c2ab2533f315b5d7a3f564ad6a16d5ee0523a065014","category":"Environment"}
