{"title":"OPEN STOMATA 1 phosphorylates CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNELs to trigger Ca2+ signaling for abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2328/7619588?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Multiple cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are abscisic acid (ABA)-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) guard cells. In particular, CNGC5, CNGC6, CNGC9, and CNGC12 are essential for ABA-specific cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and stomatal movements. However, the mechanisms underlying ABA-mediated regulation of CNGCs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling are still unknown. In this study, we identified the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein kinase OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) as a CNGC activator in Arabidopsis. OST1-targeted phosphorylation sites were identified in CNGC5, CNGC6, CNGC9, and CNGC12. These CNGCs were strongly inhibited by Ser-to-Ala mutations and fully activated by Ser-to-Asp mutations at the OST1-targeted sites. The overexpression of individual inactive CNGCs (iCNGCs) under the <span>UBIQUITIN10</span> promoter in wild-type Arabidopsis conferred a strong dominant-negative-like ABA-insensitive stomatal closure phenotype. In contrast, expressing active CNGCs (aCNGCs) under their respective native promoters in the <span>cngc5-1 cngc6-2 cngc9-1 cngc12-1</span> quadruple mutant fully restored ABA-activated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in guard cells, and rescued the ABA-insensitive stomatal movement mutant phenotypes. Thus, we uncovered that ABA elicits cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via an OST1-CNGC module, in which OST1 functions as a convergence point of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and -independent pathways in Arabidopsis guard cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"0a3be75f58c76d1aa02ed8d15d6ecd2e378f769feea1478bfcf4c891c6d38a28","category":"Environment"}
