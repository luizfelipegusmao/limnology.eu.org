{"title":"Using light polarization to identify fiber orientation in carbon fiber components: metrological analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0310/v1","date":1722851416000,"content":"In this work, a method for measuring tow angles in carbon fiber components, based on the use of a polarized camera, is analyzed from a metrological point of view. Carbon fibers alter the direction of the reflected light electrical field, so that in each point of the surface of a composite piece the angle of polarization of reflected light matches the fiber orientation. A statistical analysis of the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) in each pixel of each examined area allows to evaluate the average winding angle. An evaluation of the measurement uncertainty of the method on a cylinder obtained by a filament winding process is carried out, and the result appears adequate for the study of the distribution of angles along the surface of the piece, in order to optimize the process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e50fcdcdbb834d48bcba7cd1009c7d000d2ddeec2cb9dfa8a1eef98ac4361583","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
