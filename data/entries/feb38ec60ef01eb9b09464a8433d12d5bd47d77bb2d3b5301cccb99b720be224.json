{"title":"Is the Selfish Never Selfless? Experimental Evidence from Charitable Giving Dictator Game Played by Pre-Service Teachers in Cambodia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2115/v1","date":1727398819000,"content":"This study reveals that with similar valence of empathy, the tendency for humans to help humans in need is stronger than the animal in need. It also illustrates that a convincible advertisement for a charity should be a combination of various feelings, mainly empathic anger, in addition to compassion or empathy. To gain support from young individuals or donors regardless of their personal values, the egoistic values particularly, both the NPOs in humanitarian aid as well as in environmental protection or conservation should develop ads by which each individual or donor is aroused by either an empathic anger and empathic joy or both. This claim is more applicable for any ads developed to help people in need more than animals in need. Nevertheless, this study also found the role of an animal, generally known as innocent, as an actor in an ad is likely more crucial than human. Subjects with high-egoistic values appeared to get vulnerably aroused to a higher extent by being immersed in animal’s suffering than human’s suffering. The feeling of arousal seemed to motivate subjects with high-egoistic values to not decrease the amount of donation to a charity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"feb38ec60ef01eb9b09464a8433d12d5bd47d77bb2d3b5301cccb99b720be224","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
