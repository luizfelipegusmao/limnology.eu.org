{"title":"Study on the Influences of Idler Materials on Rolling Electrical Contact Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2033/v1","date":1727271342000,"content":"The parallel connection of multiple flexible rings in raceways can significantly improve the electrical conductivity of rolling conductive devices. Multiple flexible rings are generally separated by idlers to form ring-idler rolling pairs. In the present work, alumina (Al2O3), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and polyimide (PI) were used as idler materials. Rolling tests for four types of ring-idler contact pairs were carried out in the air at a rotating speed of 10 rpm and a current of 60 A. It was noticed that the voltage drop was the lowest when Al2O3 was incorporated as the idler material. The energy spectrum analysis indicated material transfer between the organic idlers and the flexible ring. Especially on the flexible ring surface, the transferred organic thin film covered the gold-plated layer of the flexible ring and affected the electrical contact of the flexible ring. The transfer of Al2O3 was not obvious, and the mass fraction of Au on the flexible ring surface after the rolling test was 93.1%. The above results could help in selecting the best idler material for high-power conductive rotary joints.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea705e1375b887bab2382b1620cba5a14e667fd8a8b349db0a757d7cd88e2593","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
