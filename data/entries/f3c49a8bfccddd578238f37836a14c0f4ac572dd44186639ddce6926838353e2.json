{"title":"Mapping Density in Tribological Coatings After Wear Testing Using Low-Loss EELS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.584/7720159?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Tribological coatings are important engineering materials that reduce friction and provide resistance to wear in mechanical systems. These coatings can have self-lubricating properties that reduce the need for external lubricants and enhance the function of moving parts. Understanding of the nano- and atomic-scale structure of these coatings can elucidate the mechanisms of wear and durability, which enables the design of long-life dynamic mechanical components. The ability to measure the homogeneity of these coatings, and specifically, the density variation as a function of position and the distribution of defects provides information that can be used to understand how these coatings function and how they will degrade over time. A description of the evolution of density and atomic structure as the surfaces slide together could be used to develop mechanistic models that predict performance under loads over time.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f3c49a8bfccddd578238f37836a14c0f4ac572dd44186639ddce6926838353e2","category":"Environment"}
