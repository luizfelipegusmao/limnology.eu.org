{"title":"The transcription factor ThDOF8 binds to a novel cis-element and mediates molecular responses to salt stress in Tamarix hispida","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/3171/7613680?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Salt stress is a common abiotic factor that restricts plant growth and development. As a halophyte, <span>Tamarix hispida</span> is a good model plant for exploring salt-tolerance genes and regulatory mechanisms. DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) is an important transcription factor (TF) that influences and controls various signaling substances involved in diverse biological processes related to plant growth and development, but the regulatory mechanisms of DOF TFs in response to salt stress are largely unknown in <span>T. hispida</span>. In the present study, a newly identified <span>Dof</span> gene, <span>ThDOF8</span>, was cloned from <span>T. hispida</span>, and its expression was found to be induced by salt stress. Transient overexpression of <span>ThDOF8</span> enhanced <span>T. hispida</span> salt tolerance by enhancing proline levels, and increasing the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD). These results were also verified in stably transformed Arabidopsis. Results from TF-centered yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays and EMSAs showed that ThDOF8 binds to a newly identified <span>cis</span>-element (TGCG). Expression profiling by gene chip analysis identified four potential direct targets of ThDOF8, namely the cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases genes, <span>CRK10</span> and <span>CRK26,</span> and two glutamate decarboxylase genes, <span>GAD41</span>, and <span>GAD42</span>, and these were further verified by ChIP–quantitative-PCR, EMSAs, Y1H assays, and β-glucuronidase enzyme activity assays. ThDOF8 can bind to the TGCG element in the promoter regions of its target genes, and transient overexpression of <span>ThCRK10</span> also enhanced <span>T. hispida</span> salt tolerance. On the basis of our results, we propose a new regulatory mechanism model, in which ThDOF8 binds to the TGCG <span>cis</span>-element in the promoter of the target gene <span>CRK10</span> to regulate its expression and improve salt tolerance in <span>T. hispida</span>. This study provides a basis for furthering our understanding the role of DOF TFs and identifying other downstream candidate genes that have the potential for improving plant salt tolerance via molecular breeding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"cefe734d21ddb7887665b6b3cc0d6df46c7ffca73880ef1c31d883837cbc0531","category":"Environment"}
