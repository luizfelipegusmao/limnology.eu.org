However, linking the chemical structure of metabolites to gene function in order to explore the genetic and biochemical basis of metabolism has not yet been reported in wheat (<span>Triticum aestivum</span>). Here, we profiled metabolic fragment enrichment in wheat leaves and consequently applied chemical-tag-based semi-annotated metabolomics in a genome-wide association study in accessions of wheat. The studies revealed that all 1,483 quantified metabolites have at least one known functional group whose modification is tailored in an enzyme-catalyzed manner and eventually allows efficient candidate gene mining. A Triticeae crop-specific flavonoid pathway and its underlying metabolic gene cluster were elucidated in further functional studies. Additionally, upon overexpressing the major effect gene of the cluster TraesCS2B01G460000 (<span>TaOMT24</span>), the pathway was reconstructed in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>), which lacks this pathway. The reported workflow represents an efficient and unbiased approach for gene mining using forward genetics in hexaploid wheat. The resultant candidate gene list contains vast molecular resources for decoding the genetic architecture of complex traits and identifying valuable breeding targets and will ultimately aid in achieving wheat crop improvement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"63ff17449a88dcaaee1658fa56ef88e2e8f4a8250c90eacb01d83961c9ebec2a","category":"Environment"}
