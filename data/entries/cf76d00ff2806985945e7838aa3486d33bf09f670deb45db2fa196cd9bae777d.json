{"title":"The association between serum HDL levels and infertility among American women aged 20–44 years: A retrospective cross-sectional study of NHANES, 2013–2020","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311618","date":1728309600000,"content":"<p>by Hui Wang, Dongmei Wang, Hui Chen, Liping Yang, Chunying Xie, Zhenzhen Ruan, Zhe Han</p>\r\nBackground <p>Infertility is a significant national public health concern, and the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that it will rank as the third most prevalent disease following tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The impact of dysfunctional lipoproteins on female infertility remains relatively understudied; therefore, the research focuses on exploring the relationship between serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration and infertility.</p> Methods <p>This is a retrospective cross-sectional study where we employed multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine the association between serum HDL concentrations and female infertility. The strength of association was quantified using odds ratios (OR) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals and statistical significance was evaluated at a level of P &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed).</p> Results <p>The study found that there was a significant correlation between serum HDL and infertility without adjusting the model (OR = 0.62, 95%CI 0.48–0.82, P&lt;0.001). After adjusting for covariates, a weak correlation between HDL and infertility remained (OR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.49–1.00). When HDL concentrations were divided into quartiles, there was a trend of strengthened correlation between HDL and infertility risk with the increase in HDL concentrations. Specifically, individuals in the highest concentration quartile exhibited a 44.0% lower risk of infertility compared to those in the lowest concentration quartile (95% CI 0.38–0.84). In the age-stratified analysis, after adjusting for covariates, the correlation between HDL and infertility was statistically insignificant across all age groups. Furthermore, after categorizing HDL levels into quartiles, we observed a dose-dependent trend between HDL and the reduction of female infertility risk in the adjusted models of the secondary infertility group. Specifically, in the adjusted model, the high-concentration group exhibited a 67.0% lower risk of infertility compared to the low-concentration group (OR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.12–0.940, P = 0.04).</p> Conclusion <p>Our research findings suggest weak negative correlation between serum HDL and female infertility. However, upon stratified analysis by age, the correlation between HDL and infertility did not attain statistical significance. In cases of secondary infertility, a subtle dose-dependent trend was observed between serum HDL and infertility.</p>","author":"Hui Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cf76d00ff2806985945e7838aa3486d33bf09f670deb45db2fa196cd9bae777d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
