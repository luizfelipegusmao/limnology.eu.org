{"title":"New kid on the photosynthetic block: Ycf51 is a photosystem I assembly factor in cyanobacteria","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1586/7577727?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span>During photosynthesis, pigments in light-harvesting complexes capture and transfer light energy to the reaction centers of the two chlorophyll-protein complexes of the electron transport chain: photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). Photosystems are constantly newly synthesized to accommodate growth or post-oxidative damage, and their assembly and integration to the thylakoid membrane are complicated processes, facilitated by numerous proteins. Although the assembly process of PSII has been extensively studied and many of its facilitators identified (<a href=\"#koae014-B5\">Nickelsen and Rengstl 2013</a>), experimental data describing the PSI assembly are lacking (<a href=\"#koae014-B7\">Wittenberg et al. 2017</a>). Hypothetical chloroplast open reading frames (<span>ycf</span>) are a group of conserved genes in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants that were discovered decades ago and encode proteins that were not associated with a known function (<a href=\"#koae014-B2\">Hallick et al. 1993</a>). Since their discovery, some Ycf proteins have been shown to have roles in the assembly of both photosystems, with Ycf3, Ycf4, and Ycf37 involved in PSI assembly (<a href=\"#koae014-B6\">Rochaix 2011</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"6f71c949fec14398d49895707b1a87d6b7039b0a4362ebb46c9753128cdc285b","category":"Environment"}
