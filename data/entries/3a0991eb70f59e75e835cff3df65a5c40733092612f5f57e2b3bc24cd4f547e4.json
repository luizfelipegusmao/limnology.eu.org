{"title":"A Study on the Factors for the Occurrence of Vacant Homes in Medium Cities and Characteristics of Each Types &ndash; Focusing on Asan City, Chungcheongnam-Do","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0899/v1","date":1710485290000,"content":"This study aims to spatially analyze the distribution characteristics of vacant homes in Asan-si, Chungcheongnam-do, and understand the differences in factors causing vacant homes by type. We use a variety of statistical methods to examine these factors and identify key influencing factors such as the number of vacant stores, changes in overall population, land use complexity, and physical characteristics of land and buildings. The findings reveal that the factors contributing to the occurrence of vacant homes vary significantly by region and property type, highlighting the need for region-specific policies. For instance, in old town areas, small lot ratios and land use complexity are significant, while in rural village, the average number of floors and land use complexity play a major role. This study underscores the diversity of factors influencing vacant homes, suggesting that policies should be tailored to the unique characteristics of different regions to effectively address this issue.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a0991eb70f59e75e835cff3df65a5c40733092612f5f57e2b3bc24cd4f547e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
