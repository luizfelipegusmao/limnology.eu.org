{"title":"LCK Function and Modulation: Immune Cytotoxic Response and Tumor Treatment. More than a Simple Event.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0418/v1","date":1720092660000,"content":"LCK, a member of the Scr kinase family, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in immune cell activation, antigen recognition, tumor growth, and cytotoxic response. The enzyme has usually been linked to T lymphocyte activation upon antigen recognition. Lck activation is central to CD4, CD8, and NK activation. However, recently, it has become clearer that activating the enzyme in CD8 cells can be independent of antigen presentation and enhance cytotoxic response. The role of Lck in NK cytotoxic function has been controversial in a similar fashion as the role of the enzyme in CAR T cells. Inhibition of Lck has been mainly to treat hematologic malignancies with a high rate of success. They may be useful in treating other tumor types, and they may be useful to prevent cell exhaustion. New, more selective inhibitors have been documented, and they have shown inter-esting activities not only in tumor growth but in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma, and graft vs host disease. Drug repurposing and bioinformatics can aid in solving several unsolved is-sues on the role of Lck in cancer. In summary, the role of Lck in immune response and tumor growth is not a simple event and requires more research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74fae92c60a7f1f97f46d699a7455f52735d3a60cf1d461d978a92c714a99370","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
