{"title":"PSXI-2 Impact of flexible prepartum supplementation strategies on cow-calf and subsequent progeny feedlot performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/724/7757679?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Implementation of minimal supplemental protein strategies during late gestation may have the potential to minimize any negative postweaning progeny performance while decreasing feed costs. A 3-yr study was conducted to evaluate the effects of mid- to late-gestation supplementation strategies on reproduction, cow body weight (BW), and calf performance in May-calving mature cows grazing upland native range. Cows received one of 3 supplementation strategies: 1) 0.227 kg/d of a 30% CP distillers-based supplement (HalfSupp), 2) 0.454 kg/d of a 30% CP distillers-based supplement (Supp), or 3) brief and intermittent supplementation of Supp at 0.454 kg/cow based on periods of acute environmental stress, such as snow cover, wet winter events, and is best described as flexible supplementation (Flex). Supplementation was initiated in December each year and terminated approximately 30-d prior to the start of the calving season in April. Across all 3 yr, average supplement feeding rate was 25.5, 50.9, and 5.4 kg/cow during the 112-d supplemental period, which resulted in average yearly prepartum supplemental costs of $27.30, 54.60, and 1.99 for HalfSupp, Supp, and Flex; respectively. After weaning, steers grazed sub-irrigated meadow with a dried distiller grain supplement until May. In May, all steers grazed sub-irrigated meadow without additional supplement until August/September when steers were shipped to West Central Research and Extension Center (WCREC). Steers were placed in a GrowSafe feeding system for the rest of the finishing feeding period. Each year, steers were slaughtered at a commercial facility (Tyson Fresh Meats, Lexington, NE) when estimated visually to have 1.3 cm fat thickness over the 12<sup>th</sup> rib as a group. Cow BW was not different (<span>P</span> = 0.86) at the initiation of supplementation in Jan. However, cows fed Half had a lighter (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) BW at pre-calving and tended (<span>P</span> = 0.08) to have a lighter BW at pre-breeding than their counterparts. After a 45-d breeding season, pregnancy rates were not influenced (<span>P</span> = 0.91) by prepartum supplementation strategies. Prepartum supplementation strategies did not influence (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.56) preweaning calf BW at birth, pre-breeding, and weaning. In addition, steer backgrounding BW was also not influenced (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.63) by prepartum supplementation strategy of their dam. Upon entry into the feedlot, steer BW was not impacted (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.84) by prepartum supplementation strategy of their dam. Feedlot performance (BW, average daily gain, and feed efficiency) was not influenced (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.59) by prepartum supplementation strategy of their dam. After harvest, all carcass characteristics were not impacted (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.11) by the prepartum supplementation strategy of the dam. Considering the cost for prepartum supplementation, feeding a protein supplement just during environmentally stressful periods during gestation appears to be a viable alternative to more conventional methods and reduces winter feed costs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"86c9f36559084a5db26e93025490100ea8bd971d34367c0e1fa706c6b723c586","category":"Environment"}
