{"title":"Comparative Analysis of 5G Technology in the Agriculture Sector of Bangladesh (Challenges and Potential Impact)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1474/v1","date":1721285733000,"content":"This study provides a thorough examination of the introduction of 5G technology in Bangladesh's agriculture sector, providing insights into the problems and potential implications related to its adoption. Focusing on the contextual landscape of Bangladesh, the study evaluates the effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, and ease of implementation of 5G technology concerning key challenges faced by the agricultural sector. Drawing comparisons with global perspectives, including countries such as China, Taiwan, Colombia, Netherlands, and India, the analysis provides a nuanced understanding of the diverse technological landscapes. The examination encompasses the evolution from 4G to 5G, emphasizing the commitment of major telecommunications providers in Bangladesh to advance technological capabilities. The challenges in rural adoption, limited technology literacy among farmers, and high smartphone costs are discussed, highlighting potential barriers to seamless integration. To address the creation of a more comprehensive technological infrastructure, the study also explores the efforts and regulatory support provided by the government and the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). Furthermore, the comparative analysis sheds light on the unique characteristics and advancements in other countries, contributing to a holistic understanding of 5G's role in transforming global agricultural practices. By exploring the anticipated socio-economic factors influencing the pace and success of 5G adoption in the agricultural sector, this paper emphasizes the need for collaborative efforts, infrastructure development, and addressing accessibility challenges to achieve widespread agricultural technology integration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56afeeba1c26d90564463e5f99c4d39837943b26faf45748d56b7dd5cd183e5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
