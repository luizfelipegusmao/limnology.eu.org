In many quantum materials the phases and properties of interest only emerge at low temperatures, making cryogenic characterization essential. Reduced mechanical stability under cryogenic conditions presents significant challenges for atomic-resolution STEM imaging and analysis, but advancements in technique have made routine sub-Ã… resolution imaging at liquid nitrogen temperatures possible, providing access to a wide range of exotic phases absent at ambient temperature [<a href=\"#ozae044.746-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.746-B2\">2</a>]. Beyond stabilizing low-temperature ground states, cryogenic temperature control is a powerful thermodynamic tuning knob for driving phase transitions. With conventional cryogenic sample holders, however, atomic-resolution STEM is limited to a single base temperature set by the cryogen, as actively heating above this point causes rapid boiling and accordant instability. Developments in MEMS-based cryogenic holders now allow local heating of the sample without significantly disturbing the thermal equilibrium of the cryogenic system, enabling atomic-resolution imaging at variable cryogenic temperatures, ranging to even above room temperature [<a href=\"#ozae044.746-B3\">3</a>]. In addition, advances in high speed, high-dynamic-range electron counting detectors now provide sufficient performance for cryogenic 4D-STEM multislice ptychography datasets to be collected and reconstructed. Here, we apply this full range of cryo-STEM capabilities to structurally characterize phase transitions in strongly correlated oxide materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6af08b5c3acfcc1fdfabfd17d3192197ae949b174c72cc2af680ad697a2cf176","category":"Environment"}
