{"title":"IoT-Cloud, VPN and Digital Twin Based Remote Monitoring and Control of a Multifunctional Robotic Cell in the Context of AI, Industry and Education 4.0 and 5.0","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1345/v1","date":1729154524000,"content":"The monitoring and control of an assembly/disassembly/replacement (A/D/R) multifunctional robotic cell (MRC) with the ABB 120 Industrial Robotic Manipulator (IRM) based on IoT (Internet of Things)-Cloud, VPN (Virtual Private Network), and Digital Twin (DT) technology, are presented in this paper. The approach integrates modern principles of smart manufacturing as outlined in Industry/Education 4.0 (automation, data exchange, smart systems, machine learning, predictive maintenance) and Industry/Education 5.0 (human-robot collaboration, customization, robustness and sustainability). Artificial intelligence (AI) based on Machine Learning (ML) enhances system flexibility, productivity, and user-centered collaboration. Several IoT edge devices are engaged, connected in a local network (LAN), for remote and local processing and data acquisition. The system is connected to the Internet, via Wireless Area Network (WAN) and allows remote control via Cloud and VPN. IoT dashboards, as human machine interfaces (HMIs), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and OPC-UA (Open Platform Communication-Unified Architecture) facilitate remote monitoring and control of MRC, planning and management of A/D/R task. The assignment, planning and execution of A/D/R tasks were carried out using an augmented reality (AR) tool. Synchronized timed Petri nets (STPN) were used as digital twin like a virtual reality (VR) representation of A/D FRC operations. This integration of an advanced technology into a laboratory mechatronic system, where the devices are organized in a decentralized, multilevel architecture, creates a smart, flexible, and scalable environment that caters to both industrial applications and educational frameworks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55142dce9fe58042b9b05172caddbdbd0b2687d5763bd7f0513ad059e69438d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
