{"title":"Analysing and evaluating environmental flows through hydrological methods in the regulated Indus River Basin","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2624?af=R","date":1706184537000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Environmental flows (EFs), essential for upholding the ecological integrity of rivers and aquatic habitats, have been disrupted significantly by diverting water for agricultural, industrial and domestic uses. This underscores the imperative of implementing sustainable water resource management to harmonize agricultural and environmental needs. The study was conducted in the Indus River Basin (IRB), a region extensively transformed by human interventions. EFs were determined through various techniques, including the flow duration curve shifting method, flow duration curve analysis, low-flow indices, the Tennant method, the Smakhtin approach, the Tessmann method and the Pastor method. Analysing the estimated EFs alongside downstream flows unveiled specific timeframes (days, months and seasons) of unmet EF requirements. To safeguard the downstream ecosystems, the following EFs were estimated for the respective locations: 880 m<sup>3</sup>/s (38% of the mean annual flow [MAF]) for the Indus River at Tarbela Dam, 412 m<sup>3</sup>/s (48% of the MAF) for the Jhelum at Mangla Dam, 425 m<sup>3</sup>/s (44% of the MAF) for the Chenab at Marala headworks, 389 m<sup>3</sup>/s (56% of MAF) for the Ravi at Balloki headworks, 184 m<sup>3</sup>/s (50% of MAF) for the Sutlej at Sulemanki headworks and 231 m<sup>3</sup>/s (38% of MAF) below Kotri Barrage. The study revealed that violations of EFs occurred 41%, 43%, 44% and 52% of the time during the study period for the Chenab at Marala headworks, the Ravi at Balloki headworks, the Sutlej at Sulemanki headworks and the Indus River at the Kotri Barrage, respectively. The results highlighted that the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers are particularly susceptible to vulnerability, as the estimated EFs were not consistently upheld in these rivers. These findings underscore the urgent need to take appropriate measures to ensure EFs are not violated, thus safeguarding the downstream ecosystems.</p>","author":"Kashif Mehmood, \nBernhard Tischbein, \nRashid Mahmood, \nChristian Borgemeister, \nMartina Flörke, \nFazlullah Akhtar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"b765f180b383c0ff1a0674bff42b5596402a4dfc4ab2b7b4caf5cc76bd9860bd","category":"Environment"}
