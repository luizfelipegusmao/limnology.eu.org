{"title":"Molecular Basis of Neuronal and Microglial States in the Aging Brain and Impact on Cerebral Blood Vessels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1232/v1","date":1710951714000,"content":"Brain aging causes a wide variety of changes at molecular and cellular levels, leading to the decline of cognitive functions and increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative disorders. The research aimed at understanding the aging of the brain has made much progress in recent decades. Technological innovations such as single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), proteomic analyses, and spatial transcriptomic analyses have facilitated the research on the dynamic changes occurring within neurons, glia, and other cells along with their impacts on intercellular communication during aging. In this review, we introduce recent trends of how neurons and glia change during aging and discuss the impact of the brain microenvironment such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b415d618b3e8c1acfaf393524a93191dce783960a4f149ed2c203d9ba75c359","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
