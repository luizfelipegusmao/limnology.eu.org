{"title":"ASSPM: A Deep Address Parsing Model Integrating Address Spatial Semantics for Traffic Accident Handling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1885/v1","date":1719462315000,"content":"To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of address parsing in traffic accident handling, this study designs a deep address parsing model based on BERT, named ASSPM. This model effectively addresses the limitations of existing deep learning models in Chinese address parsing tasks by integrating address spatial semantics. First, a lexicon-enhancement method based on hybrid representation is employed, transforming the spatial semantics extracted by the Address Spatial Semantics Extractor (ASSE) into a symbolic semantic space that can be integrated with the feature vector space of the deep model. This achieves effective fusion of spatial semantics and the deep model at the model level. Second, a lexicon adapter enhanced with spatial semantics is utilized to integrate spatial semantics into the Transformer layers of the BERT model, achieving semantic fusion at the BERT level. Finally, comparative experiments on a custom address dataset and a public Chinese address dataset validate the proposed methodâ€™s superior performance over other baseline methods. This research provides robust support for the application of deep address parsing models integrating address spatial semantics in traffic accident handling, promising to improve the efficiency and accuracy of traffic accident management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3e56c2ef44611c3b7eda031987aa4ae0047d65f2fdaae535a7766f3c2590489","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
