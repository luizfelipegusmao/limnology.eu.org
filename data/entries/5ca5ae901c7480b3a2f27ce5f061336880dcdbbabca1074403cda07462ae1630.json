{"title":"Reduced Acute Ischemic Stroke-Induced Neural Inflammation Using Neural Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (AB126)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0216/v1","date":1712060974000,"content":"The therapeutic, attenuative, and morphological effects of proprietary neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC EVs, AB126) produced by Aruna Bio, Inc. were assessed in a range of in vitro and in vivo models of stroke. We emphasize that modulation of neuroinflammation is a key target and suggest further studies to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of action and ultimately how best to dose and monitor the benefits of AB126 in stroke patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ca5ae901c7480b3a2f27ce5f061336880dcdbbabca1074403cda07462ae1630","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
