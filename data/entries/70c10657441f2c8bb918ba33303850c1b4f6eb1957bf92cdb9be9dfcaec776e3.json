{"title":"145 The effect of a plant secondary metabolite blend on energy metabolism and nutrient balance of beef cattle consuming low-quality warm season grass hay","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/71/7617944?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant secondary metabolites (PSM) such as condensed tannins, hydrolysable tannins, saponins and essential oils purportedly impact rumen fermentation at low inclusion rates in beef cattle diets. Twelve steers (347 ± 23 kg BW) of British and continental influence were allocated to 1 of 4 replicated 3 x 3 Latin squares. Latin squares each had 14 d periods (10 d adaptation and 4 d for sample collection). All cattle were fed ground warm-season hay (89.5% DM, 92.8% OM, 65.9% NDF, 43.6% ADF, 6.70% CP) at 1.5% of BW (DM-basis) and supplemented with soybean meal at 0.18% of BW (DM-basis) once daily. Treatments consisted of a blend of tannins, saponins and essential oils provided at 0% (Control), 0.1% (Low) and 0.3% (High) of hay offering. Treatments were mixed with daily soybean meal allotment and provided before feeding of hay. Urine and feces were completely collected from d 11 through 14 at 0730 h and daily amounts of urine and feces produced were measured gravimetrically. Measures of gaseous exchange were determined via indirect calorimetry on d 13 and 14. Open-circuit respiration calorimeters (91.4 × 91.4 × 191.2 cm) were used to collect respired gas and ruminal methane production. Total oxygen consumption and production of carbon dioxide and methane were calculated from the difference in concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane from air exhausted from each calorimeter and concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane in ambient air and multiplied by amounts of air flowing from each calorimeter standardized for temperature, pressure, and humidity. Data were analyzed for a Latin square using the MIXED procedure of SAS with fixed effect of treatment, period and square and random effect of steer. Linear and quadratic contrast coefficients were assigned using PROC IML for uneven spacing of treatments. Significance was declared when P ≤ 0.05. Per experimental design, forage N and OM intake did not differ (P ≥ 0.77). Apparent total tract digestion of OM, NDF and ADF did not differ (P ≥ 0.66) among treatments. Fecal nitrogen excretion, and the percentage of N excreted in feces increased linearly (P = 0.01). N balance tended (P = 0.08) to decrease linearly with increasing PSM supplemented. Methane (L/kg DMI) was not affected (P = 0.28) by treatments. Methane, GE, DE, and ME (mcal/kg DMI) was unaffected (P = 0.19) by treatment. Under the conditions of this experiment, a blend of PSM had little effect on rumen fermentation or energy metabolism in beef steers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"70c10657441f2c8bb918ba33303850c1b4f6eb1957bf92cdb9be9dfcaec776e3","category":"Environment"}
