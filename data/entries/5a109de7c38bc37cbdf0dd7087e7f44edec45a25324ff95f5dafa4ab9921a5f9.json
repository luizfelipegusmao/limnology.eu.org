{"title":"The Molecular Frequency, Conservation and Role of Reactive Cysteines in Plant Lipid Metabolism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/826/7479646?rss=1","date":1702944000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cysteines (Cys) are chemically reactive amino acids containing sulfur that play diverse roles in plant biology. Recent proteomics investigations in <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> have revealed the presence of thiol post-translational modifications (PTMs) in several Cys residues. These PTMs are presumed to impact protein structure and function, yet mechanistic data regarding the specific Cys susceptible to modification and their biochemical relevance remain limited. To help address these limitations, we have conducted a wide-ranging analysis by integrating published datasets encompassing PTM proteomics (comparing S-sulfenylation, persulfidation, S-nitrosylation and S-acylation), genomics and protein structures, with a specific focus on proteins involved in plant lipid metabolism. The prevalence and distribution of modified Cys residues across all analyzed proteins is diverse and multifaceted. Nevertheless, by combining an evaluation of sequence conservation across 100+ plant genomes with AlphaFold-generated protein structures and physicochemical predictions, we have unveiled structural propensities associated with Cys modifications. Furthermore, we have identified discernible patterns in lipid biochemical pathways enriched with Cys PTMs, notably involving beta-oxidation, jasmonic acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis and wax biosynthesis. These collective findings provide valuable insights for future investigations targeting the mechanistic foundations of Cys modifications and the regulation of modified proteins in lipid metabolism and other metabolic pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"5a109de7c38bc37cbdf0dd7087e7f44edec45a25324ff95f5dafa4ab9921a5f9","category":"Environment"}
