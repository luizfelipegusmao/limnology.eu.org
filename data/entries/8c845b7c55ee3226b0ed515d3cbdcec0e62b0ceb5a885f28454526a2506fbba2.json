{"title":"Optimization of Collagen Scaffold with Cultured Autologous Chondrocytes for Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Knee: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0980/v1","date":1718347164000,"content":"Treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee, has always been a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. We present a case report of a 38-year-old male with severe right knee pain after suffering from an indirect trauma and axial rotation of the knee, limiting knee functionality and impeding ability to walk, with diagnosis of osteochondritis dissecans in the trochlea of the knee, who underwent arthroscopic treatment with matrix induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI). After the surgery, physical therapy protocol for MACI was implemented, magnetic imagen resonance images with cartilage mapping were used to evaluate recovery of the lesion. A total recovery was observed evaluated with the modified Cincinnati knee rating system (mCKRS). A discussion is provided with evidence and general recommendations for the use of MACI in the treatment of adult OCD of the knee.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c845b7c55ee3226b0ed515d3cbdcec0e62b0ceb5a885f28454526a2506fbba2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
