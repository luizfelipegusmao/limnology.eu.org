{"title":"Morphological Patterns and Drivers of Urban Growth on Africa&rsquo;s Wetland Landscapes: Insights from the Densu Delta Ramsar Site, Ghana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0742/v1","date":1718123521000,"content":"The morphological aspects of urban growth on wetlands in Africa are under-researched. Using the Densu Delta Ramsar site in Accra, Ghana, as a case study, this paper analyses the morphological patterns and drivers of urban growth and its impact on wetlands. Data were obtained through remote-sensing, ground truthing and limited key informant interviews. The analysis combined land use/land cover, building coverage and multiple regression techniques, with the aid of GIS and STATA software. The findings reveal that urban growth at the Ramsar site follows discernible spatial patterns consistent with the spreading pancake, village magnet and ribbon development models. However, the primary force behind these patterns is growing demand for land to meet housing needs, aided by the failure of state institutions to perform their land use control and wetland protection functions. To achieve sustainable urban development, there is an urgent need to ensure effective wetland management by enforcing existing land use, development control and wetland protection measures. This calls for the strengthening, resourcing and closer collaboration between the various state agencies responsible for urban planning and wetland management. There is also the need to engage and sensitise political leaders to increase their commitment to implementing wetland protection and pro-environmental policies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a99dd16e5995d48c9f106440a1490ab8ee0f0ab88202fe9e70b50fab54b7f4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
