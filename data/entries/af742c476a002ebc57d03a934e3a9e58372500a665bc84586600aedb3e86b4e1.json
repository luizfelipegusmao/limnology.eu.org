{"title":"Effectiveness of non-pharmacological therapies for chronic pain in people with autoimmune diseases in Africa: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306564","date":1719928800000,"content":"<p>by Gebreamlak Gebremedhn Gebremeskel, Teklehaimanot Gereziher Haile, Gebremeskel Tukue Gebrewahd, Abrha Hailay, Woldu Aberhe, Guesh Mebrahtom, Kidane Zereabruk, Assefa Iyasu Negash, Hailemikael Gebrekidan, Degena Bahrey Tadesse</p>\r\nBackground <p>Autoimmune diseases affect 5â€“10% of the global population and cause chronic pain and impaired functionality. Chronic pain management involves pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, with non-pharmacological options gaining attention as safe, effective, and cost-effective alternatives. However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these therapies in African patients with autoimmune diseases, as existing evidence varies.</p> Methods <p>This review protocol has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42023449896). Electronic databases (PubMed, Africa Index Medicus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) will be used for searching published articles. The study will use R for data synthesis, employing a random-effects meta-analysis approach to calculate pooled effect sizes, assess heterogeneity using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, and evaluate publication bias. In conclusion, this protocol aims to fill the knowledge gap on non-pharmacological therapies for chronic pain in patients with autoimmune diseases in Africa. It will potentially enhance evidence-based decision-making to improve pain management and, hence, the quality of life of people with autoimmune diseases in Africa.</p>","author":"Gebreamlak Gebremedhn Gebremeskel","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"af742c476a002ebc57d03a934e3a9e58372500a665bc84586600aedb3e86b4e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
