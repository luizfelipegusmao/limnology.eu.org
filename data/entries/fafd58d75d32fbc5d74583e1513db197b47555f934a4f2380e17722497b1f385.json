{"title":"The research of knowledge diffusion network model for Tourism Destination-Public ecological civilization","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310112","date":1729000800000,"content":"<p>by Jiehua Xu, Peng Peng, Dongping Wei, Zhijun Deng</p>\r\n\r\nVisitor education plays a crucial role in the knowledge diffusion process in outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism. It entails sharing information, experiences, and insights with visitors to enhance their understanding and appreciation of the natural environment. Our methodology for investigating the diffusion of ecological civilization knowledge in tourism destinations involves constructing a knowledge diffusion network model. In this model, scenic spots, tourists, and the public are defined as network nodes, with the communication channels between them representing the edges of the network. By constructing a scale-free complex network, the knowledge diffusion mode of scenic spots can be depicted. The layer of resource supply node consists of different scenic spots, forming the core nodes set for knowledge diffusion in the tourism industry. This research aims to further explore the social and economic value of the tourism areasâ€™ ecological civilization knowledge diffusion, as well as analyze the path, quantity, and cost of knowledge diffusion. by analyzing this knowledge diffusion network model, insights into the effectiveness and impact of visitor education in promoting ecological civilization and sustainable practices in tourism destinations can be gained. Overall, this approach provides a theoretical framework for investigating and comprehending the knowledge diffusion process in Tourism Destination-Public ecological civilization, thereby shedding light on the social and economic benefits that can be derived from sustainable tourism practices.","author":"Jiehua Xu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fafd58d75d32fbc5d74583e1513db197b47555f934a4f2380e17722497b1f385","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
