{"title":"Enhanced Cortical Plasticity in Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease: Exploring ccPAS Potential.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0407/v1","date":1718015317000,"content":"Age-related brain deterioration and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose major challenges as misfolded proteins are deposited in the brain, leading to a decline in cognitive abilities and disruption of neural networks crucial for memory. This article addresses the impact of disrupted spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease and highlights the role of Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the study of cortico-cortical spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Amidst this adversity, the role of STDP emerges as a key player in memory formation by synchronizing neural activity. Progressive neuronal dysfunction decreases neural plasticity and impairs manual dexterity and speed, echoing more general problems in elderly people. The findings highlight the potential of neurally-driven cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to revitalize neural plasticity and improve motor performance in elderly people, bridging the gap between age-related challenges and Alzheimer's research. This work opens a door to potential rehabilitation strategies for aging populations by unlocking the aging brain's ability to improve motor performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8840dcff619971a8336ad5bb3511fccf02b913427391d8254a078489c27e9d40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
