{"title":"Coffee Oil Extraction Methods: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1855/v1","date":1721830963000,"content":"Green and Roasted coffee oils are products rich in bioactive compounds, such as linoleic acid and diterpenes cafestol and kahweol, being a potential ingredient for food and cosmetic industries. An overview of oil extraction techniques most applied for coffee and their influence on the oil composition is presented. Both green and roasted coffee oil extractions are highlighted. Pressing, Soxhlet, microwave, and supercritical fluid extraction were the most used techniques used for coffee oil extraction. Conventional Soxhlet is most used on lab-scale, while pressing is by industry. Supercritical fluid extraction has also been evaluated due to the goal of increasing the coffee oil diterpenes content. One of the highlighted activities in Brazilian agribusiness is the industrialization of oils due to their increasing use in the formulation of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. Green coffee oil (raw bean) has desirable bioactive compounds, increasing the interest of private companies and research institutions in its extraction process to preserve the properties contained in the oils.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8aa02102dca069d5b44382e92ea66a4cd13c8711049808ae4420b14c46752ca7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
