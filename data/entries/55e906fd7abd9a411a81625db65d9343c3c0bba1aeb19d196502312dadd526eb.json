{"title":"Diversity in Microscopy: A User Facility Perspective","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.1077/7720364?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a US Department of Energy, Office of Science User Facility. As a user facility that is open to all domestic and international research institutions, we have undertaken a major effort over the last few years to not only increase the diversity of the centerâ€™s staff, building on efforts promoted on a larger scale by ORNL, but to also implement outreach programs seeking to enhance the diversity of the broader scientific user community. CNMS has cutting-edge capabilities in electron and scanning probe microscopies/spectroscopy; maintaining and expanding our recognized leadership in these fields requires staff and user diversity across a broad spectrum of metrics, including gender, geography, educational background, race, ethnicity, etc. that collectively contribute to diversity of thought and enable a strong future vision for the center.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"55e906fd7abd9a411a81625db65d9343c3c0bba1aeb19d196502312dadd526eb","category":"Environment"}
