{"title":"Pd EnCat™ 30 Recycling in Suzuki Cross-Coupling Reactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2608/v1","date":1722583850000,"content":"Pd EnCat™ 30 is a palladium catalyst broadly used in several hydrogenation and cross-coupling reactions. It is known for its numerous beneficial features, which include high-yielding performance, easy recovery, and reusability. However, the available data regarding its recyclability in Suzuki coupling reactions are limited to a few reaction cycles and, therefore, fail to explore its full potential. Our work focuses on investigating the extent of Pd EnCat™ 30 reusability in Suzuki cross-coupling reactions by measuring its performance according to isolated yields of product. Our findings demonstrate that Pd EnCat™ 30 can be reused over a minimum of 30 reaction cycles, which is advantageous in terms of cost reduction and more sustainable chemical production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da73efbdb41e04c366bfcc22324dde7c3dfef30e2957d92b12f345657ab5558f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
