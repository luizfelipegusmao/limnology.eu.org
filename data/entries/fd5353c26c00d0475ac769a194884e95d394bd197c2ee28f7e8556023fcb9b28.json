{"title":"Urban geochemistry: addressing scope, strategic importance, and challenges","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12517-024-12086-0","date":1727827200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This short communication explores the urban geology sub-field, which emerges as a crucial discipline to address the dynamic interaction between human activities, geological processes, and environmental sustainability. It aims to guide land use planning, assess and mitigate the impacts of urbanization on natural resources, evaluate geological hazards, address geoenvironmental problems, and enhance public awareness. The correspondence also touched upon urban geochemistry, a relatively nascent interdisciplinary sub-field, elucidating its role in studying trace element characteristics, human activitiesâ€™ impacts on the environmental quality, and the influence on biogeochemical cycles. Despite its significance, urban geology faces underappreciation and challenges, particularly in African megacities. Inadequate funding, data collection difficulties, and a lack of awareness hinder its promotion. Therefore, we advocate for increasing the collaboration between academic institutions, research centers, and governmental authorities to overcome these barriers and promote multidisciplinary research projects for a holistic understanding of the complexities of the urban environments.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"fd5353c26c00d0475ac769a194884e95d394bd197c2ee28f7e8556023fcb9b28","category":"Environment"}
