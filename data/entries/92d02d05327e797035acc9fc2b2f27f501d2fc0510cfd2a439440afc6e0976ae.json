{"title":"Uncovering DNA Methylation Landscapes to Decipher Evolutionary Footprints of Phenotypic Diversity in Chickpea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1873/v1","date":1724711754000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of DNA methylation on phenotypic diversity in chickpeas (Cicer arietinum). By analyzing DNA methylation landscapes across various chickpea cultivars, we aim to decipher the evolutionary processes underlying phenotypic variation. Using bisulfite sequencing and advanced genomic techniques, we identified significant methylation patterns associated with key adaptive traits. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of epigenetic modifications in plant evolution and offer potential applications in crop improvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92d02d05327e797035acc9fc2b2f27f501d2fc0510cfd2a439440afc6e0976ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
