{"title":"282 Effects of granddam poor maternal nutrition during gestation on second generation offspring oxidative status in circulation and skeletal muscle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/200/7757465?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Poor maternal nutrition (under- or over-feeding) during gestation negatively impacts antioxidant activity and oxidative stress markers in first generation (F1) offspring. To determine if these alterations persist into subsequent generations, multiparous Dorset ewes (F0; n = 46) pregnant with twins were fed 100% (CON), 60% (RES), or 140% (OVER) of total nutrient requirements (NRC) from d 30 of gestation until parturition. At 16 to 19 mo of age, F1 ewes (n = 37) were maintained on a control diet and bred to generate second generation offspring (F2; CON-F2, RES-F2, OVER-F2 corresponding to F0 diet). At 112 and 224 d of age, plasma samples were collected from F2 offspring, and at d 284 semitendinosus (STN) samples were collected from rams at necropsy and muscle biopsies in ewes. Data were analyzed in SAS using PROC MIXED where significance was determined at <span>P</span> ≤ 0.05. Circulating superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was decreased by 21% and 25% in RES-F2 and OVER-F2 offspring, respectively, compared with CON-F2 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Plasma SOD activity was 17% less at d 224 than d 112 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Ewes had 9% greater circulating SOD activity compared with rams (<span>P</span> = 0.03). Muscle SOD activity was 31% and 35% greater in CON-F2 compared with RES-F2 and OVER-F2 offspring, respectively (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.003). Rams had 26% greater STN SOD activity than ewes (<span>P</span> = 0.006). Plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was 14% greater in CON-F2 than RES-F2 and OVER-F2 offspring (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.003). Circulating GPx activity was 14% less at d 224 than d 112 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Muscle GPx activity was 39% and 35% greater in CON-F2 offspring compared with RES-F2 and OVER-F2, respectively (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Ewes had 11% and 16% greater GPx activity in circulation and STN, respectively, than rams (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.005). Plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) were 18% and 10% greater in RES-F2 and OVER-F2 offspring, respectively, than CON-F2 (<span>P</span> = 0.004). Circulating MDA concentrations were 20% greater at d 224 compared with d 112 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Concentrations of MDA in STN were increased in RES-F2 and OVER-F2 offspring by 36% and 50%, respectively, compared with CON-F2 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.006). Ewes had 87% greater concentrations of MDA in STN compared with rams (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Circulating protein carbonyl (PC) concentrations were 16% greater in RES-F2 offspring than CON-F2 and OVER-F2 (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04). Plasma PC concentrations were 9% greater at d 224 compared with d 112 (<span>P</span> = 0.04). The concentrations of PC in STN were 81% and 69% greater in RES-F2 and OVER-F2 rams, respectively, compared with CON-F2 rams (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.0001). Alterations in oxidative status persist into the F2 generation and may impact muscle growth and metabolism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3dc01565ef563d7c4ec06fe3f765c984605fc0eb799f3e05ab61a72a7ead3eed","category":"Environment"}
