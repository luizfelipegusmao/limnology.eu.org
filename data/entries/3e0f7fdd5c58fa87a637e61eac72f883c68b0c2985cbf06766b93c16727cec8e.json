{"title":"Mapping Pressure Surge Source in Urban Water Networks: Integrating Low‐ and High‐Frequency Pressure Data With an Illustrative Real Case Study","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036773?af=R","date":1722927887000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This paper introduces a novel methodology that integrates low- and high-frequency pressure monitoring in the parts of the urban water distribution network characterized by the largest number of repairing operations. This integrated approach aims to pinpoint the source and characterize potentially dangerous pressure variations. The actual behavior of a real operational water distribution network is considered as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The analysis of the acquired pressure signals allows for mapping frequent pressure surges and identifying their source in the functioning conditions of a big user. Notwithstanding these pressure variations are not overly large, according to the literature, their near-continuous nature poses a risk of inducing pipe breaks, and then leakage, due to fatigue. The proposed method integrating routine low-frequency measurements with targeted high-frequency surveys provides a cost-effective, proactive management strategy.</p>","author":"S. Meniconi, \nA.
