{"title":"Synergy of higher education resources and digital infrastructure construction in China: Regional differences, dynamic evolution and trend forecasting","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304613","date":1717423200000,"content":"<p>by Ying Xie, Minglong Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nThe deep integration of higher education with digital technology represents an inevitable trend, and evaluating the interplay between higher education resources (HER) and digital infrastructure construction (DIC) holds significant value for advancing the development of digital higher education and mitigating regional disparities in China. This study establishes two comprehensive evaluation frameworks for HER and DIC. Panel data from 31 provinces, spanning the period from 2011 to 2020, are utilized for analysis. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) model is employed in this work to evaluate the synergy between HER and DIC in China. Furthermore, we analyze the regional differences, spatial distribution, and trend evolution of this synergy. The study results revealed that there is an initial decrease followed by an increase in the synergy between HER and DIC, and the overall CCD is at a moderate coordination, with the mean CCD of the eastern region being significantly higher than that of the other three regions, and the inter-regional difference is the main source of regional disparity in this synergy. The current state of synergistic development reveals a slight inclination towards multi-polarization, although the disparity in regional development was decreasing. Additionally, there is an observed convergence in the coordinated development of HER and DIC, with spatial factors playing a significant role. These findings offer empirical support for efforts to enhance the integration of HER and DIC, reduce regional disparities in higher education, and foster sustainable development in Chinaâ€™s higher education sector.","author":"Ying Xie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c50a0b5cf0663aaeb6d0e0d43eacc6159f62f69b25bba2155d2721783b8908eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
