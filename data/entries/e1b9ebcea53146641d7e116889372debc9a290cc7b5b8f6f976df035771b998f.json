As semiconductor devices become more highly integrated, solder bonding bumps on electronic boards are becoming smaller in diameter and narrower in pitch, and new bonding technologies are required. Conventional solder bonding technology is difficult to miniaturize due to the generation of Kirkendall voids and bridging, as well as the electrical resistance and heat dissipation. Cu-Cu direct bonding is a promising next-generation bonding technology, but Cu pillars alone cannot suppress height variations and defects such as unbonded bumps and voids. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new process to buffer the height variation during bonding by forming a compressible porous layer on the Cu pillars. This study evaluated the microstructure of porous layers to reveal the relationship between the microstructural control and property improvement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e1b9ebcea53146641d7e116889372debc9a290cc7b5b8f6f976df035771b998f","category":"Environment"}
