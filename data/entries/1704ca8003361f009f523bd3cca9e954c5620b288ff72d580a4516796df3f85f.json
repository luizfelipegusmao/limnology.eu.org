{"title":"Trehalose or not-trehalose: The question of direct vs. indirect transcriptional responses to the sugar trehalose-6-phosphate","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/21/7686077?rss=1","date":1717113600000,"content":"<span>In terrestrial ecosystems, plants act as primary producers by sequestering carbon from CO<sub>2</sub> and incorporating it into the soluble sugar form. These sugars are transported out of the leaves, usually in the form of sucrose, and into sink organs such as roots and fruits. The distribution of sugars within the plant at any given time is non-uniform, and plants must continually monitor their sugar levels to control carbohydrate homeostasis and other signaling processes. In addition to directly sensing the primary soluble sugar, it has been proposed that plants can also perceive trehalose-6-phosphate (Tre6P) as a signal of sugar availability. Tre6P is the intermediate molecule in the synthesis of the sugar trehalose. Trehalose metabolism is facilitated by 2 enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). In the first step, TPS catalyzes the synthesis of Tre6P from UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. TPP then dephosphorylates Tre6P to produce trehalose (Fig.).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1704ca8003361f009f523bd3cca9e954c5620b288ff72d580a4516796df3f85f","category":"Environment"}
