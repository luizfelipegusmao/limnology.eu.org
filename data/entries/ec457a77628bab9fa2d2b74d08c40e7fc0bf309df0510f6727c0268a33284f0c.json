{"title":"CFD Simulation of Dynamic Temperature Variations Induced by Tunnel Ventilation in a Broiler House","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1263/v1","date":1726526501000,"content":"Maintaining the optimal microclimate in broiler houses is crucial for bird productivity, yet enabling efficient temperature control remains a significant challenge. This study developed and validated a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict temporal changes in indoor air temperature in response to variable ventilation operations in a commercial broiler house. The model accurately simulated air velocity and airflow distribution for different numbers of tunnel fans in operation, with air-velocity errors ranging from -0.22 to 0.32 m s-1. The predicted airflow rates through inlets and cooling pads showed good agreement with measured values with an accuracy of up to 108.1%. Additionally, the CFD model effectively predicted temperature dynamics, accounting for chicken heat production and ventilation effect. The model successfully predicted the longitudinal temperature gradients and their variations during ventilation cycles, validating its reliability through comparison with experimental data. The study also explored different variable inlet configurations to mitigate the temperature gradient. The variable inlet adjustment showed the potential to relieve the high temperatures but may reduce overall ventilation efficiency or intensify temperature gradients, which confirms the importance of optimising ventilation strategies. This CFD model provides a valuable tool for evaluating and improving ventilation systems and contributes to enhanced indoor microclimates and productivity in poultry houses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec457a77628bab9fa2d2b74d08c40e7fc0bf309df0510f6727c0268a33284f0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
