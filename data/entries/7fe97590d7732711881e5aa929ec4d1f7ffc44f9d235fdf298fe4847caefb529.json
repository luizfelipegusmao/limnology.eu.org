Rasburicase is an essential medicine required to prevent and treat the hyperuricemia associated with TLS. Due to a shortage of rasburicase during the COVID-19 pandemic, a fixed dose strategy of 3 mg rasburicase had been used in many adult cancer patients in our center. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a 3 mg fixed dose of rasburicase in preventing and managing hyperuricemia associated with TLS in adult cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study between March 2020 and November 2022. The study included adult patients who received a fixed dose of 3 mg rasburicase. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in serum UA levels of","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7fe97590d7732711881e5aa929ec4d1f7ffc44f9d235fdf298fe4847caefb529","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
