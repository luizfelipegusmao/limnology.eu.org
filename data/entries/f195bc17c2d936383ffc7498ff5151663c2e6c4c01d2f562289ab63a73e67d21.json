{"title":"The Case of Clean Customer Master Data for Customer Analytics: A Neglected Element for Data Monetization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2088/v1","date":1721919205000,"content":"Despite the demonstrated benefits of data monetization initiatives in achieving competitive advantages, many of these efforts struggle to realize their potential. Companies often find it challenging to sustain even initially successful data monetization initiatives due to significant data quality issues. This reflects a disconnect between advancements in data monetization research—spanning digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation—and practical implementation within companies. Consequently, misguided approaches to data monetization are relatively common. A critical prerequisite for successful data monetization is the establishment and maintenance of clean, high-quality data. This study underscores the importance of data quality by conducting an in-depth analysis of Medical Inc., a company engaged in preparing pristine customer master data for advanced customer analytics. The investigation aims to elucidate Medical Inc.’s approach to addressing data cleanliness challenges and to distill a general framework for the customer master data cleansing process. This framework illuminates a relatively unexplored aspect of data monetization supplementing existing literature on digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f195bc17c2d936383ffc7498ff5151663c2e6c4c01d2f562289ab63a73e67d21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
