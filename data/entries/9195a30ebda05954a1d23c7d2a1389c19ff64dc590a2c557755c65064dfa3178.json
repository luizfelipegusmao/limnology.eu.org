{"title":"The Effects of an 8-Week Cognitive-Motor Training Program on Proprioception and Postural Control under Single and Dual-Task in Older Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1642/v1","date":1719211419000,"content":"The aim of the study was to assess the effects of an 8-week cognitive-motor training program on postural control and knee proprioception under single and dual-task conditions. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Methods: 20 healthy and physically active older adults (73.255.98 years) volunteered to participate and were randomly assigned into an experimental and a control group (EG and CG). Postural control was measured with the Romberg test, with open (RBOE), closed eyes (RBCE) and under unipodal dominant side (RUDL) conditions. Proprioception was assessed by measuring participants’ ability to reposition their dominant knee at 45º. Finally, performance on the cognitive task was measured through a subscale of the Barcelona Test called “categorical evocation in associations.” The EG and the CG completed 8-week training programme with two sessions the 30 minutes per week of postural control and proprioception exercises. The EG additionally included music in each session. Results: The results showed significant differences in both group at the postural control tests (RBOE and RBCE) and proprioceptive test post intervention. Conclusion: The 8-week training program had a positive impact on the post-intervention results for motor control and proprioception, but not on the results of the cognitive task. There were no significant differences between the groups that carried out sessions with or without music.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9195a30ebda05954a1d23c7d2a1389c19ff64dc590a2c557755c65064dfa3178","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
