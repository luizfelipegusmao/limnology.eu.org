Chest CT was performed 3 and 12 months after admission. CT images were evaluated using a CT severity score (CSS) (0–12 scale) and recoded to an abbreviated version (0–3 scale). We analyzed determinants of the abbreviated CSS with multivariable mixed effects ordinal regression.</p> Results <p>242 patients completed CT at 3 months, and 124 (mean age 62.3±13.3, 78 men) also at 12 months. Between 3 and 12 months (n = 124) CSS (0–12 scale) for ground-glass opacities (GGO) decreased from median 3 (25<sup>th</sup>–75<sup>th</sup> percentile: 0–12) at 3 months to 0.5 (0–12) at 12 months (p&lt;0.001), but increased for parenchymal bands (p&lt;0.001). In multivariable analysis of GGO, the odds ratio for more severe abbreviated CSS (0–3 scale) at 12 months was 0.11 (95%CI 0.11 0.05 to 0.21, p&lt;0.001) compared to 3 months, for WHO severity category 5–7 (high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation/ventilator) versus 3 (non-oxygen use) 37.16 (1.18 to 43.47, p = 0.032), and for age ≥60 compared to &lt;60 years 4.8 (1.33 to 17.6, p = 0.016). Mosaicism was reduced at 12 compared to 3 months, OR 0.33 (95%CI 0.16 to 0.66, p = 0.002).</p> Conclusions <p>GGO and mosaicism decreased, while parenchymal bands increased from 3 to 12 months. Persistent GGO were associated with initial COVID-19 severity and age ≥60 years.</p>","author":"Trond Mogens Aaløkken","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7d01a84303e134792fa56627eaaa905b9a2d4cffd004bfba98b364d181bd0af3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
