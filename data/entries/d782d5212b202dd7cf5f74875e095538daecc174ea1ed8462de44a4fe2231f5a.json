{"title":"Can access to urban networks promote urban development? Evidence from the Yangtze River Delta region of China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300199","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Liang Ding, Zhiqiong Yang, Junshen Zhang, Yahui Chen, Xiaohan Wang</p>\r\n\r\nThe regional networking strategy is widely implemented in China as a normative policy aimed at fostering cohesion and enhancing competitiveness. However, the empirical basis for this strategy remains relatively weak due to limitations in measurement methods and data availability. This paper establishes the urban networks by the enterprise investment data, and then accurately measures the network’s external effects of each city by the method of MGWR model. The results show that: (1) Regional networking plays a significant role in urban development, although it is not the dominant factor. (2) The benefits of network connections may vary depending on the location and level of cities. (3) The major cities assume a pivotal role in the urban network. Based upon the aforementioned research conclusions, this paper presents strategic measures to enhance the network’s external impacts, aiming to offer insights for other regions in formulating regional development strategies and establishing regional urban networks.","author":"Liang Ding","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d782d5212b202dd7cf5f74875e095538daecc174ea1ed8462de44a4fe2231f5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
