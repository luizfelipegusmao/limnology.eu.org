The probability density function (PDF) of the derived intracranial pressure predictions enables the computation of a definite integral around a point estimate, representing the event’s probability within a range of values. Seven hold-out test cases used for the external validation of an XGB model underwent retinal vascular pulse and intracranial pressure measurement using modified photoplethysmography and lumbar puncture, respectively. The definite integral ±1 cm water from the median (DI<sub>ICP</sub>) demonstrated a negative and highly significant correlation (-0.5213±0.17, p&lt; 0.004) with the absolute difference between the measured and predicted median intracranial pressure (Diff<sub>ICPmd</sub>). The concordance between the arterial and venous probability density functions was estimated using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, extending the distribution agreement across all data points. This parameter showed a statistically significant and positive correlation (0.4942±0.18, p&lt; 0.001) with Diff<sub>ICPmd</sub>. Two cautionary subset cases (Case 8 and Case 9), where disagreement was observed between measured and predicted intracranial pressure, were compared to the seven hold-out test cases. Arterial predictions from both cautionary subset cases converged on a uniform distribution in contrast to all other cases where distributions converged on either log-normal or closely related skewed distributions (gamma, logistic, beta). The mean±standard error of the arterial DI<sub>ICP</sub> from cases 8 and 9 (3.83±0.56%) was lower compared to that of the hold-out test cases (14.14±1.07%) the between group difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.03). Although the sample size in this analysis was limited, these results support a dual and complementary analysis approach from independently derived retinal arterial and venous non-invasive intracranial pressure predictions. Results suggest that plotting the PDF and calculating the lower order moments, arterial DI<sub>ICP</sub>, and the two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic may provide individualized predictive accuracy parameters.","author":"Anmar Abdul-Rahman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1f7b12f576b26963b6c3aab9016ce3068d54f197f7efe4fe2c02c08f33c90714","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
