{"title":"ML-based Pain Recognition Model Using Mixup Data Augmentation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0493/v1","date":1723012698000,"content":"Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized healthcare by enhancing diagnostic capabilities because of its ability to analyze large datasets and detect minor patterns often overlooked by humans. This is beneficial, especially in pain recognition, where patient communication may be limited. However, ML models often face challenges such as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. Regularization techniques like mixup, which trains models on convex combinations of data pairs, address these issues by enhancing model generalization. While mixup has proven effective in image, speech, and text datasets, its application to time-series signals like electrodermal activity (EDA) is less explored. This research uses ML for pain recognition with EDA signals from the BioVid Heat Pain Database to distinguish pain by applying mixup regularization to manually extracted EDA features and using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Results showed that this approach achieved an average accuracy of 75.87% using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV) compared to 74.61% without mixup. This demonstrates the mixupâ€™s efficacy in improving ML model accuracy for pain recognition from EDA signals. This study highlights the potential of mixup in ML as a promising approach to enhance pain assessment in healthcare.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0a01865f455e73e9afd553461e21604c7e6ddb03dcea9b11e6191ce6654607b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
