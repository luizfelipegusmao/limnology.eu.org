{"title":"Multiomics Data Analyses Identified CpG Sites and Genes That Mediate the Impact of Exposure to Environmental Chemicals on Cardiometabolic Traits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0849/v1","date":1715599352000,"content":"Understanding the molecular mechanism whereby an environmental chemical causes a disease is important for downstream purposes. In this study, an analytical workflow was designed to combine several publicly available datasets in order to identify CpG sites and genes that mediate the impact of exposure to environmental chemicals on cardiometabolic traits. Organophosphate and prenatal lead exposure were previously reported to change methylation level at the cg23627948 site. I found as cg23627948 site becomes methylated, the expression of GNA12 gene decreases and this leads to higher body fat percentage. Prenatal perfluorooctane sulfonate expo-sure was reported to increase the methylation level at cg21153102 site. The outcome of analyses revealed higher methylation at this site contributes to higher diastolic blood by changing the expression of CHP1 and GCHFR genes. Furthermore, HKR1 mediates the impact of B12 supple-mentation-cg05280698 hypermethylation on higher kidney function; while, CTDNEP1 mediates the impact of air pollution-cg03186999 hypomethylation on higher systolic blood pressure. This study reports CpG sites and genes that mediate the impact of environmental chemicals on cardiometabolic traits and describes a framework to investigate the underlying molecular paths using publicly available data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93dd817a28aead4a3470b74e60d7595669745f37dadb4b9fbbaf14432dfd9129","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
