There are 6 transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) and 4 scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) together with other microscopy and microanalysis instruments and a full set of specimen preparation equipment in the IMRI facilities, including NION UltraSTEM 200 HERMES and double-corrected JEOL Grand ARM 300F S/TEM. We witnessed the development of materials characterization facilities at UCI and participated in their management and operation in the last 17 years. Here we share with you a successful story about the development, management, and operation of materials characterization facilities at UCI.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fbac3bd9c9012ebc05660cb3b2a2617f69112661c1d465f3429427245d75d1ca","category":"Environment"}
