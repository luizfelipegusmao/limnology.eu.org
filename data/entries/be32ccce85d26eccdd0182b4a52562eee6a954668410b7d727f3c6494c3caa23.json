{"title":"The SWI/SNF subunit ARID1B is important for regenerative ability of hematopoietic stem cells in normal hematopoiesis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312616","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by Olivia Arnold, Theresa Bluemn, Cary Stelloh, Sridhar Rao, Nan Zhu</p>\r\n\r\nThe Switch/Sugar non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) nucleosome remodeling complexes are essential for normal hematopoiesis. The Brg1/Brm associated factor (BAF) is a form of mammalian SWI/SNF that is distinguished by the presence of either ARID1A or ARID1B protein. In this study, we used hematopoietic specific Cre mouse models to assess the function of Arid1b in blood development. We found Arid1b loss did not affect steady state hematopoiesis or hematopoietic regeneration. Nonetheless, Arid1b null hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells have reduced ability to reconstitute hematopoietic system compared to wild type cells. Overall, our data indicate Arid1b is largely dispensable for normal hematopoiesis but impairs the regenerative ability of HSPCs.","author":"Olivia Arnold","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"be32ccce85d26eccdd0182b4a52562eee6a954668410b7d727f3c6494c3caa23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
