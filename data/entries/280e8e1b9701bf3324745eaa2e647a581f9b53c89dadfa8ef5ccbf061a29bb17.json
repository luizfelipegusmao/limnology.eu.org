{"title":"Implementation of the 3‐30‐300 Green City Concept: Warsaw Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0339/v1","date":1728046327000,"content":"In recent years, the \"3-30-300\" concept by Professor Cecil Konijnendijk has been gaining popularity, outlining what makes a city \"green\" and what we should strive for. This concept suggests that from every apartment, at least 3 trees should be visible, 30% of the city's surface should be covered with greenery, and the nearest park or forest should be no more than 300 meters away. However, the lack of detailed guidelines makes the implementation of this concept a significant challenge. The goal of the research presented here was to adapt this concept for Warsaw (Poland) and assess whether it can be considered a green city. I defined parameters such as the maximum distance for visible trees as 20 meters and determined what counts toward the 30% green areas. The results showed that 57.82% of apartments in Warsaw have a view of at least 3 trees, while only 5.44% do not meet this criterion, and the rest meet it only partially. Parks and forests cover 19.95% of the city, while all green areas combined cover 42.01%. Additionally, 45% of buildings are located within 300 meters from a park or forest. Ultimately, full compliance with the \"3-30-300\" concept applies to 22.19% of buildings, while only 12.66% meet the criteria when considering only parks and forests. This indicates that, while Warsaw is relatively green, not all of its areas fulfill these criteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"280e8e1b9701bf3324745eaa2e647a581f9b53c89dadfa8ef5ccbf061a29bb17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
