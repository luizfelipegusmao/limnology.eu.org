{"title":"Applied Theory of Relativity into Human and Animal Biology and Psychology?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1192/v4","date":1721031817000,"content":"It is often said in human society that it all starts from the mind, and this is true. The answer to the question “Why is it that pets require much fewer years to fully develop than humans?” could be headed to the Theory of Relativity and the perceived time according to the levels of instinct and rationality. It is perhaps no wonder that the French language translates the word “mind” as “l’esprit”, which also means “spirit” in the English language. Given that the Theory of Relativity applies to all physical matter, the theory applies to chemistry, biology and psychology as well. The level of instinct is proportional with the perceived speed of time and implicitly, to the speed of time itself for the whole organism, given that the nervous system coordinates all bodily functions. A pet may experience a few years as humans experience over a decade, making their perceived lifetime to be approximately equal to the human’s. The same applies to the perception of space and its components. This aspect would emphasise upon the fact that all life on Earth shows the same degree of value with regards to uniqueness. Nevertheless, the values represented by the hierarchy of competences among living organisms at the same time differs based on species. Honour of uniqueness and hierarchy of competences represent two scientific concepts that never overcross. As a result, there is no evidence to suggest that scientific facts as such constitute a form of contradiction to philosophical and religious ideas, given that religion refers to animals as companions of humans. With regards to the clock of the living organism; there are three kinds of clocks in a living organism: the emotional clock, the cognitive clock and the molecular clock. These three categories actually constitute the temporal layers of our dimension, so they are in a relationship of interdependence. When one has a feeling that time is slower or quicker, they are not fully experiencing that change in the time speed, but only partially. And one can profoundly experience the change of perceived time speed when they experience profound feelings, which sweep them away from reality. Complete, deep mental focus can bring about this profound change in perception, which will make the individual feel as if they are in a different form of reality. When one is more instinctive, the person in cause perceives time as slower and sees more opportunities within the same frame of time and space. When one experiences the “Fight or flight” mode, the person in the cause finds themselves to be in danger and has two options; to try to prevail over the danger or to flee it. Whilst experiencing such a mode, people are much more alert and therefore, time passes more slowly and the physical space dilates. When people are relaxed, however, time and space become smaller, and when they are in a deep state of resting, they become very small. And where there is a smaller dimension, there is a greater speed, just as the circulating air gains speed when it crosses narrow passages.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30d6668aa1a750c0c064fb42016891696451b72fb8f1e0c39adcb7d3089077e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
