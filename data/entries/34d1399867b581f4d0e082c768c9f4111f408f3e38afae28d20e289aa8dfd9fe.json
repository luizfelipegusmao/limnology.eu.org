{"title":"The Salvador Pass Dilemma: Security, Violence, and the Paradox of Governance in the Sahel πs Borderlands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1249/v1","date":1723808916000,"content":"The border between Niger and Libya, often described as an \"ungoverned space,\" epitomizes the complex interplay of economic, political, and security challenges within the Sahel region. Authorities and international actors have made various efforts to establish control, but tribal structures predominantly manage governance in these areas. These structures lack formal institutions and rely heavily on external security interventions to combat terrorism and irregular migration. The increasing militarization of the region raises significant concerns about the long-term efficacy of these approaches in achieving sustainable security. This study argues that enduring stability in such contexts requires a nuanced balance of economic, political, and social factors. The research methodology includes a comprehensive literature review of security issues, governance, state fragility, and counter-terrorism, utilizing scientific journals, books, reports, and newspapers. The study investigated the dual nature of ungoverned spaces, examining their role in facilitating terrorism and organized crime while highlighting the critical need for governance to enhance citizen welfare and support state functions. Recent developments in Libya and the Sahel under-score the urgency of addressing security and developmental challenges. The study concludes by advocating for sustainable political and development initiatives over militarization, emphasizing the necessity of a new social contract to address the security challenges in the Sahel region effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34d1399867b581f4d0e082c768c9f4111f408f3e38afae28d20e289aa8dfd9fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
