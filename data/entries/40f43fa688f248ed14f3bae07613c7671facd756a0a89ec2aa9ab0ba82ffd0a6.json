{"title":"Identification of the mechanistic basis of nitrogen responsiveness in two contrasting Setaria italica accessions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/5008/7670764?rss=1","date":1715558400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nitrogen (N) is a macronutrient limiting crop productivity with varied requirements across species and genotypes. Understanding the mechanistic basis of N responsiveness by comparing contrasting genotypes could inform the development and selection of varieties with lower N demands, or inform agronomic practices to sustain yields with lower N inputs. Given the established role of millets in ensuring climate-resilient food and nutrition security, we investigated the physiological and genetic basis of nitrogen responsiveness in foxtail millet (<span>Setaria italica</span> L.). We had previously identified genotypic variants linked to N responsiveness, and here we dissect the mechanistic basis of the trait by examining the physiological and molecular behaviour of N responsive (NRp-SI58) and non-responsive (NNRp-SI114) accessions at high and low N. Under high N, NRp-SI58 allocates significantly more biomass to nodes, internodes and roots, more N to developing grains, and is more effective at remobilizing flag leaf N compared with NNRp-SI114. Post-anthesis flag leaf gene expression suggests that differences in N induce much higher transcript abundance in NNRp-SI114 than NRp-SI58, a large proportion of which is potentially regulated by APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factors. Overall, the study provides novel insights into the regulation and manipulation of N responsiveness in <span>S. italica</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"40f43fa688f248ed14f3bae07613c7671facd756a0a89ec2aa9ab0ba82ffd0a6","category":"Environment"}
