{"title":"Determining the Extent of Radical Diffusion and Corresponding Irradiation Damage During Liquid-Phase TEM Experiments via Post-Mortem 4D-STEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.803/7720178?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The investigation of nanoscale materials and processes through high spatial resolution imaging is frequently challenged by the material instability under the intense energy of electron beams. Although standard TEM provides valuable nanoscale insights, the required drying step for sample preparation can cause structural collapse, hindering the observation of dynamic reactions and transformations. To address the limitations of studying electron beam-sensitive materials and preserving the real (often solvated) structure, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) has been utilized. Yet, this method can introduce imaging artifacts, such as crystalline ice, and it is limited to materials in aqueous media, also precluding the observation of dynamic processes. In contrast, liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) offers a broader applicability, allowing for the observation of samples suspended in both aqueous and organic media – enabling study of solvated materials and a large variety of reactions including catalysis and nanoparticles synthesis. Yet, both cryo-TEM and LPTEM suffer from complications resulting from radiolytic products generated from the degradation of solvent molecules upon interaction with the electron beam [<a href=\"#ozae044.803-B1\">1</a>]. As all solvents tend to decompose upon interaction with the high energy electron beam, the intended <span>in situ</span> reactions can be perturbed physically and chemically due to changes in pH, ionic strength, charging, and the formation of reactive radicals and molecular species [<a href=\"#ozae044.803-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.803-B3\">3</a>]. Despite the recent advancements made towards understanding the reaction dynamics within the liquid cell, many of the previous studies have focused on aqueous environments and ignore the more complex (yet realistic) experimental setups within the liquid cell – including the effects of organic solvents, scavengers, and sensitizers – which require more experimental studies. To better understand the effects of primary and secondary radiolysis and achieve higher quality LPTEM experiments, it is critical to understand the radiolytic process for various electron beam conditions and solvent conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"611941df4251e2bbfdd0c16054be6eb2d8dda2a968267ce5bfa22fbcd7c54949","category":"Environment"}
