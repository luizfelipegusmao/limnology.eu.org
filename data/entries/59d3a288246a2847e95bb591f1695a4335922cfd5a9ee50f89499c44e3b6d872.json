{"title":"The Potential Regenerative Effect of L-carnitine Pretreated Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Myocardial Infarction Through Modulating Apoptosis, Inflammation, and Cellular Differentiation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1819/v1","date":1716867505000,"content":"Preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent an advanced method to overcome the challenges related to their survival rate, differentiation, and activity maintenance. L-carnitine has demonstrated antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects on injured cardiac cells. However, limited research has been conducted to explore their combined effect on cardiac tissue injury. Therefore, the present study aimed to conduct a comparative and comprehensive study investigating the role of L-carnitine-pre-treatment on the immunomodulation of inflammation, apoptosis, and differentiation of MSCs and their impact on cardiac toxicity induced by Doxorubicin (DOX). Rats were divided into group I (control), group II (DOX), group III (DOX+MSCs), group IV (DOX+L-carnitine), group V (DOX+L-carnitine pre-treated MSCs). CK-MB, troponin I, MDA, and catalase levels were improved in the treated groups (III, IV, and V). The degeneration and necrosis of the cardiomyocytes were reduced in the treated groups. They regained their normal architecture in the L-carnitine pre-treated MSCs group. These findings were augmented by analyzing the immunomodulators; NF-ҡβ, TNFα, and IL-1β, the proliferative indicators Ki-67, and hsp90, the cardiac differentiation marker TH and the apoptotic regulators; caspase 3 and Bcl2. These results demonstrate the optimal regenerative and therapeutic effects of L-carnitine pre-treated MSCs representing an efficient tool for future stem cell therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59d3a288246a2847e95bb591f1695a4335922cfd5a9ee50f89499c44e3b6d872","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
