{"title":"Nitrogen and Phosphorus Discharges from Cargo Ships&rsquo; Black and Grey Waters &ndash; Case of a Baltic Sea Port","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0640/v1","date":1715333480000,"content":"Shipping is a vital component of global trade. However, shipping activities have negative environmental impacts, including emissions to air and water. The Baltic Sea is severely affected by eutrophication, mainly due to nutrient inputs, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. The aim of this research is to quantify the nutrient content of black and grey water discharged from cargo ships in the Baltic Sea in order to assess their contribution to the total nutrient load. Specifically, the research examines the nitrogen and phosphorus loadings from ships calling the port of HaminaKotka and addresses key questions regarding nutrient generation, discharge proportions, emission shares by ship type and their importance compared to other sources. Using a methodology based on ship data and nutrient production estimates, the study found that 2545 cargo ships generated a total of 781 kg of nitrogen and 134 kg of phosphorus in their effluents during their voyages to the port in 2021. However, only a small fraction (0.5%) of the cargo ships discharged their wastewater at port reception facilities. The study concludes that, although nutrient discharges from cargo ships are relatively small compared to other nutrient sources, efforts to promote port reception or onboard treatment are important for environmental sustainability. Further research is recommended to assess the effectiveness of onboard treatment systems, the impact of other contaminants in wastewater and the development of port reception facilities to facilitate proper wastewater management in the maritime trade.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3f7b5484c9926c7fd3603626c91771b900e44cb3a1ba32b2fa16fa5358bd491","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
