{"title":"Partial cutting favours northern white-cedar regeneration but does not ensure recruitment to canopy: does browsing matter?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/97/1/162/7203814?rss=1","date":1687219200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gap dynamics facilitate recruitment of late-successional species such as northern white-cedar (<span>Thuja occidentalis</span> L.). For this reason, harvests that result in partial rather than complete canopy removal have been suggested for cedar. However, success of regenerating cedar following partial harvests is uncertain, especially where there is heavy browsing by white-tailed deer (<span>Odocoileus virginianus</span> Zimmerman) or snowshoe hare (<span>Lepus americanus</span>). Efforts to understand how partial harvests and browsing interact to affect natural regeneration of cedar have been limited. We inventoried partially harvested stands along a gradient of 1–11 years since harvest in New Brunswick, Canada, in an area where deer frequently overwinter. Cedar regeneration was negatively influenced by browsing, but positively influenced by years since harvest and sapling basal area. Cedar seedling survival was assessed over a 2-year period and found to be primarily a function of height at initial measurement, with little influence of browsing. Annual vertical gain of cedar seedlings (a surrogate for height growth) decreased with increasing years since harvest and was influenced by distance from gap edge. In gaps, vertical gain increased with distance to gap edge, while distance to gap edge had a negative influence on vertical gain of seedlings in the matrix (between-gap areas). Many tagged cedar seedlings disappeared prior to remeasurement. These were likely completely consumed by browsers, limiting our ability to determine relative influences of partial harvest and browsing on cedar regeneration. We conclude that partial harvests, as applied in this study, increase cedar abundance and vertical gain, but browsing may necessitate seedling protection. We suggest monitoring to confirm sufficient cedar regeneration in partially harvested stands, using exclosures where browsing is a concern, and retaining or at least delaying removal of seed-bearing cedar overstory trees until regeneration has reached heights safe from browsing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research Current Issue","siteHash":"674daa49a10aca976a546578a4b89e6a296c5e7ca75e6f3ff66a7154daf5b0cb","entryHash":"beab6491d177a65e6103406850667194c83668ec5f1e2c384c71a623c9f14250","category":"Environment"}
