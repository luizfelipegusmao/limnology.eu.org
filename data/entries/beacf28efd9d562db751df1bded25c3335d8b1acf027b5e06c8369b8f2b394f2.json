{"title":"The preservation effect of biodegradable gelatin coating incorporated with grape seed oil on glazed shrimp","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13236?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This study was conducted to investigate the quality and shelf life of shrimps (<i>Parapenaeus longirostris</i>, Lucas 1846) glazed with biodegradable gelatin solutions combined with grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) seed oil (GSO). Therefore, shrimps were divided into five groups and were glazed with distilled water (control), G (gelatin), G + 5% GSO (gelatin with 5% GSO), G + 10% GSO (gelatin with 10% GSO) and G + 15% GSO (gelatin with 15% GSO). Glazed shrimps were vacuum packaged and stored at −18 °C for 12 months. Proximate composition of the shrimps was determined, and the microbial (total viable counts, psychrotrophic bacteria count and Enterobacteriaceae), sensorial, chemical (residual sulfite, pH, total volatile basic nitrogen, trimethylamine nitrogen, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) analysis, colour measurement, and melanosis formation were evaluated throughout the storage period.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>According to the analysis results, edible G + GSO coatings improved the meat quality and the brightness of the shrimps. The combined treatment reduced the quality loss of the shrimps which was caused by lipid content and prevented the total psychotropic bacteria growth throughout the storage. Moreover, glazing with G + GSO retarded the melanosis formation of the frozen shrimps.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study results revealed that GSO may be a recommended alternatively to sodium metabisulfite, which is a hazardous chemical substance commonly used against melanosis of shrimps. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tuba Baygar, \nCansu Metin Hacisa, \nTaçnur Baygar, \nYunus Alparslan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"beacf28efd9d562db751df1bded25c3335d8b1acf027b5e06c8369b8f2b394f2","category":"Environment"}
