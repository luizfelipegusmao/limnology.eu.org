Such variation may be especially important for ectotherms whose body temperatures, and consequently, physiological processes, are regulated by external conditions.\n\nAdditionally, differences in body size are often associated with latitudinal clines, thought to be driven by climate gradients. While studies have begun to explore variation in body size and heat tolerance within species, our understanding of these patterns across large spatial scales, particularly regarding the roles of plasticity and genetic differences, remains incomplete.\n\nHere, we examine body size, as measured by wing length, and thermal tolerance, as measured by the time to immobilisation at high temperatures (“thermal knockdown”), in populations of the mosquito <i>Aedes sierrensis</i> collected from across a large latitudinal climate gradient spanning 1300 km (34–44° N).\n\nWe find that mosquitoes collected from lower latitudes and warmer climates were more tolerant of high temperatures than those collected from higher latitudes and colder climates. Moreover, body size increased with latitude and decreased with temperature, a pattern consistent with James' rule, which appears to be a result of plasticity rather than genetic variation.\n\nOur results suggest that warmer environments produce smaller and more thermally tolerant populations.\n</p>","author":"Kelsey Lyberger, \nJohannah E.
