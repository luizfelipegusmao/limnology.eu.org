{"title":"Using Multispectral Remote Sensing to Track Evapotranspiration Patterns in the Yinchuan Plain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0555/v1","date":1723097000000,"content":"Evapotranspiration is a critical component of the hydrological cycle, and it has a decisive impact on the ecosystem balance in arid and semi-arid regions. The Yinchuan Plain, located in the Gobi of Northwest China, has a strong surface ET. In order to assess the ET pattern in this region, we obtained the ETa of Yinchuan Plain between 1987 and 2020 using the GEE platform. We employed the Surface Energy Balance Model (SEBAL), specifically geeSEBAL, to analyze the change pattern of ET over different seasons, years, and land types. The results show that: ① In spring, the daily ETa of the Yinchuan Plain is highest in the central lake wetland area, with a maximum value of 4.32 mm day-1. In summer, it is concentrated around the croplands and water bodies, with a maximum value of 6.90 mm day-1; In Autumn and winter, it is mainly concentrated around the water bodies and impervious areas, with maximum values of 3.93 and 1.56 mm day-1, respectively. ② From 1987 to 2020, the ET of the Yinchuan Plain showed an obvious upward and downward trend in some areas with significant land use changes, but the overall ET of the region remained relatively stable without dramatic fluctuations. ③ The evapotranspiration of different underlying land use types in the Yinchuan Plain region is as follows: water body&amp;gt;cultivated land&amp;gt;impervious&amp;gt;grassland&amp;gt;bare land. Our results showed that geeSEBAL is highly applicable in the Yinchuan Plain area. It allows for the accurate and detailed inversion of ET in the study area, which facilitates the study of regional hydrological cycle and water governance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe9551b035ef11eae36724f399c1d0dcd7b61fbfbc9f49c1191e973e8aa92a9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
