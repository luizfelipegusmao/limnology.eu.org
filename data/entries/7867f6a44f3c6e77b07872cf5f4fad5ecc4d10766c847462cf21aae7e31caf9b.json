While electrolyzers, used to produce green hydrogen, and fuel cells, used to convert this hydrogen to electrical energy, have been commercialized in low volumes, they are not yet efficient, durable, or affordable enough for mass production and wide adoption. A principal component of these devices that remains poorly understood is the thin-film ionomer that coats the electrode structures and governs the flow of ions and molecules to and from catalyst active sites [<a href=\"#ozae044.864-B2\">2</a>]. Though various techniques such as neutron and X-ray scattering can provide valuable information about model two-dimensional thin-film systems [<a href=\"#ozae044.864-B2\">2</a>], high spatial-resolution characterization of ionomers within their native heterogeneous electrode environments is challenging, limiting our understanding of their properties in functional devices. Not only are these materials and interfaces buried within devices, but they are highly sensitive to electron beams, damaging many orders of magnitude more rapidly than materials well suited for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, while cryogenic methods have been shown to enable enhanced local ionomer information to be obtained compared to conventional techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.864-B3\">3-9</a>], the heterogeneous nature of electrodes necessitates acquisition of such information across full electrode structures to understand the range and spatial distribution of their properties present within the electrode [<a href=\"#ozae044.864-B10\">10</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7867f6a44f3c6e77b07872cf5f4fad5ecc4d10766c847462cf21aae7e31caf9b","category":"Environment"}
