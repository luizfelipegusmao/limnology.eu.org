BM at different revolutions per minute (RPM) was found to have a direct impact on the quality of graphene coating [<a href=\"#ozae044.293-B1\">1</a>]. This study suggests that low speed milling (210 RPM) results in larger, less defective flakes with lower coverage. Conversely, high speed milling (620 RPM) results in higher coating coverage but with smaller and more damaged graphene flakes. The preferred milling speed for moderate coverage and less damaged graphene flakes was 415 RPM demonstrated by the results presented in this report. Characterization of the graphene coating was carried out via SEM imaging (SNE 4500 Plus) and Raman spectroscopy (Horiba HR800).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b0d1af2a2fab82c7570545d363d2d8211209c4cf89cfa11f8e9d60786c9a69f0","category":"Environment"}
