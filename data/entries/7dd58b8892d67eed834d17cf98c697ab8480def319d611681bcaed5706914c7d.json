{"title":"Cross-Walking the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework: A Forest-Centred Outlook","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1181/v1","date":1710926770000,"content":"Following the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF), with the Convention on Biological Diversity serving as its guiding treaty, the European Union (EU) has just reached an agreement on an EU Nature Restoration Regulation. This study carries out a systematic cross-walk between the restoration regulation and the KM-GBF, focusing on their implications for forest ecosystems. This paper identifies areas of alignment, divergence, and potential gaps related to habitat restoration, species protection, climate resilience, and the sustainable use of natural resources. The methodology adopts a grounded approach, starting with the 23 targets outlined in the KM-GBF and proceeding to the 28 articles set out in the restoration regulation. The results highlight the need for better alignment between the KM-GBF, the restoration regulation, and other forest-relevant EU policy instruments. The study stresses the need for a coherent and integrated EU policy approach that can address the diverse challenges and policy objectives facing forests. It concludes that amendments to the restoration regulation have significantly diluted its potential impact, limiting the EU Members States accountability and ability to meet KM-GBF goals and targets. It further stresses the need for strategies that can reconcile divergent EU policy pathways, support forest management and restoration efforts, while aligning with global biodiversity objectives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7dd58b8892d67eed834d17cf98c697ab8480def319d611681bcaed5706914c7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
