{"title":"Burn Severity and Post‐Fire Weather Are Key to Predicting Time‐To‐Recover From Australian Forest Fires","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003780?af=R","date":1713616521000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change has accelerated the frequency of catastrophic wildfires; however, the drivers that control the time-to-recover of forests are poorly understood. We integrated remotely sensed data, climate records, and landscape features to identify the causes of variability in the time-to-recover of canopy leaf area in southeast Australian eucalypt forests. Approximately 97% of all observed burns between 2001 and 2014 recovered to a pre-fire leaf area index (±0.25 sd) within six years. Time-to-recover was highly variable within individual wildfires (ranging between ≤1 and ≥5 years), across burn seasons (90% longer January to September), and year of fire (median time-to-recover varying four-fold across fire years). We used the logistic growth function to estimate the leaf area recovery rate, burn severity, and the long-term carrying capacity of leaf area. Time-to-recover was most correlated with the leaf area recovery rate. The leaf area recovery rate was largest in areas that experienced high burn severity, and smallest in areas of intermediate to low burn severity. The leaf area recovery rate was also strongly accelerated by anomalously high post-fire precipitation, and delayed by post-fire drought. Finally we developed a predictive machine-learning model of time-to-recover (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup>: 0.68). Despite the exceptionally high burn severity of the 2019–2020 Australian megafires, we forecast the time-to-recover to be only 15% longer than the average of previous fire years.</p>","author":"Sami W.
