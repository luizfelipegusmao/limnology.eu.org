{"title":"Light-like Geodesics at the Event Horizon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202303.0512/v9","date":1707142761000,"content":"This paper examines radially infalling worldlines in both Schwarzschild and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates.  A new Schwarzschild coordinate chart is presented which emphasizes the curvature of both the time and space coordinates and makes clear not only the mechanism by which the inertial observer is accelerated relative to the rest observers, but also clearly shows the light-like nature of the inertial worldline at the event horizon.  The light-like nature of the falling frame is then supported by examining the falling worldlines in Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates.  The effect of length contraction in the falling frame is also analyzed in both Schwarzschild and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bd307f68b42621c750e730ac5e54c614559c7b0491122649c27b01436f488a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
