{"title":"Influence of Moult Cycles on Digestive Enzyme Activities during Early Larval Stages of Panulirus ornatus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/9956046?af=R","date":1684306800000,"content":"<p>The tropical spiny lobster, <i>Panulirus ornatus</i>, has a complex life cycle characterised by a series of moults that occur throughout pelagic larval stages. Significant morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes commonly coincide with moulting and can have dietary implications when culturing this species. Digestive enzyme activities respond to nutritional requirements and have provided useful insight into nutrient use dynamics associated with first-feeding in <i>P. ornatus</i>. Beyond first-feeding, however, information on digestive enzyme activities in <i>P. ornatus</i> is scarce. Greater knowledge of fluctuations in digestive enzyme activities during moult cycles should facilitate better formulation of feeds and more efficient feeding regimens. As an initial step towards this goal, the present study evaluated the influence of moult cycles on digestive enzyme activities during early larval stages of <i>P. ornatus</i>. The investigation focused exclusively on early larval stages (stages Iâ€“III) when delivery of appropriate feeds and nutrition can dramatically affect subsequent growth and survival.</p>","author":"Jerome Genodepa, \nChaoshu Zeng, \nThane A.
