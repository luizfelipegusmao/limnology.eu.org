{"title":"Performance Analysis of Six Electro-Optical Crystals in a High-Bandwidth Traveling Wave Mach-Zehnder Light Modulator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0179/v1","date":1712044098000,"content":"In this study, a Traveling-Wave Mach-Zehnder intensity Modulator (TW-MZM) was designed and optimized for six different electro-optical (EO) crystals: Lithium Niobate (LNB), Potassium Niobate (KNB), Lithium Titanate (LTO), Beta Barium Borate (BBO), Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), and Indium phosphide (InP). The performance of each EO crystal, including optical and radio frequency (RF) loss, applied voltage, and modulation bandwidth, was estimated and compared. The results suggested that, in theory, KNB, LTO, BBO, and CdTe have the potential to outperform LNB. However, it should be noted that the loss associated with KNB and LTO is comparable to that of LNB. The findings demonstrated that BBO and CdTe exhibit a modulation bandwidth exceeding 100 GHz and demonstrate the lowest loss among the considered crystals based on the assumed geometry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3daf08490833515f2245700dcdf4cbfca2c80c714b1f9531bf26c5e5e4cab3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
