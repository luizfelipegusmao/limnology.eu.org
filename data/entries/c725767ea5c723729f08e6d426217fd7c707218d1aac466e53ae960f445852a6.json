{"title":"Gut Microbiota a Novel Source of Biomarkers for Immunotherapy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0902/v1","date":1710484411000,"content":"Despite the recent availability of immune checkpoint inhibitors, not all patients affected by Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) benefit from immunotherapy. The reason for this variability relies to a variety of factors which may allow the identification of novel biomarkers. Presently, a variety of biomarkers are under investigation, including the PD1/PDL1 axis, the tumor mutational burden, and the Microbiota. This latter is made by all bacteria and other microorganisms hosted in our body. The gut microbiota is the most represented and has been involved in different physiological and pathological events, including cancer. In this light, it appears that all conditions modifying gut microbiota can influence cancer, its treatment, and its treatment-related toxicities. The aim of this review is to analyze all conditions influencing the gut microbiota and, therefore, affecting response to immunotherapy, iRAEs and their management in NSCLC patients. The investigation of the landscape of these biological events can allow novel insights for optimal management of NSCLC immunotherapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c725767ea5c723729f08e6d426217fd7c707218d1aac466e53ae960f445852a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
