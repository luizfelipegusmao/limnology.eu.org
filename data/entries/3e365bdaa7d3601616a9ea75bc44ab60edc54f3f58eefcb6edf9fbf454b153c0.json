{"title":"Enhancing seniorsâ€™ dental care access: Analyzing the impact of government insurance in Canada","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310928","date":1727186400000,"content":"<p>by Qi Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nA crucial policy question for the government is whether publicly funded insurance programs effectively improve access to care. Using 2015 and 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data, we first estimated the effect of government dental insurance for seniors on promoting regular care access and lowering cost barrier. When controlling for individual heterogeneity, we found that having government coverage is associated with significantly lower probability of reporting avoidance of dental care due to cost compared to having no coverage. This effect is comparable with other types of insurance. However, the impact of the government program on regular access to dental care is modest. Secondly, using a portion of data collected in Alberta, we found that the government plan does not increase the overall coverage rate. Moreover, switching from an employer-based plan to government-provided coverage for seniors reduces the probability of regular access to care and increases the probability of experiencing cost barrier. This finding indicates that without expansion of overall coverage rate, the current government dental program may not be generous enough to offset the negative impact of leaving the employer-based plan.","author":"Qi Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3e365bdaa7d3601616a9ea75bc44ab60edc54f3f58eefcb6edf9fbf454b153c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
