{"title":"Places of Food Acquisition and Food Groups Acquired According to Levels of Food Insecurity in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1727/v1","date":1729607800000,"content":"Food insecurity (FI) is a persistent issue in Brazil, with significant disparities across the country's macroregions. This study investigated food acquisition locations and types of foods purchased at different levels of FI, utilizing data from 57,920 households in the 2017–2018 Brazilian Household Budget Survey. Food acquisition locations were grouped into supermarkets, small markets, fairs/farmers’ markets/public markets, and others. Foods were categorized into 12 groups: rice, beans, vegetables, fruits, red meats, fish, poultry, eggs, milk and dairy products, bread, cookies, and sugary drinks. Supermarkets are the primary source of food in Brazil. However, in the North and Northeast regions, small markets are more frequently used across all levels of FI. Nationally, most food groups are predominantly purchased at supermarkets. Nevertheless, households experiencing moderate or severe FI rely more on small markets for essential items such as rice, beans, and proteins, as well as ultra-processed foods. These findings highlight the need for public policies that improve food access for vulnerable populations and address regional inequalities. Enhancing access and ensuring food security across different regions is essential to promote equitable and healthy diets throughout the country.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c3f4de37bab527e20528da9dec0c6545fdcb226e122c6121ad60db7b75135fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
