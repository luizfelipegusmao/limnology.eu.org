{"title":"Designing of a Brushed DC Motor Driver with a Novel Adaptive Learning Algorithm Suitable for Automotive Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1133/v1","date":1728961266000,"content":"In this study, a stepper driver, which is suitable for use in the automotive industry, designed for general use, capable of adaptive learning in the system in which it will be used, with CAN and Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) communication options, has been designed. This design is made with PIC18F25K22 Micro Controller Unit (MCU). Rotor speed, armature current, and terminal voltage can be measured on the proposed brushed DC motor drive system. It gives the desired response by evaluating the obstacle and high current situations. The speed measurement of the vehicle and the open and closed status of the automatic door can be monitored. Main contribution of the designed PCB is Adaptive Learning Algorithm (ALA) which uses pulses of the encoder and estimates position of the step and manage operation process to prevent mechanical damage at final point of the motor. On the other hand, unexpected hitting and pinching can be kept under control by watching current value. Beneficial side of this method is that life of the mechanical step increases due to management of the forward and backward operation of the step and prevents potential accidents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54a6d35ff20dd3ff88b559ff3ea10d8d7d338956e7e8961894c47318e8123bc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
