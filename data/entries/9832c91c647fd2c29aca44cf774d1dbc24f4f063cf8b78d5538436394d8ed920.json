{"title":"Evaluation of Epidemiological and Pathological Features of Symptomatic Spinal Metastases in Romania&mdash;What Could We Learn from a Retrospective Study?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0995/v1","date":1718348048000,"content":"Background and Objectives: Metastases are the most common tumors of the spine. As an important increase in the annual incidence of spinal metastases (SM) has been observed in the last decade, the aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and histopathological types of SM surgically treated in the neurosurgery clinics of a regional hospital in North-Eastern Romania over a period of 5 years, in order to define a certain tumor profile that would benefit from an early screening. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 115 adult patients, searching for demographic data (gender and age of the patients), primary tumor characteristics (location and histological type), topography and histopathological type of the spinal metastasis, and the time interval between the diagnosis of the primary tumor and the surgery for the spinal metastasis. Results: The patients were elderly (average age = 58.96 years), with a male predominance (67.82%). Main location of SM was in thoracic region (44.34%), with multiple vertebral metastases in 30.43% patients. Only 33.04% of the patients had a known cancer at the time of admission. Primary tumor was located mainly in lung (47.82%), gastrointestinal tract (15.65%), breast (11.30%), prostate (10.43%) and kidney (9.56%). SM from lung cancer mostly expressed squamous cell carcinoma (19.13%), and those from the digestive system mostly exhibited a moderately/poor colorectal adenocarcinoma (8.69%). Conclusions: Our data suggest the need for close surveillance of patients diagnosed with lung cancer and colorectal cancer because these malignancies most frequently develop spinal metastases. Smoking prevention actions and screening programs for the detection and removal of precancerous colorectal lesions must be developed and expanded.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9832c91c647fd2c29aca44cf774d1dbc24f4f063cf8b78d5538436394d8ed920","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
