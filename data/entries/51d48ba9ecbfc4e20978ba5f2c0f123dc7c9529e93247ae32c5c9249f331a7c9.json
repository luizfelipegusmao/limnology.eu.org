{"title":"Effect of ten different physical parameters on solar still productivity: Theoretical modeling","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14416?af=R","date":1716209659000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Solar distillation using solar stills is widely recognized as a clean and cost-effective method for producing freshwater. However, due to its straightforward design, solar still performance is greatly influenced by various physical characteristics. Many researches have evaluated solar still parameters, while only a few articles have concerned physical ones. Therefore, this article aims to investigate the effect of different physical parameters on solar still productivity through thermal modeling. The theoretical results were validated with those of a previous experimental model, showing a good agreement with each other. The results reveal that daily productivity experiences significant improvement with an increase in plate emissivity or insulation thickness. Conversely, an increase in water mass, glass absorptivity or insulation thermal conductivity leads to a substantial reduction in productivity. Notably, water transmissivity and plate absorptivity do not affect productivity. Modest enhancements in productivity can be achieved by reducing the effective emissivity between water and glass. While the initial temperature of water has a minor impact on productivity at low water mass, it exhibits a substantial improvement effect at high water mass. These results can be a good guidance for the designers and manufacturers to develop more efficient designs that maximize the production of clean water.</p>","author":"Adil A. M.
