{"title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Restricted Access Window in IEEE 802.11ah MAC Layer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0067/v1","date":1711966884000,"content":"The IEEE 802.11ah standard is introduced to address the growing scale of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. To reduce contention and enhance energy efficiency within the system, the restricted access window (RAW) mechanism is introduced at the medium access control (MAC) layer to manage the significant number of stations accessing the network. However, the RAW parameters need to be appropriately determined to achieve optimal network performance. In this paper, we optimize the configuration of RAW parameters in the IEEE 802.11ah-based IoT network. We analyze and propose an RAW parameters optimization problem with the objective of improving network throughput and formulate it as a Markov decision process. To cope with the complex and dynamic network conditions, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to find the optimal RAW parameters. We construct network environments with periodic and random traffic in the NS-3 simulator to validate the performance of the proposed PPO-based RAW parameters optimization algorithm. Simulation results reveal that using the PPO-based DRL algorithm, optimal RAW parameters can be obtained under different network conditions, thereby significantly improving network throughput.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f93e8a01d954c51acc645a9e5c8a592c00adfdf00fa9b928953a5f7947ff3b4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
