{"title":"Automatic Assist Level Adjustment Function of a Gait Exercise Rehabilitation Robot with Functional Electrical Stimulation for Spinal Cord Injury","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0968/v1","date":1726112320000,"content":"This study aimed to identify whether the combined use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) reduces the motor torque of a gait exercise rehabilitation robot in spinal cord injury (SCI) and to verify the effectiveness of the developed automatic assist level adjustment in people with paraplegia. Acute and chronic SCI patients (1 case each) performed 10 min of gait exercises with and without FES using a rehabilitation robot. Reinforcement learning was used to adjust the assist level automatically. The maximum torque values and assist levels for each of the ten walking cycles when walking became steady were averaged and compared with and without FES. The motor's output torque and the assist level were measured as outcomes. The assist level adjustment allowed both the motor torque and assist level to decrease gradually to a steady state. The motor torque and the assist levels were significantly lower with the FES than without the FES under steady conditions in both cases. No adverse events were reported. The combined use of FES attenuated the motor torque of a gait exercise rehabilitation robot for SCI. Automatic assistive level adjustment is also useful for spinal cord injuries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a9019a5440eb619dd07a2ef3f478ceae0ae477c579b342f578a61131a6858b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
