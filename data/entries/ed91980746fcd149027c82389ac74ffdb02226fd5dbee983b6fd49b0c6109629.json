{"title":"The Impacts of Changing Winter Warm Spells on Snow Ablation Over Western North America","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034492?af=R","date":1715090963000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>An increase in winter air temperature can amplify snowmelt and sublimation in mountain regions with implications to water resources and ecological systems. Winter Warm Spells (WWS) are defined as a winter period (December to February, DJF) of at least 3 consecutive days with daily maximum temperature anomaly above the 90th percentile (using a moving-average of 15 days between 2001 and 2013). We calculate WWS for every 4-km grid cell within an atmospheric model over western North America to characterize WWS and analyze snow ablation and their changes in a warmer climate. We find that days with ablation during WWS represent a small fraction of winter days (0.6 days), however, 49% of total winter ablation (33.4 mm/DJF) occurs during WWS. Greater extreme ablation rates (99th percentile) occur 18% more frequently during WWS than during non-WWS days. Ablation rates during WWS in humid regions are larger (9 mm d<sup>−1</sup>) than in dry regions (7 mm d<sup>−1</sup>) in a warmer climate, which can be explained by differences in the energy balance and the snowpack's cold content. We find that warmer (0.8°C), longer (1.8 days) and more frequent (3.7 more events) WWS increase total winter ablation (on average 109% or 18 mm/DJF) in a warmer climate. Winter melt during WWS in warm and humid places is expected to increase about 3 times more than in the cold and dry region. This study provides a comprehensive description of WWS and their impact on snowpack dynamics, which is relevant to reservoir operations and water security.</p>","author":"Lucia Scaff, \nSebastian A.
