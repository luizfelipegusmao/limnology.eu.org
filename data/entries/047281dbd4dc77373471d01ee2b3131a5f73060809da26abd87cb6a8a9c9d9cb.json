{"title":"Clarification of the Boundaries of Lands of Historical and Cultural Heritage and Determination of Their Protection Zones by Remote Sensing Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1863/v1","date":1714376165000,"content":"Determining precise boundaries and protective zones for historical and cultural objects enables their effective preservation. This is particularly crucial in the face of increasing tourism, urbanization, and natural disasters. Accurately defining boundaries and protective zones can aid in the planning of scientific research, archaeological excavations, and other studies aimed at exploring the history and cultural significance of these objects. The article presents the framework for establishing protective zones around historical and cultural heritage sites existing in Ukraine, using the example of the Citadel defensive complex located in Lviv (Ukraine). It proposes general and detailed conceptual models for the combined application of remote and non-invasive methods for investigating historical and cultural heritage sites. This conceptual article introduces the theory of integrating radar satellite imaging with ground-based georadar imaging. Additionally, it presents a software module that has been developed to analyze collected data on two-dimensional historical and cultural heritage objects, refine their boundaries, and establish protective zones around them.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"047281dbd4dc77373471d01ee2b3131a5f73060809da26abd87cb6a8a9c9d9cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
