{"title":"Revisiting the role of ascorbate oxidase in plant systems","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/9/2740/7609141?rss=1","date":1708041600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ascorbic acid (AsA) plays an indispensable role in plants, serving as both an antioxidant and a master regulator of the cellular redox balance. Ascorbate oxidase (AO) is a blue copper oxidase that is responsible for the oxidation of AsA with the concomitant production of water. For many decades, AO was erroneously postulated as an enzyme without any obvious advantage, as it decreases the AsA pool size and thus is expected to weaken plant stress resistance. It was only a decade ago that this perspective shifted towards the fundamental role of AO in orchestrating both AsA and oxygen levels by influencing the overall redox balance in the extracellular matrix. Consistent with its localization in the apoplast, AO is involved in cell expansion, division, resource allocation, and overall plant yield. An increasing number of transgenic studies has demonstrated that AO can also facilitate communication between the surrounding environment and the cell, as its gene expression is highly responsive to factors such as hormonal signaling, oxidative stress, and mechanical injury. This review aims to describe the multiple functions of AO in plant growth, development, and stress resilience, and explore any additional roles the enzyme might have in fruits during the course of ripening.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8cc0017b8d14b9b5905d42a77eac54f3d529509133c3a3f15504895ccb08ec20","category":"Environment"}
