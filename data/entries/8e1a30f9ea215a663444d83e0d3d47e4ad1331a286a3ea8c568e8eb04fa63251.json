{"title":"Molecular Characterization of Hepatitis B Virus in People Living With HIV in Rural and Peri-Urban Communities in Botswana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0322/v1","date":1717645565000,"content":"(1) Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) sequencing data are important for monitoring HBV evolution. We aimed to molecularly characterize HBV sequences from participants with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg+) positive serology and occult hepatitis B infection (OBI+). (2) Methods: We utilized archived plasma samples from a cohort of people living with (PLWH) in Botswana. HBV DNA was sequenced, genotyped and analyzed for mutations. We compared mutations from study sequences to those from previously generated HBV sequences in Botswana. The impact of OBI-associated mutations on protein function was assessed using the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer. (3) Results: Sequencing success was higher in HBsAg+ than OBI+ samples [86/128 (67.2%) vs 21/71 (29.2%)]. Overall, 93.5% (100/107) sequences were genotype A1, 2.8% (3/107) were D3 and 3.7% (4/107) were E. We identified 13 escape mutations in 18/90 (20%) sequences with HBsAg coverage, with K122R having the highest frequency. The mutational profile of current sequences differed from previous Botswana HBV sequences, suggesting possible mutational changes over-time. Mutations deemed to have an impact on protein function were tpQ6H, surfaceV194A and preCW28L. (4) Conclusions: We characterized HBV sequences from PLWH in Botswana. Escape mutations were prevalent and were not associated with OBI. Longitudinal HBV studies are needed to investigate HBV natural evolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e1a30f9ea215a663444d83e0d3d47e4ad1331a286a3ea8c568e8eb04fa63251","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
