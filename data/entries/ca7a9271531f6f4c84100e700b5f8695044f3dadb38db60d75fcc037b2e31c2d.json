{"title":"Effects of instant controlled pressure drop treatment combined with refractance window drying on infusion quality of made green tea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13477?af=R","date":1712222050000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The study aimed to determine the effects of instant controlled decompression of steam pressure, termed as ICPD (instant controlled pressure drop) on fresh tea leaves, when combined with refractance window drying (RWD) of rolled green teas during green tea manufacturing. The ICPD steam treatment pressure (TP; 0.1–0.3 MPa), treatment time (TT; 10–20 s) and refractance window drying temperature (RWDT; 70–90 °C) were used as the processing parameters for manufacturing of green tea.</p>\n<h2>RESULT</h2>\n<p>Response surface methodology was employed to enumerate the effects of ICPD process conditions and temperature of RWD on total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity of the green tea infusion. An optimum condition for green tea processing was found at TP 0.2 MPa, TT 20 s with RWDT at 70 °C. In comparison to made green tea manufactured without ICPD treatment, the ICPD treated green tea showed enhanced TPC, TFC and DPPH radical scavenging activity along with better colour and sensory attributes. The microstructural study of ICPD treated green tea samples showed more deformed cell surface integrity, larger stomatal pore size and cracks at the leaf surface in comparison with non-treated green tea sample.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Present study reveals that an ICPD treatment at 0.2 MPa for 20 s can be used as an alternative to the traditional enzyme inactivation step of hot water treatment, for green tea leaves to improve the infusion quality in terms of increased levels of TPC and TFC and DPPH radical scavenging activity. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tridisha Bordoloi, \nManuj Kumar Hazarika","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ca7a9271531f6f4c84100e700b5f8695044f3dadb38db60d75fcc037b2e31c2d","category":"Environment"}
