{"title":"Effect of Calcium Silicate-Based Intracanal Medicament and Calcium Hydroxide on Growth Factor TGF-β1 Release from Root Canal Dentine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1315/v1","date":1711026369000,"content":"This study evaluated the effect of newly introduced calcium silicate-based temporary intracanal medicament Bio-C Temp and calcium hydroxide-based material UltraCal XS on the release of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) from root canal dentin. Twenty-two intact and fully developed human premolars from patients aged 15 – 18 were shaped and irrigated according to the current clinical recommendations. The teeth were then gently split in half, and the root canal dentin of paired samples was covered with Bio-C Temp or UltraCal XS. After 3 weeks of incubation, the specimens were conditioned with 17% EDTA and the collected solution was subjected to quantification of released TGF-β1 by performing ELISA. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s test, was selected to determine the statistically significant differences between the groups at the 0.95 confidence level. The highest mean value of released TGF-β1 (1993.1 pg/ml) was detected in the control group, where root canal dentin was conditioned with 17% EDTA alone. Regarding experimental groups, Bio-C Temp released a statistically significant higher amount of TGF-β1 (282.14 pg/ml) compared to UltraCal XS (114.28 pg/ml; p = 0.0158). Bio-C Temp affected the release of growth factors from root canal dentin less than UltraCal XS and may therefore serve as an intracanal medicament for regenerative endodontic procedures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be976b849e0655b06a30f345f90ec6cbf1228b8432ba81a0894f9ebd7b0e4dba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
