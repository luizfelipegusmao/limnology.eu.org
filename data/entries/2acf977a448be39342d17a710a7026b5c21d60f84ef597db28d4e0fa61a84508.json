{"title":"Success Factors for Returnee Migrant Entrepreneurs in Ethiopia: The Mediating Role of Government Policies and Institutional Support","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2144/v1","date":1721991950000,"content":"In recent years, Ethiopia's number of returnee entrepreneurs has increased dramatically, significantly contributing to personal financial achievement and the nation's economic development and transformation. However, their businesses are typically smaller and less profitable than non-migrant entrepreneurs. This study explores factors affecting the success of these returnee migrant entrepreneurs, including individual characteristics, entrepreneurial skills, and experience, financial resources, as well as the mediating role of government policies and institutional support. Data was collected from 390 returnee migrants who started their businesses and analyzed using a robust theoretical foundation and PLS-SEM to understand the impact of success factors. The results show that entrepreneurial skills, experience, and financial resources positively and significantly influence the success of returnee migrant entrepreneurs. Furthermore, social networks, while not directly significantly influencing the entrepreneurial success of returnee migrants are mediated by government policies and institutional support. Professional guidance and counseling provided by experts and mentors of the accelerator program were found to be essential for entrepreneurial success but did not improve the effectiveness of the policy. Financial resources, although crucial, did not significantly impact policy efficacy. These findings underscore the need for tailored policy interventions addressing the challenges faced by returnee migrants, including economic self-sufficiency, socio-psychological support, and effective social networks to boost the success of returnee migrants. Experienced returnee entrepreneurs play a key role in developing a vigorous and supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem through community engagement and policy advocacy. Additionally, personal traits are crucial for entrepreneurial success, while practical experience influences government policies for substantiated policy development in returnee migrant entrepreneurship and its benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2acf977a448be39342d17a710a7026b5c21d60f84ef597db28d4e0fa61a84508","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
