{"title":"Hindcasted Body Temperatures Reveal Underestimated Thermal Stress Faced by Intertidal Species","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13908?af=R","date":1729138271000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>As global climate changes, there is a clear mismatch between the temporal and spatial characteristics of body temperature and environmental temperature, confounding the assessment of thermal stress for organisms in many ecological studies. Here, we hindcast the hourly body temperatures of intertidal molluscs to explore the differences between them and environmental temperatures (air and water temperatures) in multiple metrics of thermal stress.</p>\n<h2>Location</h2>\n<p>Intertidal shores in East Asia (0°–45°N, 100°E–140°E).</p>\n<h2>Time Period</h2>\n<p>40 years, 1980 to 2019.</p>\n<h2>Major Taxa Studied</h2>\n<p>Mollusca.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>We collected habitat zonation data and measured the morphological characteristics of 25 intertidal molluscs living in East Asia. For three different types of intertidal molluscs (i.e., bivalves, limpets and snails), we built corresponding heat budget models (HBMs) to hindcast the hourly body temperatures from 1980 to 2019. We analysed the thermal stress of intertidal species faced in three metrics, annual extreme high temperatures (<i>T</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>99</i>\n</sub>), seasonal daily maximum temperatures (DMT) and heatwaves, and compared them with environmental temperatures.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We found that <i>T</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>99</i>\n</sub> of body temperatures and their interannual warming rates are significantly higher than those of environmental temperatures. Moreover, there were non-negligible mismatches between the seasonal thermal pattern and heatwaves of body temperatures and environmental temperatures, suggesting that the deleterious impacts of global warming on intertidal species are underestimated and cannot be directly revealed by environmental temperatures.</p>\n<h2>Main Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Thermal stress patterns of body temperature were significantly different from those of environmental temperature, and the thermal stress faced by intertidal species had been persistently underestimated. These results emphasise that body temperature should be used as the appropriate metric for evaluating and predicting the impacts of global warming and weather extremes in the intertidal biological system.</p>","author":"Lin‐Xuan Ma, \nJie Wang, \nMark W.
