It contains a full suite of capabilities, including the ability to steal private data and download and execute new malicious files.</p>\n<p>Dubbed JokerSpy, the malware is written in the Python programming language and makes use of an open-source tool known as <a href=\"https://github.com/cedowens/SwiftBelt\">SwiftBelt</a>, which is designed for legitimate security professionals to test their networks for vulnerabilities. JokerSpy first came to light earlier this month in <a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/fragments-of-cross-platform-backdoor-hint-at-larger-mac-os-attack/\">this post</a> from security firm Bitdefender. Researchers for the company said they identified Windows and Linux components, suggesting that versions exist for those platforms as well.</p>\n<p>Five days later, researchers for security firm Elastic <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/inital-research-of-jokerspy\">reported</a> that the diagnostic endpoint protection tool they sell had detected xcc, a binary file that’s part of JokerSpy. Elastic didn’t identify the victim other than to say it was a “prominent Japanese cryptocurrency exchange.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950160#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950160&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05ef9cadbef2ea62f468fbfd112934b893edcd695e8e700a150bf145d882d9e1","category":"Tech"}
