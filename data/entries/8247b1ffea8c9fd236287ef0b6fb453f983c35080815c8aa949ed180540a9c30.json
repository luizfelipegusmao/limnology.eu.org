{"title":"Can Suttonella ornithocola entail a potential hazard to songbirds? A systematic review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10344-024-01785-4","date":1709856000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Passeriformes populations have experienced a marked decline in number during the last decades. Several infectious agents have been described as key factors for this populationâ€™s decrease, as they can cause mortal diseases like the recently reported <em>Suttonella ornithocola</em>. <em>S. ornithocola</em> is a bacterium from the Cardiobacteriaceae family that has been linked to several outbreaks. This systematic review aims to collect all the scientific information available about <em>S. ornithocola</em> to better understand its epidemiology and pathogenesis and to assess the potential hazard that it can pose to garden songbirds. Although it has been considered a respiratory pathogen, <em>S. ornithocola</em> has been isolated from several organs, suggesting a systemic pathogenesis. However, it has also been described as a normal taxon from the microbiota of some bird species. Therefore, further studies in healthy birds are necessary to establish if <em>S. ornithocola</em> is a primary pathogen or an opportunistic bacterium in songbirds.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"8247b1ffea8c9fd236287ef0b6fb453f983c35080815c8aa949ed180540a9c30","category":"Environment"}
