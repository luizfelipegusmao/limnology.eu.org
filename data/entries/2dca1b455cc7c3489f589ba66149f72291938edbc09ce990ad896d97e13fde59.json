{"title":"Exploring Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Comparative Study of Traditional Classifiers and Deep Learning Techniques to Analyze Functional Connectivity Measures from a Multicentric Dataset","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0867/v1","date":1720611321000,"content":"Investigation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with machine learning (ML) techniques, including also deep learning (DL) methods, have been widely used to study Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This disorder is characterized by symptoms that affect the individualâ€™s behavioral aspects and social relationships. Early diagnosis is crucial for intervention, but the complexity of ASD poses challenges for treatment development. This study compares traditional ML techniques with deep learning (DL) methods in the analysis of functional connectivity measures obtained from the time series of multicentric ABIDE dataset. Specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers, with both linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels, as well as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers, are compared against the TabNet classifier, which is a DL architecture customized for tabular data analysis and a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). The findings suggest that DL classifiers may not be optimal for the type of data analyzed, as their performance trails behind that of standard classifiers. SVMs achieve performances, in terms of AUC, around 75%, compared to the best TabNet and MLP results, which are 65% and 71%, respectively. Additionally, this work investigates the brain regions that contribute most to the classification task, which are found to be those primarily responsible for sensory and spatial perception, as well as attention modulation, known to be altered in ASD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dca1b455cc7c3489f589ba66149f72291938edbc09ce990ad896d97e13fde59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
