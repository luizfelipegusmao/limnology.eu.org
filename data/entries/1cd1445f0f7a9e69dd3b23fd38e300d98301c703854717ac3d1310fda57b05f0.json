{"title":"PSV-22 Effects of corn silage particle size on eating behavior, performance, and carcass traits in finishing beef heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/559/7757588?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The potential for increasing the theoretical cut length (TCL) in corn silage has gained wide acceptance in the last decades, especially in dairy cattle diets. However, there is scarce knowledge on this topic in beef finishing diets. The hypothesis of this study was that rations of longer particle size would result in greater chewing activity and performance. Thus, our objective was to determine the effect of feeding corn silage of two particle sizes on eating behavior, blood parameters, fecal characteristics, and performance in beef heifers. A single cornfield was harvested in alternating strips to maintain similar conditions for treatments. Corn hybrid was harvested at 37.9 ± 1.6 % DM using a self-propelled forage harvester (Claas Jaguar 870 equipped with an orbis 600 head) set at 13 mm TCL and designated “conventional” particle size (CPS) or 24 mm TLC and designated “long” particle size (LPS). Roll gap of 2 mm was adopted for both TLC. The CPS and LPS had 9.56 ± 4.6% and 35.1 ± 4.8% of particles retained on the top screen (19 mm). The kernel processing score were 73.9 and 72.8% for CPS and LPS, respectively. Single-sourced Nellore heifers [n = 96; initial shrunk body weight (BW) = 248.3 ± 36.3 kg] were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments (3 heifers per pen; 16 pen replicates per treatment). Treatments consisted of a finishing diet containing CPS or LPS. The diet was formulated using NASEM (2016) to provide an average daily gain (ADG) of 1.3 kg/d [19.5 % of corn silage, 39.1 % of high moisture corn (HMC), 26.3% of ground corn, 7.1 % of cotton meal, 3.95% of soybean meal, 0.85 % of urea, and 3.2 % of mineral mix; dry matter (DM) basis]. Heifers were adapted to the finishing diet over a 15-d period and fed for a total of 101 d. Feeding behavior was assessed on d 47 and 69. Fecal samples were collected on d 58 and 78. Ultrasound fat thickness and ribeye area, and blood samples were assessed on the day of shipping to slaughter. Statistical analysis of experimental data was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4 and an α of 0.05 determined significance. No differences were obtained for initial BW, final BW, ADG, dressing, hot carcass, and carcass traits. Heifers consuming LPS had greater DM intake (2.59% of BW) than CPS diet (2.50% of BW). No effects were found for feed efficiency (gain to feed; G:F). Fecal characteristics (DM, starch, NDF, N, pH, and scoring) were not different between treatments. Regarding blood parameters, no differences were observed for creatine phosphokinase, γ-glutamyltransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Overall, corn silage with longer particle size fed to finishing heifers does not appreciably influence chewing, daily gain, or carcass parameters.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1cd1445f0f7a9e69dd3b23fd38e300d98301c703854717ac3d1310fda57b05f0","category":"Environment"}
