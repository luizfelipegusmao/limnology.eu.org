More recently, scientists have begun to harness the self-assembly of these molecules to develop new biomimetic materials with applications in health, energy, and environment. However, creating two-dimensional (2D) protein architectures at solid-liquid interfaces in a pre-designed manner is still highly challenging. The energy landscape arising from the interplay between protein-protein and protein-surface interactions can determine the dynamics and final organization of proteins at solid-liquid interfaces but remains unclear. To explore how the energy landscape responds to solution conditions and environmental stimuli at solid-liquid interfaces, <span>in-situ</span> characterization with high temporal and spatial resolution, in combination with statistical analysis, is required.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e3534ece5cf97f36cddb06d525fe57af99ce9cc4cc3464003448b2a550df2005","category":"Environment"}
