{"title":"Wood in Modern Construction: A Scientometric Examination of Sustainable Trends","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1100/v1","date":1726282013000,"content":"The context of this research is given by a socio-economic situation in which new and more demanding challenges appear. Using wood, a naturally occurring, renewable, and biodegradable material, in construction is becoming more and more necessary due to the awareness of the negative impact on the environment of the construction industry and the energy crisis limitations. The purpose of this study is to analyze what do we really know about the use of wood as a building material. The search for an answer to the research question implies the use of a scientometric literature analysis, followed by an in-depth and expert analysis. The research results indicate a major preoccupation for studying engineering wood structures, like the Cross laminated Timber, the structural behaviour of the structures, the implementation of new IT discoveries in wood construction technology and a more recent approach regarding the environmental impact of wood construction, mostly the possibility of using wood waste to prolong the life of wood as a building material. The results also show a need to create new models of understanding the structural behaviour of wood that consider the fibrous and cellular nature of the material. Wood as a construction material is an extremely complex material and for a better understanding of it, there is a need to have an interdisciplinary approach in which to combine the knowledge of construction with that of forestry, ecology, biology and others.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90930037493fc96d05098f64e7319c38f9d2a82aa401be9cc497cedb15ea4244","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
