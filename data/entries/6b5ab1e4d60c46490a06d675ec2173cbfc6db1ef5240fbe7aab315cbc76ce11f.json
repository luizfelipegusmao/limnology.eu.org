{"title":"Some Recent Advances on Germanium Recovery from Various Resources","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1197/v1","date":1713441869000,"content":"Though nowadays germanium do not reach the range of popularity than other metals, i.e. rare earth elements, its utility in target industries makes of it also a strategic metal. Though germanium can be find in a series of raw materials, the principal source for its recovery is from secondary wastes of the zinc industry, and also, the recycle of germanium-bearing waste materials is becoming of interest. In this recovery, Hydrometallurgy is performing a key role to the successful achievement of this goal. The present work reviews the most recent applications (2023 and 2024 years) of hydrometallurgical operations on the recovery of germanium from different solid and liquid sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b5ab1e4d60c46490a06d675ec2173cbfc6db1ef5240fbe7aab315cbc76ce11f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
