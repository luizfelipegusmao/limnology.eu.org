{"title":"Title Application of Different Echocardiographic Parameters in Sepsis-induced Cardiomyopathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1633/v1","date":1721634181000,"content":"Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) may be defined as a non-ischemic cardiac dysfunction associated with sepsis. SICM is characterized by a decrease in left ventricular contractility, ultimately associated with left ventricular dilation, with or without right ventricular dysfunction. Echocardiography stands as the current gold standard in diagnosis of SICM. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most frequently utilized parameter for evaluating left ventricular systolic function, but some traditional parameters, including LVEF, are dependent on cardiac preload and afterload, limiting their clinical application. Advanced echocardiography techniques, such as speckle-tracking analysis, have the potential to diagnose and evaluate myocardial dysfunction even in the early phases of sepsis, facilitating risk stratification for proactive personalized treatment of patients. This article reviews the progress in the application of various echocardiographic parameters in SICM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8adbe81415dad1559a349fe22085ce47b0d50ba5c906963fecee8f2bf698c9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
