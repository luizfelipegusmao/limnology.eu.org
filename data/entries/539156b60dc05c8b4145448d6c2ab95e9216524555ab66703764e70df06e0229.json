{"title":"Keyword Co-Occurrence Analysis Using the FPGrowth Algorithm. An Example of Energies Journal Bibliometric Data for 2023-2024","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1380/v1","date":1718890667000,"content":"Background. Keyword co-occurrence analysis is a crucial tool for comprehending research trends, identifying relevant studies, and gaining insight into the connections between various concepts and topics. Objective. This study focuses on analyzing the co-occurrence of keywords using FP-growth algorithm and direct search methods. Materials and methods. The methodology involved extracting bibliometric data of Energies journal for 2023-2024 from MDPI publisher platform, keyword lemmatization and keyword co-occurrence estimation. Clustering and visualization were performed using Multidendrograms and Scimago Graphica software. Results. The results showed that the FP-growth algorithm can achieve a close match with the direct search results, which facilitates data preparation for clustering. In addition, finding the co-occurrence of three or more keywords significantly reduced the number of possible combinations, which allowed the identification of specific research topics. Conclusions. This study highlights the usefulness of the FP-growth algorithm in keyword analysis and provides insights into ways to refine search queries to abstract databases for the purpose of designing and writing literature and systematic reviews.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"539156b60dc05c8b4145448d6c2ab95e9216524555ab66703764e70df06e0229","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
