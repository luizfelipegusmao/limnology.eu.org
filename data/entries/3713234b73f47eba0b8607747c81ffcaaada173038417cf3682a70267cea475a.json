{"title":"Exploring the relationship between EFL students’ writing performance and activity theory related influencing factors in the blended learning context","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305668","date":1718632800000,"content":"<p>by Yuling Wang, Shaidatul Akma Binti Adi Kasuma, Salasiah Binti Che Lah, Qi Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nWith the rapid development of technologies, blended learning is widespread in English writing instruction. The effect of blended learning on EFL writing outcomes is affected by various factors. This study examines the relationship between EFL students’ writing performance and influencing factors and the relationship between these factors in a blended learning context based on the Activity Theory. The study used a quantitative method: English argumentative writing tests and questionnaires with 33 undergraduates. The results reveal that EFL students’ argumentative writing performance is significantly and positively correlated with five influencing factors, in descending order of correlation: subject, community, object, rules, and division of labor. Moreover, the findings suggest a significant positive relationship within each factor in the blended learning environment, except for no relationship between rules and division of labor. Furthermore, the research provides useful references and insights for further research and educational practice in blended writing instruction. Due to limitations such as the relatively small sample size, the focus on argumentative writing, and the reliance on quantitative data, this study gives the impression that the results only represent a portion of the population and situation. Therefore, future research could consider enlarging the sample size, adopting a more comprehensive range of writing genres, involving qualitative methods, or expanding the scope of research on the impact of BL on other disciplines.","author":"Yuling Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3713234b73f47eba0b8607747c81ffcaaada173038417cf3682a70267cea475a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
