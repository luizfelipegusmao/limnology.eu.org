An investigation using word association, hedonic scales and rate‐all‐that‐apply","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13964?af=R","date":1728718771000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Flavour, texture, and extended shelf life are key quality traits for blueberries. Studies have used trained panelists and texture analysers to evaluate frozen blueberries. However, more studies are needed to investigate consumer perception and acceptance of frozen blueberries' texture. This study used word association, hedonic scales, and rate-all-that-apply to evaluate how consumers perceive the texture of frozen blueberries.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Consumers were interested in the firmness of frozen blueberries, as well as crunchiness, softness, juiciness, and smoothness. They also identified the textural descriptors mushy, tough, chewy, squishy, and mealy. The participants separated the wild blueberries from the cultivated blueberries when evaluating their liking. Textural attributes were correlated with the consumers' overall liking (juicy, firm, crunchy, smooth positively and mushy, tough, squishy negatively).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study identified which textural attributes influence consumers' liking of frozen blueberries. Consumers preferred frozen blueberries that were firm, juicy and crunchy. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Rachael Moss, \nAllison Stright, \nLaura Baxter, \nMatthew B McSweeney","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"18bd4fe78dc6e62342f5e0120e9a5cc65f2c7640d1504300ddbb81c624792270","category":"Environment"}
