{"title":"Developing interconnectedness is critical in retaining rural general practitioners: A qualitative thematic analysis of recently recruited general practitioners to South East New South Wales, Australia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0002860","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Sarath Burgis-Kasthala, Suzanne Bain-Donohue, Ellen Tailby, Kathryn Stonestreet, Malcolm Moore</p>\r\n\r\nAustralia, in common with many countries globally, has a shortage of doctors working rurally. Whilst strategies and current research focus on recruitment, attrition from rural practice is a significant determinant of such shortages. Understanding doctors’ decisions to stay or leave, once recruited, may provide further insights on how to address this rural differential. This study comprises a qualitative study of 21 recently recruited nationally-trained doctors and international medical graduates to a rural area of New South Wales, Australia. Interviews focused on their experiences prior to and within rural practice, and how these influenced their future career intentions. We used reflexive thematic analysis with each interview coded by two researchers to build an explanatory framework. Our findings comprise five themes which applied differentially to nationally-trained doctors and international medical graduates: connectedness across professional, personal and geographic domains, how multi-faceted connectedness was, and dissonance between participants’ expectations and experiences. Amongst nationally-trained doctors, connectedness stemmed from prior rural experiences which engendered expectations founded upon their ability to develop community-level relationships. Experiences were mixed; some described difficulties maintaining a boundary between their personal and professional lives, which encroached upon their ability to embed within the community. International medical graduates’ expectations were cultivated by their pre-conceptions of Australian postgraduate training but they lamented a lack of professional opportunities once in practice. Moreover, they described a lack of professional relationships with local, nationally-trained, doctors that could help them embed into rural practice. This study highlighted that when connectedness occurs across professional, geographic and personal domains doctors are more likely to continue rural practice, whilst illustrating how the importance of each domain may differ amongst different cadres of doctor. Supporting such cadres develop supportive interrelationships may be a low hanging fruit to maximise retention.","author":"Sarath Burgis-Kasthala","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c44ec53e2894ee0f1f3ca9de0fb7fc49c9d79919705e7b618c03217f6fec10a7","category":"Environment"}
