{"title":"Time-to-event surrogate endpoint validation using mediation analysis and meta-analytic data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/1/98/6832427?rss=1","date":1668729600000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>With the ongoing development of treatments and the resulting increase in survival in oncology, clinical trials based on endpoints such as overall survival may require long follow-up periods to observe sufficient events and ensure adequate statistical power. This increase in follow-up time may compromise the feasibility of the study. The use of surrogate endpoints instead of final endpoints may be attractive for these studies. However, before a surrogate can be used in a clinical trial, it must be statistically validated. In this article, we propose an approach to validate surrogates when both the surrogate and final endpoints are censored event times. This approach is developed for meta-analytic data and uses a mediation analysis to decompose the total effect of the treatment on the final endpoint as a direct effect and an indirect effect through the surrogate. The meta-analytic nature of the data is accounted for in a joint model with random effects at the trial level. The proportion of the indirect effect over the total effect of the treatment on the final endpoint can be computed from the parameters of the model and used as a measure of surrogacy. We applied this method to investigate time-to-relapse as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival in resectable gastric cancer.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"74fdc21b6607df158c4af699d2471e18209027dfdee0a8142395e29da58b359d","category":"Environment"}
