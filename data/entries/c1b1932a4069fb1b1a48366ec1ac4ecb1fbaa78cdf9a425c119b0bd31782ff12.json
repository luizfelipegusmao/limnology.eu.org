The method considers two options for the treatment of long series, considering possible variability in the seasonal phases. The method also proposes a bootstrap scheme to deal approximately with series shorter than one period of the seasonal signal. Tests with synthetic data show that the method gives quite acceptable results, so that results from application to real data, although approximate, should be useful considering the inherent uncertainties in the data.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"c1b1932a4069fb1b1a48366ec1ac4ecb1fbaa78cdf9a425c119b0bd31782ff12","category":"Environment"}
