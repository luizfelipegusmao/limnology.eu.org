{"title":"Mechanically homogenized expanded graphite/ cobalt(II) rhenate(VII) â€“ Co(ReO4)2, as electrodes in hybrid symmetric supercapacitors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0969/v1","date":1718355890000,"content":"Mechanically homogenized composite of expanded graphite and cobalt(II) rhenate(VII) has been described. Cobalt(II) rhenate(VII) was obtained in a reaction of perrhenic acid with cobalt(II) nitrate. A simple mortar homogenization method was used to enhance intercalation of cobalt species within carbon matrix. The specific capacity of composite was enhanced by 50% in comparison to bare expanded graphite. The electrochemical characteristic was significantly improved including better cyclability, lower resistance of electrode material, lower iR drop, with respect to expanded graphite without cobalt(II) rhenate(VII) active species. Expanded graphite with its unique specific surface area and pore size diameter was proved as potential and cheap carbon support.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c92738688b30128fbd2e7eb8ba27b4bb6f0e353a353dbcc6b9e48feda08195e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
