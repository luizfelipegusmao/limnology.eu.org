{"title":"Unification:  inflation and dark epochs from multi-field  theory.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1473/v1","date":1718962327000,"content":"A two scalar field model that incorporates non Riemannian Measures of integration  or usually called Two Measures Theory (TMT)  is introduced, in order to unify the early and present universe. In the Einstein frame, a K-essence is generated and as a consequence for the early universe, we can have an Inflation for the very early universe and then, after inflation, an early dark energy period and a late dark energy period for the present universe dark, both dark energy epochs have a consistent generation of dark energy (DE), dark matter (DM) and stiff matter. This is obtained when the  scale invariance is introduced and then is spontaneously broken from the integration of the degrees of freedom associated with the modified measures. The resulting effective potentials and K-essence  in the Einstein frame produce the three flat regions corresponding to the different epochs mentioned before. For the first flat region, we can associate   an inflationary universe.  Also assuming this first plateau, we study the inflation in the framework of the slow-roll approximation. In this scenario under the slow roll approximation, we obtain a linear combination that is a constant. The corresponding cosmological perturbations in our model are determined and we also obtain the different constraints on the parameter-space  from the Planck data.\nThe slow roll approximation can be arranged so that the transition from inflation to the next flat region can be achieved without problems.\nIn the following two flat regions, in addition to the inflation phase, representing the Early Dark Energy and Late Dark Energy Periods, with DE and also the DM,  do not need to be introduced separately, they are instead a result of a K-essence induced by the multi measures, multi field theory. Therefore the scalars generate both the DE and the DM . Also a stiff matter component is automatically generated from the K-essence theory from two scalar fields. From the perturbative analysis associated to the perturbation  solution of background, we find a correlation  between the two scalars. Besides, we obtain that our model during the  \ndark epoch has a behaviour of tracking freezing mode","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cfec5850922b45c838a35d15ab73e791436dd548e2370d1fa3c8f70991ab899","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
