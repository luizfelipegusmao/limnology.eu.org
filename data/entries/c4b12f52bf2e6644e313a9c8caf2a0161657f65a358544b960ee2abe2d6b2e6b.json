{"title":"Enhancing Acute Migraine Treatment: Exploring Solid Lipid Nanoparticles and Nanostructured Lipid Carriers for the Nose-to-Brain Route","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2019/v1","date":1727323056000,"content":"Migraine has a high prevalence worldwide and is one of the main disabling neurological diseases in individuals under the age of 50. In general, treatment includes the use of oral analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for mild attacks, and, for moderate or severe attacks, triptans or 5-hydroxytryptamine/serotonin (5-HT)1B/1D receptor agonists. However, the administration of antimigraine drugs in conventional oral pharmaceutical dosage forms is a challenge, since many molecules have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the brain, which leads to bioavailability problems. Efforts have been made to find alternative delivery systems and/or routes for antimigraine drugs. In vivo studies have shown that it is possible to administer drugs directly into the brain via the intranasal (IN) or the nose-to-brain route, thus avoiding the need for the molecules to cross the BBB. In this field, the use of lipid nanoparticles, in particular solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), has shown promising results, since they have several advantages for drugs administered via the IN route, including increased absorption and reduced enzymatic degradation, improving bioavailability. Furthermore, SLN and NLC are capable of co-encapsulating drugs, promoting their simultaneous delivery to the site of therapeutic action, which can be a promising approach for the acute migraine treatment. This review highlights the potential of using SLN and NLC to improve the treatment of acute migraine via the nose-to-brain route. First sections describe the pathophysiology and the currently available pharmacological treatment for acute migraine, followed by an outline of the mechanisms underlying the nose-to-brain route. Afterwards, the main features of SLN and NLC and the most recent in vivo studies investigating the use of these nanoparticles for the treatment of acute migraine are presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4b12f52bf2e6644e313a9c8caf2a0161657f65a358544b960ee2abe2d6b2e6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
