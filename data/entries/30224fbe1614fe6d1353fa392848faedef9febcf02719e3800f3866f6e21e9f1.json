{"title":"A Preliminary Study to Understand the Microbial Composition of Fresh Panchagavya Preparation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1402/v1","date":1711357783000,"content":"Fecal Microbial Transplant (FMT) has been emerging as a prominent therapeutics in the modern science to modulate and correct the dysbiotic state of gut microbiome that leads to various metabolic and gastro-enteric diseases. A similar concept called as “panchagavya prasahan” exists in Ayurveda. This technique unlike the FMT involves the use of Cive by- products of cow viz. Cow dung, urine, milk, curd, ghee mixed in a copper vessel. In this study we assess the microbial composition of this preparation before and after the mixing in the copper vessel. We used the 16S rRNA gene based amplicon sequencing approach to understand the bacterial composition in the panchagavya preparation. We observed signiCicant decrease in the abundance of genera Pseudomonas and Streptococcus (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30224fbe1614fe6d1353fa392848faedef9febcf02719e3800f3866f6e21e9f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
