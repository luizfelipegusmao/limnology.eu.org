{"title":"Impact of four years of annually repeated indoor residual spraying (IRS) with Actellic 300CS on routinely reported malaria cases in an agricultural setting in Malawi","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0002264","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by Remy Hoek Spaans, Albert Mkumbwa, Peter Nasoni, Christopher M. Jones, Michelle C. Stanton</p>\r\n\r\nIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main vector control tools used in malaria prevention. This study evaluates IRS in the context of a privately run campaign conducted across a low-lying, irrigated, sugarcane estate from Illovo Sugar, in the Chikwawa district of Malawi. The effect of Actellic 300CS annual spraying over four years (2015-2018) was assessed using a negative binomial mixed effects model, in an area where pyrethroid resistance has previously been identified. With an unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.32â€“0.45) and an adjusted IRR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.42-0.59), IRS has significantly contributed to a reduction in case incidence rates at Illovo, as compared to control clinics and time points outside of the six month protective period. This study shows how the consistency of a privately run IRS campaign can improve the health of employees. More research is needed on the duration of protection and optimal timing of IRS programmes.","author":"Remy Hoek Spaans","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"1a7e2b563268f6c7caaf7bd3adf7f2cbe92a37f73a119375e8780e78cd8ebaa7","category":"Environment"}
