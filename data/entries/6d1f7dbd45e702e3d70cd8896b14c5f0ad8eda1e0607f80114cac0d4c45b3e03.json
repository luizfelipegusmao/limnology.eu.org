{"title":"Genotype by environment interaction across water regimes in relation to cropping season response of quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309777","date":1728396000000,"content":"<p>by Van Loc Nguyen, Hue Nhan Luu, Thi Hong Nhung Phan, Viet Long Nguyen, Duc Ha Chu, Daniel Bertero, Néstor Curti, Peter C. McKeown, Charles Spillane</p>\r\n\r\nGenotype × environment (GxE) interaction effects are one of the major challenges in identifying cultivars with stable performance across agri-environments. In this study we analysed GE interactions to identify quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>) cultivars with high and stable yields under different soil moisture regimes, representing control conditions, waterlogging and drought. Waterlogging and drought treatments were artificially induced using normoxia, a combination of hypoxia-normoxia, and 10% PEG (Polyethylene glycol) under hydroponic growth conditions, respectively. Both waterlogging and drought conditions significantly reduced the plant height (PH), number of leaves (NoL) and number of branches (NoB), stem diameter (SD), leaf area (LA) and dry weight (DW) of quinoa genotypes. The genotype, water regime, and genotype by water regime effects all significantly affected the measured quinoa traits. Based on the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model for DW, the genotypes G18, Puno, Q4, 2-Want, Puno, Real1 x Ruy937 and Titicaca were found to exhibit tolerance and were stable across water regimes. A second-stage evaluation was conducted to test genotype × environment interaction effects in crop production field trials, selecting two contrasting seasons based on soil moisture conditions involving a diverse set of genotypes (58 varieties in total). Our results demonstrate significant variations in both growth and yield among the quinoa genotypes across the cropping seasons. The GGE analysis for grain yield indicate that field conditions matched to G × E under hydroponic experimental conditions and the cultivars G18, Q1, Q4, NL-3, G28, 42-Test, Atlas and 59-ALC were classified within a range of high productivity. Our findings provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms of wide adaptation, while identifying germplasm that enhances the water stress tolerance of quinoa cultivars at early growth stages.","author":"Van Loc Nguyen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6d1f7dbd45e702e3d70cd8896b14c5f0ad8eda1e0607f80114cac0d4c45b3e03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
