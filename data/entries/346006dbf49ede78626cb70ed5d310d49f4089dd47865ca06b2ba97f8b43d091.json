{"title":"An Exploratory Study on the Potentials of Removing Ice from Frozen Structures by Bubble Pulsation Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1052/v1","date":1728900409000,"content":"The safety and reliability of structures operating in cold regions are seriously threatened by icing. This has attracted researchers to explore de-icing/anti-icing methods. In this work, a bubble de-icing system was established and investigated for the removal of ice from frozen structures using bubble pulsation energy. Traditional de-icing method face high energy consumption, environmental pollution, and secondary icing issues. To avoid this and promote the development of de-icing techniques, the massive amount of energy generated by bubble pulsation can be used for de-icing. In the present work, experimental methods have been adopted to demonstrate the possibilities of de-icing using cavitation energy. Many test cases, in which the bubble distance from the target and thickness of ice layer were varied 5 - 35 mm, were examined to determine the mechanism of ice removal by the bubble energy. This research demonstrated that bubble energy can be used effectively for de-icing. Bubble energy\n should be further explored for de-icing techniques and engineering application prospects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"346006dbf49ede78626cb70ed5d310d49f4089dd47865ca06b2ba97f8b43d091","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
