{"title":"UMAMIT44 is a key player in glutamate export from Arabidopsis chloroplasts","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/4/1119/7471969?rss=1","date":1702425600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Selective partitioning of amino acids among organelles, cells, tissues, and organs is essential for cellular metabolism and plant growth. Nitrogen assimilation into glutamine and glutamate and de novo biosynthesis of most protein amino acids occur in chloroplasts; therefore, various transport mechanisms must exist to accommodate their directional efflux from the stroma to the cytosol and feed the amino acids into the extraplastidial metabolic and long-distance transport pathways. Yet, Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) transporters functioning in plastidial export of amino acids remained undiscovered. Here, USUALLY MULTIPLE ACIDS MOVE IN AND OUT TRANSPORTER 44 (UMAMIT44) was identified and shown to function in glutamate export from Arabidopsis chloroplasts. UMAMIT44 controls glutamate homeostasis within and outside of chloroplasts and influences nitrogen partitioning from leaves to sinks. Glutamate imbalances in chloroplasts and leaves of <span>umamit44</span> mutants impact cellular redox state, nitrogen and carbon metabolism, and amino acid (AA) and sucrose supply of growing sinks, leading to negative effects on plant growth. Nonetheless, the mutant lines adjust to some extent by upregulating alternative pathways for glutamate synthesis outside the plastids and by mitigating oxidative stress through the production of other amino acids and antioxidants. Overall, this study establishes that the role of UMAMIT44 in glutamate export from chloroplasts is vital for controlling nitrogen availability within source leaf cells and for sink nutrition, with an impact on growth and seed yield.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"a8a1f3636bc7ba67605f394280f51cd310b8a8c152a9c91cc927bc31b4cdc009","category":"Environment"}
