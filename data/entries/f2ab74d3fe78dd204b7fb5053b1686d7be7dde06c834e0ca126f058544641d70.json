{"title":"Effect of hot‐air drying on drying characteristics and quality of tiger nut","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13824?af=R","date":1724639408000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The delayed drying of newly harvested tiger nuts can lead to mold and rancidity. Timely drying is therefore important. However, few studies have analyzed the impact of hot-air drying on the quality of tiger-nut oil and starch, making it essential to establish optimal drying conditions.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that the drying temperature was the most important factor affecting the drying speed, followed by drying airflow rate and loading capacity. A logarithmic model can describe the hot-air drying process of tiger nuts. The oil yield of tiger nut was highest after drying at 60 °C, reaching 22.40%. Meanwhile, the starch extracted from after drying at 60 °C had the highest solubility and expansion rate, 4.77% and 9.74%, respectively. Starch has the highest viscosity after drying at 70 °C, and it forms gel easily after aging.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>High-quality tiger nuts should be produced under optimal conditions: a hot-air drying temperature of 60 °C, an airflow rate of 1.0 m s<sup>−1</sup>, and a loading capacity of 100 g. The results of this study have practical implications for the effective drying of tiger nuts. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Pengxiao Chen, \nHan Bao, \nMengmeng Jiang, \nWenxue Zhu, \nYating Zhao, \nRunyang Zhang, \nKaihao Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f2ab74d3fe78dd204b7fb5053b1686d7be7dde06c834e0ca126f058544641d70","category":"Environment"}
