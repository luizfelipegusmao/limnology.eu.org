{"title":"Evaluation of APTES Functionalized Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles for Adsorption of CH4 and CO2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0610/v1","date":1725863293000,"content":"Zinc Oxide nanoparticles functionalized with APTES were obtained to evaluate their CH4 and CO2 adsorption and separation behavior. First, ZnO nanoparticles were obtained by a precipitation method and subsequently coated with (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTES). The nanoparticles sample was characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR spectroscopy, TGA, XRD, TEM/EDX, XPS and N2 adsorption at 77 K. CH4 and CO2 adsorption experiments were carried out at 298 K in a range between 0-10 bar. It was observed that the amount of gas adsorbed on the surface of the nanostructure is very small in comparison with other materials traditionally used for this purpose but slightly higher than those obtained in naked nanoparticles evaluated in previous studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62408bf74ef64acbdb564d57c5c74d4e577f04a29fba38d9debcd63d2030e401","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
