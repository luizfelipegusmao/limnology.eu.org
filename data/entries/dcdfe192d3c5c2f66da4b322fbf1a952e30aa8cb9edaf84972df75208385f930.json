They show for the first time that organic sediment samples from the eastern Netherlands and mammal bones from Doggerland reflect shifts in the presence and the density of vegetation (food for herbivores) and mammal biomass during the last ice age (Weichselian Stage, ~119–14.7 ka cal <span>bp</span>). Comparison with oxygen isotope curves of Greenland ice cores and geomorphological data shows that cold climate, in particular during the younger part of the Weichselian Middle Pleniglacial and during the Late Pleniglacial, and related scarcity or even absence of vegetation, were limiting factors for the carrying capacity of the landscape and thus for the population density of large herbivores during the period covered by <sup>14</sup>C dating (last ca. 55 000 years). A ‘fossil gap’ during the Late Pleniglacial lasted ca. 13 000 years from ca. 28 to 15 ka cal \n<span>bp</span>. Previous research from the nearby Eifel region in Germany shows that environmental conditions were less extreme (‘refugium conditions’) than in the Netherlands, taking into account the continuous presence of spores of coprophilous fungi in the Eifel, indicating uninterrupted food supply for herbivores.</p>","author":"B.
