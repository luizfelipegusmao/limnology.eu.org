{"title":"Digital Transformation in University Architecture: Building Data Management on the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Campus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0939/v1","date":1726193671000,"content":"The integration of digital technologies in managing technical and design information is trans-forming the fields of architecture and construction. This article presents a website developed to compile detailed information on the construction processes of buildings at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (PUJ) campus. The site offers comprehensive construction records and interviews with designers, engineers and other professionals who collaborated to align design approaches with technical construction requirements. A chronological record of the construction processes was maintained, from inception to completion of the buildings. Digital tools include interactive modules that facilitate access and data updates, improving coordination and efficiency for man-aging future projects. Gamification elements and social media dissemination boost user engage-ment. The study also assesses the impact of the website on the university community, analyzing usability and user (N=235), among students, teachers, and staff members. Findings indicate that digital technologies optimize construction processes and improve the management of technical and design information, and reveal opportunities for future projects and research, benefiting both internal and external stakeholders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4b4aa70a683e42ee16010d24b7859e8ee4844d73ce6a5cfb5faa8be63cc30a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
