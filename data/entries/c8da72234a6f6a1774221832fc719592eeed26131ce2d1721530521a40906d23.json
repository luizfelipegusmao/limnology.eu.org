{"title":"Will Liquid Biopsy Deliver the Expected Breakthrough in Clinical Oncology? Contribution of Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1312/v1","date":1711419254000,"content":"Analysis of liquid biopsy samples can reveal a wealth of molecular as well as cellular entities circulating in various body fluids. These entities include circulating tumor cells, circulating cell-free and tumor DNA, RNA, and proteins. Detection and characterization of this genetic and proteomic material can provide crucial information on tumor characteristics, including its heterogeneity, biology, tumor progression, staging, associated gene mutations and the course of therapy. The increased use of liquid biopsy in clinical oncology offers in non-invasive manner easier tumor sampling and continuous monitoring of the disease evolution through repetitive sampling from cancer patients. The continuous monitoring offered by this method is highly relevant to the assessment of a given therapeutic regime and early detection of markers associated with possible drug resistance, which may develop in the course of the therapy. \n   The use of proteomic approaches, including mass spectrometry-based proteomics for the analysis of biofluids extends for over three decades, yet only in the last few years such methods have found their way to clinical oncology. The non-invasive nature of liquid biopsy and the simple procedures for sample collection made this approach far more attractive than the traditional and well-established tissue biopsy. Such preference becomes more practical in the analysis of solid tumors, particularly in pediatric population. In this review we discuss some works on the emerging role of liquid biopsy analyses in clinical oncology, and how such use allows a better understanding of diagnosis, prognosis, disease evolution and response to therapy of various forms of cancer. We also discuss the role of MS-based methods in the characterization of post-translational modifications of proteins circulating in liquid biopsies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8da72234a6f6a1774221832fc719592eeed26131ce2d1721530521a40906d23","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
