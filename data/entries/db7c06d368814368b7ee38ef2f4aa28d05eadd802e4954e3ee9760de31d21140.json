{"title":"Individual and combined effects of high‐temperature stress at booting and flowering stages on rice grain quality","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13808?af=R","date":1726033480000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>High temperature stress (HTS) has become a serious threat to rice grain quality and few studies have examined the effects of HTS across multiple stages on rice grain quality. In the present study, we conducted 2 years of HTS treatments under three temperature regimes (32/22 °C, 40/30 °C and 44/34 °C) and HTS durations of 2 days and 4 days at three critical stages: booting, flowering, and a combination of booting and flowering. We employed the heat degree days (HDD) metric, which accounts for both the level and duration of HTS, to quantify the relationships between grain quality traits and HTS.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results revealed the diverse effects of HTS on rice grain quality at different stages, durations and temperature levels. HTS significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) reduced grain quality, with the highest sensitivities (reduction per 1 °C day<sup>−1</sup> increase in HDD) observed at the flowering stage, followed by the combined and booting stages treatments under mild HTS treatment (40/30 °C). However, under extreme HTS treatments (44/34 °C) for 4 days, rice grains subjected to combined HTS treatment experienced complete mortality.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Pre-exposed to HTS at the booting stage within a certain intensity can alleviate the adverse effects of post-flowering HTS on grain quality. This provides valuable insights for assessing the potential impact of multiple HTS events on the grain quality under future climate warming. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wei Wang, \nLiujun Xiao, \nAqib Mahmood, \nHanwen Xu, \nLiang Tang, \nLeilei Liu, \nBing Liu, \nWeixing Cao, \nYan Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"db7c06d368814368b7ee38ef2f4aa28d05eadd802e4954e3ee9760de31d21140","category":"Environment"}
