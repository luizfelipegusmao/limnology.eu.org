{"title":"Physical modeling of the effect of shape, blockage, and flow variability on scour in culvert outlets","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306252","date":1719496800000,"content":"<p>by Kaywan Othman Ahmed, Mohammad Reza Kavianpour, Ata Amini, Younes Aminpour</p>\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of culverts has prompted researchers to focus on developing precise designs to prevent their failure caused by scouring at the culvert outlet. This study employed physical modelling to investigate alternation in culvert outlets under different conditions, including variations in culvert shape, blockage, and flow discharge during steady and unsteady flow conditions. Box and circular culverts were examined with 0%, 15%, and 30% blockage rates at the culvert inlet. For unsteady flow conditions, two hydrographs were generated, each with nine distinct flow discharges, while for steady flow conditions, flow rates of up to 14 <i>l/s</i> and 22 <i>l/s</i> were used. The sediment and flow conditions were carefully selected to ensure clear water throughout the experiments. According to the study results, the scour profile exhibited more growth in the circular culvert compared to the box culvert across all cases. Furthermore, an increase in flow rate led to an increase in the scour hole dimension, and the scouring increased with a rise in hydrograph stepwise. However, when the degree of blockage was increased, a strictly proportional increase in scour depth was not observed across all cases. The results and data presented in this research can be used by other researchers in addition to being used by hydraulic designers.","author":"Kaywan Othman Ahmed","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9b32e955f7d288d47b1082b0d3e83cfdc56b174166b2c5b7af409347ba709592","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
