{"title":"Incorporation of observation uncertainty in stock assessment using spatio-temporal modeling of catch-at-length and age-at-length survey data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/7/1195/7699322?rss=1","date":1719360000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Spatio-temporal models are essential tools for estimating abundance indices and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Time series of index uncertainties can be used to objectively determine the influence each index has on the assessment. This can involve reducing the influence of indices in years with limited data. However, incorporating uncertainty in age-length conversion into assessment models has remained a challenge. In this research, we propose an index estimation approach that combines an abundance-at-length model with a model for age-at-length to generate age-specific abundance indices. By jointly modeling abundance-at-length and age-at-length, we address uncertainties in both components of the index-at-age. Using North East Arctic haddock (<span>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</span>) as a case study, we validate the uncertainty of the indices by integrating them into the state space assessment model SAM. The results indicate that the uncertainty estimates are realistic, and we further demonstrate that incorporating uncertainty in age conversion has effects on the assessment results. Our case study demonstrates that incorporating the uncertainty in age-at-length data improves the characterization of uncertainty in stock assessment, and hence better accounts for risk in precautionary management.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"fe24ca778ac4b6c11eecbed587a7f9c0346e6ec24d76d765dac04c7a4805c262","category":"Environment"}
