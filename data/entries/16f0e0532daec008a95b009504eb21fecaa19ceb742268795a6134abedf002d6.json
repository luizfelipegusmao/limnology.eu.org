{"title":"Sustainability Education in Formal and Non-Formal Education Materials. A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1506/v1","date":1726769482000,"content":"Education for sustainable development seeks transformative learning in order to empower learners to change the ways they understand the world. In order to achieve its goals, teaching materials are needed, that reflect its principles and goals in their content and pedagogy they promote. The study of the epistemological background on which the teaching material is structured is a research proposal, which is addressed to researchers, authors and practitioners for sustainable development, pointing out that the structuring and development of the materials should be based on a theoretical framework that effectively link the teaching activity with all 17 Sustainable Development Goals with a focus on Quality Education. This scoping review attempts to map the existing literature that assesses the effectiveness of formal and non-formal educational materials that seek to promote education for sustainability. In addition, research is presented that evaluates the effectiveness of teaching materials from the perspective of sociocultural learning theory, considering that education for sustainable development (an ideal to be achieved) is in a dynamic relationship with constructivism (a learning theory) on the basis of knowledge construction, learning and sustainability's sociocultural aspects. It was found that the international literature investigating the contradictions presented by educational materials in relation to the objectives they set and achieve and the way in which the activities they propose are implemented in practice, is limited.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16f0e0532daec008a95b009504eb21fecaa19ceb742268795a6134abedf002d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
