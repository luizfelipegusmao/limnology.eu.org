{"title":"The Effect of Lower Limb Combined Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation on Skeletal Muscle Cross-sectional Area and Inflammatory Signaling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1804/v1","date":1714284169000,"content":"In individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), rapid skeletal muscle atrophy and metabolic dysfunction pose profound rehabilitation challenges, often resulting in substantial loss of muscle mass and function. This study evaluates the effect of combined neuromuscular electrical stimulation (Comb-NMES) on skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and inflammatory signaling within the acute phase of SCI. We applied a novel Comb-NMES regimen, integrating both high-frequency resistance and low-frequency aerobic protocols on the vastus lateralis muscle, to participants early post-SCI. Muscle biopsies were analyzed for CSA and inflammatory markers pre-and post-intervention. The results revealed a preservation of muscle CSA in the Comb-NMES group compared to a control group receiving transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and passive movements. Inflammatory signaling proteins such as TLR4 and Atrogin-1 were downregulated, whereas markers associated with muscle repair and growth were modulated beneficially in the Comb-NMES group. The study's findings suggest that early application of Comb-NMES post-SCI can attenuate inflammatory pathways linked to muscle atrophy and potentially promote muscle repair, advocating for its inclusion in early rehabilitation efforts. However, the small sample size and variability in injury characteristics emphasize the need for further research to corroborate these results across a more diverse and extensive SCI population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5a1996b5fc763ea95a503e2f9492110a296e87ecb7f92e2c85536a808e1609e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
