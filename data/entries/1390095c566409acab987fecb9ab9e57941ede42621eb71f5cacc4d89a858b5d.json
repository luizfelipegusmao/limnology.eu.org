A one-year-old spayed female Poodle dog weighing 1.7 kg was brought in with non-weight-bearing lameness, an open wound, and a frac-ture in the right forelimb. The dog had fallen off the bicycle being ridden by its owner, causing its right forelimb to be caught in the wheel. The treatment included surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue, skin reconstruction with an advancement flap, and radial bone reconstruction with an ulnar bone graft, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), humeral cancellous bone and a ti-tanium T-shaped plate. Postoperative management included antibiotics, pain medication, and activity restriction. The dog made a good recovery and was able to bear weight on the affected limb four months after surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1390095c566409acab987fecb9ab9e57941ede42621eb71f5cacc4d89a858b5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
