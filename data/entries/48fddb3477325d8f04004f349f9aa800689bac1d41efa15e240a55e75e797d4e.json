{"title":"Investigation on Molecular Mechanisms of Cistanche tubulosa in Treating Acute Alcoholic Liver Injury Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1787/v1","date":1716822280000,"content":"Background: Citicola tubulosa (CT) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been found to have hepatoprotective effect，but the underlying mechanisms against acute alcoholic liver injury (ALI) remain unclear.\nObjective：This work aims to predict the molecular mechanisms of CT in treating ALI using network pharmacology and molecular docking. \nMethods: Targets of CT and ALI were screened and collected from TCMSP, Genecard, OMIM and other databases. The effective ingredient target network was constructed using Cytoscape platform. The core targets were obtained by constructing protein interaction network. The biological processes and pathways of CT were analyzed using the DAVID platform. The effective components of CT were docked with core targets using AutoDock software, and visualized by PyMOL software. \nResults: There were seven main active components, 89 drug targets, 6291 disease targets and 32 pathways. The top three docking results were hydrogen bonding between stigmasterol and EGFR, β⁃ sitosterol and ALB, stigmasterol and BCL2. \nConclusion: The effective components of CT (e.g., quercetin, stigmasterol, crocetin) may regulate core targets via multiple pathways to alleviate ALI. The use of network pharmacology and molecular docking technology can aid in revealing effective components and underlying molecular mechanisms of CT.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48fddb3477325d8f04004f349f9aa800689bac1d41efa15e240a55e75e797d4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
