{"title":"Review of Strategies and Policies for Enhanced Participation in Global Value Chains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2244/v1","date":1722326330000,"content":"This article underscores the immense potential for substantial economic growth and  development that can be harnessed through effective participation in global value chains  (GVCs). It emphasises the role of policymakers in adeptly navigating GVCs, prioritising tasks,  exploring different forms of GVC governance, and fostering a conducive environment for  foreign investments. By effectively managing power dynamics and supply chain risks,  countries can attract valuable foreign investors, enhance market connectivity, and improve  infrastructure and services, leading to significant economic growth. The potential benefits of  GVC participation are vast, and policymakers can shape the situation by understanding and  addressing strategic inquiries, laying the foundation for a prosperous future. Furthermore, the  article explores the potential for a country to enhance its involvement in GVCs and progress to  more lucrative activities by strengthening existing connections between GVCs and the local  economy. By enhancing the capacity of local stakeholders to acquire knowledge, policymakers  can play a crucial role in maximising the benefits from GVC spillovers, positively impacting a  country's economic development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e92661c93ec967943f83a88b92abb10ba85eb110be5b4a54fd480f7b6b0b83d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
