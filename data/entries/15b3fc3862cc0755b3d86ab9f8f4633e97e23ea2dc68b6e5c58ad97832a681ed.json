Plasmids, small genetic carriers known for transferring antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria were our target. By studying these genetic elements in glacial ice and nearby waters of Svalbard, we uncovered the presence of the unique as well unexpected for this region stress-response genes, including antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, shedding light on bacterial adaptation and resistome dynamics in extreme Arctic environments.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Polar regions are relatively isolated from human activity and thus could offer insight into anthropogenic and ecological drivers of the spread of antibiotic resistance. Plasmids are of particular interest in this context given the central role that they are thought to play in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, plasmidomes are challenging to profile in environmental samples. The objective of this study was to compare various aspects of the plasmidome associated with glacial ice and adjacent aquatic environments across the high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, representing a gradient of anthropogenic inputs and specific treated and untreated wastewater outflows to the sea. We accessed plasmidomes by applying enrichment cultures, plasmid isolation and shotgun Illumina sequencing of environmental samples. We examined the abundance and diversity of ARGs and other stress-response genes that might be co/cross-selected or co-transported in these environments, including biocide resistance genes (BRGs), metal resistance genes (MRGs), virulence genes (VGs) and integrons. We found striking differences between glacial ice and aquatic environments in terms of the ARGs carried by plasmids. We found a strong correlation between MRGs and ARGs in plasmids in the wastewaters and fjords. Alternatively, in glacial ice, VGs and BRGs genes were dominant, suggesting that glacial ice may be a repository of pathogenic strains. Moreover, ARGs were not found within the cassettes of integrons carried by the plasmids, which is suggestive of unique adaptive features of the microbial communities to their extreme environment. This study provides insight into the role of plasmids in facilitating bacterial adaptation to Arctic ecosystems as well as in shaping corresponding resistomes. Increasing human activity, warming of Arctic regions and associated increases in the meltwater run-off from glaciers could contribute to the release and spread of plasmid-related genes from Svalbard to the broader pool of ARGs in the Arctic Ocean.</p>","author":"Nicoletta Makowska‚ÄêZawierucha, \nArtur Trzebny, \nKrzysztof Zawierucha, \nVineeth Manthapuri, \nJames A.
