{"title":"PSXIII-14 Effect of melatonin supplementation during in vitro embryo culture on cleavage rates following in vitro maturation and fertilization of bovine oocytes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/717/7757723?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In vitro embryo production (IVEP) is an important advanced reproductive technology and has great potential in enhancing livestock production. However, in vitro culture (IVC) of embryos exposes them to stress resulting in compromising quality and efficiency of embryo production. Melatonin has been reported in several studies to reduce oxidative stress and improve the efficiency of IVEP. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of melatonin supplementation in IVC media on cleavage rates of bovine embryos. Bovine ovaries (n = 22) were obtained from local abattoir with ovarian weight of 7.29 ± 3.31 g, and size of 3.65 ± 0.69 cm. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were recovered from 2 to 8 mm size follicles by aspiration using an 18-gauge needle attached with a 10 mL syringe. COCs were matured, fertilized, and cultured in vitro using IVF Bioscience bovine media and their protocols. Oocytes were in vitro matured for 23 h at 38.8°C, 5.5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere and assessed for maturation by assessing COC expansion. Fully expanded and partially expanded COCs were fertilized for 20 h in a 4-well dish with frozen/thawed bull semen. Following IVF, the cumulus cells were removed by vertexing, and the presumptive zygotes were cultured in vitro with and without 1 µM melatonin in 4-well dishes in triplicates under the oil for embryo development at 38.8°C and 5.5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cleavage rates were determined on d 3 of culture. The percentage of cleaved embryos was calculated as (number of zygotes cleaved/total number of fertilized oocytes) x100. Data were analyzed by student’s unpaired t- test with Welch’s correction using GraphPad Prism software. The cleavage rate was greater in melatonin supplemented group (54.17 ± 11.24%) than the control (49.83 ± 7.36%) but the difference was not significant (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, under our experimental conditions, melatonin supplementation during embryo culture, following IVM/IVF of the bovine oocytes, did not significantly improve cleavage rates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7293c9137a81ffef1a9afa7720879627fffb857dfd419639708bb21526e06912","category":"Environment"}
