{"title":"A place for everything and everything in its place: linker histone H1 controls heterochromatic condensation through phase separation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1584/7617568?rss=1","date":1709251200000,"content":"<span>If we take a closer look at eukaryotic nuclei, we can distinguish how chromatin arranges itself into two distinct states depending on its degree of condensation: the open, non-condensed, and active euchromatin and the highly condensed state known as heterochromatin. The tightly packed structure often forms visible heterochromatic foci (HF; see <a href=\"#koae032-F1\">Fig</a>.). These HF regions contain abundant transposable elements and showcase distinctive repressive epigenetic marks (histone modifications, histone variants, and DNA methylation), leading to an overall inactive state (<a href=\"#koae032-B2\">Gibson et al. 2019</a>; <a href=\"#koae032-B5\">Huang et al. 2020</a>). The proper compaction of chromatin is crucial for ensuring the correct cellular program, enabling access for gene expression, and maintaining the immobility of transposable elements, among other functions. But what forces drive the formation of these discrete and compacted heterochromatic areas? In this issue, Shengbo He, Yiming Yu, Liang Wang, and colleagues (<a href=\"#koae032-B4\">He et al. 2024</a>) address this question and identify the C-terminal region of the linker histone H1 as a central component regulating the formation of HF (see <a href=\"#koae032-F1\">Fig</a>.).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"1f287d9b96e4492f5baefbc2cd4626d649b0d52b90e153b79b8538ce5aecc9ee","category":"Environment"}
