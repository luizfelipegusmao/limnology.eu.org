The focused electron probe, in the most common scan mode, is raster scanned, collecting the desired detector information pixel-by-pixel. Due to finite pixel dwell times and total image acquisition times, images exhibit unavoidable sample drift from mechanical instabilities, and from linear and nonlinear scan distortions in raster scans due to the fast and slow scan axes and electron probe flyback effects. While post-processing is routinely applied to account for these distortions, a myriad of <span>in situ</span> microscopy applications would benefit tremendously from 1) obtaining the undistorted atomic lattice information without compromising the area of interest from depositing large amounts of electrons and 2) the ability to dynamically place the electron probe with respect to a specific atomic or even sub-atomic target. This would realize repeated atom-selective spectroscopic measurements, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), or precise placement of the electron probe for imposing a controlled structural modification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f87b4cd025ad4eab28944a86caf45cf5b086fd7355b478cb0ecf577911f0f512","category":"Environment"}
