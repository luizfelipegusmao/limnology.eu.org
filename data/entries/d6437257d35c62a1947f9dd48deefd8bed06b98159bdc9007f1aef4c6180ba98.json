Whitmore [<a href=\"#ozae044.060-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.060-B2\">2</a>], micro-fading test (MFT) has offered cultural heritage institutions the ability to assess the unique light stability of individual holdings, with the benefit of being a quasi-nondestructive test method that targets exposure to selected spots of interest on an object. A microscopic spot is exposed for a short duration at a high light intensity, and its impact is carefully controlled to be indiscernible. This technique has been widely practiced in cultural heritage institutions to assess the risks and identify light-fugitive objects requiring special care when displayed or loaned [<a href=\"#ozae044.060-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d6437257d35c62a1947f9dd48deefd8bed06b98159bdc9007f1aef4c6180ba98","category":"Environment"}
