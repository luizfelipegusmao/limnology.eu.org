The CoCrFeMnNi system has been extensively studied for its physical properties and thermodynamic stability [<a href=\"#ozae044.669-B2\">2-3</a>]. The most common processes for sintering HEAs are plasma spark sintering, conventional sintering and hot isostatic pressing [<a href=\"#ozae044.669-B3\">3</a>]. The High-Frequency Induction Heat Sintering HFIHS method has emerged as an alternative for sintering. However, the effect of variables such as pressure and time in alloys modified with Al has yet to be widely studied. Thus, this study aims to determine the effect of such variables on microstructure and Vickers microhardness and compare them to the conventional method (CS).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"dc8f44643dc8ea0f97db71ed372ac6480458463a821dc2c0188bd2cd68e0295c","category":"Environment"}
