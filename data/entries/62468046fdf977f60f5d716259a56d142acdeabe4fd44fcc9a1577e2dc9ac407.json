They are present in both urban and rural environments, on land and in marine ecosystems, causing serious environmental problems since they do not degrade easily, remain almost unchanged for long periods, and bioaccumulate. Detection, though especially quantification, is a systematic process as monitoring of their levels needs to be carried out at regular intervals since there is often seasonal variation. The need for rapid and low-cost determination of metals is therefore considerable. In the present study atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), using a flame or graphite furnace, and square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV), using a bismuth thin film electrode, a sensitive voltammetric method is being compared and analytically validated. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) represents a well-established analytical technique while anodic stripping voltammetry is being criticized for its applicability in complicated sample matrices such as soil samples. This sample-handling challenge is being investigated in the present study. The results show that both methods AAS and ASV were satisfactorily correlated and showed that the concentration of metals is lower than the limit values, but with increasing trend. Therefore, continuous monitoring of metal levels in the urban complex of the city is necessary and a matter of great importance. Regarding Cd, the detection limits of Cd are lower compared to those of AAS when using the graphite furnace, while an overestimation was noted when using flame-AAS in comparison with those found with SWASV. The SWASV method has the advantage of being cheaper and faster, enabling the simultaneous determination of heavy elements across the range of concentrations that these elements can occur in Mediterranean soils. Additionally, we applied a dsDNA-modified electrode which can be used in the speciation analysis of Cu(I) and Cu(II). The changes in the characteristic peaks of guanine and adenine can be applied in the redox speciation analysis of copper in soil which represents an issue of great importance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62468046fdf977f60f5d716259a56d142acdeabe4fd44fcc9a1577e2dc9ac407","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
