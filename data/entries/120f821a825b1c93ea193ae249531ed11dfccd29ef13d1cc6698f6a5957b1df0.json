{"title":"Evaluating ARM and RISC-V Architectures For High-Performance Computing With Docker and Kubernetes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0867/v1","date":1723531448000,"content":"This paper thoroughly assesses the ARM and RISC-V architectures in the context of High-Performance Computing (HPC). It includes an analysis of Docker, Kubernetes, and KVM virtualization integration. Our study aims to evaluate and compare these systems' performance, scalability, and practicality in a general context and then assess the impact that might have on special use cases, like HPC. ARM-based systems exhibited better performance and seamless integration with Docker and Kubernetes, underscoring their advanced development and effectiveness in managing high-performance computing workloads. On the other hand, despite their open-source architecture, RISC-V platforms presented considerable intricacy and difficulties in coordinating with Kubernetes, which hurt their overall effectiveness and ease of management. The results of our study offer valuable insights into the practical consequences of implementing these architectures for HPC, highlighting ARM's preparedness and the potential of RISC-V while acknowledging the increased complexity involved and significant trade-offs at this point.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"120f821a825b1c93ea193ae249531ed11dfccd29ef13d1cc6698f6a5957b1df0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
