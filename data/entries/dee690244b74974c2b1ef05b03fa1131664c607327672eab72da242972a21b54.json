{"title":"Enhancing the Learning of Sports Skills Through Verbal Feedback","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0426/v1","date":1720083571000,"content":"Background We investigated to determine the effectiveness of verbal feedback in learning the round-off back somersault on the balance beam with stable landing. Methods: The research material consisted of female gymnasts (n = 16). They were randomly assigned to one of two groups: FKE group (n = 8) with feedback on key elements, or FAE group (n = 8) with 100% feedback on all errors made in the phase structure of the task. Results: Based on research, it was established that key elements could be identified in the preparatory, main and final phases. Mixed ANOVA showed that significant differences (p &amp;lt; 0.05) were noted due to the teaching method used (Group x Time factor) when performing the gymnastic routine of round-off back somersault with stable landing on the balance beam. Based on the Welch t test for independent data it was revealed that the group with feedback on the key elements obtained significantly higher mean scores from judges at the end of the experiment. Conclusions: The findings of the present study point to a possibility of offering coaches teaching methods that increase the effectiveness of learning complex motor skills and indicate a possibility of applying such solutions in groups of female gymnasts both in training and during competitions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dee690244b74974c2b1ef05b03fa1131664c607327672eab72da242972a21b54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
