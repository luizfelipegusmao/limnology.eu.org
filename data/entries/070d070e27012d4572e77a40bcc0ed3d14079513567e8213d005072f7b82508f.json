{"title":"Rare and Riveting: A Case Report on Artery of Percheron Occlusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0401/v1","date":1712325236000,"content":"Artery of Percheron Infarct (AOP) is a rare congenital anatomical vascular variant supplying the paramedian thalamus and the rostral midbrain. It arises from either proximal segment of the posterior cerebral artery (P1). The symptoms of an AOP infarction might vary, although they typically manifest as memory loss, altered mental status, and supranuclear vertical gaze palsy. Most of the time, the initial CT scan fails to diagnose the AOP infarct. Most of these diagnoses are made when ischemic stroke patients are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy. We report a case of a 40-year-old female with a history of well-managed hypertension, who presented in the ER with chief complaints of altered behavior, altered gaze palsy, and drowsiness. Initially, the CT scan did not show pathological changes. The diagnosis was made the next hospital day by MRI. Our case presents an unusual presentation and the lack of evidence of AOP infarction on a CT scan does not exclude its diagnosis. An infarcted Percheron artery requires a thorough clinical and radiological examination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"070d070e27012d4572e77a40bcc0ed3d14079513567e8213d005072f7b82508f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
