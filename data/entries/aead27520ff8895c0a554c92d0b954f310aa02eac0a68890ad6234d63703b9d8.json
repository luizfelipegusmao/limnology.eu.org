{"title":"Alternative electron pathways of photosynthesis power green algal CO2 capture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4132/7671043?rss=1","date":1715558400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Microalgae contribute to about half of global net photosynthesis, which converts sunlight into the chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) used to transform CO<sub>2</sub> into biomass. Alternative electron pathways of photosynthesis have been proposed to generate additional ATP that is required to sustain CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. However, the relative importance of each alternative pathway remains elusive. Here, we dissect and quantify the contribution of cyclic, pseudo-cyclic, and chloroplast-to-mitochondrion electron flows for their ability to sustain net photosynthesis in the microalga <span>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</span>. We show that (i) each alternative pathway can provide sufficient additional energy to sustain high CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates, (ii) the alternative pathways exhibit cross-compensation, and (iii) the activity of at least one of the three alternative pathways is necessary to sustain photosynthesis. We further show that all pathways have very different efficiencies at energizing CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, with the chloroplastâ€“mitochondrion interaction being the most efficient. Overall, our data lay bioenergetic foundations for biotechnological strategies to improve CO<sub>2</sub> capture and fixation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"aead27520ff8895c0a554c92d0b954f310aa02eac0a68890ad6234d63703b9d8","category":"Environment"}
