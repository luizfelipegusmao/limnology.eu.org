This study proposes a novel deep learning parameterization method called AEdiffusion, which combines Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for dimensionality reduction. The method employs a generator-refiner strategy to generate high-dimensional aquifer properties from low-dimensional latent representations. The inversion modeling was performed on a synthetic non-Gaussian hydraulic conductivity field with line-source contamination using the Iterative Local Updating Ensemble Smoother (ILUES) algorithm. The results demonstrate that the AEdiffusion-ILUES framework can accurately identify model parameters. To reduce the computational burden, an AR-Net-WL (ARNW) surrogate model was introduced, resulting in an efficient inversion framework (AEdiffusion-ILUES-ARNW) with similar prediction accuracy and predictive uncertainty estimation as the AEdiffusion-ILUES but at a lower computational cost.</p>","author":"Xun Zhang, \nSimin Jiang, \nNa Zheng, \nXuemin Xia, \nZhi Li, \nRuicheng Zhang, \nJiangjiang Zhang, \nXinshu Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"11de03bdd3fb53a3ae5b6b332de3db1e3eaf782ddfb20e06dc6b0e0c1af9f3dd","category":"Environment"}
