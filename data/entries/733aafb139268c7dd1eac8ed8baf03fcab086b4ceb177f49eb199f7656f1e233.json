{"title":"Study of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Infant Formulas and Baby Bottles: Data from the European LIFE‐MILCH PROJECT","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0667/v1","date":1728465037000,"content":"Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is inevitable, and growing scientific evidence indicates that even very low doses can negatively impact human health, particularly during pregnancy and the neonatal period. As part of the European project LIFE18 ENV/IT/00460, this study aims to identify the presence of EDCs in 20 infant formulas (both powdered and liquid) and the release from baby bottles and teats. Particularly, sensitization of young people and future parents towards the potential harmful effects of EDCs could significantly help to reduce exposure. Seven different UPLC-MS/MS methodologies and one ICP-AES were set-up to quantify already assessed and suspected EDCs among 85 different chemicals (bisphenols, parabens, phthalates, pesticides, herbicides, and their main metabolites, PFAS, and metals). Results showed that in 2 out of 14 baby bottles only anthracene and phenanthrene of the group of PAHs were released (10.68-10.81 ng/mL). Phthalates such as mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) were found in 9 of 14 samples (0.054–0.140 ng/mL), while mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MeOHP) appeared in 2 samples (0.870–0.930 ng/mL). In accordance with current EU regulations, other chemicals were not detected in baby bottles and teats. However, Bisphenols, Parabens, PAHs, Phthalates, PFAS and Metals were detected in infant formula, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and public health interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"733aafb139268c7dd1eac8ed8baf03fcab086b4ceb177f49eb199f7656f1e233","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
