Metal oxides such as WO<sub>3</sub> and MoO<sub>3</sub> are known for their temperature-dependent phase transformations and exceptional electro-chromic properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.579-B2\">2</a>]. The amalgamation of WO<sub>3</sub> and MoO<sub>3</sub> into mixed metal oxides presents intriguing possibilities for applications in supercapacitors and gas sensing [<a href=\"#ozae044.579-B3\">3</a>]. However, the exploration of phase transformations in these mixed metal oxides remains incomplete. While existing studies utilizing X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy provide partial insights into phase change [<a href=\"#ozae044.579-B4\">4</a>], a comprehensive understanding of the exact phase transitions and interface structures necessitate microscopic studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cfee222ab7aabb27d99b85a27e7e32d7ccf53723a9c196ac2f2c8e0d46d95abf","category":"Environment"}
