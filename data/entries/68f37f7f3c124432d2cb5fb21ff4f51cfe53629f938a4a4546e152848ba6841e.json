Although relaxor behavior had been commonly attributed to polar nanoregions—nanoscale domains embedded within a non-polar matrix—giving rise to their diffuse dielectric and piezoelectric properties across a broad temperature range, only recently have direct insights into fundamental changes at the atomic scale been possible. Prior models, for example, have fallen short in explaining relaxor behavior. While X-rays, neutrons, and electrons diffuse scattering techniques have been used extensively to explore temperature-dependent polar behavior, these methods capture the global and local average structures. Atomic-scale resolution microscopy is required to help fully elucidate the origin of relaxor properties by providing direct connections between local chemistry and structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.1074-B4\">4</a>], particularly as a function of temperature.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"68f37f7f3c124432d2cb5fb21ff4f51cfe53629f938a4a4546e152848ba6841e","category":"Environment"}
