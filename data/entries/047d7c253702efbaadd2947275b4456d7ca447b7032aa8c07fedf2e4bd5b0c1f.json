{"title":"Developing Standard BIM Execution Plans for Complex Construction Projects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1858/v2","date":1720778596000,"content":"This study addresses the critical need for standardizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) Execution Plans (BEPs) in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) sector. By analyzing 36 BEP documents from international organizations, we identify key elements and propose a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing digital transformation and collaboration in complex construction projects. This research employs scientometric analysis to map the evolution of BEP standards and integrates empirical data from industry surveys to validate the proposed framework. Our findings highlight the benefits of standardized BEPs in reducing inefficiencies and improving project outcomes, thereby providing a significant contribution to the field of BIM implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"047d7c253702efbaadd2947275b4456d7ca447b7032aa8c07fedf2e4bd5b0c1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
