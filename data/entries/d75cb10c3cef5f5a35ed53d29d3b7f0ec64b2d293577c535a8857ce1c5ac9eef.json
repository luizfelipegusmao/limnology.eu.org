In this study we examined the effects of <em>H. decurrens</em> on fire hazard by assessing fire behavior indicators at the landscape scale, using a modeling and simulation approach. Six fuel models for <em>H. decurrens</em> were developed through fuel characterization and experimental fires. The fuel models correspond to combinations of developmental stages of <em>H. decurrens</em> populations (Early, Intermediate and Mature) and management (Standing and Slashed fuels). These combinations were used with three levels of <em>H. decurrens</em> invasion, corresponding to 25%, 50% and 75% of cover of the landscape, applied to five real landscapes in northern Portugal (replicates) under three fuel moisture conditions (Low, Medium and High), used as surrogates of weather severity. Fire behavior simulations were conducted with FlamMap software. The relationships between fire behavior indicators (flame length, rate of spread and burn probability) at the landscape level and the four factors tested were analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Standing fuels were found to be more hazardous than slashed fuels. Fire-hazard increased with <em>H. decurrens</em> stand maturity and slash, regardless of moisture conditions. The results of this study indicate that <em>H. decurrens</em> expansion might negatively affect the fire regime in the north of Portugal. Our findings add to other known negative impacts of the species on native ecosystems, calling for the need to reinforce its control.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"d75cb10c3cef5f5a35ed53d29d3b7f0ec64b2d293577c535a8857ce1c5ac9eef","category":"Environment"}
