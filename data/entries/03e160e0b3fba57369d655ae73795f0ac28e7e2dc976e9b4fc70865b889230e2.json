{"title":"A Systematic Review of Success Factors and Failure Reasons in Enterprise Systems for Executive, Managerial, and Operational Support","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1670/v1","date":1729578397000,"content":"Enterprise Systems (ES), including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Supply Chain Management (SCM), play a critical role in streamlining processes, integrating data, and enhancing decision-making across executive, managerial, and operational levels in organizations. These systems facilitate real-time information flow, improve coordination, and increase efficiency. This systematic review aims to identify the success factors and reasons for failure in the implementation of Enterprise Systems across various organizational levels, drawing from empirical research and case studies. A systematic search of databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted. The review examined key factors influencing ES success, including top management support, user involvement, clear objectives, and change management. Failures were linked to misalignment with business goals, insufficient training, and poor communication. Studies were selected based on eligibility criteria, including publication date (within the last 20 years) and relevance to ES implementation. Out of the 64 studies reviewed, 76% focused on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), while 12% specifically addressed small businesses. The analysis revealed that 46% of the studies emphasized the role of ES in strategic planning at the executive level, 34% examined ES's impact on managerial performance in SMEs, and 20% explored the alignment of ES with business strategy. The review also found that on-premises solutions dominated ES implementation (67%), followed by cloud-based solutions (33%). Key success factors identified were organizational readiness, strategic alignment with business goals, and user engagement. Common failure causes included insufficient training (35%), lack of organizational readiness (28%), and poor change management (22%). This review provides insights into the critical success factors for ES implementation and common pitfalls. Findings emphasize the need for strategic alignment, comprehensive training, and stakeholder involvement at all organizational levels. These results offer a roadmap for organizations to optimize future ES implementations and ensure long-term sustainability through effective planning and change management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"03e160e0b3fba57369d655ae73795f0ac28e7e2dc976e9b4fc70865b889230e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
