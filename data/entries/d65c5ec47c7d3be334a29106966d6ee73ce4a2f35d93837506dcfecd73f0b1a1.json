{"title":"Enhancing the Dispersity and Electrochemical Properties of Chitosan-Coated Carbon Nanotubes for Manufacturing High-Sensitivity Biosensors with Optimal Electrical Conductivity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0519/v1","date":1715175946000,"content":"Recent developments in high-performance electrode materials have been pivotal for real-time monitoring biosensors, necessitating compatibility with biomaterials and robust electrochemi-cal properties. This study explores the development of electrode materials using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), with a primary fo-cus on assessing their dispersion and electrochemical properties. Various solvents, including N N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), deionized water, ethanol, and acetone, were used for dispersion analysis by employing ultrasonic waves. The results showed that SWCNTs exhibited well-dispersed characteristics without precipitation when introduced to a DMF solution. It found that resistance values decreased as the concentration of SWCNTs increased over the range of 0.025 to 0.4 g/L, with a considerable electrical conductivity reached at concentrations ranging from 0.2 g/L to 0.4 g/L in DMF. The biosensor platform was evaluated with 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succin-imidyl este (PBSE) as the linker and glucose oxidase (Gox) and chitosan as the binding substrate. The binding of Gox with glucose resulted in a significant decrease in resistance value of the biosensor with rising their concentrations ranged from 0.001 to 0.1 M. Though this research provides founda-tional insights for the advancement of SWCNT-based high-performance electrode materials, it will pave the way for the next generation of efficient and reliable biosensors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d65c5ec47c7d3be334a29106966d6ee73ce4a2f35d93837506dcfecd73f0b1a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
