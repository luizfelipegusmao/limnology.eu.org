The quality of short RNAs isolated through this method is validated by gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and crystallization with a protein-binding partner.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"94916ed06f139e8084a250cb95a8b17fa25abd94f83e155b02cc67a0c366b0b7","category":"Environment"}
