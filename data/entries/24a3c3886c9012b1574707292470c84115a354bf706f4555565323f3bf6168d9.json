{"title":"Human-Robot Collaboration in Business Environments: Leveraging GPU-Accelerated Computer Vision and Generative AI for Enhanced Productivity and Safety","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1230/v1","date":1724035002000,"content":"As businesses increasingly adopt advanced technologies to enhance productivity and safety, the integration of human-robot collaboration (HRC) emerges as a transformative approach. This paper explores the role of GPU-accelerated computer vision and generative AI in optimizing HRC within business environments. By leveraging the computational power of GPUs, real-time data processing, and advanced machine learning algorithms, robots can better interpret complex visual cues and adapt to dynamic workspaces. Generative AI further enables the design of intelligent robotic systems capable of anticipating human actions, optimizing task allocation, and ensuring safety through predictive modeling. This research highlights the potential of these technologies to improve operational efficiency, reduce human error, and create safer, more adaptable workplaces. The implications of such advancements are discussed, providing insights into the future of HRC in various industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24a3c3886c9012b1574707292470c84115a354bf706f4555565323f3bf6168d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
