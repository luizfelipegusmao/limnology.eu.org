However, for passive seismic isolation devices, due to their non-adjustable performance parameters, it is challenging to achieve a good seismic isolation effect for structures under random and variable seismic loads in the wide frequency range of 0 Hz to 20 Hz; (2) Methods: the sensitivity of the design parameters of the seismic isolation bearing was analyzed using the optimization center gradient method, and an improved genetic algorithm was employed to quickly optimize and obtain the optimal design parameters; (3) Results: the effectiveness of the three-dimensional seismic isolation bearing was validated through experiments. (4) Conclusions: The multi-factor sensitivity analysis approach used in this study for designing novel isolation bearings is applicable not only to seismic design in bridges but also serves as a reference for parameter design in isolation bearings requiring medium to high precision in seismic performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f3600d5e6eb33edcde05d74e349da35a7539c8e1d9fbdf8e4fc26e818b03a78","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
