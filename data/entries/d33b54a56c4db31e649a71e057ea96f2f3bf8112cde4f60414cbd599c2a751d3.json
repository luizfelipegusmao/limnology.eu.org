{"title":"Seeding and Acclimatization of Microorganisms in a Moving Bed Biological Reactor (MBBR) for Process Optimization at a Compact Septage Treatment Plant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0917/v1","date":1715662210000,"content":"In this study, MBBR, utilizing kaldnes as a media to attach and grow microorganisms, was used to treat organics in a Compact Septage Treatment Plant (CSTP). Seeding and acclimatization processes were done initially to ensure the microorganisms were able to grow and adapt well within their environments. This research was done to determine the time required for those processes, the optimum conditions, and the growth mechanism of microorganisms during the acclimatization process. Both processes were run in a batch mode. Changes in colour and weight of kaldnes were analyzed for the seeding stage; while COD, MLVSS, pH &amp;amp; temperature were observed for the acclimatization stage. Seeding and acclimatization were run for 6 and 16 days respectively. Acclimatization stage was halted when MLVSS, pH, temperature and COD reduction efficiency were stable. Three phases of microorganism growth were clearly observed in the end of the acclimatization stage, i.e., lag, constant increasing and declining rates. This indicated that microorganisms could adapt well with the MBBR system, and were ready to be utilized further to treat septage in the MBBR of the CSTP. Further research is required to investigate the efficacy of the MBBR with the acclimatized microorganisms in the CSTP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d33b54a56c4db31e649a71e057ea96f2f3bf8112cde4f60414cbd599c2a751d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
