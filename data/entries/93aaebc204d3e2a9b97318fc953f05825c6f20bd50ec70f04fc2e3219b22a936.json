{"title":"Study on Sustainable Lightweight Design for Ming-Style Round-Backed Armchair with Laminated Bamboo Lumber Based on Finite Element Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0933/v1","date":1723551400000,"content":"Ming-style round-backed armchairs as a classic Chinese chair design are renowned for the blend of ergonomics, practicality, and elegance. Although the Chinese armchair furniture industry has made strides in sustainability, there is still a need for further improvements in material selection, manufacturing processes, and supply chain management to fully support the development of sustainable furniture. Laminated bamboo lumber as new sustainable materials are becoming a popular option for furniture designers in the era of \"sustainable design\". This research aims to investigate the feasibility and application of laminated bamboo lumber in the design of Chinese armchair furniture and proposes innovative ideas for optimizing the armchair's design. First, an empirical study was conducted to comprehensively understand the classification of Ming-style round-backed armchairs’ structure to develop a 3D model. Secondly, an experimental research method was then employed to explore the parameters of laminated bamboo lumber for future studies. Additionally, a validation experiment was conducted to compare real-world scenarios with simulations using finite element analysis in Ansys. Finally, finite element analysis was used to test the feasibility and application of laminated bamboo lumber in furniture design, focusing on the material’s mechanical properties. Results indicated that laminated bamboo lumber has excellent mechanical properties as furniture design materials, subsequently, using the optimized results, the use of 0.6319 kg of steel was successfully reduced by 23.68% to ensure the armchair’s stability. This provides a reference for the future compter-assist and standardized innovative design of Chinese armchair. By incorporating compter-assist design and lightweight optimization, it is possible to save materials and make more efficient use of resources, thereby contributing to sustainable development goals in the field of furniture design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93aaebc204d3e2a9b97318fc953f05825c6f20bd50ec70f04fc2e3219b22a936","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
