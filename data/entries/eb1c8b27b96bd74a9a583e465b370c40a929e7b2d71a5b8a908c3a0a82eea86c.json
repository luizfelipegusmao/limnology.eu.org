{"title":"Cytokeratin-18 is a sensitive biomarker of alanine transaminase increase in a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial of therapeutic paracetamol dosing (PATH-BP biomarker substudy)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/2/203/7634302?rss=1","date":1711152000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a challenge in clinical medicine and drug development. Highly sensitive novel biomarkers have been identified for detecting DILI following a paracetamol overdose. The study objective was to evaluate biomarker performance in a 14-day trial of therapeutic dose paracetamol. The PATH-BP trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Individuals (<span>n</span> = 110) were randomized to receive 1 g paracetamol 4× daily or matched placebo for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week washout before crossing over to the alternate treatment. Blood was collected on days 0 (baseline), 4, 7, and 14 in both arms. Alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was measured in all patients. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), cytokeratin-18 (K18), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) were measured in patients who had an elevated ALT on paracetamol treatment (≥50% from baseline). ALT increased in 49 individuals (45%). All 3 biomarkers were increased at the time of peak ALT (K18 paracetamol arm: 18.9 ± 9.7 ng/ml, placebo arm: 11.1 ± 5.4 ng/ml, ROC-AUC = 0.80, 95% CI 0.71–0.89; miR-122: 15.1 ± 12.9fM V 4.9 ± 4.7fM, ROC-AUC = 0.83, 0.75–0.91; and GLDH: 24.6 ± 31.1U/l V 12.0 ± 11.8U/l, ROC-AUC = 0.66, 0.49–0.83). All biomarkers were correlated with ALT (K18 <span>r</span> = 0.68, miR-122 <span>r</span> = 0.67, GLDH <span>r</span> = 0.60). To assess sensitivity, biomarker performance was analyzed on the visit preceding peak ALT (mean 3 days earlier). K18 identified the subsequent ALT increase (K18 ROC-AUC = 0.70, 0.59–0.80; miR-122 ROC-AUC = 0.60, 0.49–0.72, ALT ROC-AUC = 0.59, 0.48–0.70; GLDH ROC-AUC = 0.70, 0.50–0.90). Variability was lowest for ALT and K18. In conclusion, K18 was more sensitive than ALT, miR-122, or GLDH and has potential significant utility in the early identification of DILI in trials and clinical practice.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"eb1c8b27b96bd74a9a583e465b370c40a929e7b2d71a5b8a908c3a0a82eea86c","category":"Environment"}
