{"title":"Analysis and Application of DFSS&mdash;Design for Six Sigma in the Product Development Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0894/v1","date":1728646011000,"content":"The modern economic landscape, now more competitive than ever, compels companies to create increasingly innovative, cutting-edge, and cost-effective products. In this regard, design and development phases play a crucial role, since they closely determine the final satisfaction of the customer. As a consequence, the need for a structured approach is evident, since it allows the companies to identify product key characteristics. With the purpose of creating a new product with an extended horizon to various markets, this work is based on the use of Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodology for the identification and optimization of Critical-To-Quality (CTQ) features, aiming at making the project as responsive as possible to customer needs. Two main themes are addressed. The first one is the analysis of the integrated product development process with the Six Sigma methodology for achieving design excellence; the second one is the application of the Identify phase of the IDOV (Identify, Design, Optimise, Validate) approach through a DFSS case study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f855420263aee045d3031c970b5f852cada87893ee887c96675411287f5bd438","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
