Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the application of CGF after mandibular third molar extraction will be included. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO, and the registration ID was CRD42023463234. Two reviewers will conduct the literature search, eligible study selection, data extraction, and bias risk assessment (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool). Data analysis will be performed with RevMan software (version 5.4).</p> Results <p>The results of this study will be available in a peer-reviewed journal.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study will provide scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of applying CGF in mandibular third molar extraction.</p>","author":"Hengxiao Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5ae303e8c2df7360e35e227240c3420c4d1a25f9cc03d5ecd9ff7954688ca4d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
