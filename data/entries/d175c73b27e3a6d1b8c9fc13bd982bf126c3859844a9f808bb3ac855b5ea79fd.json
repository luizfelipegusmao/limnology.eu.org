{"title":"Novel Impact of Colchicine on Interleukin-10 Expression in Acute Myocardial Infarction: An Integrative Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0587/v1","date":1720420537000,"content":"Background: Inflammatory plays critical role in myocardial infarction as a critical process in the development of heart failure, involving the development of cardiac fibrosis. Colchicine is a well-established anti-inflammatory drug, but its scientific application in controlling post-acute myocardial infarction remodelling processes has not been established. IL-10, a key cytokine in modulating inflammatory responses, underscoring its potential as a crucial therapeutic target of colchicine. \n\nObjectives: To explore the protective role of IL-10 modulated by colchicine in myocardial healing and repair following AMI, particularly cardiac fibrosis. \n\nMaterials and Methods: The predicted protein of Colchicine was assessed using WAY2DRUG PASS as probability active value. Proteins associated with Colchicine, cardiac fibrosis and acute myocardial infarction were analysed with DisGeNET and Open Target databases. Analysis and visualization of protein-protein interactions were conducted using STRING and Cytoscape. A 3T3 cell line treated with CoCl2 was used to mimic hypoxic. HIF-1α and IL-10 expression were measured by flow cytometry and analysed using a one-way ANOVA test. This observational clinical trial examined acute myocardial infarction patients undergoing immediate and delayed primary percutaneous coronary interventions. Subjects were randomized into control groups receiving placebo and intervention groups treated with Colchicine. Assessments occurred at 24 hours and five days after the intervention. IL-10 expression in the clinical trial was measured by ELISA assay and analysed using a T-test. \n\nResults: Colchicine demonstrates promising bioactivity in treating acute myocardial infarction, with notable probability active values as a tubulin antagonist (0.744), beta-tubulin antagonist (0.673), and NOS2 inhibitor (0.529). Its primary action targets IL-10, with protein-protein interactions analysis indicating interactions between IL-10 and key inflammatory mediators—IL-1β, IFN-γ, CCL2, TNF, and TGF-β1—during acute myocardial infarction and cardiac fibrosis. Hypoxic conditions in the CoCl2-induced 3T3 cell model show significantly elevated HIF-1α compared to controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Acute myocardial infarction patients were predominantly from high-risk populations, with notable smoking prevalence in the early Colchicine group (72%). Hypertension prevalence was significantly different, with 67.31% in the late Colchicine group compared to 38% in the early Colchicine and 39.80% in the early placebo groups. Both early and late Colchicine groups exhibited a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Colchicine use, either early or late, did not significantly alter major adverse cardiovascular events incidence compared to placebo (p&amp;gt;0.05). However, Colchicine significantly increased IL-10 expression in CoCl2-treated cells (p&amp;lt;0.0001) and in acute myocardial infarction patients within five days (p&amp;lt;0.05). \n\nConclusions: Colchicine may bolster the anti-inflammatory response post-myocardial infarction by activating IL-10 pathways in fibroblasts and in clinical settings, potentially reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Further investigation into broader aspects of this pathway, particularly in cardiac fibroblasts, is required.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d175c73b27e3a6d1b8c9fc13bd982bf126c3859844a9f808bb3ac855b5ea79fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
