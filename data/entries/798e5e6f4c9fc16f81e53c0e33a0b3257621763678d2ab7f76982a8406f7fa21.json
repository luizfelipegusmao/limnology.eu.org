{"title":"Evolution of “invasion syndrome” in invasive goldenrod is not constrained by genetic trade‐offs","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13734?af=R","date":1719572010000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A suite of plant traits is thought to make weed populations highly invasive, including vigorous growth and reproduction, superior competitive ability, and high dispersal ability. Using a breeding design and a common garden experiment, we tested whether such an “invasion syndrome” has evolved in an invasive range of <i>Solidago altissima</i>, and whether the evolution is likely to be genetically constrained. We found an overall shift in invasive phenotypes between native North American and invasive Japanese populations. The invasive populations were taller and produced more leaves, suggesting a superior ability to exploit limited resources. The populations also produced more allelopathic compounds that can suppress competitor growth. Finally, invasive populations produced more seeds, which are smaller and are released from a greater height, indicating a potential for superior dispersal ability than the native populations. Quantitative genetics analyses found a large amount of additive genetic variation in most focal traits across native and invasive populations, with no systematic differences in its magnitude between the ranges. Genetic covariances among three traits representing invasion strategies (leaf mass, polyacetylene concentration and seed size) were small. The R metric, which measures the effect of genetic covariances on the rate of adaptation, indicated that the covariance neither constrains nor accelerates concerted evolution of these traits. The results suggest that the invasion syndrome in <i>S. altissima</i> has evolved in the novel range due to ample additive genetic variation, and relatively free from genetic trade-offs.</p>","author":"Laura C.
