{"title":"Emplacing Ecological Grief in Last Chance Tourism: Cryospheric Change and Travel in the Arctic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0535/v1","date":1712565164000,"content":"Last Chance Tourism (LCT) is an increasingly popular phenomenon whereby tourists seek encounters with vanishing landscapes, cultures, and endangered species. However, there are concerns that it is not sufficiently ecologically informed, has a large carbon footprint, and may put further pressure on vulnerable ecosystems and communities. The Arctic has emerged as a major global frontier for LCT, and at the same time is at the forefront of disruptive and accelerating climate change. Here a review of important LCT literature is combined with a review of key insights from the concept of Ecological Grief, which calls for explicitly mourning the losses of formerly ecologically rich landscapes, species diversity, and traditional knowledge. While there is currently insufficient engagement with grief and mourning in LCT, Ecological Grief can provide a new research focus as well as a pathway to share empathy, concern, and sorrow between scientists, communities, and visitorsâ€”thereby offering an alternative way to critically reflect upon our connections with the vanishing cryosphere in the Anthropocene.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d8df32dd20b6b064e9ea32d1dee3069efe8aeffe19a5bc95a7c88471c7d7509","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
