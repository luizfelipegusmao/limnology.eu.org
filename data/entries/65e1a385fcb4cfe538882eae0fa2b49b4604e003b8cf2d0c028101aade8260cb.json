{"title":"Diagnosis, isolation and description of a novel amnoonvirus recovered from diseased fancy guppies, Poecilia reticulata","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13937?af=R","date":1715361848000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The guppy, <i>Poecilia reticulata</i>, is one of the most common cultured ornamental fish species, and a popular pet fish highly desired by hobbyists worldwide due to its availability of many brilliantly coloured fish of many varieties. The susceptibility of guppies to diseases presents a remarkable concern for both breeders and hobbyists. In this study, we report the emergence of disease in fancy guppies caused by a previously uncharacterized virus in the USA. This virus was isolated from moribund guppies in two separate outbreaks in California and Alabama, from December 2021 to June 2023. The infected guppies presented with acute morbidity and mortality shortly after shipping, displaying nonspecific clinical signs and gross changes including lethargy, anorexia, swimming at the water surface, gill pallor, mild to moderate coelomic distension and occasional skin lesions including protruding scales, skin ulcers and hyperaemia. Histological changes in affected fish were mild and nonspecific; however, liver and testes from moribund fish were positive for Tilapia lake virus (TiLV), the single described member in the family <i>Amnoonviridae</i>, using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, although the latter was weak. A virus was successfully recovered following tissue inoculation on epithelioma papulosum cyprini and snakehead fish cell lines. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses revealed nucleotide and amino acid homologies from 78.3%–91.2%, and 78.2%–97.7%, respectively, when comparing the guppy virus genomes to TiLV isolates. Based on the criteria outlined herein, we propose the classification of this new virus, fancy tailed guppy virus (FTGV), as a member of the family <i>Amnoonviridae</i>, with the name <i>Tilapinevirus poikilos</i> (from the Greek ‘poikilos’, meaning of many colours; various sorts, akin to ‘poecilia’).</p>","author":"Esteban Soto, \nBenjamin R.
