{"title":"Overcoming Challenges in Energy Transition: The Role of Risk Management in Achieving NZEB Standards","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0249/v1","date":1719973777000,"content":"The energy transition is a complicated process that involves changing production and consumption habits, boosting the use of renewable energy sources, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This article examines the management of risks associated with this shift, focusing on investment, commercial, technological, regulatory, and environmental challenges. The paper proposes an effective way for dealing with new difficulties by assessing risks and the management techniques that accompany them. Furthermore, as a critical component of the energy revolution, the concept of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) is given, with a focus on the ambitions of INGV – Irpina Headquarters and the EU regulatory framework. Finally, the actions and methods employed to achieve the NZEB objectives are discussed, including the utilization of cutting-edge technologies and renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the concept of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) is introduced as an important component of the energy transition, with an emphasis on the European regulatory framework and the ambitions of the INGV – Irpina Headquarters. Finally, the interventions and techniques employed to achieve the NZEB targets are highlighted, such as the employment of advanced technologies and renewable energy resources. This study contributes significantly to understanding the processes and issues associated with the energy transition and the implementation of NZEB, hence boosting sustainability in the construction sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0e8c8c2e13caaf1a0b5eb51e500e8650c5486b8972892707f0bdff717e81330","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
