{"title":"A Bibliometric Review of the Trends of Construction Digitalization Research in the Last Decade","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0677/v1","date":1715336783000,"content":"The integration of digital technologies into construction practices has emerged as a pivotal area of interest, reflecting its substantial influence on the future trajectory of the construction industry. This study undertakes a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of literature on construction digitalization spanning from 2013 to 2023, sourced from the Elsevier Scopus database. Employing key terms such as \"construction digitalization,\" \"BIM,\" \"construction 4.0,\" and \"digital construction methodologies,\" the research methodically extracts and scrutinizes relevant articles. Advanced tools like the VOS viewer were utilized to delve into the bibliometric networks, offering insights into prevailing research trends within the built environment sector. The findings reveal a pronounced emphasis on digital modeling, automation, blockchain technologies, and emerging paradigms such as smart contracts and modular construction. This investigation enriches the academic discourse by elucidating the varied subtleties, ongoing shifts, and prospective directions in the ever-evolving landscape of construction digitalization research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e344a3a4595126b394af266ca2165837b5871e3a394148bb8e61ea3cc37702f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
