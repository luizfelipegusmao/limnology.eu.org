{"title":"Less variability when growing faster? Experimental assessment of the relationship of growth rate with functional traits of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05444-8","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Diversity and its drivers and consequences are at the heart of ecological research. Mostly, studies have focused on different species, but if the causes for increases or decreases in diversity are general, the observed patterns should also be observable within genotypes. As previous research shows that there is higher variability in nitrogen to phosphorus ratios (N/P) between slow-growing unicellular algal populations, compared to fast-growing ones, we expected to observe similar patterns within genetically identical strains growing at different rates. We tested this hypothesis in a laboratory experiment performed with a monoculture of the diatom <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em>. Using a growth rate gradient obtained with 10 chemostats, we were able to determine the effect of growth rate on the diatomâ€™s elemental stoichiometry as well as on selected traits, such as cell size and shape. Our results showed indeed less intercellular variability (in the selected traits assessed on single-cell level) in the faster-growing populations, which was accompanied by a downward trend in bulk N/P ratios. We pose that this higher variability at lower growth rates potentially results in higher variability of the food sources available for higher trophic levels with potential consequences for the transfer efficiency of energy and matter in marine food webs.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"aea2d5f3771341f413f258d7853afac59392fffcee0a4bf6f3578ba2376874b0","category":"Environment"}
