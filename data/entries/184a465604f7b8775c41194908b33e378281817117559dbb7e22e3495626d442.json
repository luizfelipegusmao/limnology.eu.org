However, the exploration and development potential of CBM in low-rank coals in the Zhalainuoer coalfield is unknown. In this study, various testing methods were utilized, including low temperature N<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance, to investigate the pore structure characteristics of low-rank coals in the Zhalainuoer coalfield, so as to further evaluate the occurrence space of CBM therein. The results revealed that the prevalent pore types in the low-rank coals were “ink bottle” shaped pores and semi-closed pores, and micropores provide the main specific surface area (SSA) and total pore volume (TPV). Moreover, there is no significant correlation between vitrinite content and fractal dimension, while pore SSA and TPV are correlated positively with D<sub>1</sub> but negatively with D<sub>2</sub>. The coalification degree significantly impacts the pore characteristics of the coal reservoirs. With coalification degree increasing, the SSA and TPV of micropores and transition pores generally exhibited a pattern of initially decreasing and then increasing. These research findings establish a theoretical foundation for the exploration and development of CBM in the Zhalainuoer coalfield.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"184a465604f7b8775c41194908b33e378281817117559dbb7e22e3495626d442","category":"Environment"}
