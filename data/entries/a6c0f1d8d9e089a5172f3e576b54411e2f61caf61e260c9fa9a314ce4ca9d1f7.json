{"title":"Geoheritage and Cultural Heritage Interface in a Worship Place: The Case Study of the Monumental Complex of San Francesco Le Moniche in Aversa (XIII Century, Italy) and Its Underground Artificial Cavities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1257/v1","date":1726492406000,"content":"Relationships between geoheritage and cultural heritage are increasingly becoming a topic of study, especially in urban contexts. Their integrated reading adds value for educational and urban geotourism purpose, being the latter an emerging sector of sustainable tourism. The case study of the monumental complex of San Francesco le Moniche, built in the ancient Norman county Aversa, in the northern Campania (Italy), is analyzed here. The cultural heritage of the monumental complex and the additional value associated with the natural heritage (geological and geomorphological context, building stones) have been linked. The building stratification of the complex has been read not only from documentary sources, but also from the distribution and architecture of the existing underground cavities, the building stones, from ancient images and even postcards, integrating disciplines such as geosciences, architecture, archaeology, speleology, engineering. The results provide a clear example of a geoheritage-cultural heritage interface and the importance of an integrated approach in the valorization of the cultural and natural heritage of urban areas. The results allowed us to improve the knowledge of the study site and provide useful tools for the planning of future targeted investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6c0f1d8d9e089a5172f3e576b54411e2f61caf61e260c9fa9a314ce4ca9d1f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
