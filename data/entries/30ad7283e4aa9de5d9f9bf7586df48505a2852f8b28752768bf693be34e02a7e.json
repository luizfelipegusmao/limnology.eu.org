{"title":"&lsquo;I Can&rsquo;t Even Talk to My Parents About It&rsquo;: South Sudanese Youth Advocates&rsquo; Perspectives on Suicide Through Reflexive Discussions and Collaborative Poetic Inquiry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1520/v1","date":1726822235000,"content":"The issue of suicide has garnered considerable attention in refugee scholarship, where research examines how unique forced migration and resettlement challenges exacerbate risks and vul-nerabilities to suicide. However, there are gaps in understanding the social and cultural factors shaping the lived experience of suicide in refugee communities. Using the example of Afri-can-background young people in Australia, this paper presents a collaboration among two aca-demics and two South Sudanese youth advocates to explore the sociocultural factors impacting suicidality through reflexive discussions and collaborative poetry. This combined approach of-fered a unique and nuanced conceptual and methodological framework to contribute culturally specific narratives to critical suicide studies and challenge western-centric and biomedical per-spectives on suicide. The process highlighted (i) the lack of dialogue about suicide in the South Sudanese community, and (ii) an absence of community-based support structures to address sui-cide. This paper provides useful insights on the culturally specific context of suicide, adding ref-ugee perspectives to the discipline of critical suicide studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30ad7283e4aa9de5d9f9bf7586df48505a2852f8b28752768bf693be34e02a7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
