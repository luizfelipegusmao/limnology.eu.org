{"title":"Design and Analysis of A Triple-Input Three-Level PV Inverter with Minimized Number of MPPT Controllers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0724/v1","date":1728548154000,"content":"Photovoltaic (PV) energy has been a preferable choice with the rise in global energy demand, as it is a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective source of energy. Optimizing the power generation is necessary to fully utilize the PV system. Harvesting more power uses cascading of impedance source converters taking input from low-voltage PV arrays which requires multiple maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers. To solve this problem, a three-level inverter topology with a new PV arrangement, offering a smaller size with lower cost is designed in this article. The design criteria for parameters are discussed with the help of the small signal analysis. In this paper, three PV arrays are used to harvest maximum energy, which requires only one MPPT controller and employs a modified perturb and observe (P&amp;amp;O) algorithm, being faster, highly efficient, and reducing the computational burden of the controller. Moreover, a three maximum power points tracker algorithm, which perturbs one parameter and observes six variables, is designed for the selected converter topology. This MPPT algorithm offers better dynamics and is highly efficient with a conversion efficiency of 99.2% during uniform irradiance and 97% efficiency during variable irradiance conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3184d93be3f3cd3da4d9d4c1f3250a3e7f8d491be53b2bc977ee266774917d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
