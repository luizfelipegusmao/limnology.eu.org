{"title":"Teachers’ and Administrators’ Perspectives on School Princi-pals’ Self-Regulation Skills and Decision-Making Styles: A Mixed-Methods Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0893/v1","date":1720678984000,"content":"This study explores the impact of self-regulation skills on the decision-making styles of school administrators in public primary schools. There is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding how self-regulation components—foresight, will control, and self-reflection—affect the deci-sion-making processes of school leaders. A mixed-methods approach was used, integrating quantitative data from the \"Self-Regulation Skills Scale for School Administrators\" and the \"Deci-sion-Making Styles Scale\" with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with adminis-trators and teachers. The findings reveal that administrators with strong self-regulation skills predominantly use rational and intuitive decision-making styles. This correlation leads to more effective management and improved educational outcomes. The study underscores the im-portance of professional development programs aimed at enhancing self-regulation abilities among school administrators. Such improvements in self-regulation can lead to better deci-sion-making processes, ultimately benefiting student performance and overall school success.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5610a3710ae1bda191596fe3a55bff7b6b23a98e7316896d60e9835972c54274","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
