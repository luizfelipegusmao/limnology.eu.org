{"title":"Characterization of MET Alterations in 37 Gastroesophageal Cancer Cell Lines for MET-Targeted Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1174/v1","date":1715941689000,"content":"Background: Capmatinib and savolitinib, selective MET inhibitors, are widely used to treat various MET-positive cancers. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of these inhibitors on MET-amplified gastric cancer (GC) cells. Methods: After screening 37 GC cell lines, the following cell lines were found to be MET-positive with copy number variation &amp;gt; 10: SNU-620, ESO51, MKN-45, SNU-5, and OE33 cell lines. Nest, we assessed the cytotoxic response of these cell lines to capmatinib or savolitinib alone using cell counting kit-8 and clonogenic cell survival assays. Western blotting was performed to assess the effects of capmatinib and savolitinib on the MET signaling pathway. Xenograft studies were performed to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of savolitinib in MKN-45 cells. Results: Savolitinib and capmatinib exerted anti-proliferative effects on MET-amplified GC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Savolitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of MET and downstream signaling pathways, such as the protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, in MET-amplified GC cells. Additionally, savolitinib significantly decreased the number of colonies formed on the soft agar and exerted dose-dependent anti-tumor effects in a MKN-45 GC cell xenograft model. Furthermore, combination of trastuzumab and capmatinib exhibited enhanced inhibition of AKT and ERK activation in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)- and MET-positive OE-33 cells. Conclusions: Therefore, targeting MET with savolitinib and capmatinib efficiently suppressed the growth of MET-amplified GC cells. Moreover, these MET inhibitors exerted synergistic effects with trastuzumab on HER2- and MET-amplified GC cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70eb26ca1cd9f499f5650bc87a832757f6f6de76ec77a55f50e9343cb40d347a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
