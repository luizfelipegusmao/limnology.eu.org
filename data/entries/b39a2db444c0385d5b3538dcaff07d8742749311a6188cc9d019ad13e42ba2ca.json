{"title":"Perturbed FLRW Metric Explains the Difference in Measurements of the Hubble Constant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0626/v2","date":1719918864000,"content":"A cosmological model described by the perturbation metric is proposed, in which space is entrained by matter expanding as a result of the Big Bang. In the absence of an input of external energy and momentum, the solution of the Einstein equations assumes a pressure equal to zero and an accelerated expansion. The cosmological perturbation model explains the difference in measurements of the Hubble constant using gravitational lensing and a distance ladder.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b39a2db444c0385d5b3538dcaff07d8742749311a6188cc9d019ad13e42ba2ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
