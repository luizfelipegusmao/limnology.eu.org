{"title":"BAHD Company: The Ever-Expanding Roles of the BAHD Acyltransferase Gene Family in Plants","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-arplant-062922-050122?TRACK=RSS","date":1684713600000,"content":"<div><p>Plants’ ability to chemically modify core structures of specialized metabolites is the main reason why the plant kingdom contains such a wide and rich array of diverse compounds. One of the most important types of chemical modifications of small molecules is the addition of an acyl moiety to produce esters and amides. Large-scale phylogenomics analyses have shown that the enzymes that perform acyl transfer reactions on the myriad small molecules synthesized by plants belong to only a few gene families. This review is focused on describing the biochemistry, evolutionary origins, and chemical ecology implications of one of these families—the BAHD acyltransferases. The growth of advanced metabolomic studies coupled with next-generation sequencing of diverse plant species has confirmed that the BAHD family plays critical roles in modifying nearly all known classes of specialized metabolites. The current and future outlook for research on BAHDs includes expanding their roles in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.</p></div>","author":"Gaurav Moghe, Lars H.
