{"title":"SARS-CoV-2 Displays a Suboptimal Codon Usage Bias for Efficient Translation in Human Cells Diverted by Hijacking the tRNA Epitranscriptome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2124/v1","date":1727400100000,"content":"Codon bias analysis of SARS-CoV-2 reveals suboptimal adaptation for translation in human cells it infects. The detailed examination of the codons preferentially used by SARS-CoV-2 shows a strong preference for LysAAA, GlnCAA, GluGAA, and Arg AGA infrequently used in human genes. In the absence of an adapted tRNA pool, efficient decoding of these codons requires a 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2) modification at the U34 wobble position of the corresponding tRNAs (tLysUUU; tGlnUUG; tGluUUC; tArgUCU). The optimal translation of SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs) may therefore require several adjustments to the host's translation machinery, enabling the highly biased viral genome to achieve a more favorable \"Ready-to-Translate\" state in human cells. Experimental approaches based on LC-MS/MS quantification of tRNA modifications and on alteration of enzymatic tRNA modification pathways provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 induces U34 tRNA modifications and relies on these modifications for its lifecycle. The conclusions emphasize the need for future studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 codon bias and its ability to alter the host tRNA pool through the manipulation of RNA modifications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"459622086d10c499d62e5e09b2d9de212326b92fcd79b24ab390ab2334561cd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
