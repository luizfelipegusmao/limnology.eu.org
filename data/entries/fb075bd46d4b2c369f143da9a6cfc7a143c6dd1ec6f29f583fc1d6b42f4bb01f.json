{"title":"AFM Nanoindentation Based Stiffness of Biomaterials: Softening Index and Variation from Parabolic Nature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0969/v1","date":1713180077000,"content":"AFM nanoindentation showed variation in stiffness (Elastic modulus) due to heterogenous nature of the collagen fibres. The S values varied from 5 N/m to 11.11 n/m corresponding to an E change of 2.25 to 1.38 GPa. The variation in effective modulus (Eff) with respect to displacement indicated crossing the parabolic limit. A softening index n was proposed due to the heterogenous behaviour of the biomaterials","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb075bd46d4b2c369f143da9a6cfc7a143c6dd1ec6f29f583fc1d6b42f4bb01f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
