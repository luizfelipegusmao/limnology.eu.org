The technique involves the implementation of weight and aerodynamic balance in the main flight modes, has the ability to consider atmospheric aircrafts with one or two lifting surfaces, apply parallel calculations and automatically generate a three-dimensional geometric model of aircraft appearance based on the optimization results. A method for accelerating the process of optimizing the parameters of an aircraft in terms of take-off weight by more than three times by introducing a objective function into a set of design variables is proposed and demonstrated. The results of assessing the reliability of the used mathematical models of aerodynamics and the correctness of the calculation the objective function, taking into account various constraints, are presented. A comprehensive test of the performance and efficiency of the methodology is considered by solving demonstration problems to optimize more than ten main design parameters the appearance of two existing heavy-class unmanned aerial vehicles with known characteristics from open sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e1f1eb4fd0ff4f61993c00097b02e1ff36736a0017d55f578aa4472045c69ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
