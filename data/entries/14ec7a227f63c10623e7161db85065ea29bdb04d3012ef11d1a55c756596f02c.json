{"title":"An Experimental Insight on The Use Of N-Butanol as Sustainable Aviation Fuel","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0721/v1","date":1723302659000,"content":"This study investigates the performance and environmental impact of n-butanol blended with Jet-A fuel in turbo-engines, aiming to assess its viability as a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The research involves experimental testing of various blends, ranging from low to high concentrations of methanol, to determine their effects on engine performance and emissions. The experimental setup includes comprehensive measurements of engine parameters such as thrust, fuel consumption rates, and exhaust gas temperatures. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) are also analysed to evaluate environmental impacts. Key findings indicate that n-butanol/Jet-A blends can significantly enhance combustion efficiency and reduce emissions compared to conventional Jet-A fuel. Higher n-butanol concentrations lead to improved thermal efficiency and lower NOx and CO emissions. However, PM emissions slightly increase with higher methanol content. The study underscores the potential of n-butanol as a SAF for turbo-engines, highlighting its ability to mitigate environmental impacts while maintaining or improving engine performance. This research supports the feasibility of integrating n-butanol into Jet-A blends for turbo-engine applications, emphasizing its role in achieving more environmentally friendly aviation operations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14ec7a227f63c10623e7161db85065ea29bdb04d3012ef11d1a55c756596f02c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
