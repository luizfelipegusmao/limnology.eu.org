{"title":"The Role of Urban Design in Facilitating a Circular Economy: From Linear to Regenerative Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1548/v1","date":1726754530000,"content":"The increasing urbanization of cities worldwide has driven a parallel rise in resource consumption, waste generation, and environmental degradation. The transition to a circular economy (CE) offers a sustainable alternative, shifting from traditional linear systems of resource use and disposal to regenerative systems that prioritize material reuse, resource efficiency, and ecological restoration. Urban design and planning play an essential role in facilitating this shift by creating the physical and regulatory infrastructure necessary to implement CE principles in cities. This paper explores the role of urban design in promoting circular economy strategies, with a focus on adaptive reuse of buildings, green architecture, and the integration of nature-based solutions (NBS) into urban environments. Through detailed analysis of these strategies and case studies from cities around the world, this paper demonstrates that regenerative design is essential for closing material and resource loops and creating more sustainable, resilient cities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c94c55f404c4e46a18e76159c89ee9c64f85aab95f65de3ddb00797f3533216f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
