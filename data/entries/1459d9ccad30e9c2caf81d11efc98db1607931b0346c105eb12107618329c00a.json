{"title":"Pioneers of plankton research: Eugen Jørgensen (1862–1938)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/3/243/7659886?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span>Among those of us who work on dinoflagellates, ciliates or radiolaria of the marine plankton, the name Eugen Jørgensen (<a href=\"#f1\">Fig. 1</a>) may ring a bell. However, you might think it is spelled Jörgensen, or Jorgensen or Joergensen as he wrote in Norwegian, German and English. He authored several important monographs on different groups of marine microplankton in the early 20th century. What is little known, even among those of us who know his work, is that Jørgensen was actually an unlikely plankton researcher. Like many of us in the field today, he came to work on plankton almost accidently. When he began working on plankton, his expertise and a professional position were completely unrelated to plankton research. However, at the age of 36, he became seriously taken with microplankton, and subsequently spent nearly the next three decades working on various studies, and oceanographic expedition reports. Hence, Jørgensen’s story is, I believe, one we can relate to. Here I will give a sketch of his life from middle school teacher, to renowned expert on Artic flora, and finally, an authority on microplankton. The following account of the events in Jørgensen’s life and career are based on the memorial biography of Jørgensen by <a href=\"#ref13\">Holmeboe (1939)</a> and statements in Jørgensen’s publications. </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"1459d9ccad30e9c2caf81d11efc98db1607931b0346c105eb12107618329c00a","category":"Environment"}
