{"title":"Changes in chemical components and hepatoprotective effect of red Panax notoginseng processed by aspartic acid impregnation treatment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13440?af=R","date":1709719697000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Red <i>Panax notoginseng</i> (RPN) is one of the major processed products of <i>Panax notoginseng</i> (PN), with more effective biological activities. However, the traditional processing method of RPN has some disadvantages such as low conversion rate of ginsenosides and long processing time.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>In this work, we developed a green, safe and efficient approach for RPN processing by aspartic acid impregnation pretreatment. Our results showed that the optimized temperature, steaming time, and concentration of aspartic acid were 120°C, 1 h and 3%, respectively. The original ginsenosides in aspartic acid-treated <i>Panax notoginseng</i> (Asp-PN) were completely converted to rare saponins at 120°C only within 1 h. The concentration of the rare ginsenosdies in Asp-PN was two times higher than that in untreated RPN. In addition, we examined the protective effect of RPN and Asp-PN on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury in a mouse model. The results showed that Asp-PN has significantly more potent hepatoprotective action than the RPN. The hepatoprotection of Asp-PN in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity may be due to its anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>These results indicated that aspartic acid impregnation pretreatment may provide an effective method to shorten the steaming time, improve the conversion rate of ginsenosides and enhance hepatoprotective activity of RPN.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
