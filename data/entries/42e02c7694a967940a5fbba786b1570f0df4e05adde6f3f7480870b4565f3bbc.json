{"title":"Changes in chemical components and hepatoprotective effect of red Panax notoginseng processed by aspartic acid impregnation treatment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13440?af=R","date":1710845027000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Red <i>Panax notoginseng</i> (RPN) is one of the major processed products of <i>P. notoginseng</i> (PN), with more effective biological activities. However, the traditional processing method of RPN has some disadvantages, such as low conversion rate of ginsenosides and long processing time.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this work, we developed a green, safe, and efficient approach for RPN processing by aspartic acid impregnation pretreatment. Our results showed that the optimized temperature, steaming time, and concentration of aspartic acid were 120 °C, 1 h, and 3% respectively. The original ginsenosides in PN treated by aspartic acid (Asp-PN) were completely converted to rare saponins at 120 °C within just 1 h. The concentration of the rare ginsenosides in Asp-PN was two times higher than that in untreated RPN. In addition, we examined the protective effect of RPN and Asp-PN on acetaminophen-induced liver injury in a mouse model. The results showed that Asp-PN has significantly more potent hepatoprotective action than the RPN. The hepatoprotection of Asp-PN in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity may be due to its anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results indicated that aspartic acid impregnation pretreatment may provide an effective method to shorten the steaming time, improve the conversion rate of ginsenosides, and enhance hepatoprotective activity of RPN. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ying Cui, \nJianfa Wu, \nDanli Zhang, \nDan Li, \nJing Zhang, \nWei Li, \nChongzhi Wang, \nChunsu Yuan, \nZhi Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"42e02c7694a967940a5fbba786b1570f0df4e05adde6f3f7480870b4565f3bbc","category":"Environment"}
