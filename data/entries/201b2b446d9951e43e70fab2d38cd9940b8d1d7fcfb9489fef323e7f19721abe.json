{"title":"Impact of Environmental Factors on Bacterial Populations: A Comparison of Riverine, Estuarine and Coastal Sediments Within Adyar Creek Estuary, India","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1206/v1","date":1729008886000,"content":"The Adyar Creek, a backwater estuary at the mouth of the Adyar River on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, represents a critical ecosystem facing mounting pressure from urbanization. This study employed high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize bacterial communities within the riverine, estuarine, and coastal sediments of Adyar Creek. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum across most samples, with proportions ranging from 39.65% to 72.09%. Notably, the estuarine environment exhibited a distinct taxonomic profile characterized by a significant abundance of Firmicutes (47.09% of the bacterial population). Distinct bacterial classes were observed across sediment types: Alphaproteobacteria (30.07% - 34.32%) in riverine sediments, bacilli dominated estuarine sediments (40.17%), and Gammaproteobacteria (15.71%-51.94%) in coastal sediments. The most significant environmental factors influencing bacterial community composition across these samples were pH, salinity, phosphate, and nitrate. LEfSe analysis identified specific genera within the estuary, including Bacillus (20.26%), unclassified Paenibacillaceae (12.87%), Clostridium (3.81%), Gailella (3.17%), Paenibacillus (3.02%), Massilia (1.70%), Paraburkholderia (1.42%), and Pantoea (1.15%), as potential biomarkers for habitat health. Functional analysis revealed elevated expression of genes associated with ABC transporters and carbon metabolism in the estuary, suggesting a heightened nutrient cycling capacity. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis indicated bacterial communities exhibit a strong modular structure with complex species interactions across the three sediment types. These findings highlight bacterial communities' critical role and their key drivers in estuarine ecosystems, establishing a baseline for further investigations into the functional ecology of these vulnerable ecosystems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"201b2b446d9951e43e70fab2d38cd9940b8d1d7fcfb9489fef323e7f19721abe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
