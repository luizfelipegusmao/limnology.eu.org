A new study in PLOS Biology revealed that there are multiple checkpoints to ensure that only ribosomes containing the correct 3′ end participate in translation.\r\n\r\nThe 3’ end of 18S ribosomal RNA is formed by the endoribonuclease Nob1, but how cells ensure the accuracy of the 3’ end has been a mystery.
