{"title":"Segment Anything in OCT: SAM 2 for Volumetric Segmentation of Retinal Biomarkers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0703/v1","date":1725887777000,"content":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in ophthalmology for visualizing retinal layers, aiding in early detection and monitoring of retinal diseases. OCT is useful for detecting diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME), which affect millions of people globally. Over the past decade, the area of application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep Learning (DL), has significantly increased. The number of medical applications is also rising, with solutions from other domains being increasingly applied to OCT. The segmentation of biomarkers is an essential problem that can enhance the quality of retinal disease diagnostics. For 3D OCT scans, AI is beneficial since manual segmentation is very labor-intensive. In this paper, we employ the new SAM 2 and MedSAM 2 for the segmentation of OCT volumes for two open-source datasets, comparing their performance with the traditional U-Net. The model achieved an overall Dice score of 0.913 and 0.902 for macular holes (MH) and intraretinal cysts (IRC) on OIMHS and 0.888 and 0.909 for intraretinal fluid (IRF) and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) on the AROI dataset, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d3f868860474a82423be68e5ae22bcd1b67794b136391f27b86f7f8bec369ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
