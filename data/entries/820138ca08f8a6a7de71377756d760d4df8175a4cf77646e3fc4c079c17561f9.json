{"title":"Antimicrobial Effect of Chitosan Nanoparticles and Allium Species on Several Microorganisms, Including Mycobacterium tuberculosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0216/v1","date":1719913683000,"content":"This study evaluates the antimicrobial efficacy of chitosan nanoparticles (CNP), varying in size, against E. coli, S. aureus, E. faecalis, C. albicans, and clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), as well as the antimicrobial effects of aqueous extracts and lyophilized powders of Allium (garlic) species. CNP were synthesized through ionotropic gelation and characterized by Z potential, hydrodynamic diameter (Dynamic Light Scattering, DLS) and SEM. Aqueous garlic extracts were prepared via decoction. We assessed antimicrobial activity using disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods; besides a modified agar proportion method in blood agar was used for antimicrobial activity against MTB. CNP inhibited MTB growth at 300 μg for 116.6 nm particles and 400 μg for 364.4 nm particles. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed against E. faecalis with nanoparticles between 200 and 280 nm. Allium sativum extract produced inhibition for C. albicans at 100 μg. The results indicate that CNP possess significant antimicrobial properties against a range of pathogens, including MTB, at high concentrations. On the other hand, aqueous Allium sativum extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity, but given their instability in solution, the use of lyophilized Allium sativum powder is preferable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"820138ca08f8a6a7de71377756d760d4df8175a4cf77646e3fc4c079c17561f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
