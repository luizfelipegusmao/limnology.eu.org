{"title":"Effects and driving factors of domestic sewage from different sources on nitrous oxide emissions in a bog","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jpe/article/doi/10.1093/jpe/rtae020/7634876?rss=1","date":1711411200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Direct sewage discharge may enhance soil nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions, worsening the greenhouse effect. However, the effects of sewage discharge into bogs on N<sub>2</sub>O flux, drivers and influencing mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, investigating the impact of reclaimed water on N<sub>2</sub>O flux is important for bog replenishment and water shortage alleviation. This study simulated sewage from different sources into a bog and analyzed N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes, soil (organic carbon, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, pH and electrical conductivity), plant (species richness and biomass) and microorganisms (ammonia-oxidizing archaea, <span>napA</span>, <span>nirS</span>, <span>nirK</span> and <span>nosZ</span> genes). Results showed that the reclaimed water did not significantly change N<sub>2</sub>O flux, while 50% tap water mixed with 50% domestic sewage and domestic sewage significantly increased the N<sub>2</sub>O flux. Among soil factors, available nitrogen and pH were key in influencing N<sub>2</sub>O flux. Among plant parameters, species richness was the primary factor affecting N<sub>2</sub>O flux. Nitrogen transformation functional genes contributed the most to the increase in the N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes, with an increase in domestic sewage input leading to a higher abundance of these genes and subsequent N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Therefore, domestic sewage should be considered, as it significantly increases N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by affecting the soil, plants and microorganisms, thereby increasing the global warming potential. This studyâ€™s findings suggest that using treated reclaimed water for bog replenishment could be an environmentally friendly approach to wetland management.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plant Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"532f26bf1ba0f166bd6491390ce5cd237faca477af455cac49d2509f7b38d556","entryHash":"dbbf6997799bb1386dba4a3b39195b394595ccf3b0e9b9ba8c503c608d105940","category":"Environment"}
