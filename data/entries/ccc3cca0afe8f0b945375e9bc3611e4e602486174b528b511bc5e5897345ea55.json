Higher 3D resolution demands more specimen projections [<a href=\"#ozae044.890-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.890-B2\">2</a>] and exceedingly high SNR [<a href=\"#ozae044.890-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.890-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.890-B4\">4</a>]. This makes high-resolution chemical tomography from inelastic scattering intractable. The inelastic scattering signals from chemically sensitive core-electron interactions are typically one-hundred times smaller than high-angle elastic scattering signals hitting an annular dark field (ADF) detector. For any specimen, one can expect 3D chemical resolution to be five to ten times worse than ADF tomography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ccc3cca0afe8f0b945375e9bc3611e4e602486174b528b511bc5e5897345ea55","category":"Environment"}
