{"title":"A Novel Soybean Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1b Variant with Three Amino Acid Substitutions Increases Seed Oil Content","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/6/872/7429424?rss=1","date":1700438400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Improving soybean (<span>Glycine max</span>) seed composition by increasing the protein and oil components will add significant value to the crop and enhance environmental sustainability. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final rate-limiting step in triacylglycerol biosynthesis and has a major impact on seed oil accumulation. We previously identified a soybean DGAT1b variant modified with 14 amino acid substitutions (GmDGAT1b-MOD) that increases total oil content by 3 percentage points when overexpressed in soybean seeds. In the present study, additional GmDGAT1b variants were generated to further increase oil with a reduced number of substitutions. Variants with one to four amino acid substitutions were screened in the model systems <span>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> and transient <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> leaf. Promising GmDGAT1b variants resulting in high oil accumulation in the model systems were selected for overexpression in soybeans. One GmDGAT1b variant with three novel amino acid substitutions (GmDGAT1b-3aa) increased total soybean oil to levels near the previously discovered GmDGAT1b-MOD variant. In a multiple location field trial, GmDGAT1b-3aa transgenic events had significantly increased oil and protein by up to 2.3 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively. The modeling of the GmDGAT1b-3aa protein structure provided insights into the potential function of the three substitutions. These findings will guide efforts to improve soybean oil content and overall seed composition by CRISPR editing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"c1ec74397595ac3f3b76ae2c5cc85e916682bf956048ed57a6ec6583662567b0","category":"Environment"}
