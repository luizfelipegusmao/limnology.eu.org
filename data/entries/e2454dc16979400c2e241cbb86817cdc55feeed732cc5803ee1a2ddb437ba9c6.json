{"title":"False-positive MDA findings in HRMS-based screening of putrefied postmortem blood samples—Identification of the interference as N-acetyltyramine","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/5/393/7631847?rss=1","date":1709078400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>An unidentified compound in putrefied postmortem blood samples showed identical accurate mass and chromatographic behavior as 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and led to false-positive preliminary screening results. The aim of the study was to identify this unknown interference. Postmortem blood samples were analyzed after protein precipitation on a QExactive Focus high-resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Germany) coupled to a RP C18 column (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). Based on the analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) adducts and isotope ratios using fullscan (<span>m/z</span> 134–330) information, the empiric formula of the protonated molecule [M + H]<sup>+</sup> of the unknown compound was found to be C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N (+ 0.6 ppm). Product ion spectra recorded using normalized collision energy 22% showed a base peak of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>1</sub> (+ 1.5 ppm) and a low-abundant water loss to C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>9</sub> (+ 1.9 ppm), neutral losses of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> were found. Based on fullscan and MS-MS information and under consideration of the observed order of neutral losses, the compound was presumptively identified as <span>N</span>-acetyltyramine. This assumption was supported by SIRIUS software showing a SIRIUS score of 99.43% for <span>N</span>-acetyltyramine. Finally, the putative structure annotation was confirmed by a reference compound. The described false-positive MDA findings could be attributed to the presence of <span>N</span>-acetyltyramine in putrefied blood samples. Being an isomer of MDA, <span>N</span>-acetyltyramine could not be distinguished by high-resolution data of the protonated molecules. The presented results once again highlight that false-positive findings may occur even in hyphenated high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) when using full-scan information only.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"e2454dc16979400c2e241cbb86817cdc55feeed732cc5803ee1a2ddb437ba9c6","category":"Environment"}
