{"title":"The impacts of diel thermal variability on growth, development and performance of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from two thermally distinct rivers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae007/7606530?rss=1","date":1707696000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Temperature in many natural aquatic environments follows a diel cycle, but to date, we know little on how diel thermal cycles affect fish biology. The current study investigates the growth, development and physiological performance of wild Atlantic salmon collected from the Miramichi and Restigouche rivers (NB, Canada). Fish were collected as parr and acclimated to either 16–21 or 19–24°C diel thermal cycles throughout the parr and smolt life stages. Both Miramichi and Restigouche Atlantic salmon parr grew at similar rates during 16–21 or 19–24°C acclimations. However, as smolts, the growth rates of the Miramichi (−8% body mass day<sup>−1</sup>) and Restigouche (−38% body mass day<sup>−1</sup>) fish were significantly slower at 19–24°C, and were in fact negative, indicating loss of mass in this group. Acclimation to 19–24°C also increased Atlantic salmon <span>CT</span><sub>max</sub>. Our findings suggest that both life stage and river origin impact Atlantic salmon growth and performance in the thermal range used herein. These findings provide evidence for local adaptation of Atlantic salmon, increased vulnerability to warming temperatures, and highlight the differential impacts of these ecologically relevant diel thermal cycles on the juvenile life stages in this species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"0b7dafcaff2b102d06b5114aa15d870ad8aafd7189d4cc848187538f4f35b128","category":"Environment"}
