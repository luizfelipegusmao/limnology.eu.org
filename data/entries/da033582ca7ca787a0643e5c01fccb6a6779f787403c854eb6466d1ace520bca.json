Due to its low pathogenicity and abundant genetic variation, <i>Armillaria gallica</i> exhibited a unique and beneficial symbiosis with <i>Gastrodia elata</i>, which was used as a traditional Chinese medicine. However, the variation and population structure of <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i> populations have rarely been investigated. Hence, we analyzed the evolution and variation in simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in three Armillaria genomes: <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i>, <i>A</i>. <i>cepistipes</i>, and <i>A</i>. <i>ostoyae</i> to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of 14 <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i> strains. Genome analysis revealed that SSRs were more abundant in the intergenic region than the intron and exon region, as was the SSR density. Compared with other two genomes, SSR density was the lowest in exon region and largest in the intron region of <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i>, with significant variation in genic region. There were 17 polymorphic markers in <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i> genome was identified, with 26.7% in genic region, which is higher than that of 18.8% in the intergenic region. Moreover, a total of 50 alleles and 42 polymorphic loci were detected among these <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i> strains. The averaged polymorphism information content (PIC) was 0.4487, ranged from 0.2577 to 0.6786. Both principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and population structure analyses based on the genotype data of SSRs divided the strains into two clusters. The cluster I included all the strains from high-altitude <i>G</i>. <i>elata</i> producing areas and some low-altitude areas, while the strains in Cluster II originated from low-altitude <i>G</i>. <i>elata</i> producing areas. These results indicated that substantial genome-specific variation in SSRs within the genic region of <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i> and provide new insights for further studies on the evolution and breeding of <i>A</i>. <i>gallica</i>.","author":"Shengnan Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"da033582ca7ca787a0643e5c01fccb6a6779f787403c854eb6466d1ace520bca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
