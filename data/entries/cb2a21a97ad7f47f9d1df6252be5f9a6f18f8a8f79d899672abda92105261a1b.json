The studied drill core sample contains late-stage pink felsic dykes overwritten by Na-metasomatism (albite, K-feldspar, magnetite and accessory apatite) and the primary Cu-Au mineralization in a vug filled with coarse-grained anhydrite, calcite, magnetite, chalcopyrite, pyrite in millimeter sizes and accessory fine-grained wollastonite and titanite. The mineralization is considered to have formed at 1520 Â±6 Ma based on dating the coarse euhedral allanite (Ca,REE)<sub>2</sub>(Fe,Ti) (Al,Fe)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>(OH)) overgrown with chalcopyrite. Allanite ages are in good agreement of the accepted age for the Mt. Elliott deposit and neighboring igneous intrusions [<a href=\"#ozae044.007-B2\">2</a>]. REE were mobilized and deposited by the same magmatic-hydrothermal fluid that precipitated the Cu-sulfides and the anhydrite resulted from the elevated heat flux from the igneous activity in the region [<a href=\"#ozae044.007-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cb2a21a97ad7f47f9d1df6252be5f9a6f18f8a8f79d899672abda92105261a1b","category":"Environment"}
