{"title":"Solutions Based on Nature to Face Water Stress: Lessons from the Present and Past","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0630/v1","date":1720487252000,"content":"This manuscript reviews three case studies from Brazil, Panama, and Portugal that illustrate Nature-based Solutions. The Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro is a remarkable story of centuries of forest management that today is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Panama Canal Watershed produces water for Canal operations, electricity generation, and drinking water for half the countryÂ´s population. Traditional windmills and weirs near streams in the Alentejo Region, Portugal, have largely been abandoned due to the damming of the Guadiana River. Yet today, weirs are increasingly recognized for their important contribution to water provisioning in this dry region.  All have a primary goal related to water provisioning, yet their ecosystem benefits are multiple.  The cases offer important lessons for adaptation to climate change, cultural benefits from traditional human activities, and concerns about social equity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1eaca2dc4623e5d003b1eaffa7c00c768b050b597ab0268ffff038c8561dc032","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
