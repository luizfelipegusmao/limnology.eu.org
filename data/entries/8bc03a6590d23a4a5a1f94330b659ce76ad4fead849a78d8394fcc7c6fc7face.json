Few materials show multiferroic behavior in a single phase and at room temperature, with Bi<sub>6</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>y</sub>Mn<sub>z</sub>O<sub>18</sub> (B6TFMO) being one such material [<a href=\"#ozae044.749-B2\">2</a>], making it an interesting system for exploring and exploiting the physical mechanisms and topologies formed due to this magnetoelectric coupling. The latter is achieved in this system by incorporating a small amount of magnetic cations (Mn, Fe) into the multilayer ferroelectric framework. The relatively high magnetic response arises due to the preferential partitioning of Mn and Fe cations toward the central region of the perovskite superlattice. While the cation distribution within the structure has been measured previously using Electron Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) [<a href=\"#ozae044.749-B3\">3</a>], here we additionally show a sub-unit cell variation in the valency of these cations using Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS), and the potential implications of this phenomenon on the materialâ€™s magnetic response is discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8bc03a6590d23a4a5a1f94330b659ce76ad4fead849a78d8394fcc7c6fc7face","category":"Environment"}
