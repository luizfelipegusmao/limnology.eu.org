{"title":"Differences in knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding hypertension by access to a community-based screening program (POSBINDU): A cross-sectional study from four districts in Indonesia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303503","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Yusuf Ari Mashuri, Vitri Widyaningsih, Alimah Premanawasti, Jaap Koot, Zinzi Pardoel, Jeanet Landsman-Dijkstra, Maarten Postma, Ari Probandari</p>\r\nBackground <p>A high prevalence of hypertension is found in Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMICs) including in Indonesia. However, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control are relativity poor. A community-based program to screen and educate people on non-communicable disease prevention (POSBINDU) was launched by the Indonesian government. However, the association between participation in the POSBINDU program with increasing knowledge, attitude, and practice of hypertension has not been widely assessed. In this study, we compared the knowledge, attitudes, and practices among people who accessed the POSBINDU and those who did not access the POSBINDU program. Subsequently, factors associated with the knowledge, attitudes, and practices among people who accessed the POSBINDU and those who did not access the POSBINDU were explored.</p> Methods <p>This was an observational study with a cross-sectional design measuring the knowledge, attitudes, and practices for hypertension control in four districts in Indonesia from October 2019 to January 2020. A total of 1,988 respondents were included in this study. A questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of hypertension. Simple logistic regression was used to investigate the correlation between the characteristics of respondents and knowledge, attitudes, and practice status. Multiple logistic regression tests were conducted to investigate factors associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practice status.</p> Results <p>We found that people who accessed POSBINDU had higher odds of having better knowledge (aOR:1.4; 95%CI:1.2–1.8), however, accessed to POSBINDU was associated with lower attitudes (aOR:0.6; 85%CI: 0.5–0.7) and had no association with hypertension-related practice.</p> Conclusion <p>People who accessed POSBINDU have an association with good knowledge, but the association with good attitude and practice was less clear. Therefore, an improvement in the POSBINDU program is needed to increase the attitudes and practices of hypertension.</p>","author":"Yusuf Ari Mashuri","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cea31436662b0409831c2414973d9d91b0be6c41e02997d87f358bb78523c49d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
