{"title":"Theory of Relationships Between Spaces to Obtain Numerical Knowledge","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202311.0053/v3","date":1719911899000,"content":"The theory says that number interacts with spaces based on the meaning of mathematics, in this way it is possible to obtain numerical knowledge. The theory shows the possibility of using spaces related to each other to efficiently discover whether results and origins are even or odd, but always applying rules to make this work. the study uses equivalent representations of odd and even numbers. Thus, it is possible to discover the possibilities of origins and their results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ec9eab2e5f43350a8c87461f827a80d63e5b7fee90d407c07916e8cb6b23dff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
