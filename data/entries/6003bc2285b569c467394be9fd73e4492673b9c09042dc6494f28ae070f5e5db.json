Irradiating the SiO<sub>2</sub> wire with 300 keV electrons caused the wire to become positively charged due to the emission of secondary electrons. The spin polarization of these electrons interacting with the charged wire was observed <span>in situ</span> using a phase reconstruction process under an external magnetic field. The magnetic field of the spin-polarized electrons was simulated taking into account the distribution of secondary electrons and the effect of the external magnetic field.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"6003bc2285b569c467394be9fd73e4492673b9c09042dc6494f28ae070f5e5db","category":"Environment"}
