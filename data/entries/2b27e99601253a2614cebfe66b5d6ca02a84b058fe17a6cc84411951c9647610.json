{"title":"Composite Sand-Crumb Rubber and Geofoam Wave Barrier for Train Vibration","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10706-023-02674-4","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The increased use of high-speed trains in recent urbanisation has raised concerns about ground vibration. The present study explores the ability to screen vibrations arising from train load for Indian conditions through the installation of an open trench (OT) and infilled trench (IFT). Disposal of leftover tyre rubber is a challenge, therefore its utilization as an IFT material is the primary motivation behind the present study. A composite layer filled with sand crumb rubber (SCR) mixture and EPS geofoam was explored as a screening material. A plane strain finite element analysis has been performed using ABAQUS 2018. Train speeds of 80 km/h, 120 km/h, and 180 km/h were considered for the numerical simulation. The optimal screening performance was determined by varying geometrical parameters such as trench depth, width, and distance from the centre of the railway track. The train-generated noise insertion loss through the composite layered trench was also measured. It was observed that with an increase in the train speed and trench depth, the noise level decreases. Screening efficiency of more than 75% was observed for train speeds 180 km/h whereas for lower speeds more than 50% screening was achieved.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"2b27e99601253a2614cebfe66b5d6ca02a84b058fe17a6cc84411951c9647610","category":"Environment"}
