{"title":"An Umbrella Review of The Periodontal Disease&mdash;Diabetes Mellitus Association","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1431/v1","date":1729262157000,"content":"Aim: To determine the clinical performance association of periodontal disease with diabetes mellitus, using an umbrella review. Material and Methods: An information search was carried out up to August 2023 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane database, Scopus, SciELO, Google Scholar and OpenGrey. We included studies that were systematic reviews (SR) with or without meta-analysis, without time and language restrictions, that evaluated primary studies that evaluated the association between periodontal disease with diabetes mellitus. Literature or narrative reviews, rapid reviews, intervention studies, observational studies, preclinical and basic research, abstracts, comments, case reports, protocols, personal opinions, letters, and posters were excluded. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to determine the methodological quality of the included studies. Results: The preliminary search yielded a total of 577 articles, discarding those that did not meet the selection criteria, leaving only 17 articles. An association was found between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus). Conclusion: Based on the results and conclusions of the SR with a high overall confidence, periodontal disease is associated with the onset of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"481375bcb033c30f480472a2f3da20e6b653213b87bc43d8a1d5d946bf61a8b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
