However, it is not cultivated widely for human consumption due to the neurotoxin β-N-oxalyl-L-α, β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP), and its association with neurolathyrism. Though some varieties with low β-ODAP have been developed through classical breeding, the β-ODAP content is increasing due to genotype x environment interactions. This review covers grass pea nutritional quality, β-ODAP biosynthesis, mechanism of paralysis, traditional ways to reduce β-ODAP, candidate genes for boosting sulfur-containing amino acids, and the potential and targets of gene editing to reduce β-ODAP content. Recently, two key enzymes (β-ODAP synthase and β-cyanoalanine synthase) have been identified in the biosynthetic pathway of β-ODAP. We proposed four strategies through which the genes encoding these enzymes can be targeted and suppressed using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Compared to its homology in Medicago truncatula, the grass pea β-ODAP synthase gene sequence and β-cyanoalanine synthase showed 62.9% and 95% similarity, respectively. The β-ODAP synthase converts the final intermediate L-DAPA into toxic β-ODAP whist β-cyanoalanine synthase converts O-Acetylserine into β-isoxazolin-5-on-2-yl-alanine. Since grass pea is low in methionine and cysteine amino acids, improvement of these amino acids is also needed to boost its protein content.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e2f0bad52cf003dc88b38c1754212026ffdabfef45c36326687958a7946c8bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
