{"title":"Hypertension-Tachycardia Duet in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Is It Due to Catecholamine Hypersecretion, Highlighting a Gap of Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1731/v1","date":1727087327000,"content":"Patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) commonly present with tachycardia and or hypertension. There is little focus in the literature on the pathogenesis of this duet. It is currently established that ALL are catecholamine-secreting cells, and this means that ALL might induce hypertension and tachycardia via catecholamine hypersecretion. Proving the latter hypothesis can help in better treatment of ALL associated inappropriate tachycardia and systemic hypertension using combined alpha and beta blockers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd206b0e5321a321485042430d1b3e3b975eb0b42ec16eafc4053641914ce2b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
