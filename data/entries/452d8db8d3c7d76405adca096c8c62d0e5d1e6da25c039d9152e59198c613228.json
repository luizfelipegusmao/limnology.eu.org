{"title":"Gene expression profiling of Cacopsylla pyricola (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) infected with Ca. Phytoplasma pyri (Acholeplasmatales: Acholeplasmataceae) reveals candidate effectors and mechanisms of infection","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/771/7749913?rss=1","date":1725494400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phytoplasmas can negatively or positively alter vector host fitness. “<span>Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri</span>,” is the causal agent of pear decline in commercial pear (<span>Pyrus communis</span> L.; Rosales: Rosaceae) and peach yellow leafroll in peach [<span>Prunus persica</span> (L.); Rosaceae]. This plant pathogen is transmitted by several species of pear psyllids (<span>Cacopsylla</span> spp. Hemiptera: Psyllidae). We sought to explore the relationship between the pear decline phytoplasma and its US vector, <span>Cacopsylla pyricola</span> (Förster), at the molecular genetic level through transcriptomic analysis using RNA-sequencing methodology. We also focused on phytoplasma and insect effectors, which are secreted proteins that can modulate interactions within a pathosystem. In this study, we identified 30 differentially expressed genes, 14 candidate insect effector genes, and 8 <span>Ca. Phytoplasma pyri</span> candidate effectors. Two strains of <span>Ca. Phytoplasma pyri</span> were identified based on immunodominant membrane protein sequence analysis from <span>C. pyricola</span> collected in the Pacific Northwest agricultural region. Here, we present a first genetic look at the pear decline pathosystem and report gene candidates for further exploration of infection mechanisms and potential tools for integrated pest management.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"452d8db8d3c7d76405adca096c8c62d0e5d1e6da25c039d9152e59198c613228","category":"Environment"}
