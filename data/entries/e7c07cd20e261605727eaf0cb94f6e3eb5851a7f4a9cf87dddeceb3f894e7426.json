{"title":"A Framework for Resilient Post-Disaster Self-Built House: A Case Study of Gabions House in Gorkha, Nepal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1426/v1","date":1713861705000,"content":"The seismic events of 2015 in Nepal exposed the challenges associated with constructing earthquake-resistant 2-story self-built stone masonry structures in high-elevation rural regions, especially post-disaster. The Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC) provided designs that failed to preserve the local architectural landscape and craftsmanship while adding unfamiliar knowledge and technology. To address the challenges related to architecture, structure, and socio-economic concerns in designing and implementing post-earthquake houses, a need-based building development framework is required for standardized practice. This study presents a novel framework to assess, design, and implement a self-built house after a disaster, consisting of five stages: 1) post-disaster problem assessment, 2) need identification, 3) material selection, 4) design development, and 5) validation and implementation. Based on this framework, we proposed a novel gabions building construction technology for two-story stone masonry structures that effectively mitigate post-disaster challenges such as logistic, resilience, and socioeconomic aspects while improving disaster resiliency specifically in the high-elevation rural areas of Nepal. The proposed two-story gabion building preserves architectural values, enhances structural integrity, and provides cost-effectiveness when compared with its DUDBC peer models while providing much-needed relief to the vulnerable community. The proposed resilient house, G- 2.1, utilizes locally sourced materials and craftsmanship, and innovative gabion technology that ensures affordability and facilitates knowledge transfer. The contribution of this study includes a development framework and a two-story gabions house that is most suitable for self-built post-disaster reconstruction and resilient to local architecture and socio-economic conditions while providing structural integrity and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7c07cd20e261605727eaf0cb94f6e3eb5851a7f4a9cf87dddeceb3f894e7426","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
