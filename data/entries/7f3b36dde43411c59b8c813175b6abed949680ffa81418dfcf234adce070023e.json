{"title":"Stochastic Model for a QAM Transmission Subject to the Epidemic Interference Effect","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1930/v1","date":1729782572000,"content":"This article presents a stochastic model for the effect of interference caused by a sudden increase in the number of users that access a QAM digital cellular communication system. As demonstrated, the rapid increase in the number of users that access the system causes a non-stationary traffic in the network. A stochastic differential approach is used to model the epidemic interference effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f3b36dde43411c59b8c813175b6abed949680ffa81418dfcf234adce070023e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
