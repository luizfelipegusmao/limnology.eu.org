{"title":"Synthesis and Beneficials Effects of Glycerol Derivatives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0170/v1","date":1719906364000,"content":"Glycerol conversion to valuable biomolecules has been a research avenue that has attracted a significant interest in recent years due to its increasing over production, with possibilities for chemical transformation for eco-friendly processes and distinct compounds with biological activities. Also, in the current climate change  in which a major emphasis is being placed on the design of green processes, solvents are key factors from both an economic and environmental point of view. In this context, due to its abundance and low-price, glycerol represents an innovative solvent coming from biomass and produce in high amount. On the other hand, Epichlorydrin, Glycidol and Solketal have become useful intermediates in chemical transformations when using glycerol as a raw material. This review focuses on glycerol as a green solvent in the synthesis of complex molecules, Epichlorydrin, Glycidol, Solketal and Tosyl solketal as an efficient recycling process for glycerol, as well as building blocks in the synthesis of glycerol derivatives, which are undeniable new source of potentials drugs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0c8fa38ca49c409147c5a57ee9288c4d965077421c6bf0ff68d74aa367a5dda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
