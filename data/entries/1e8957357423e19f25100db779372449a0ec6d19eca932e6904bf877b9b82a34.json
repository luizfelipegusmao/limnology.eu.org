{"title":"The CELL NUMBER REGULATOR FW2.2 protein regulates cell-to-cell communication in tomato by modulating callose deposition at plasmodesmata","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/883/7642291?rss=1","date":1712534400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>FW2.2</span> (standing for <span>FRUIT WEIGHT 2.2</span>), the founding member of the <span>CELL NUMBER REGULATOR</span> (<span>CNR</span>) gene family, was the first cloned gene underlying a quantitative trait locus (QTL) governing fruit size and weight in tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>). However, despite this discovery over 20 yr ago, the molecular mechanisms by which FW2.2 negatively regulates cell division during fruit growth remain undeciphered. In the present study, we confirmed that FW2.2 is a membrane-anchored protein whose N- and C-terminal ends face the apoplast. We unexpectedly found that FW2.2 is located at plasmodesmata (PD). FW2.2 participates in the spatiotemporal regulation of callose deposition at PD and belongs to a protein complex which encompasses callose synthases. These results suggest that FW2.2 has a regulatory role in cell-to-cell communication by modulating PD transport capacity and trafficking of signaling molecules during fruit development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"1e8957357423e19f25100db779372449a0ec6d19eca932e6904bf877b9b82a34","category":"Environment"}
