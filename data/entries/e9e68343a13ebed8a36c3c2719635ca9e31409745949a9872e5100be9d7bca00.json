{"title":"Clinical and Immunological Features in Limpet (Patella sp.) Allergy: A New Trigger of Food Anaphylaxis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1484/v1","date":1729245480000,"content":"Seafood is a vital source of nutrients, and its consumption has grown globally. Shellfish is a major cause of food allergy and anaphylaxis worldwide, affecting an estimated 0.5-2.5% of the general population. Most basic and clinical research has traditionally focused on crustaceans, leaving the characteristics of mollusk allergy poorly understood. In the Canary Islands, limpets (sea gastropod) are commonly consumed as part of the local cuisine. While some cases of limpet allergy have been reported, there are no published studies featuring large series or detailed clinical analyses of this specific food allergy. A cohort of patients with sensitization to limpet were studied: 66 were monosensitized to limpets (group A), while 64 were also sensitized to other shellfish (group B). Limpet ingestion caused delayed and severe symptoms. In group A, only 11,5% of patients showed positive shellfish allergen detection, compared to 67,9% in group B. The presence of protein bands in the 25-40 and 50-200 kDa range in monosensitized patients distinguishes our study from another researchs. Our study presents the largest reported series of patients with limpet allergy to date. The aim is to analyze the clinical and immunological characteristics of a local sample of limpet-allergic patients, contributing to a better understanding of this emerging condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9e68343a13ebed8a36c3c2719635ca9e31409745949a9872e5100be9d7bca00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
