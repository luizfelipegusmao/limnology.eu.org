{"title":"Gut microbial composition is altered in sarcopenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308360","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Xiaohong Mai, Shuyi Yang, Qifeng Chen, Kangkang Chen</p>\r\n\r\nIncreasing evidence has shown that gut microbiota (GM) was involved in the pathophysiology of musculoskeletal disorders through multiple pathways such as protein anabolism, chronic inflammation and immunity, and imbalanced metabolism. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of human studies to evaluate GM diversity differences between individuals with and without sarcopenia, and explore bacteria with potential to become biomarkers. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library were systematically searched from inception to February 16, 2024. Studies were included if they (1) sampled adults with sarcopenia, and (2) performed GM analysis and reported α-diversity, β-diversity or relative abundance. The methodological quality of included studies and the certainty of evidence were assessed through the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group system, respectively. Weighted standardized mean differences (SMDs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for α-diversity indices using a fixed-effects and a random-effects model. Beta diversity and the relative abundance of GM were summarized qualitatively. A total of 19 studies involving 6,565 participants were included in this study. Compared with controls, significantly moderate decrease in microbial richness in participants with sarcopenia were found (Chao1: SMD = -0.44; 95%CI, -0.64 to -0.23, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 57.23%, 13 studies; observed species: SMD = -0.68; 95%CI, -1.00 to -0.37, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 66.07%, 5 studies; ACE index: SMD = -0.30; 95%CI, -0.56 to -0.04, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 8.12%, 4 studies), with very low certainty of evidence. Differences in <i>β</i>-diversity were consistently observed in 84.6% of studies and 97.3% of participants. The detailed analysis of the gut microbial differential abundance identified a loss of <i>Prevotellaceae</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Megamonas</i> in sarcopenia compared with non-sarcopenia. In conclusion, sarcopenia was found to be associated with reduced richness of GM, and supplementing intestinal bacteria described above may contribute to preventing and treating this muscle disease. The research protocol was registered and approved in PROSPERO (CRD42023412849).","author":"Xiaohong Mai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"017ab5d5b4a87fb28217a20469822d2b155ca64cfdce1f5df0263ad723b1c1b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
