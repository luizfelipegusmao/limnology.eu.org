{"title":"Springs of the Arabian Desert: Hydrogeology and Hydrochemistry of Abu Jir Springs, Central Iraq","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1750/v1","date":1721650880000,"content":"The Arabian Desert is characterised by very low rainfall and high evaporation, yet on its northeastern edge in central Iraq are 210 springs along the Abu Jir lineament, which represents the western depositional margin of a foreland basin infilled by the floodplain sediments of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers; there is little evidence of faulting. The springs discharge from gently east-dipping Paleocene-Eocene limestones, either where groundwater flowpaths intersect the ground surface or where groundwater flow is forced to the surface by confining aquitards. Calculated annual recharge to the aquifer system across the Arabian Desert plateau (130-500 million m3) is enough to sustain the Abu Jir springs provided groundwater extraction is not excessive. The hydrochemistry of the springs is determined by evaporation, rainfall composition (high SO4 concentrations are due to dissolution of wind-blown gypsum in the rainfall), and plant uptake of Ca and K (despite the sparse vegetation). Limestone dissolution has relatively little impact; many of the springs are undersaturated with respect to calcite and lack tufa/travertine deposits. The springs at Hit-Kubaysa contain tar and high levels of H2S that probably seeped upwards along subvertical faults from underlying oil reservoirs; the presence of hydrocarbons makes the water reducing and converts the dissolved SO4 to H2S.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff78403a7cf65d4eedf61f262bf53a0c68c594bf77ad38127a6fca28c670f044","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
