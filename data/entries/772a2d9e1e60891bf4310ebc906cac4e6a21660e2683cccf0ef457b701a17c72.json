{"title":"Health, Technology And Built Environment Nexus: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0088/v1","date":1711967709000,"content":"Research into health, particularly social and psychological health, is crucial. Ultimately, an in-depth understanding of social and psychological health will more than promote well-being. Technology research is indispensable, particularly concerning health and the built environment, given the need to create holistic and supportive frameworks for well-being. Moreover, because literature reviews establish the foundation for academic inquiries, they provide valuable overviews for foresight into grey research areas, particularly multi-disciplinary research like health technology and the built environment. Hence, this study aims to discover the existing themes on health, technology, and built-environment nexus subjects while revealing the grey areas and suggesting proactive areas for future research. The objectives drove this aim to: 1. investigate the implications of technology for the social and psychological dimensions of health; 2. uncover the likelihood of a nexus between health, technology, and the built environment; and 3. highlight new research perspectives for the concluding seven years of the SDGs (2024â€“2030). The review results highlighted ten themes around which a nexus exists between health, technology, and the built environment; they also pointed out new research perspectives for the next seven years (up to 2023).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"772a2d9e1e60891bf4310ebc906cac4e6a21660e2683cccf0ef457b701a17c72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
