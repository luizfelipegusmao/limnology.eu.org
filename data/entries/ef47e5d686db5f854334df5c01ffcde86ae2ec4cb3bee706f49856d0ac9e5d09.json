{"title":"A NAC transcription factor represses a module associated with xyloglucan content and regulates aluminum tolerance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/564/7675287?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The transcriptional regulation of aluminum (Al) tolerance in plants is largely unknown, although Al toxicity restricts agricultural yields in acidic soils. Here, we identified a NAM, ATAF1/2, and cup-shaped cotyledon 2 (NAC) transcription factor that participates in Al tolerance in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). Al substantially induced the transcript and protein levels of ANAC070, and loss-of-function mutants showed remarkably increased Al sensitivity, implying a beneficial role of ANAC070 in plant tolerance to Al toxicity. Further investigation revealed that more Al accumulated in the roots of <span>anac070</span> mutants, especially in root cell walls, accompanied by a higher hemicellulose and xyloglucan level, implying a possible interaction between ANAC070 and genes that encode proteins responsible for the modification of xyloglucan, including xyloglucan <span>endo</span>-transglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) or ANAC017. Yeast 1-hybrid analysis revealed a potential interaction between <span>ANAC070</span> and <span>ANAC017</span>, but not for other <span>XTHs</span>. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR, and GUS analysis revealed that <span>ANAC070</span> could directly repress the transcript levels of <span>ANAC017</span>, and knockout of <span>ANAC017</span> in the <span>anac070</span> mutant partially restored its Al sensitivity phenotype, indicating that <span>ANAC070</span> contributes to Al tolerance mechanisms other than suppression of <span>ANAC017</span> expression. Further analysis revealed that the core transcription factor SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY 1 (STOP1) and its target genes, which control Al tolerance in Arabidopsis, may also be involved in <span>ANAC070</span>-regulated Al tolerance. In summary, we identified a transcription factor, ANAC070, that represses the <span>ANAC017</span>-<span>XTH31</span> module to regulate Al tolerance in Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ef47e5d686db5f854334df5c01ffcde86ae2ec4cb3bee706f49856d0ac9e5d09","category":"Environment"}
