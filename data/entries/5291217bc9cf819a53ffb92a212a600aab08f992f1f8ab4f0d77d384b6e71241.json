{"title":"Theory of Majorana&ndash;Type Heavy Ion Double Charge Exchange Reactions by Pion-Nucleon Isotensor Interactions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1787/v1","date":1711636592000,"content":"The theory of heavy ion double charge exchange (DCE) reactions proceeding by effective rank–2 isotensor interactions is presented. Virtual pion–nucleon charge exchange interactions are investigated as the source for induced isotensor interactions, giving rise to the Majorana DCE (MDCE) reaction mechanism. MDCE is of a generic character, proceeding through pairs of complementary (π±,π∓) reactions in the projectile and target nucleus. The dynamics of the elementary processes is discussed where the excitation of pion–nucleon resonances are of central importance. Investigations of initial and final state ion–ion interactions show that these effects are acting as vertex renormalizations. In closure approximation, well justified by the finite pion mass, the second order transition matrix elements reduce to pion potentials and effective two–body isotensor DCE interactions, giving rise also to two–body correlations in either of the participating nuclei. Connections to neutrinoless Majorana double beta decay (MDBD) are elucidated at various levels of dynamics, from the underlying fundamental electro–weak and QCD scales to the physical scales of nuclear MDBD and MDCE physics. It is pointed out that heavy ion MDCE reactions may also proceed by competing electro–weak charge exchange processes, leading to lepton MDCE by electrons, positrons, and neutrinos.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5291217bc9cf819a53ffb92a212a600aab08f992f1f8ab4f0d77d384b6e71241","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
