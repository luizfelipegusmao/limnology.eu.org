{"title":"Properties of Electrodeposited Nickel Composite Coatings: Ni-Al2O3, Ni-SiC, Ni-ZrO2, Ni-TiO2 and Ni-WC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1695/v1","date":1724394179000,"content":"Nickel electrodeposition is a widely utilized method for creating thin films on various substrates with various desirable attributes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing nickel composite coatings that incorporate additional elements or particles into the nickel matrix to enhance their properties. These composite coatings offer superior wear resistance, corrosion resistance, hardness, and other functional benefits compared to pure nickel coatings. Some of the recent advancements in electrodeposited nickel composite coatings include improved wear resistance, enhanced mechanical properties and better corrosion resistance. Researchers have discovered that adding Al, Si, Zr, C, W, and Ti particles to nickel coatings can significantly enhance wear resistance. The uniform distribution of these particles within the nickel matrix acts as a barrier to wear and tear. Studies have also shown that nickel composite coatings with Al, Si, Zr, C, W, and Ti particles exhibit superior mechanical properties, including increased hardness. These particles refine the grain size of the nickel matrix and hinder defect movement, leading to greater mechanical strength. Moreover, nickel composite coatings offer improved protection against corrosion compared to pure nickel coatings. This review provides a detail discussion of nickel composite coatings with regard to their comparative advantaged compared to pure nickel coatings on different substrates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2df9421856c16427c0b616f18be10f1544ba3887c0a1372733abd47c172a89d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
