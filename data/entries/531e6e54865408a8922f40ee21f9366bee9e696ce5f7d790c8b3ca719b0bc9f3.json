{"title":"The Role of NtproBNP in Diagnosis and Treatment of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction, Its Not Always a Seek and Hide Game","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0270/v1","date":1717635952000,"content":"Although heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has become the predominant heart failure subtype, it remains clinically under-recognized. This, has been attributed to the complex pathophysiological mechanisms that accompany individuals with several co-morbidities and symptoms and signs of HFpEF. Natriuretic peptides have been recognized to have important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but their role in HFpEF remains controversial. Its seems that the role of NtproBNP in the diagnosis of HFpEF, is mainly driven by the pathophysiological characteristics of the patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"531e6e54865408a8922f40ee21f9366bee9e696ce5f7d790c8b3ca719b0bc9f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
