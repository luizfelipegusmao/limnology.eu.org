{"title":"Budesonide and N-acetylcysteine inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by regulating miR-381 to alleviate acute lung injury caused by the pyroptosis-mediated inflammatory response","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae115/7725702?rss=1","date":1722556800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><div>Background</div>The anti-inflammatory effects of budesonide (BUN) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuate acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of combination therapy consisting of BUN and NAC on ALI and the underlying mechanisms.<div>Methods</div>In vitro and in vivo models of ALI were generated by LPS induction. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of pyroptosis-related proteins and inflammation-related factors, and RT–qPCR was used to detect the expression of miR-381. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. ELISA was used to detect the levels of inflammation-related factors. HE staining was used to detect lung injury.<div>Results</div>The results showed that LPS effectively induced pyroptosis in cells and promoted the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins (Caspase1, Gasdermin D and NLRP3) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β). The combination of BUN and NAC significantly alleviated LPS-induced pyroptosis and inflammation. In addition, the combination of BUN and NAC effectively promoted miR-381 expression. Transfection of miR-381 mimics effectively alleviated LPS-induced pyroptosis and inflammation, while transfection of miR-381 inhibitors had the opposite effect. miR-381 negatively regulates NLRP3 expression. Treatment with a miR-381 inhibitor or pc-NLRP3 reversed the effects of the combination of BUN and NAC. In a mouse model of ALI, the combination of BUN and NAC effectively improved lung injury, while treatment with a miR-381 inhibitor or pc-NLRP3 effectively reversed this effect.<div>Conclusion</div>Overall, this study revealed that BUN + NAC inhibits the activation of NLRP3 by regulating miR-381, thereby alleviating ALI caused by pyroptosis-mediated inflammation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"e4c7be0da75a4029c308959391d6b3cf927bd1d3d0944881fd1d5b2cb352735a","category":"Environment"}
