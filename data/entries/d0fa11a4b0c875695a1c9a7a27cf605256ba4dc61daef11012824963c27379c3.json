{"title":"Exogenous Melatonin Improves Oocyte Competence and Blastocyst Development in Indigenous Donor Cattle During Summer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0758/v1","date":1723433265000,"content":"The elevated environment temperature in summer plays adverse effects on bovine fertility. Antioxidant treatment may have positive impact to enhance oocyte competence could be possible strategy for alleviating the summer effects on bovine fertility. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin treatment on oocyte development competence, blastocyst development rate, activity of antioxidant enzymes, expression profiles of development related genes and pregnancy rates in cattle during summer. The experiment was conducted in 44 non-lactating indigenous Sahiwal cattle divided into control and treatment group. Treatment group received (day 0) inj. Melatonin @ 18mg/50kg body weight while control group received inj. Corn oil, 4ml i.m. On day 4, all the cows were subjected to ovum pickup (OPU) to aspirate oocytes for in-vitro embryo production. Blood samples were used to determine lipid peroxidation (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes concentration (SOD, GSH), and also for plasma hormonal concentration analysis. The results revealed that blastocyst development rate (%) was higher in treatment group (p&lt;0.05). Treatment group had increased (p&lt;0.05) antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GSH), plasma melatonin and estradiol concentrations, and decreased (p&lt;0.05) MDA concentrations than controls. The mRNA expression level of SOD2, HSPB1, BCL2, MT2 and STAR in oocytes, cumulus cells, COCs (immature and mature) and blastocyst were found to be higher, however, BAX was downregulated in melatonin-treated than control group. In conclusion, the results suggesting probable beneficial role of exogenous melatonin administration in reducing heat stress and enhancing blastocyst developmental competence in indigenous cattle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0fa11a4b0c875695a1c9a7a27cf605256ba4dc61daef11012824963c27379c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
