Accelerated crop improvement, however, must capitalize on revolutionary new plant breeding technologies, like genetically modified and gene-edited crops, to heighten food crop traits. Genome editing still faces ineffective methods for the transformation and regeneration of different plant species and must surpass the genotype dependency of the transformation process. Tomato is considered an alternative plant model system to rice and Arabidopsis, and a model organism for fleshy-fruited plants. Furthermore, tomato cultivars like Micro-Tom are excellent models for tomato research due to its short life cycle, small size, and capacity to grow at high density. Therefore, we developed an indirect somatic embryo protocol from cotyledonary tomato explants and used this to generate epigenetically edited tomato plants for the <i>SlWRKY29</i> gene <i>via</i> CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa). We found that epigenetic reprogramming for <i>SlWRKY29</i> establishes a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state, as determined by an enrichment of the H3K4me3 mark. A whole transcriptome analysis of CRISPRa-edited pro-embryogenic masses and mature somatic embryos allowed us to characterize the mechanism driving somatic embryo induction in the edited tomato cv. Micro-Tom. Furthermore, we show that enhanced embryo induction and maturation are influenced by the transcriptional effector employed during CRISPRa, as well as by the medium composition and <i>in vitro</i> environmental conditions such as osmotic components, plant growth regulators, and light intensity.","author":"Eliana Valencia-Lozano","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2f1e87ca582bee72f88b0e47cd5e1bbe3bfb4fad8151a2f32a5bd4df53bd5f68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
