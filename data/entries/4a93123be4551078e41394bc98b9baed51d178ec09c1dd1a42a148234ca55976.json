{"title":"Exploring the Challenges and Prospects for Sustainable Wellbeing in Qatar: Stakeholder Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1273/v1","date":1716200450000,"content":"Wellbeing is a multifaceted concept that involves various facets of human condition and experience, including individual and communal spiritual, emotional, intellectual, physical, and social dimensions. To explore the complex facets of sustainable wellbeing, this study utilized an interpretive qualitative research approach, looking at round table (focus group) discussion data obtained from a diverse group of public and private sector representatives, including education, government, non-governmental organizations, and businesses in Qatar. The purpose of this study was to gain a contextualized understanding of how participants perceive and experience wellbeing. A purposive sampling technique was employed to recruit participants representing different sectors of society. To elicit participants’ perspectives on wellbeing, thematic analysis was used to identify recurring themes and patterns that emerged from the focus groups, viewed through the lens of Bronfenbrenner’ Ecological Systems Theory. Findings reveal that wellbeing is a very personal and subjective experience. Key themes extracted from the data include challenges to sustainable wellbeing in Qatar, including technological disruptions and socio-cultural influences. These challenges require proactive measures that reflect educational priorities, promote cultural preservation, and foster resilient communities while emphasizing individual and collective sustainable wellbeing. This research also identified opportunities for enhancing sustainable wellbeing in Qatar.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a93123be4551078e41394bc98b9baed51d178ec09c1dd1a42a148234ca55976","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
