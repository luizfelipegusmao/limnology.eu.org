{"title":"Study on Carbon Reduction Strategies of Rural Residential Buildings in Gannan Tibetan Area, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0505/v1","date":1723032488000,"content":"Heating stage accounts for the largest proportion of building carbon emissions. In order to figure out heating situations of rural residential building in Gansu Province, Gannan region was selected to carry out on-site survey on heating condition including heating mode, energy used for heating, heating fees, residentsâ€™ satisfaction on heating and thermal environment of typical building. The results showed that local rural residents burnt scattered coal for heating with primitive heating stove with high heating cost and low efficiency, causing low air temperature and high heating fees. Besides carbon emissions caused by heating reached 5743.28 kgCO2em-2, Several strategies for improving the heating effect and reducing carbon were proposed taking economic benefits into consideration limited by rural economic development. A parameter of reduced carbon emissions per investment input was proposed to evaluate the carbon reduction strategies. Results showed that Biomass was the most economical way to reduce the carbon emissions, followed by thermal insulation design, natural gas furnace and air source heat pumps for heating, and it was not reasonable to blindly increase building insulation to reduce building carbon emissions. The optimum energy efficiency was 55% in Gannan. The results provided reference for building low-carbon design in rural areas, helped achieving low carbon goal with low investment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c557f111ad15939380b8484772c0a5e8de164ffd806040e8c38e188d82fe922d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
