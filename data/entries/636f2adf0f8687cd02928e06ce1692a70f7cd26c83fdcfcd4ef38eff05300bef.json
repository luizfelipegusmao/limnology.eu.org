{"title":"Ecological Control of Aphids in Mandarins With Pyroligneous Acid Derived From Biomass","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2080/v1","date":1721966145000,"content":"This study investigates the implementation of equipment to obtain pyroligneous acid as an alternative to control aphids in mandarin cultivation on the El Arrayanal farm, Monte Olivo parish, Carchi province, Ecuador. Derived from mandarin pruning biomass using a dry distillation pilot oven, pyroligneous acid is an ecological option compared to synthetic phytosanitary products, with less impact on the environment and human health. Using a DBCA design, different concentrations of pyroligneous acid (250 ml, 500 ml, 750 ml, and 1000 ml) applied to immature shoots affected by aphids were analyzed. The 1000 ml concentration achieved 98% control of the pest. Analysis by Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC-MSD) and Total Polyphenols confirmed the effectiveness of pyroligneous acid. The results of the study, carried out in the research and linkage laboratories of the State University of Bol√≠var, Guaranda, Ecuador, demonstrated significant differences between the doses applied (p-value","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"636f2adf0f8687cd02928e06ce1692a70f7cd26c83fdcfcd4ef38eff05300bef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
