Probiotic supplementation is a potential therapeutic approach to modify gut microbiota and improve CF management through the gut–lung axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> supplementation on pulmonary function test, respiratory symptoms and growth in CF patients.</p>\n<h2>METHODS</h2>\n<p>A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out on 40 children with CF aged from 6 to 20 years. Participants were designated to receive either <i>L. reuteri</i> or placebo daily for 4 months. Pulmonary function tests, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) <i>z</i>-scores were measured pre and post treatment.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The median baseline BMI of the patients was 16.28 kg m<sup>−2</sup>. A significant change in the probiotic group's BMI <i>z</i>-score after the study period was observed (<i>P</i> = 0.034) but not for weight and height <i>z</i>-scores (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). After treatment, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> grew in sputum cultures of seven in the placebo and one patient in the intervention group (<i>P</i> = 0.03) while at baseline it grew in the sputum of four patients in each group. There was no significant difference in forced expiratory volume in the first second, forced expiratory flow at 25–75% or forced vital capacity change between the two groups after the treatment period (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences were found in pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalization frequencies or COVID-19 infection between the two groups during the study (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results suggest that <i>L. reuteri</i> supplementation may impact the growth of severely malnourished CF patients. Furthermore, it may be concluded that this strain might reduce <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in the sputum culture of CF patients. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Seyed Ahmad Tabatabaii, \nGhamartaj Khanbabaee, \nSaeed Sadr, \nNazanin Farahbakhsh, \nSeyedeh Zalfa Modarresi, \nMatin Pourghasem, \nMahmoud Hajipour","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"1c4cadfe8a019047cb5a968590fe48e9f1fe4b303530e04b1bf485b5b6d7e1a6","category":"Environment"}
