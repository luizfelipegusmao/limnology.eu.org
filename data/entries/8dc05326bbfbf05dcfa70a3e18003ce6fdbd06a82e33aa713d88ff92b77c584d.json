{"title":"Selective Cytotoxicity of Curcumin in Colon Cancer via Talin-Mediated Integrin β1 Activation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2140/v1","date":1717148726000,"content":"Curcumin has attracted attention for its nontoxic chemopreventive effects; however, the specific pathways underlying its anticancer effects in colon cancer remain unclear. This study investigated the potential interplay between curcumin and integrin β1 in colon cancer. HCT116 and fibroblast cells were treated with curcumin, and cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay and western blotting. We analyzed integrin β1 expression after curcumin treatment of HCT116 cells using western blotting and confocal microscopy. The roles of talin and rab25 in integrin β1 activation by curcumin were investigated using the same methods. Curcumin treatment significantly decreased the survival of HCT 116 cells but did not significantly affect the survival of fibroblast cells. Moreover, curcumin significantly increased integrin β1 expression in HCT 116 cells, which was primarily mediated by talin. In contrast, rab25 expression remained unchanged after curcumin treatment. Using rab25-specific siRNA knockdown experiments, we confirmed that curcumin increased integrin β1 expression even in the absence of rab25. Confocal microscopy revealed a dose-dependent increase in integrin β1 and talin expression, with consistent spatial distribution patterns in response to curcumin. This study highlights the clinical significance of curcumin as a selective anticancer agent in colon cancer by modulating integrin β1 expression through a talin-mediated pathway rather than through rab25.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8dc05326bbfbf05dcfa70a3e18003ce6fdbd06a82e33aa713d88ff92b77c584d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
