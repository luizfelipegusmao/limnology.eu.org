{"title":"Regulatory networks in plant responses to drought and cold stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/170/7633370?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought and cold represent distinct types of abiotic stress, each initiating unique primary signaling pathways in response to dehydration and temperature changes, respectively. However, a convergence at the gene regulatory level is observed where a common set of stress-responsive genes is activated to mitigate the impacts of both stresses. In this review, we explore these intricate regulatory networks, illustrating how plants coordinate distinct stress signals into a collective transcriptional strategy. We delve into the molecular mechanisms of stress perception, stress signaling, and the activation of gene regulatory pathways, with a focus on insights gained from model species. By elucidating both the shared and distinct aspects of plant responses to drought and cold, we provide insight into the adaptive strategies of plants, paving the way for the engineering of stress-resilient crop varieties that can withstand a changing climate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"cbbf2a082e3bf55488a716a732d66f3dc36c7a19361412dbcf6295a1ff52c8e1","category":"Environment"}
