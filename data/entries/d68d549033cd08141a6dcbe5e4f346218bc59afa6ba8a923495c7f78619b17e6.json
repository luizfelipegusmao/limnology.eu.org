{"title":"Wildflowers and compost amendment can improve infiltration in soils impacted by construction","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13202?af=R","date":1717387773000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Vegetation is an important component of stormwater control measures, as vegetation can reduce erosion and runoff. While grass is typically used in stormwater control measures, wildflowers can be planted to reduce maintenance and improve pollinator habitat. Previous studies have established that tillage followed by establishment of a vigorous vegetation stand can increase infiltration relative to compacted soils. Compost can also improve soil physical properties and fertility. The goal of this study was to evaluate potential improvements in infiltration using tillage together with compost and either grass or wildflowers. Wildflowers or grass were planted on tilled soil with or without compost at three sites in North Carolina. Bulk density, infiltration rate, root mass density, and penetration resistance were measured every 6 months over a 30-month period. A subset of plots received wheel traffic from a mower. Compost application reduced bulk density compared to tillage alone. Compost improved infiltration at two sites (46%–50%). Wildflowers improved infiltration at all sites (30%–43%) compared to grass. Few differences were observed in root mass and penetration resistance. Mower traffic reduced soil improvements more in grassed plots than wildflower plots due to higher mowing frequency. Results suggest compost and/or wildflowers together with tillage (at establishment) provide viable options to improve soil conditions and infiltration rate in construction impacted soils.</p>","author":"Shaddy H.
