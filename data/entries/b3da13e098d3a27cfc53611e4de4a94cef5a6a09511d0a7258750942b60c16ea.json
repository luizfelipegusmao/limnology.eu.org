Maintaining face-to-face medical education and clinical placements","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306129","date":1719842400000,"content":"<p>by Hilary Humphreys, Ronan Baxter, Judith Gilroy, Gianpiero L.

Here, we describe how the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) delivered clinical placements in medical programmes over the first three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, including a student-centred, holistic approach to students’ educational, social and health needs with strong student involvement, re-organising the university’s primary care team, developing COVID-19 PCR testing on site and re-focusing communications and student services. This resulted in re-arranging the students into learning communities, and students and staff electronically recorded their COVID-19 symptom status daily. In-person observed structured clinical examination and other clinical exams progressed. No lockdown of any campus occurred. Over the two senior years, 693 students completed 15,000 weeks of clinical and experiential learning across 104 sites, similar to previous years, including anatomy practicals, procedural skills training, simulated ward rounds and patient encounters, case-based presentations and small group tutorials. The compliance rate with the daily symptom tracker was 91%. The percentage response rate and the number of students providing feedback from October 2020 to April 2021 was as high as 50%. The overall response rate was 33%. By mid-May, 93–95% of students in the two senior years had had at least one dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with 99% fully vaccinated by the start of the next academic year in autumn 2021. Over the period of testing for SARS-CoV-2, just over 22,000 samples were processed, of which 0.79% were positive; no medical student acquired COVID-19 or was associated with nosocomial transmission. The total investment by the RCSI in Dublin, was €9.3m (€1.2 in capital expenditure and €8.1 in operational expenses). Continuing face-to-face clinical placements during a pandemic was possible through a multi-model approach that prioritised two-way communication, compliance with national public health advice and student screening.","author":"Hilary Humphreys","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b3da13e098d3a27cfc53611e4de4a94cef5a6a09511d0a7258750942b60c16ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
