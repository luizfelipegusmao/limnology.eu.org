{"title":"Hybrid Quorum Sensing and Machine Learning Systems for Adaptive Synthetic Biology: Toward Autonomous Gene Regulation and Precision Therapies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1551/v1","date":1729494199000,"content":"Quorum Sensing (QS) and Machine Learning (ML) hybrid systems represent a groundbreaking innovation in synthetic biology, offering unprecedented control and adaptability in microbial gene regulation and metabolic processes. QS, a microbial communication mechanism, is crucial for coordinating gene expression in response to population density, impacting behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence, and resource optimization. However, traditional QS systems are constrained by their reliance on static, pre-programmed feedback loops, limiting their flexibility in dynamic, complex environments. This review highlights how integrating advanced ML algorithms—such as reinforcement learning and deep learning—into QS systems can overcome these limitations by enabling real-time data processing, predictive modeling, and dynamic feedback control. Through these innovations, QS-ML systems can autonomously adjust gene expression and metabolic outputs, making them more efficient and scalable in applications ranging from pathogen control to precision medicine and industrial biomanufacturing. Key case studies illustrate the successful deployment of QS-ML systems to combat antimicrobial resistance, optimize bio-production, and enhance therapeutic precision in cancer and immune modulation. Despite the clear advantages, challenges remain in data integration, system robustness, and regulatory oversight. Addressing these hurdles through interdisciplinary collaboration and developing scalable, multi-omics data platforms will be critical for advancing QS-ML systems from experimental settings to real-world applications. This review underscores the transformative potential of QS-ML systems in revolutionizing synthetic biology, with profound implications for personalized medicine, sustainable biomanufacturing, and environmental health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7d911a2649ee88ba25cabe36083e43e1f452c0e46ae749a5395f73fdf7b4a43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
