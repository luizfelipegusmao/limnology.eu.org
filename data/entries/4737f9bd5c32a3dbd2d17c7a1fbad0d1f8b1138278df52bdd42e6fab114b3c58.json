{"title":"CTA Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Injuries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0691/v1","date":1715352949000,"content":"Traumatic vascular injuries consist in direct or indirect damage to arteries and/or veins and accounts for 3% of all traumatic injuries. Typical consequences are hemorrhage and ischemia.\nExtremities vascular injuries can occur isolated or in association in major trauma with other organ injuries. They account for 1-2% of patients admitted to Emergency Department, for approximately 50% of all arterial injuries. Lower extremities are more frequently injured than the upper ones in adult population. \nThe outcome of vascular injuries is strictly correlated to the environment and the time background. Treatment can be challenging notably in polytrauma because of the dilemma of which injury should be prioritized and treatment delay can cause disability or even death especially for limb vascular injury. \nOur purposes are to discuss the role of Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) in the diagnosis of vascular trauma and its optimized protocol to achieve the definitive diagnosis, and to assess the radiological signs of vascular injuries and the possible pitfalls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4737f9bd5c32a3dbd2d17c7a1fbad0d1f8b1138278df52bdd42e6fab114b3c58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
