{"title":"Study on the High Stability and Catalytic Properties of MOF Materials Represented by UiO-66 / G-C3N4","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0656/v1","date":1718096346000,"content":"This study examines the potential of UiO-66 and g-C3N4-based composite catalysts for environmental purification and pesticide degradation. By integrating zirconium-based metal-organic framework UiO-66 with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a composite with a Z-type heterojunction structure is created, enhancing photocatalytic pesticide degradation and phosphorus recovery. The optimal composite, UiO-66/g-C3N4(UG6:4), shows high efficiency in degrading organophosphorus pesticides like DDVP under visible light. This catalyst's high surface area and porous nature efficiently adsorb and break down persistent soil pollutants, including DDT and DDVP. Featuring robust stability and effective photocatalytic activity, the UiO-66/g-C3N4 composite holds promise for soil remediation and dealing with organic pollutants. Future research will aim to further refine this materialâ€™s structure and properties, ensuring its practical application in environmental cleanup.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ee8af3f40b8d3272f884267a6f2da2857f33d1a456d372d0a16a97226bc79f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
