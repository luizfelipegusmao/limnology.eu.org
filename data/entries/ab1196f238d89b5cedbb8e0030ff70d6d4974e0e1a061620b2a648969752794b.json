{"title":"The Gap of Presence: Challenges in Describing Perceptual Phenomena","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1873/v1","date":1719396759000,"content":"The paper reconstructs Merleau-Ponty’s philosophical project in terms of a phenomenology of sensible transcendence. According to this framework, i) any given data is correlative to a subjec-tive apprehension, ii) but it cannot be fully captured by this same experience. Therefore, subjec-tive apprehension must remain open to a type of absence or radical indeterminacy. This notion of transcendence must be grounded in bodily experience, and the challenge is to develop a notion of logos that can account for its sensible donation. We describe that the critical apparatus mobilized to achieve this goal, primarily through the notions of “field of presence” and “presentation”, re-stores a logic of consciousness in these analyses that focus on the body.\n\nKeywords","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab1196f238d89b5cedbb8e0030ff70d6d4974e0e1a061620b2a648969752794b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
