{"title":"Considerations for Determining Duane-Hunt Limits on Electron Beam Instruments","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.097/7719540?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The upper bound of continuum X-ray production at a given electron beam energy, known as the Duane-Hunt limit [<a href=\"#ozae044.097-B1\">1</a>], is commonly utilized to determine the accuracy of the incident electron landing energy. This determination is necessary to accurately estimate the overvoltage of emission lines as is required for quantitative analysis, especially at low beam energies (&lt; 5 keV) or at low overvoltages (ratio of the electron beam to the emission line ionization edge energy), which must be greater than 1.0. The Duane-Hunt limit is defined as the energy above which the production of continuum X-rays drops to zero due to the conservation of energy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5e3cfff749addac57a16ee09194f70ea765250bbd28352f466ca0ec6a77cee5e","category":"Environment"}
