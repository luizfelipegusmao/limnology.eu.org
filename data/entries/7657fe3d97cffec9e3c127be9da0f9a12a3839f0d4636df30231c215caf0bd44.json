{"title":"Comparative study between the energy information system and the energy management system according to ISO 50001","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0521/v1","date":1715207888000,"content":"Energy management, especially in communities, is attracting growing interest, but is often marred by confusion between the terms \"Energy Information System\" (EIS) and \"Energy Man-agement System\" (EMS). This ambiguity hinders understanding of their use and role in improv-ing energy performance. Our objective is to clarify these terms and their contribution to energy management. We used a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate and compare the criteria of definition, objective, functionality, role, as well as correlated elements such as or-ganizational structure, responsibilities, planning and policy, according to the requirements of ISO 50001, in addition to criteria specific to the two systems. The study reveals differences in the roles of the EIS and the SME, with a complementarity of 40% between the two systems, depend-ing on the positioning of the EIS in relation to the elements of the SME process. The EIS plays a crucial role in facilitating the implementation of the EMS according to ISO 50001. This clarifica-tion contributes to a better understanding of the respective roles of these systems in energy management, thus helping communities to improve their energy performance in an effective manner.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7657fe3d97cffec9e3c127be9da0f9a12a3839f0d4636df30231c215caf0bd44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
