{"title":"The interplay between Helicobacter pylori infection and rs738409 PNPLA3 in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310361","date":1727100000000,"content":"<p>by Facundo Maiorana, Magali Neschuk, María Virginia Caronia, Karina Elizondo, María Laura Robledo, Adolfo Schneider, Georgina Veron, Pedro Dario Zapata, Fernando Javier Barreyro</p>\r\nBackground <p>Recent studies have suggested an association between <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> and metabolic-disfunction associated fatty liver disease (MASLD). However, epidemiologic studies have yielded inconsistent results. We aim to evaluate the association of <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> and G-allele PNPLA3 in MASLD diagnosis, and markers of severity.</p> Methods <p>A multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted. A total 224 functional dyspepsia (FD) patients cohort who underwent gastroscopy was selected. Biochemical, clinical parameters, ultrasound, FIB-4 score, LSM by VCTE, gastric biopsies, <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> status, and rs738409 PNPLA3 were evaluated. A second retrospective cohort of 86 patients with biopsy-proven MASLD who underwent gastroscopy with gastric biopsies was analyzed.</p> Results <p>In the FD cohort MASLD was observed in 52%, and <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i>-positive in 51%. <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection was associated with MASLD prevalence, but in multivariate analyses adjusted for G-allele PNPLA3, it became not significant. Then in MASLD-only dyspeptic cohort, <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection was significantly linked to elevated serum AST levels and increased liver stiffness measurements, suggesting a potential role in liver injury and fibrosis. Histopathological analysis in biopsy-proven MASLD patients further supported these findings, showing a significant association between <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection and increased NAS score, fibrosis stage, and prevalence of MASH. Notably, the combination of <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection and G-allele PNPLA3 appeared to exacerbate MASLD severity beyond individual effects.</p> Conclusions <p>Our results suggest that <i>H</i>. <i>pylori</i> infection may play a role in the progression of liver injury and fibrosis in patients with MASLD, especially in those with specific genetic predispositions.</p>","author":"Facundo Maiorana","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"732c0120e4afc679dbfdb51a93304e8f19a25a7004e970152a3815ece6f5ae8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
