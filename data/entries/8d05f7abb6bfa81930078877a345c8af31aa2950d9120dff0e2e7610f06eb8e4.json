To understand the regulations and roles of the cellular ultrastructure, it is crucial to grasp their 3D structures at the nanometer level in a quantitative manner. Recent advances in serial section EM such as serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) have enabled the automatic acquisition of volume EM data. Reconstruction of the volume EM data has made it possible to observe 3D nanometer-scale structures, such as organelles. However, the reconstruction requires a significant amount of labor-intensive work, leading to the limited number of samples to be analyzed in many cases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8d05f7abb6bfa81930078877a345c8af31aa2950d9120dff0e2e7610f06eb8e4","category":"Environment"}
