{"title":"Electrochemical Aptasensor for Label-Free Detection of Oxytetracycline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0062/v1","date":1719818748000,"content":"Oxytetracycline (OTC) serves as a widely employed antibiotic in veterinary treatment and prevention of infections, potentially leaving residues in animal-derived food products, such as milk, that are consumed by humans. Given the detrimental effects of prolonged human exposure, it becomes imperative to develop precise and sensitive methods for monitoring the presence of OTC in food. This work reports on the fabrication of a label-free electrochemical aptasensor for the determination of OTC as a proof-of-concept.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67e21647f74ae589f59bb860e96e64852140feee92857fa712303957ea45c984","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
