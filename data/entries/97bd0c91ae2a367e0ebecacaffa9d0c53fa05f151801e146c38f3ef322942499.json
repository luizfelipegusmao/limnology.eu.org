{"title":"Preparation of a Water-Soluble Aminated Lignin and Its Structure Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0853/v1","date":1712925653000,"content":"Lignin is insoluble in water, limiting its use in the synthesis of adhesives. Therefore, in order to increase the amount of lignin raw materials used in the synthesis of adhesives, a kind of aminated lignin compounds was prepared through lignin amination reaction, and conducting structural analysis in this paper. The particle size of the amino lignin is about 100 nm, with the weight average molecular weight of 57,627 g/mol and a water solubility of 0.45g/100ml. The reaction mechanisms were proposed that the phenolic hydroxyl groups of lignin react with ammonia molecules, and thereby successfully introducing amino groups to generate the aminated lignin compounds. Therefore, this article enriches the scientific theory of lignin reactions and provides reference for the widespread application of lignin raw materials in the field of adhesives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97bd0c91ae2a367e0ebecacaffa9d0c53fa05f151801e146c38f3ef322942499","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
