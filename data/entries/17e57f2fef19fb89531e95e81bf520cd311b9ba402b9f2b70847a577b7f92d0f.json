{"title":"Phenomenological Modeling of TRIP Steels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2175/v1","date":1724980834000,"content":"A constant effort is made in the physical metallurgy of transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels. These are multiphase steels, whose mechanical behavior depends on the different phases present, the intrinsic strength of each phase, the work hardening of each constituent and the austenite to martensite transformation, among others. Hard and soft phases can be distinguished in these steels and both stress and strain are distributed between them. The objective of this work was to simulate the stress-strain behavior for two TRIP steels. Bouquerelâ€™s model was modified to account for the initial martensite, a moderate hard austenite and adjustable strain hardening parameters. The austenite fraction that transforms into martensite was computed through an Olson and Cohen model. The Mecking-Kocks model was used to evaluate the increment in the dislocation density and the Rodriguez-Gutierrez model, to compute the hardening of martensite. Ferrite is considered a soft phase, martensite and bainite, hard phases and austenite, a phase with a moderate hardness. The routine was implemented in MATLAB, and results were compared with those obtained experimentally in a tension test of two TRIP steels of the same composition but different heat treatments, obtaining in both cases a good agreement for the stress-strain-curves.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17e57f2fef19fb89531e95e81bf520cd311b9ba402b9f2b70847a577b7f92d0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
