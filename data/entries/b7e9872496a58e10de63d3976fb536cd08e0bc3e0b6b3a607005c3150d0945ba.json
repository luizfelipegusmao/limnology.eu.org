{"title":"A Methodology to Optimize Natural By-Products Mixes for Rammed Earth Construction Based on the Taguchi Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1559/v1","date":1729504781000,"content":"In this investigation, four distinct by-products of natural materials were used to compose a mix for rammed earth construction. The mix of these materials, which have various granulometry, affords many potential combinations, making the analysis of different combinations highly complex. The Taguchi method, a statistical approach renowned for significantly reducing the number of ex-periments in complex systems, was employed to address this challenge. Each of the four ma-terials was assessed across four different levels, with moisture content also factored in as a pa-rameter within the statistical analysis. Two separate studies were conducted to obtain two optimal com-binations of the materials to enhance the dry density and the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS). Taguchi method demonstrated its efficacy in predicting the optimal combination of mix-tures for enhancing both objective parameters. A natural by-product mix demonstrated its po-tential for use as a building material. The enhancement of the dry density due to a modification of the mixâ€™s Particle Size Distribution (PSD) did not produce a direct improvement in the mix UCS. The factor to be prioritized should be the mechanical strength, rather than the dry density of the sample.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7e9872496a58e10de63d3976fb536cd08e0bc3e0b6b3a607005c3150d0945ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
