{"title":"Alcohol dehydrogenases regulated by a MYB44 transcription factor underlie Lauraceae citral biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1674/7310989?rss=1","date":1697155200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Lineage-specific terpenoids have arisen throughout the evolution of land plants and are believed to play a role in interactions between plants and the environment. Species-specific gene clusters in plants have provided insight on the evolution of secondary metabolism. Lauraceae is an ecologically important plant family whose members are also of considerable economic value given their monoterpene contents. However, the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of monoterpenes remains yet to be elucidated. Here, a Lauraceae-specific citral biosynthetic gene cluster (CGC) was identified and investigated using a multifaceted approach that combined phylogenetic, collinearity, and biochemical analyses. The CGC comprises MYB44 as a regulator and 2 alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) as modifying enzymes, which derived from species-specific tandem and proximal duplication events. Activity and substrate divergence of the ADHs has resulted in the fruit of mountain pepper (<span>Litsea cubeba</span>), a core Lauraceae species, consisting of more than 80% citral. In addition, MYB44 negatively regulates citral biosynthesis by directly binding to the promoters of the ADH-encoding genes. The aggregation of citral biosynthetic pathways suggests that they may form the basis of important characteristics that enhance adaptability. The findings of this study provide insights into the evolution of and the regulatory mechanisms involved in plant terpene biosynthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"136df10bb355e0481fe13a85ce041f46e958023466e953059b83db2987f1407c","category":"Environment"}
