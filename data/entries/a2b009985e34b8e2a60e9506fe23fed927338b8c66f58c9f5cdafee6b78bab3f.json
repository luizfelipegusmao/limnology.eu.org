Acquiring large EM data volumes is easier than ever, and tools for analysis like deep learning are helping to extract meaningful information more efficiently. In addition, combining strategies like on-section fluorescence labelling with array tomography for correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) imaging can unite molecular identification and ultrastructural detail in significant ways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a2b009985e34b8e2a60e9506fe23fed927338b8c66f58c9f5cdafee6b78bab3f","category":"Environment"}
