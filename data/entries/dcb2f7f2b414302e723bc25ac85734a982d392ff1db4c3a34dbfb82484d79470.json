{"title":"Volatile Constituents of Some Myrtaceous Edible and Medicinal Fruits from the Brazilian Amazon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1327/v1","date":1711098058000,"content":"Native and exotic fruits from the Amazon have varied characteristics, with aroma being a decisive factor in attracting and accepting them and their medicinal use as a nutraceutical supplement. This work aimed to analyze the chemical constituents of the volatile concentrates of some Myrtaceous fruit species sampled in the Brazilian Amazon. The fruit's pulps were subjected to simultaneous distillation-extraction, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze their volatile chemical composition. In the volatile concentrate of Eugenia stipitata (Araçá-boi) were identified α-pinene (17.5%), citronellyl butanoate (15.6%), and pogostol (13.5%) as primary constituents; in Eugenia uniflora (Ginja) were curzerene (30.5%), germacrone (15.4%), atractylone (13.1%), and (E)-β-ocimene (11.1%); in Myrciaria dubia (Camu-Camu) were α-pinene (55.8%), (E)-β-ocimene (13.1%), and α-terpineol (10.0%); in Psidium guajava (Goiaba) were (2E)-hexenal (21.7%), hexanal (15.4%), caryophylla-4(12),8(13)-dien-5-β-ol (10.5%), caryophyllene oxide (9.2%), and pogostol (8.3%); and in Psidium guineense (Araçá) were limonene (25.2%), ethyl butanoate (12.1%), epi-β-bisabolol (9.8%), and α-pinene (9.2%). The analyzed fruit species' volatile concentrates presented a significant diversity of constituents with a predominance of functional groups, such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and fatty acid derivatives, originating from the plant's secondary metabolism and representing significant importance regarding their nutritional and medicinal uses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcb2f7f2b414302e723bc25ac85734a982d392ff1db4c3a34dbfb82484d79470","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
