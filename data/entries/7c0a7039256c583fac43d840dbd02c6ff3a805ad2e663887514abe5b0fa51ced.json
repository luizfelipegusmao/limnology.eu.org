{"title":"Effects of PFAS on human liver transporters: implications for health outcomes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/200/2/213/7667880?rss=1","date":1715212800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have become internationally recognized over the past three decades as persistent organic pollutants used in the production of various consumer and industrial goods. Research efforts continue to gauge the risk that historically used, and newly produced, PFAS may cause to human health. Numerous studies report toxic effects of PFAS on the human liver as well as increased serum cholesterol levels in adults. A major concern with PFAS, also dubbed “forever chemicals,” is that they accumulate in the liver and kidney and persist in serum. The mechanisms responsible for their disposition and excretion in humans are poorly understood. A better understanding of the interaction of PFAS with liver transporters, as it pertains to the disposition of PFAS and other xenobiotics, could provide mechanistic insight into human health effects and guide efforts toward risk assessment of compounds in development. This review summarizes the current state of the literature on the emerging relationships (eg, substrates, inhibitors, modulators of gene expression) between PFAS and specific hepatic transporters. The adaptive and toxicological responses of hepatocytes to PFAS that reveal linkages to pathologies and epidemiological findings are highlighted. The evidence suggests that our understanding of the molecular landscape of PFAS must improve to determine their impact on the expression and function of hepatocyte transporters that play a key role in PFAS or other xenobiotic disposition. From here, we can assess what role these changes may have in documented human health outcomes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"7c0a7039256c583fac43d840dbd02c6ff3a805ad2e663887514abe5b0fa51ced","category":"Environment"}
