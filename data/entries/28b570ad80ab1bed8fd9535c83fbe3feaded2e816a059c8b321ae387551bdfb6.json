{"title":"Numerical Modelling of Vortex-Based Superconducting Memory Cells: Dynamics and Geometrical Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2020/v1","date":1724834872000,"content":"The lack of dense random-access memory is one of the main obstacles to the development of digital superconducting computers. It has been suggested that AVRAM cells, based on the storage of a single Abrikosov vortex — the smallest quantized object in superconductors — can enable drastic miniaturization to the nanometer scale. In this work, we present numerical modeling of such cells using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. The cell represents a fluxonic quantum dot containing a small superconducting island, an asymmetric notch for vortex entrance, a guiding track, and a vortex trap. We determine the optimal geometrical parameters for operation at zero magnetic field and the conditions for controllable vortex manipulation by short current pulses. We report ultra-fast vortex motion with velocities more than an order of magnitude faster than those expected for macroscopic superconductors. This phenomenon is attributed to strong interactions with the edges of a mesoscopic island, combined with the nonlinear reduction of flux-flow viscosity due to nonequilibrium effects in the track. Our results show that such cells can be scaled down to sizes comparable to the London penetration depth, ∼100 nm, and can enable ultrafast switching on the picosecond scale with ultra-low energy per operation, ∼10−19 J.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28b570ad80ab1bed8fd9535c83fbe3feaded2e816a059c8b321ae387551bdfb6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
