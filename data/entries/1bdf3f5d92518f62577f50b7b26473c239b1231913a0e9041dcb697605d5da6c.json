These include transmission of UV through the optical media, which enables the animals to exploit the shorter wavelengths characteristic of twilight, and a shift in the peak spectral reflectance of the <i>tapetum lucidum</i> (TL) from around 640 nm in summer to around 450 nm in winter, which increases retinal illumination at short wavelengths.\n\nEnhanced sensitivity to short wavelengths is likely to enhance the contrast of some objects and hence the ability of <i>Rangifer</i> to discriminate forage plants and to detect other animals (conspecifics or predators) against a snowy background under low illuminance.\n\nThere is, nevertheless, currently no evidence of any specific boreal adaptation in their visual system: (i) The eyes of <i>Rangifer</i>, and by inference the area of the dilated pupil, are no larger than expected based on the allometry of eye size in ruminants. (ii) There is no evidence of a change in the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors associated with detection of UVa. (iii) Transmission of UV through the anterior eye is not unique to <i>Rangifer</i>. (iv) The blue shift in the reflectance of the winter TL appears to be a passive response to prolonged dilation of the pupil and there is no a priori reason not to predict the same response in other large ungulates exposed to low light levels. (v) There is no conclusive evidence of a seasonal shift in absolute retinal sensitivity in <i>Rangifer</i>. (vi) Weak circadian organisation in <i>Rangifer</i> has tentatively been linked to mutations within the circadian molecular clockwork but it remains unclear to what extent this represents a specific adaptation to high latitude.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/09/24/reindeer\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Nicholas J.
