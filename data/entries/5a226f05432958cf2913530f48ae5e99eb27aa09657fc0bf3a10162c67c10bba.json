{"title":"Lower respiratory tract microbiota in patients with clinically suspected nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease according to the presence of gastroesophageal reflux","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309446","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Eun Jeong Won, Yu Jeong Lee, Moon-Ju Kim, Tae-Jong Kim, Hong-Joon Shin, Tae-Ok Kim, Yong-Soo Kwon</p>\r\n\r\nAlthough gastroesophageal reflux has been recognized as one of the risk factors of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) progression, the effect of reflux on the lower respiratory tract microbiota has not been studied in detail. We investigated the composition of the lower respiratory tract microbiota in patients with clinically suspected NTM-PD, comparing them based on the presence of reflux. Forty-seven patients suspected of having NTM-PD were enrolled and assigned according to presence of reflux (n = 22) and non- reflux (n = 25). We performed a pepsin ELISA assay to identify the presence of reflux and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing to evaluate the microbiota in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. There were no significant differences in the diversity or composition of the lower respiratory microbiota between the NTM-PD and non-NTM-PD groups. Bacterial richness was observed in the non-reflux group than in the reflux group [<i>P</i> = 0.03] and a cluster in the reflux group was observed. The reflux group showed a predominance for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> or <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> among the NTM-PD group and for <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, or <i>Eikenella</i> species among the non-NTM-PD group. The non-reflux groups presented diverse patterns. A linear discriminant analysis and volcano plot demonstrated that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, <i>H</i>. <i>haemolyticus</i>, <i>Selenomonas artemidis</i>, and <i>Dolosigranulum pigrum</i> were specifically associated with the NTM-PD reflux group, while <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> was specifically associated with the non-NTM-PD reflux group. These observations confirm that the lower respiratory microbiota is consistently altered by reflux but not in NTM-PD.","author":"Eun Jeong Won","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5a226f05432958cf2913530f48ae5e99eb27aa09657fc0bf3a10162c67c10bba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
