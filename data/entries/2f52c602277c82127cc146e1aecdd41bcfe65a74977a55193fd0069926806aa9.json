{"title":"Towards High-Throughput Catalyst Innovation via Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.537/7719983?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Catalysis is a central theme in science [<a href=\"#ozae044.537-B1\">1</a>]. Over 90% of contemporary chemical processes, which are crucial for sustaining our food sources, purifying water and air, and meeting raw material demands, require catalysis. As we strive for sustainability, advancing catalyst technologies becomes imperative, particularly in vital processes like water splitting, hydrogen carrier production, and CO<sub>2</sub> utilization etc. These endeavors necessitate significant catalyst innovations, and electron microscopy is an indispensable tool in this pursuit. Given that catalytic active sites operate at the atomic scale, electron microscopy remains unparalleled in probing both chemical and structural intricacies at this level in practical catalysts with high-surface areas.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2f52c602277c82127cc146e1aecdd41bcfe65a74977a55193fd0069926806aa9","category":"Environment"}
