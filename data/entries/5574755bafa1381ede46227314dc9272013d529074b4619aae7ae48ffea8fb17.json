The reactions furnished the target adducts in satisfactory yields and good enantiomeric excesses. A tentative of computational study is presented aiming to understand the reaction mechanism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5574755bafa1381ede46227314dc9272013d529074b4619aae7ae48ffea8fb17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
