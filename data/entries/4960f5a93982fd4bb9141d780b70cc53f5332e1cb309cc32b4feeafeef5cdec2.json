{"title":"Micro-Nanoparticle Characterization: Establishing Underpinnings for Proper Identification and Nanotechnology-Enabled Remediation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0802/v1","date":1723511645000,"content":"Secondary microplastic (MPL) and nanoplastic (NPL) particles exhibit different physiochemical characteristics that attenuate their toxicities in different ways: some particle types being well documented (primary) while other (secondary), are more unknown. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman, Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-NMR), Curie Point-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (CP-gc-MS), Induced Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), Field Flow Fractionation-Multiple Angle Light Scattering (FFF-MALS), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetry (TGA), Differential Mobility Particle [Sizing] (DMPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microspectroscopy (STXM) are re-viewed as part of a suite of characterization methods for physiochemical ascertainment and distinguishment. Organizations, like the water treatment or waste management industry, and those in groups that bring awareness to this issue, which are in direct contact with the hydrosphere, can utilize these techniques in order to sense and remediate this plastic polymer pollution. The primary goal of this review paper is to highlight the extent of plastic pollution in the environment as well as introduce its effect on the biodiversity of the planet while underscoring current characterization techniques in this field of research. The secondary goal involves illustrating current and theoretical avenues in which future research needs to address and optimize MPL/NPL remediation, utilizing nanotechnology, before this sleeping giant of a problem awakens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4960f5a93982fd4bb9141d780b70cc53f5332e1cb309cc32b4feeafeef5cdec2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
