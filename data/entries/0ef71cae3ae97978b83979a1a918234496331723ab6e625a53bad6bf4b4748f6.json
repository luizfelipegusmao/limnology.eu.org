[<a href=\"#ozae044.867-B1\">1-3</a>] Peptoids are a type of short-chain polymer that mimics peptides, with side chains attached to the backbone amide nitrogen instead of the Î±-carbon. [<a href=\"#ozae044.867-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.867-B5\">5</a>] As compared to peptides, peptoids have no hydrogen bond donors or chiral centers along the backbone. The structure and function of peptoids depend on the side chain characteristics and sequence. This unique flexibility makes peptoids an ideal platform for studying ionic interactions in the design of polymer nanostructures by accurately engineering the location of ionic groups. In this work, we use cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and single particles analysis (SPA) to directly visualize the effect of protonation of ionic groups on the self-assembly of polypeptoids in solution</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0ef71cae3ae97978b83979a1a918234496331723ab6e625a53bad6bf4b4748f6","category":"Environment"}
