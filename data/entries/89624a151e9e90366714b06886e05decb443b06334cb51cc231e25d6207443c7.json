{"title":"Oligodendroglia-to-pericyte conversion after lipopolysaccharide exposure is gender-dependent","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308132","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Qingting Yu, Linyuan Zhang, Ting Xu, Jiapeng Shao, Falei Yuan, Zuisu Yang, Yuncheng Wu, Haiyan Lyu</p>\r\n\r\nTo investigate the sex-dependent differentiation of Sox10 cells and their response to pathological conditions such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure or ischemia, we utilized Sox10 Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup>, tdTomato mice. Tamoxifen administration induced the expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP) in these cells, facilitating their subsequent tracking and analysis after LPS injection and ischemia via immunofluorescence staining. Propidium iodide (PI) was injected to label necrotic cells following LPS administration. We found that the conversion of Sox10 cells to pericytes in female mice was significantly higher than in male mice, especially in those exposed to LPS. After LPS injection, the number of PI<sup>+</sup> necrotic cells were significantly greater in females than in males. Moreover, RFP<sup>+</sup> cells did not co-localize with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b). Similarly, after brain ischemia, RFP<sup>+</sup> cells did not express cluster of differentiation 13 (CD13), neuronal nuclei (NeuN), GFAP, or ionised calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1). These findings indicate that the conversion of Sox10 cells to pericytes following LPS exposure is sex-dependent, with neither male nor female groups showing differentiation into other cell types after LPS exposure or under ischemic conditions. The differences in LPS-induced necrosis of pericytes between sexes may explain the variations in the conversion of Sox10 cells to pericytes in both sexes.","author":"Qingting Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"89624a151e9e90366714b06886e05decb443b06334cb51cc231e25d6207443c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
