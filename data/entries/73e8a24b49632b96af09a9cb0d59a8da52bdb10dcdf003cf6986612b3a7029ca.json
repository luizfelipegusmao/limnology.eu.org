{"title":"Navigate Change and Innovation: Strategically Integrating Emerging Technologies in Release Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1184/v1","date":1713359819000,"content":"The enterprise software sector is experiencing a significant transformation driven by rapid technological progress and evolving business needs. An effective release management process is crucial for the solution providers and customers, as they incorporate the principles of Industry 4.0 and 5.0. With the growing dependence on software solutions and services, ensuring their quality, reliability, and security is highly necessary. The release management process incorporates strategic planning, regression testing, accurate deployment, and continuous monitoring of software updates. However, the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) create a unique challenge to the release management process. The existing research needs to address the necessary adaptations for Industry 5.0, mainly in product-based software organizations, to the release management process without a change management system. After working with several software solution stakeholders, based on the responses from SaaS project stakeholders, we have presented a revised software release readiness workflow by incorporating a change management module. The preliminary result based on data over a limited period of time indicates that the revised workflow has the potential to improve the management of slippage, particularly by more effectively addressing NFR-related issues, thereby resulting in more predictable and reliable release cycles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73e8a24b49632b96af09a9cb0d59a8da52bdb10dcdf003cf6986612b3a7029ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
