{"title":"Etiology of a Fish Kill, Including the Endangered Tidewater Goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), in a Northeastern Pacific Coastal Lagoon","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12237-023-01300-z","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Ecological disturbances such as fish kills can negatively impact ecosystem processes in coastal lagoons. To gain an understanding of factors causing fish kills, we examined conditions associated with a summertime fish kill in a northeastern Pacific coastal lagoon (Rodeo Lagoon, CA, USA). Examination of available data indicated the fish kill was likely caused by hypoxia involving the following etiology: (1) strong onshore winds (up to 12 m/s) mixed a stratified water column, (2) water column mixing transported nutrients from near the bed into the photic zone, (3) increased nutrient concentrations in the photic zone (&gt; 200%) together with high solar irradiance fueled a phytoplankton bloom, (4) death and decomposition of phytoplankton (72% decrease in abundance) contributed to biological oxygen demand that led to (5) hypoxic conditions (as low as 0.6 mg/L) that caused the fish kill. The event resulted in the death of an estimated 3677 Tidewater Goby (<em>Eucyclogobius newberryi</em>), a species listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act, and numerous (but not enumerated) Threespine Stickleback (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>), unidentified sculpins (Cottidae), and macroinvertebrates (primarily Amphipoda). The processes contributing to the event are likely re-occurring phenomena responsible for observed periodic fish kills. Coastal lagoons with limited freshwater inflows and connection to the Pacific Ocean may retain nutrients and be susceptible to similar events.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"bfe64c2f68c047fe6253b5406bd5c5a47dbaaa84cdd841230ce67a31f2f385f4","category":"Environment"}
