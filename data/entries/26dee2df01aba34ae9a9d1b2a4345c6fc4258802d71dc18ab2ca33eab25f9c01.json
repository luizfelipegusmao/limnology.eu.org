The present review paper explores the role of lactic fermentation in African Indigenous vegetables, emphasizing its impact on food safety and shelf life extension. The paper systematically examines the biochemical mechanisms of lactic acid bacteria in suppressing pathogenic microorganisms and spoilage organisms, thereby improving the safety and shelf life of these vegetables. Additionally, it briefly addresses how lactic fermentation contributes to the nutritional and sensory qualities of Indigenous vegetables, which are crucial for their marketability. The review further delves into the economic implications of integrating lactic fermentation of African Indigenous vegetables practices into local agricultural and food systems, considering aspects such as cost-effectiveness, market potential, and value addition of African Indigenous vegetables. By synthesizing the current research and practices, the paper highlights the dual benefits of lactic fermentation of African Indigenous vegetables in enhancing food security and creating economic opportunities in Africa. The findings suggest that leveraging traditional fermentation techniques could significantly bolster the shelf life, safety, and economic viability of African Indigenous vegetables, offering a sustainable approach to food preservation and economic development.</p>","author":"Irakoze Marie Lys","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"26dee2df01aba34ae9a9d1b2a4345c6fc4258802d71dc18ab2ca33eab25f9c01","category":"Environment"}
