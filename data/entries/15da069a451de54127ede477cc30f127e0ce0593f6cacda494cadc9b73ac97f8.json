Therefore, it is great significance that replacement fish meal using other protein sources for the sustainable development of aquaculture industry. In this study, fermented cottonseed meal (FCM) and fermented rapeseed meal (FRM) were used to replace fish meal in Chinese mitten crab. The ratio of FCM and FRM were set according to 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1, and were supplemented into 25% fish meal (FM-25) and 15% fish meal (FM-15) diets, respectively, to formulated 6 kinds of experimental diets. The feeding duration was 8 weeks. The results showed that the weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) of crabs fed the diets containing 25% fish meal were significantly higher than crabs fed 15% fish meal diets. At 25% fish meal level, the WG and SGR of crabs fed the diet with 1FCM:1FRM were significantly higher than those fed the 1FCM:2FRM and 2FCM:1FRM diets. At 25% fish meal level, the crude lipid (CL) content of crabs fed the diet with 1FCM:2FRM were significantly higher than those fed the 2FCM:1FRM and 1FCM:1FRM. At 25% fish meal level, the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and peroxidase (POD) of crabs fed the diet with 1FCM:2FRM were significantly higher than those fed the 2FCM:1FRM and 1FCM:1FRM. At 25% fish meal level, the relative expression of peroxiredoxin (PRX) of crabs fed the diet with 1FCM:1FRM were significantly higher than those fed the 2FCM:1FRM and 1FCM:2FRM. In summary, diets supplemented with a mixture of fermented cotton meal and fermented rapeseed meal (1:1) can significantly improve the growth and antioxidant capacity of Chinese mitten crab.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15da069a451de54127ede477cc30f127e0ce0593f6cacda494cadc9b73ac97f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
