{"title":"Synthesis of Carbon Quantum Dots for Excellent Energy Density in Supercapacitors: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1932/v1","date":1719477544000,"content":"Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) have emerged as promising nanomaterials for enhancing the performance of supercapacitors, offering unique advantages such as high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and tunable surface chemistry. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the synthesis, characterization, and integration of CQDs into supercapacitor devices. Various synthesis methods, including chemical oxidation, hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, microwave-assisted synthesis, and pyrolysis, are discussed, highlighting their impact on the structural and electrochemical properties of CQDs. Characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy are elucidated for assessing the morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties of CQDs. The integration of CQDs into supercapacitors, including their utilization in composite electrodes, binder-free electrodes, and doping strategies, is explored to enhance specific capacitance, energy density, power density, and cycle stability of the devices. Challenges and future perspectives in the field are outlined, emphasizing the need for scalable synthesis methods, enhanced electrochemical performance, and sustainable device engineering to realize the full potential of CQD-based supercapacitors for various energy storage applications. This review aims to provide insights into the current state of research and guide future endeavors towards developing high-performance and environmentally sustainable energy storage technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db086fb38b14a7f0adfcfc1a9164ba2d60aed149d3925f0a483e8c908b650384","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
