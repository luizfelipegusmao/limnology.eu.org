{"title":"Honeypots in Cybersecurity: Their Analysis, Evaluation and Importance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0946/v1","date":1723551243000,"content":"Honeypots are vital security tools that enable cybersecurity specialists to scrutinize the tactics employed by attackers. By doing so, they can get valuable insights into existing and upcoming internet dangers. Cyber-attacks are in a perpetual evolution, increasingly sophisticated and tailored to exploit specific vulnerabilities. Hence, it is imperative for both organizations and individuals not only to consider but also implement methods to safeguard themselves against cyberattacks and malware. This paper assesses a specific group of honeypot systems by considering detection range, emulation accuracy, data quality, dependability, scalability, performance, extensibility, installation options, setup difficulty, and maintenance requirements. Furthermore, it provides conclusions regarding the relative effectiveness of diverse honeypot systems in different situations. As a part of the research, it analyzes the latest progress and innovations in honeypot development, including enhancements in machine learning, heightened automation, integration with other security tools, cloud-based honeypots, and deception technology by using simulated assaults to showcase the logging and recording capabilities of these honeypots in capturing attack information. After carefully analyzing each honeypot, each has unique advantages, disadvantages, and special characteristics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd7d1a3a5c27bac58096579816fac1300842da29e873692ba02ae6445c82ec16","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
