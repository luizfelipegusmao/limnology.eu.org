{"title":"Delivery of a post-natal neonatal jaundice education intervention improves knowledge among mothers at Jinja Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301512","date":1712239200000,"content":"<p>by Businge Alinaitwe, Nkunzimaana Francis, Tom Denis Ngabirano, Charles Kato, Petranilla Nakamya, Rachel Uwimbabazi, Adam Kaplan, Molly McCoy, Elizabeth Ayebare, Jameel Winter</p>\r\nBackground <p>Neonatal jaundice (NNJ) is a major contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality. As many infants are discharged by 24 hours of age, mothers are key in detecting severe forms of jaundice. Mothers with limited knowledge of NNJ have a hard time identifying these infants who could go on to have the worst outcomes. This study aimed to determine the effect of a jaundice education package delivered to mothers prior to hospital discharge on maternal knowledge after discharge.</p> Methods <p>This was a before and after interventional study involving an education package delivered through a video message and informational voucher. At 10–14 days after discharge, participants were followed up via telephone to assess their post-intervention knowledge. A paired t-test was used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on knowledge improvement. Linear regression was used to determine predictors of baseline knowledge and of change in knowledge score.</p> Results <p>Of the 250 mothers recruited, 188 were fit for analysis. The mean knowledge score was 10.02 before and 14.61 after the intervention, a significant difference (p&lt;0.001). Factors determining higher baseline knowledge included attendance of 4 or more antenatal visits (p &lt; 0.001), having heard about NNJ previously (p &lt; 0.001), having experienced an antepartum illness (p = 0.019) and higher maternal age (p = 0.015). Participants with poor baseline knowledge (β = 7.523) and moderate baseline knowledge (β = 3.114) had much more to gain from the intervention relative to those with high baseline knowledge (p &lt; 0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>Maternal knowledge of jaundice can be increased using a simple educational intervention, especially in settings where the burden of detection often falls on the mother. Further study is needed to determine the impact of this intervention on care seeking and infant outcomes.</p>","author":"Businge Alinaitwe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4e10e0289afd7c40d64f5dd3426924295a8800a19d4ef5c9fae68a6c9fe53e76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
