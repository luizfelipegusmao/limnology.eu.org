{"title":"No Mow May: Generating buzz and community science action to manage yards for bees and other pollinators","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11252-024-01582-6","date":1733011200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Urban ecosystems can provide diverse habitats for enhancing pollinator biodiversity. Here, we describe efforts to initiate a community wide conversation around pollinator friendly yard (lawn and garden) management practices in Appleton, Wisconsin, USA, using a series of projects. We began with wild bee census work at local environmental education centers and city parks, then expanded to community science common gardens as part of the “Bring Your Own Bees” project, and shifted gears to implement a No Mow May campaign. We outline the timeline of events that led to the creation of the Pollenablers group, which allowed us to work alongside city legislators and community leaders to bring No Mow May to Appleton. Through our experiences, we learned about the timescales and processes of small-town government structures, and the challenges of engaging in open science that garners media attention. Engaging in community conversations across scales was an essential component, including individual discussions, co-generation of research goals in alignment with community builders at Pollenablers meetings, and collaborating with political leaders to align legislative resolutions with research objectives. We hope that our insights inspire others to continue to “bee” change-makers in their local communities, and build systems of reciprocity to cultivate richer human, and more biodiverse, urban ecosystems.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"5bb99aefba668f0d24dc189db216a7dc95abf07239eb372f38b15f4cb0772c40","category":"Environment"}
