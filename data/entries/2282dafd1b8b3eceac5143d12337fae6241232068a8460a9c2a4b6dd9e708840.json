{"title":"Functional Nano-Metallic Coatings for Solar Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1087/v1","date":1728909925000,"content":"We have collected theoretical arguments supporting the functional role of nano-metallic coatings of solar cells, which enhance their efficiency via by plasmon strengthening of absorption of sun-light photons and reduction of binding energy of photo-excitons. The quantum character of plasmonic effect related with the absorption of photons (called as optical plasmonic effect) is described in terms of Fermi golden rule for quantum transitions of semiconductor band electrons induced by plasmons from a nano-metallic coating. The plasmonic effect related with the lowering of exciton binding energy (called as electrical plasmonic effect) is also quantumly characterized with particular significance for metalized perovskite solar cells. Quantum coupling between plasmons in nanoparticles from a coating with band electrons in a semiconductor substrate significantly modifies material properties (dielectric functions) both of particles and of a semiconductor, beyond the ability of a classical electrodynamics description.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2282dafd1b8b3eceac5143d12337fae6241232068a8460a9c2a4b6dd9e708840","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
