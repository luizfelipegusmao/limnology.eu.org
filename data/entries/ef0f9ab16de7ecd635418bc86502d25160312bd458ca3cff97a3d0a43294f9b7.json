{"title":"COL6A3 Exosomes Promoting Tumor Dissemination and Metastasis in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1228/v1","date":1718704292000,"content":"Our study explores the role of cancer-derived extracellular exosomes (EXs), particularly focusing on collagen alpha-3 (VI; COL6A3), in facilitating tumor dissemination and metastasis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We found that COL6A3 is expressed in aggressive ES2 derivatives, SKOV3 overexpressing COL6A3 (SKOV3/COL6A3), and mesenchymal-type ovarian carcinoma stromal progenitor cells (MSC-OCSPCs), as well as their EXs, but not in less aggressive SKOV3 cells or ES2 cells with COL6A3 knockdown (ES2/shCOL6A3). High COL6A3 expression correlates with worse overall survival in EOC patients, as evidenced by TCGA and GEO data analysis. In vitro experiments showed that EXs from MSC-OCSPCs or SKOV3/COL6A3 cells significantly enhance invasion ability in ES2 or SKOV3/COL6A3 cells, respectively (both, P &amp;lt;0.001). In contrast, ES2 cells with ES2/shCOL6A3 EXs exhibit reduced invasion ability (p&amp;lt;0.001). In vivo, the average disseminated tumor numbers in the peritoneal cavity were significantly greater in mice receiving intraperitoneally injected SKOV3/COL6A3 cells than in SKOV3 cells (p&amp;lt;0.001). Furthermore, mice intravenously (IV) injected with SKOV3/COL6A3 cells and SKOV3/COL6A3-EXs showed increased lung colonization compared to mice injected with SKOV3 cells and PBS (p=0.007) or SKOV3/COL6A3 cells and PBS (p=0.039). Knockdown of COL6A3 or treatment with EXs inhibitor GW4869 or rapamycin-abolished COL6A3-EXs may suppress the aggressiveness in EOC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef0f9ab16de7ecd635418bc86502d25160312bd458ca3cff97a3d0a43294f9b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
