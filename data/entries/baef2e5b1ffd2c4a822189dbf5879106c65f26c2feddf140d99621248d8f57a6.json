{"title":"Commensal microbiome dysbiosis elicits interleukin-8 signaling to drive fibrotic skin disease","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae273/7717709?rss=1","date":1722297600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Wound healing is an intensely studied topic involved in many relevant pathophysiological processes, including fibrosis. Despite the large interest in fibrosis, the network that is related to commensal microbiota and skin fibrosis remains mysterious. Here, we pay attention to keloid, a classical yet intractable skin fibrotic disease to establish the association between commensal microbiota to scaring tissue. Our histological data reveal the presence of microbiota in the keloids. 16S rRNA sequencing characterizes microbial composition and divergence between the pathological and normal skin tissues. Moreover, the data show elevation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in both the circulation and keloid tissue, which elicited the collagen accumulation and migratory program of dermal fibroblasts via CXCR1/2 receptor. Our research provides insights into the pathology of human fibrotic diseases, advocating commensal bacteria and IL-8 signaling as useful targets in future interventions of recurrent keloid disease.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"baef2e5b1ffd2c4a822189dbf5879106c65f26c2feddf140d99621248d8f57a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
