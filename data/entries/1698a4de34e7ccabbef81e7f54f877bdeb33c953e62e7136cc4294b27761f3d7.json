(2024). Insectivorous birds and bats outperform ants in the top-down regulation of arthropods across strata of a Japanese temperate forest. <i>Journal of Animal Ecology.</i>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14146\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14146</a>. Top-down predators exert strong effects on prey populations. Theoretical and empirical studies investigating the cascading effects of predators on biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem functionality have been central to advancing ecology and conservation biology. Yet, how intraguild predation and niche overlap drive the strength and direction of trophic cascades across forest strata is still barely understood. In a study published in this issue, Sivault et al. (2024) investigated the impacts of excluding vertebrate (birds and bats) and invertebrate (ants) predators on arthropod herbivores and plant damage in understory and canopy forest strata. The study finds that birds and bats (but not ants) have negative impacts on herbivore density, which, in turn, benefits plants by reducing leaf damage. Additionally, the effects of vertebrate predators are similar across strata. The authors also show that herbivore density and herbivory are greater in the understory compared to the canopy strata. Sivault et al. (2024) demonstrate that intraguild predation and niche overlap dictate the strength and direction of trophic cascades in forest ecosystems. In addition, these findings shed new light on forest ecology and conservation, especially considering the potential negative effects of climate change on top predators.</p>","author":"Thiago Gonçalves‐Souza","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"1698a4de34e7ccabbef81e7f54f877bdeb33c953e62e7136cc4294b27761f3d7","category":"Environment"}
