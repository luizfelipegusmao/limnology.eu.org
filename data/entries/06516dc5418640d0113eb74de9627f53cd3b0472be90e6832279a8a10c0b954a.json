{"title":"Research criteria towards an interdisciplinary Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention assessment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/doi/10.1093/oxfclm/kgae010/7701783?rss=1","date":1719619200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>With surface temperatures already reaching unprecedented highs, resulting in significant adverse consequences for societies and ecosystems, there are increasing calls to expand research into climate interventions, including Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI). However, research and dissemination are currently fragmented and would benefit from a comprehensive international assessment of the current state of knowledge regarding impacts, risks, and recommendations for future SAI research directions. The goals of a scientific assessment would be to describe the current state of SAI research and evaluate proposed scenario-strategy combinations through well-designed evaluation guidelines. The suggested iterative approach would integrate natural and social science considerations to guide future research toward more plausible scenarios and strategy development to reduce uncertainties and minimize the risks of SAI. Here, we outline multidisciplinary research criteria to guide the assessment process and provide an overview of the benefits and risks of proposed SAI applications. We group these criteria into three categories: (1) technical and design requirements, (2) response and impacts, and (3) societal considerations. Including all three categories in a comprehensive assessment of potential SAI applications outlined here promotes enhanced interdisciplinary and international collaborations, intentionally engaging the underrepresented Global South. The assessment structure further promotes the need for recurring reports every few years with globally representative participation and could also be applicable to other Solar Radiation Modification methods or combined approaches. Such assessments are necessary to align research with considerations for decision-makers and the public on the feasibility of SAI in reducing the impacts of climate change and its potential societal and ecological trade-offs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Oxford Open Climate Change Current Issue","siteHash":"00d34e28b1e6fdd64576c95b4b9bf33bcd15bb32fadd247b4a29ecaac9c1ad73","entryHash":"06516dc5418640d0113eb74de9627f53cd3b0472be90e6832279a8a10c0b954a","category":"Environment"}
