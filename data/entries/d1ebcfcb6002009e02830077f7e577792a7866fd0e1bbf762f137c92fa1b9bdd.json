{"title":"Guidelines for Managing Radon Hazards in Tourist Volcanic Caves in Spain","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GH001067?af=R","date":1718348400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Tourist volcanic caves are in high demand for ecotourism and geotourism lovers, as well as by sun and beach tourists as a complementary activity during their holidays. There are six tourist volcanic caves in the Canary Islands, all of them managed by the local administration of the island. The managers of these caves must ensure the safety of visitors and workers, who are exposed to natural hazards, such as radon, inherent to the environment in which the activity takes place. The methodology for analyzing natural radon radiation is based on the latest studies published by experts in this field and on previous experiences in tourist caves. This article proposes a protocol for the correct management of radon in tourist caves in the Canary Islands, adapted to current regulations, to mitigate effects on the health of visitors and workers.</p>","author":"Luis E.
