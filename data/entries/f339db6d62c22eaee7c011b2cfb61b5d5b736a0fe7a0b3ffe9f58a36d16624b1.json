{"title":"Subchronic Chloroform Exposure Causes Intestinal Damage and Induces Gut Microbiota Disruption and Metabolic Dysregulation in Mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24417?af=R","date":1725279939000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Chloroform is a prevalent toxic environmental pollutant in urban settings, posing risks to human health through exposure via various mediums such as air and tap water. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in maintaining host health. However, there is a paucity of research elucidating the impact of chloroform exposure on the gut microbiota. In this investigation, 18 SPF Kunming female mice were stratified into three groups (<i>n</i> = 6) and subjected to oral gavage with chloroform doses equivalent to 0, 50, and 150 mg/kg of body weight over 30 days. Our findings demonstrate that subchronic chloroform exposure significantly perturbs hematological parameters in mice and induces histopathological alterations in cecal tissues, consequently engendering marked disparities in the functional composition of cecal microbiota and metabolic equilibrium of cecal contents. Ultimately, our investigation revealed a statistically robust correlation, exhibiting a high degree of significance, between the intestinal microbiome composition and the metabolites that were differentially expressed consequent to chloroform exposure.</p>","author":"Zaishan Wang, \nMeng Xu, \nQiang Li, \nSihan Lu, \nZhu Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"f339db6d62c22eaee7c011b2cfb61b5d5b736a0fe7a0b3ffe9f58a36d16624b1","category":"Environment"}
