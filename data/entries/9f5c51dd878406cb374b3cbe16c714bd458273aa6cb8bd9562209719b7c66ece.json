{"title":"Hepatocyte miR-21-5p-deficiency alleviates APAP-induced liver injury by inducing PPARγ and autophagy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/198/1/50/7511867?rss=1","date":1704412800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury is one of the most frequent causes of acute liver failure worldwide. Significant increases in the levels of miRNA-21 in both liver tissues and plasma have been observed in APAP-overdosed animals and humans. However, the mechanistic effect of miRNA-21 on acute liver injury remains unknown. In this study, we generated a new hepatocyte-specific miRNA-21 knockout (miR-21-HKO) mouse line. miR-21-HKO and the background-matched sibling wild-type (WT) mice were treated with a toxic dose of APAP. Compared with WT mice, miR-21 HKO mice showed an increased survival, a reduction of necrotic hepatocytes, and an increased expression of light chain 3 beta, which suggested an autophagy activation. The expression of PPARγ was highly induced in the livers of miR-21-HKO mice after a 2-h APAP treatment, which preceded the activation of LC3B at the 12 h APAP treatment. miR-21 negatively regulated PPARγ protein expression by targeting its 3′-UTR. When PPARγ function was blocked by a potent antagonist GW9662 in miR-21-HKO mice, the autophage activation was significantly diminished, suggesting an indispensable role of PPARγ signaling pathway in miR-21-mediated hepatotoxicity. Taken together, hepatocyte-specific depletion of miRNA-21 alleviated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by activating PPARγ and autophagy, demonstrating a crucial new regulatory role of miR-21 in APAP-mediated liver injury.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"9f5c51dd878406cb374b3cbe16c714bd458273aa6cb8bd9562209719b7c66ece","category":"Environment"}
