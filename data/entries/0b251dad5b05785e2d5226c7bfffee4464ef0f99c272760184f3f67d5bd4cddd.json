Autoclaves can be integrated with an absorption refrigeration cycle to utilize the waste heat generated at high temperature during the process. Today, many studies are carried out on the evaluation of energy resources. In this study, it is designed to obtain a cooling load by adding an integrated sub-cycle to the waste steam heat of the autoclave device in a sterilization unit. In the lower cycle, the ammonia/water absorption refrigeration cycle is used. According to the energy analysis; With the condition that the cooling temperature is 7°C, the generator temperature of 95°C and a cooling load of 130.9 W occurred with 531.7 W of waste heat received by the absorption cooling system. Accordingly, an efficiency of COP 0.246 was obtained. The energy analysis of the absorption refrigeration cycle can improve the energy efficiency of the autoclave and save energy. In addition, the obtained cooling load will be preserved in medical supplies that need to be kept cold.</p>","author":"Mehmet Erhan Şahin, \nAhmet Elbir","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"0b251dad5b05785e2d5226c7bfffee4464ef0f99c272760184f3f67d5bd4cddd","category":"Environment"}
