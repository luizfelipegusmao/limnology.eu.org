{"title":"Trends in Enterococcus faecium Bacteremia: Exploring Risk Factors with Emphasis on Prior Antibiotic Exposure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0623/v1","date":1720489795000,"content":"Enterococcal bacteraemia (EB) is on the rise both in Sweden and globally. While Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is susceptible to ampicillin and piperacillin/tazobactam (pip/taz), Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) is not. The use of pip/taz has increased dramatically in Sweden, but it is unknown if this has affected the relative incidence of E. faecalis/E. faecium bacteraemia. Here we investigate whether the number and proportion of E. faecium bacteraemia (EfmB) cases have increased. Additionalle, risk factors associated with EfmB with focus on prior antibiotic exposure are analyzed. Medical journals of 360 patients with EB admitted to Sahlgrenska University Hospital were reviewed. The proportion of EfmB cases increased from 41% in 2015 to 51% in 2021. Hospital-acquired infection, previous exposure to pip/taz, and carbapenems were identified as independent risk factors for EfmB. There were considerable patient related differences between the EfmB and EfsB groups but there was no difference in mortality rates. In conclusion, the increasing proportion of EfmB cases is concerning and was seen parallell to the expanding use of pip/taz, one possible contributing factor. Our findings suggest that a cautious approach to antibiotic use is essential to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"579a3d6181df11e93816499d2d74326957fbf3a7862ae6ccbcec1b0b20054b2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
