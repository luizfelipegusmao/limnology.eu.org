{"title":"Permeability and Induced Polarization of Mudstones","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR037455?af=R","date":1722314761000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Electrical measurements can be used to estimate hydraulic properties such as permeability (<i>k</i>) in sedimentary rocks. Previous work has focused on sandstones, siltstones, and carbonates, while investigations on mudstones have rarely been reported. In this study, we report on electrical geophysical measurements for 23 mudstone samples using an experimental approach designed to reliably saturate these low permeability mudstones. The modified Hagen-Poiseuille model linking permeability to the formation factor (<i>F</i>) and an effective pore radius (<i>r</i>) provides an excellent fit to the data set with a near-constant pore radius, indicating that the effective porosity (1/<i>F</i>) is the controlling factor on <i>k</i>. In these samples, the surface area normalized to pore volume (<i>S</i>\n<sub>por</sub>), frequently used in permeability estimation models, varies by 1â€“2 orders of magnitude and is thus not a reliable proxy of the inverse effective hydraulic radius. The formation factor also exerts the primary control on induced polarization (IP) parameters, whereas <i>S</i>\n<sub>por</sub> shows no relation to the IP parameters. A strong linear relationship is found between IP parameters (imaginary conductivity and normalized chargeability) and surface conductivity, although the proportionality factor is significantly lower than those observed in more permeable rocks and sediments. Apparent relationships between the polarization strength-derived and time constant-derived geophysical length scales and the effective hydraulic radius appear to be driven by variations in the electrochemical parameters (i.e., specific polarizability and diffusion coefficient). Overall, these findings emphasize that predicting hydraulic properties from electrical measurements in fine-grained rocks remains challenging and requires further investigation into the electrochemical properties involved.</p>","author":"Klaudio Peshtani, \nAndreas Weller, \nLee Slater","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"f9c52fd0462b6106c05e098709f3d7c606bf9ab248d36c3cbdc93affc5880c7b","category":"Environment"}
