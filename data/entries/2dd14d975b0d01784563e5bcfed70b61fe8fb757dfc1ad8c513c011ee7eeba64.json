{"title":"Effect of strain and enteric septicemia of catfish vaccine‐booster on production and processing traits of the Delta Select and Delta Control strains of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13068?af=R","date":1719467112000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Delta Select channel catfish strain (DS) was developed by selection for increased growth and carcass yield. Progeny from DS and the Delta Control (DC) strain (a randomly bred strain from the same base population as DS) were compared in three trials. Trial 1: unvaccinated ~1-year-old fingerlings from each strain reared communally in 0.4-ha ponds. Trial 2: vaccinated ~ 1-year-old fingerlings from each strain grown in separate replicated 0.4-ha ponds and fish in about half the ponds were given an ESC vaccine-booster at 13 months post-hatch. Trial 3: same procedures as Trial 2, except fish were raised in replicate 0.04-ha ponds with no vaccine-booster. In Trial 1 DS were larger at stocking, larger at harvest, and had higher carcass yield than DC; in Trial 2 DS were larger at harvest, had better survival and higher production/ha than DC. Vaccine-booster had no effect on fish growth or survival. DS and DC were not different for any traits in Trial 3. Although outcome varied among trials, the overall results indicated a vaccine booster did not affect growth or survival, DS strain fingerlings grew faster than DC fingerling, and DS had higher carcass yield than DC strain fish when reared communally.</p>","author":"Brian Bosworth, \nGeoff Waldbieser, \nDave Wise, \nGanesh Kumar, \nDaniela Lourenco, \nAndre Garcia, \nBrian Ott, \nLes Torrans","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"2dd14d975b0d01784563e5bcfed70b61fe8fb757dfc1ad8c513c011ee7eeba64","category":"Environment"}
