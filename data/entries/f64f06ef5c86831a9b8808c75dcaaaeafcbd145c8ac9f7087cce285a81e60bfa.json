{"title":"Repellency, Toxicity and Chemical Composition of Plant Essential Oils from Myrtaceae against Asian Citrus Psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera Liviidae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1489/v1","date":1718952515000,"content":"The Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (D. citri) is one of the major pests in the citrus industry, which spreads Citrus Huanglongbing disease. It has developed resistance to chemical insecticides. Therefore, searching for greener solutions for pest management is critically important. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the repellent and insecticidal efficacy of essential oils (EOs) from four species of Myrtaceae plants: Psidium guajava (PG), Eucalyptus robusta (ER), Eucalyptus tereticornis (ET), and Baeckea frutescens (BF) against D. citri and to analyze their chemical composition. GC-MS analysis was performed, and the results indicated that the EOs of PG, ER, ET, and BF were rich in terpenoids, ketones, esters, and alcohol compounds. The repellent rate of all four EOs showed that it decreased with exposure time but increased with concentrations of EOs. Repellent rates ranged from 80.50% to 100.00% after treating D. citri for 6 hours with four EOs at 100% concentration and decreased to 67.71% to 85.49% after 24 hours of exposure. Among the compounds from the EOs tested, eucalyptol had the strongest repellent activity, with a 24-hour repellency rate of 100%. The contact toxicity bioassay results showed that all EOs have insecticidal toxicity to D. citri; the LC50 for nymphs was 36.47-93.15 mL/L, and for adults, it was 60.72-111.00 mL/L. These results show that when PG is used as the reference material, both ER, ET, and BF EOs have strong biological activity against D. citri, which provides a scientific basis for the further development of plant-derived agrochemicals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f64f06ef5c86831a9b8808c75dcaaaeafcbd145c8ac9f7087cce285a81e60bfa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
