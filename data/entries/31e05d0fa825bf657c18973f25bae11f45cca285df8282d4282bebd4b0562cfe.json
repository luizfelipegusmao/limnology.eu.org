{"title":"The impact of digital financial inclusion on bank performance: An exploration of mechanisms of action and heterogeneity","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309099","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Jing Zhao, Congqi Wang, Haslindar Ibrahim, Yanpeng Chen</p>\r\n\r\nThe use of digital technology by banks and other financial institutions to facilitate financial inclusion is referred to as digital financial inclusion. This fusion of digital finance and traditional banking methods has the potential to impact banks’ operational effectiveness. This study uses the panel effects model to examine the link between digital financial inclusion and bank performance in 30 Chinese provinces from 2012 to 2021. This research uses kernel density estimation to examine the spatial-temporal growth patterns of both variables. The mediator variable in examining how digital financial inclusion affects bank performance is risk-taking. Finally, the paper analyses the regional heterogeneity of the impact. It presents the following conclusions: (1) In China, digital financial inclusion and bank performance have constantly increased, with noticeable regional variances in their development levels. This regional inequality has widened gradually since 2018, yet it has not resulted in polarization. (2) The significant positive correlation between digital inclusive finance and banking performance indicates that banking performance tends to increase with the enhancement of digital inclusive finance. (3) Digital financial inclusion impacts bank performance, with risk-taking as a moderator. The spread of digital financial inclusion services enhances banks’ willingness to take risks, enhancing overall efficiency. (4) Digital financial inclusion boosts bank performance in the Northwest, South, North, and East regions while lightly inhibiting it in the Central region. Based on the findings, this study makes bank and government suggestions.","author":"Jing Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"31e05d0fa825bf657c18973f25bae11f45cca285df8282d4282bebd4b0562cfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
