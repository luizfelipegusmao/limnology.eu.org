{"title":"A generalist regulator: MYB transcription factors regulate the biosynthesis of active compounds in medicinal plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4729/7676628?rss=1","date":1716163200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Medicinal plants are rich in a variety of secondary metabolites with therapeutic value. However, the yields of these metabolites are generally very low, making their extraction both time-consuming and labour-intensive. Transcription factor-targeted secondary metabolic engineering can efficiently regulate the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants. v-Myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) transcription factors are involved in regulating various morphological and developmental processes, responses to stress, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plants. This review discusses the biological functions and transcription regulation mechanisms of MYB transcription factors and summarizes research progress concerning MYB transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of representative active components. In the transcriptional regulatory network, MYB transcription factors regulate multiple synthase genes to mediate the biosynthesis of active compounds. This work will serve as a reference for an in-depth analysis of the MYB transcription factor family in medicinal plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"54624b6616fec55d37f809d8270ad0d9d29be76d05a76e6f7334830d4fa72dca","category":"Environment"}
