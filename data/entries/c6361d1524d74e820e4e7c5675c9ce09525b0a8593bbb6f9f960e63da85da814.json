{"title":"PSIII-2 Exploring differential gene expression and pathways associated with pregnancy outcomes in beef heifers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/500/7757619?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Heifer fertility is a key factor in the success of beef production systems, as the reproductive performance of a heifer correlates with her stayability in the breeding herd. However, despite being reproductively mature and physically healthy, 5 to 15% of these heifers fail to conceive within a designated breeding season. The underlying physiological mechanisms preventing these heifers from achieving pregnancy remain elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological pathways associated with pregnancy outcomes in beef heifers. Angus-Simmental crossbred heifers were subjected to an estrus synchronization and fixed-time artificial insemination (AI) program (7-d CO-Synch + CIDR) and blood samples were collected at the time of AI for isolation of peripheral white blood cells (PWBC). After pregnancy check, heifers were classified as pregnant (P) and non-pregnant (NP). Based on that, 6 animals per group were randomly selected for total RNA isolation from the PWBC samples, and genome-wide expression was measured through RNA sequencing. The RNA-Seq data were analyzed using an in-house bioinformatics pipeline, with filtered reads aligned to the <span>Bos taurus</span> reference genome using STAR. DEGs were identified using DESeq2, followed by functional analysis using ShinyGO. Our approach unveiled 230 DEGs, comprising 102 up and 128 downregulated genes in the NP group (<span>P</span>-value â‰¤ 0.05 and |log2FC| &gt; 0.5). Upregulated genes included those from the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP27B1 and CYP2U1). The genes SCML2, USIG2, and FBP1 were upregulated and have been associated with immune response and increased PWBC counts. This may be related to the over-representation of biological processes involved in cell division based on the upregulated genes. KEGG pathway over-representation analysis of DEGs retrieved allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, type I Diabetes Mellitus, insulin signaling pathway, and transcriptional misregulation of cancer. These pathways included genes such as BOLA-DQB, PRKAR1B, CALML4 and JUP, which were reported as downregulated during times of inflammatory response. Another downregulated gene was GZMB, which is needed for proper cell targeting during immune response. This finding may provide a link between immune function and early pregnancy failure. However, the relationship between the immune system and pregnancy warrants further investigation. Our results shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive performance in beef heifers and support previous studies associating immune function with pregnancy outcomes. These differentially expressed genes may be further explored as potential avenues for enhancing fertility in beef production systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c6361d1524d74e820e4e7c5675c9ce09525b0a8593bbb6f9f960e63da85da814","category":"Environment"}
