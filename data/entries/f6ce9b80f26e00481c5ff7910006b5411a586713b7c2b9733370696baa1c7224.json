{"title":"Assessing the Feasibility of Handheld Cameras to Increase Access to Teleretinal Diabetic Retinopathy Screenings in Safety-Net Clinics in Los Angeles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0999/v1","date":1726149705000,"content":"Background: Handheld cameras may increase access to teleretinal diabetic retinopathy screenings (TDRS), as they are more economical and nimbler than traditional desktop cameras. However, their use in safety-net clinical settings is less understood. Methods: The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health collaborated with the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) to pilot the use of handheld cameras in DHSâ€™s TDRS program. This study assessed screening metrics and interviewed TDRS coordinators and photographers about their experiences using these cameras. Results: Handheld cameras are harder to operate and performed less optimally on key screening metrics (e.g., image quality) compared to desktop cameras. However, this challenge appeared to be linked to the selected model, rather than to all handheld cameras. The adoption of handheld cameras in DHS was aided by their integration into an existing agency infrastructure that already supports the use of desktop cameras; these operational supports include an established workflow, a data platform, and experienced photographers. Conclusions: The use of handheld cameras for TDRS is a promising practice for assuring equitable access to screenings. Handheld cameras are portable, smaller in size, and lower in cost than desktop cameras. Future projects should invest in and assess the performance of higher-quality models of these cameras, especially their use in safety-net clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6ce9b80f26e00481c5ff7910006b5411a586713b7c2b9733370696baa1c7224","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
