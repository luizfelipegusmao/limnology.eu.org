{"title":"Functional Foods, Gut Microbiome and Association With Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1427/v1","date":1713863808000,"content":"The human gastrointestinal gut contains about 100 trillion of microorganisms including up to 5000 different types of bacteria called the \"gut microbiome\". Alterations in the composition of gut microorganisms (dysbiosis) can cause threatening for life diseases. This present seeks to evaluate if finally diet and more specifically functional foods affect the intestinal microbiome, and if obesity and the metabolic syndrome (Mets) are associated with the intestinal microbiome. This systematic review was accomplished according to PRISMA guidelines mostly using the key words functional foods, microbiome, obesity, Mets, Mediterranean diet.  The search was carried out of recent scien-tific articles from the databases Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The most studies discussed in this review showed a potential therapeutic effect of the Mediterranean diet rich in beneficial nutrients, on body weight, fat deposition, in correlation with modulation of the synthesis of gut microbiome. This literature review demonstrates a possible relationship between the metabolites of the microflora, the endotoxemia, obesity and Mets. The role of probiotics, prebiotics, and polyphe-nols in the prevention of obesity and Mets is of high importance in promoting healthy aging. The future challenge is to understand how different dietary patterns can regulate the composition of the gut microflora and whether these changes could be long-term.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67ad70bcc9ac4929b2df76e2717837f66ddc7f60e5db2becd7ef52a85bf7e74c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
