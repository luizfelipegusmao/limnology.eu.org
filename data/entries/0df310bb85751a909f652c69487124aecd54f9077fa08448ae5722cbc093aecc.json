{"title":"Green Synthesis of CuO Nanoparticles from Macroalgae Ulva lactuca and Gracilaria verrucosa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0774/v1","date":1718186306000,"content":"Macroalgae seaweeds such as Ulva lactuca and Gracilaria verrucosa cause problems on the Northern Coast of the Italian Adriatic Sea because their overabundance hinders the growth of cultivated clams, Rudatapes philippinarum. This study focused on the green synthesis of CuO nanoparticles from U. lactuca and G. verrucosa. The biosynthesized CuO NPs were successfully characterized using FTIR, XRD, HRTEM/EDX, and zeta potential. Nanoparticles from the two different algae species are essentially identical, with the same physical characteristics and almost the same antimicrobial activities. We have not investigated the cause of this identity, but it seems likely to arise from the reaction of Cu with the same algae metabolites in both species. The study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain useful products from these macroalgae through a green synthesis approach and that they should be considered as not just a cause of environmental and economic damage but also as a potential source of income.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0df310bb85751a909f652c69487124aecd54f9077fa08448ae5722cbc093aecc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
