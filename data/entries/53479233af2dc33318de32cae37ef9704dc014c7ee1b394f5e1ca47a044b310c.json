{"title":"Electrochemical Performance of Ti Gr. 2 as Electrodes in Contact with Saline Suspension of Clays during Electroflotation Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0005/v1","date":1722503370000,"content":"The presence of clays in copper minerals has a significant negative impact during their processing, leading to low recoveries during the flotation process. In saline environments such as seawater, the presence of clays contribute to an increase in operational problems caused by salinity, a decrease in the grade of the copper concentrate, alteration of the rheology of the mineral pulp, a decrease in the selectivity of copper during the flotation process, a reduction in the quality of clarified water, and excessive corrosion of metallic components. This study explores the electroflotation of kaolinite and montmorillonite clays in NaCl solutions using a modified Hallimond tube coupled with Ti Gr. 2 electrodes for bubble generation via water electrolysis, and the corrosion analysis of these electrodes applying the superposition model. The electroflotation results show recovery of clays close to 72.68% for kaolinite, 88.44% for montmorillonite, and 67.36% for a mixtures of both clays. The presence of clays helps reduce the corrosive effects of Ti Gr. 2 from 0.069 A/m2 in NaCl to 0.0073 A/m2 in NaCl with montmorillonite clay.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53479233af2dc33318de32cae37ef9704dc014c7ee1b394f5e1ca47a044b310c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
