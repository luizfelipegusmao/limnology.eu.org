Obesity often occurs concomitantly with micronutrient deficiencies that impair energy metabolism. Microbiota composition is affected by diet. Host–microbiota interactions are bidirectional. We propose three pathways whereby these interactions may modulate the gut microbiome and obesity: (1) ingested compounds or derivatives affecting small intestinal transit, endogenous secretions, digestion, absorption, microbiome balance, and gut barrier function directly affect host metabolism; (2) substrate availability affecting colonic microbial composition and contact with the gut barrier; and (3) microbial end products affecting host metabolism. The quantity/concentration, duration, and/or frequency (circadian rhythm) of changes in these pathways can alter the gut microbiome, disrupt the gut barrier, alter host immunity, and increase the risk of and progression to overweight and obesity. Host-specific characteristics (e.g., genetic variations) may further affect individual sensitivity and/or resilience to diet- and microbiome-associated perturbations in the colonic environment. In this narrative review, the effects of selected interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary calorie restriction, dietary fibers and prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids, on the gut microbiome, body weight, and/or adiposity are summarized to help identify mechanisms of action and research opportunities.</p>","author":"Michael I.
