{"title":"PyRAMD Scheme: A Protocol for Computing the Infrared Spectra of Polyatomic Molecules Using Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1381/v1","date":1721215855000,"content":"Here, we present a general framework for computing the infrared anharmonic vibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules using the Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) with the software PyRAMD. To account for the nuclear quantum effects, we suggest using the simplified Wigner sampling (SWS) approach [\\textit{Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.}, 2023, \\textbf{25}, 18406-18423] simultaneously coupled with the Andersen and Berendsen thermostats. We propose a new criterion for selecting the parameter of the SWS based on the molecules' harmonic vibrational frequencies and usage of the large-time-step blue shift correction, allowing for a decrease in computational expenses. For the Fourier transform of the dipole moment autocorrelation function, we propose to use the regularized least-squares analysis, which allows us to obtain higher frequency resolution than the direct application of fast Fourier transform. Finally, we suggest the usage of the pre-parameterized scaling factors for the IR spectra from BOMD, also providing the scaling factors for the spectra at the BLYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G, PBE-D3(BJ)/6-31G, and PBEh-3c levels of theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b80912a3700da888d18b6000e0034af12ca5f75c3b5f4eadef06df2590832942","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
