{"title":"Impaired PARylation Turnover in Radiation- Damaged Tissue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1903/v1","date":1724769147000,"content":"PARP inhibitors are used in tumor therapy exploiting their inhibitory role in DNA repair. Radiation therapy leads to DNA damage in the affected region comprising both tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue. In addition, radiotherapy has long-standing effects on DNA integrity. The mechanisms for this are not well understood. We studied normal tissue damage of the lung after application of ionizing radiation (IR) in two well established rat models comprising both external (eIR) and internal (iIR) ionizing radiation. We found a nearly complete (~350-fold) loss of PARP-1 in the irradiated tissue in both models but no change in PARylated protein. This may be explained by the strong decrease in both ARH3 and PARG, both deparylating enzymes. We demonstrate, that of all these proteins are expressed in type II pneumocytes, but also in type I pneumocytes and the bronchiolar epithelium. The data suggest a severe disturbance of PARylation in these cells which may affect their major functions such as maintenance of the integrity of the alveolar wall. It is likely that the application of PARP inhibitors could have cumulative effects in radiation-damaged normal tissue.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b99d10a201254eece511e1e28bc9ad28960be4830255d33000d359daf6b20376","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
