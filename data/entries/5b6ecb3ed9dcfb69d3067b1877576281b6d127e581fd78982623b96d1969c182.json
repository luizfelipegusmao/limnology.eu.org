{"title":"Pregnancy Outcomes Following Participation in the Healthy Women Healthy Futures Doula Program in New York City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0872/v1","date":1723561613000,"content":"Background: Historically, in the United States and globally, women have supported other women before, during, and after childbirth. Birth doulas are considered an important component to eliminating racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality. To address disparities in birth outcomes, Healthy Women Healthy Futures (HWHF) provides free birth and postpartum doula services to low-income women and communities of color in New York City. Methods: Secondary analysis of program data (n=364) collected between 2020 and 2021 was conducted. Univariate and multivariable analyses focused on: method of delivery, preterm birth, low-birthweight birth, breastfeeding, maternal-infant skin contact. The key exposure variable was total doula hours. Results: Clients who received prenatal doula support had low rates of preterm birth (8.8%) and low birthweight (7.1%), and high rates of vaginal delivery (69.1%), breastfeeding in the hospital (90.9%), and maternal-infant skin contact (78.2%). Multivariable analysis did not identify an association between number of doula hours and any of the five outcomes examined. Conclusion: While descriptive results point to positive birth outcomes, these effects did not persist in multivariable analyses. Data quality concerns from this intervention likely hindered the ability to detect a program impact, emphasizing the importance of funding to support data collection and management activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b6ecb3ed9dcfb69d3067b1877576281b6d127e581fd78982623b96d1969c182","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
