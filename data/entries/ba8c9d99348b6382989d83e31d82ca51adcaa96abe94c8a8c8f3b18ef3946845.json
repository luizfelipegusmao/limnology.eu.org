Patient treatment and management pose a challenge for healthcare systems. The prognosis of these patients may be influenced by factors such as sex. This study aims to describe the clinical parameters of patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a Spanish hospital due to Trauma Brain Injury  and to establish differences based on sex. Methodology: An observational, cross-sectional, and analytical study was conducted from March 2015 to December 2019. All patients admitted to the ICU during this period who presented isolated significant Traumatic Brain Injury, defined as an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) ≥ 3, were included. Data on baseline characteristics, mechanism of injury, substance use, and acute management in the prehospital and hospital stages (including the need for hospitalization) were recorded. A descriptive and in-ferential analysis was conducted using the chi-square test. Results: A total of 950 patients were ultimately included. The majority of the patients were men (723) with a mean age of 45.16 (± 17.55). There were statistically significant differences in terms of the mechanism of injury (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba8c9d99348b6382989d83e31d82ca51adcaa96abe94c8a8c8f3b18ef3946845","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
