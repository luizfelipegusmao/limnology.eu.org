However, little is known about the spatial organization of immune cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) in the SLOs. Traditional imaging is limited to a few markers, confining our understanding of the differences between the SLOs. Herein, imaging mass cytometry addressed this gap by simultaneously profiling 25-plex proteins in SLO tissues at subcellular resolution. The antibody panel targeted immune, stromal, chemokine, epigenetic, and functional markers. For robust cell identification, a computational workflow <span>SpatialVizPheno</span> was developed to spatially phenotype 999,970 cells using two approaches, including manual gating and semi-supervised gating, iterative clustering, and annotation. LN exhibited the highest density of B cells while the intestinal tissues contained the highest proportion of regulatory and follicular helper T cells. <span>SpatialVizPheno</span> identified the most prevalent interaction between follicular dendritic cells and stromal cells (SCs), plasmablasts/plasma cells, and the SCs across the lymphoid tissues. Collagen-enriched regions were associated with the spatial orientation of B cell follicles in both TS and LN tissues, but not in intestinal lymphoid tissues. Such spatial differences of immunophenotypes and ECM in different SLO tissues can be used to quantify the relationship between cellular organization and ultimate immune responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"f829d328c4b799f6f0d655b728383a247a0e33bbb6d6d882d366fe5e8331b334","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
