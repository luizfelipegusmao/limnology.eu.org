{"title":"Intraspecific variation in responses to extreme and moderate temperature stress in the wild species, Solanum carolinense (Solanaceae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae030/7678783?rss=1","date":1716249600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Adaptation or acclimation to local temperature regimes has often been used as a proxy for predicting how plant populations will respond to impending novel conditions driven by human-caused climate change. To understand how plants may successfully respond to increasing air temperatures (extreme and moderate) in the future, we explored how temperature tolerance traits differ in populations of <span>Solanum carolinense</span> from northern (MN) and southern (TX) regions of the continental USA in a two-experiment study. In the first experiment, we compared the heat and cold tolerance in vegetative (sporophyte) and reproductive (male gametophyte) traits. In the second experiment, we studied if long-term heat influences plant development by examining how development in moderate heat affected reproductive structures and reproductive success. We found that temperature sensitivity differed between southern populations, which regularly experience extreme heat, and northern populations which do not. In contrast to our expectations, northern populations appeared more heat-tolerant than southern populations for vegetative traits such as chlorophyll stability and reproductive traits such as pollen germination. Our results are consistent with a heat-avoidance, rather than tolerance mechanism to mitigate extreme heat during pollen germination. In the second experiment, plants developing under the moderate heat treatment had significantly smaller reproductive structures and reduced seed production (27% fewer seeds on average than in the control treatment). Reproductive structures that developed in moderate heat were also reduced in size, particularly in the northern populations relative to populations from the south. We conclude that rising temperatures have the potential to incur substantial negative consequences for the reproductive success of individuals in this species and that some populations already mitigate stressful temperature conditions through phenotypic plasticity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"593fb91176e6286ad1679a19ac412dc3c7cb74a29c85a28f1de5e82180845389","category":"Environment"}
