{"title":"Unilateral Exudative Retinal Detachment and Uveitis Accompanied by a Large Subretinal Deposit on the Macula Secondary to Bartonella henselae Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0771/v1","date":1728541067000,"content":"Introduction: To describe a case of unilateral exudative retinal detachment and severe uveitis with a large subretinal deposit in a 6-year-old girl presenting with left thigh lymphadenitis.\nCase Presentation: A metagenome next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the vitreous body was performed, revealing Bartonella henselae. The patient showed the resolution of retinal detachment and uveitis, as well as improvement of left thigh lymphadenitis, in response to systemic and ocular antibiotics and corticosteroids.\nConclusion: Bartonella henselae neuroretinitis may manifest as exudative retinal detachment with extensive subretinal lesions and uveitis. The treatment involving systemic and ocular antibiotics and corticosteroids proved to be effective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65692801d44dc3edd8474b32911a08c6ac93d05b6bc9bca47c4233097bcf3cdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
