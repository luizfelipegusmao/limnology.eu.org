{"title":"A Ray-Tracing Based Single-Site Localization Method for Non-Line-of-Sight Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1502/v1","date":1729645749000,"content":"Localization accuracy in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios is often hindered by the complex nature of multipath propagation. Traditional approaches typically focus on NLOS node identification and error mitigation techniques. However, the intricacies of NLOS localization are intrinsically tied to propagation challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel single-site localization method tailored for complex multipath NLOS environments, leveraging only angle of arrival (AOA) estimates in conjunction with a ray-tracing (RT) algorithm. The method transforms NLOS paths into equivalent line-of-sight (LOS) paths through the generation of generalized sources (GSs) via ray tracing. A novel weighting mechanism for GSs is introduced, which, when combined with an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) estimator, significantly improves the localization accuracy of non-cooperative target sources. Furthermore, a multipath similarity displacement matrix (MSDM) is incorporated to enhance accuracy in regions with pronounced multipath fluctuations. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, achieving localization performance that approaches the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB), even in challenging NLOS scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9554fb12d486334690f7fc1299c0a0850a32e6dbcac96ca0b28fbeb85ff8843d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
