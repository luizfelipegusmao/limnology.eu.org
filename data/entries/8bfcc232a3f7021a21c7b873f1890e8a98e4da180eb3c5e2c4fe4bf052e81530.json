{"title":"Morphological and molecular data combined reveal inter- and intraspecific cranial shape variations in bats of Artibeus Leach, 1821 (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/biolinnean/blae031/7634205?rss=1","date":1711152000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Since morphological traits may overlap among species within a complex, the integration of morphological and mitochondrial data could provide crucial insights for distinguishing species, as observed in fruit-eating bats of the genus <span>Artibeus</span>. Therefore, the application of geometric morphometric (GM) techniques could yield more refined and robust analyses of inter- and intraspecific variations. In this study, we generated two datasets: one with molecular delimitation data based on the barcode region (<span>COI</span>) and the other with cranial size and shape data using GM methods. Our aims were to investigate variations between large and small species within the genus <span>Artibeus</span>, as well as to explore potential factors influencing such variations. The results from species delimitation revealed molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) supporting the morphological identification. Analyses using GM techniques demonstrated significant inter- and intraspecific variations in cranial size and shape among <span>Artibeus</span> species. The combined outcomes suggest the absence of a significant phylogenetic signal influencing skull variation. This scenario indicates that potential historical ecological factors may have directly influenced the cranial morphology of these species, acting as significant selection forces in geographical space and generating intraspecific variations in <span>Artibeus planirostris</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"8bfcc232a3f7021a21c7b873f1890e8a98e4da180eb3c5e2c4fe4bf052e81530","category":"Environment"}
