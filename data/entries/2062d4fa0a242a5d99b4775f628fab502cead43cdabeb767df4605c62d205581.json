Several studies have previously demonstrated correlations between cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients and independent risk factors for diabetic neuropathy. Our objective was to retrospectively analyze data from diabetic patients in the North-East region of Hungary who underwent neuropathy screening at the Diabetic Neuropathy Center, University of Debrecen, between 2017 and 2021. We aimed to investigate the correlations between cardiovascular risk factors and microvascular complications among patients with DSPN. The median age of the patients was 67 years, 59,6% were female, and 91,1% had type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of DSPN among the study subjects was 71.7%. A significantly longer duration of diabetes (p&lt;0.01) was noted in patients with DSPN. Those with DSPN demonstrated a significantly higher HbA1c level (p&lt;0.001) and a greater frequency of insulin use (p = 0.001). We observed a significantly elevated albumin/creatinine ratio (p&lt;0.001) and a significantly lower eGFR (p&lt;0.001) in patients with DSPN. Diabetic retinopathy exhibited a significantly higher prevalence in patients with DSPN (p&lt;0.001). A higher prevalence of myocardial infarction (p&lt;0.05), ischemic heart disease (p&lt;0.001), peripheral arterial disease (p&lt;0.05) and a history of atherosclerosis (p&lt;0.05) was observed in patients with DSPN. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were independently associated with the presence of DSPN: higher HbA1c (OR:2.58, 95% CI:1.89–3.52, p&lt;0.001), age (OR:1.03, 95% CI:1.01–1.05, p = 0.006), albumin/creatinine ratio above 3 mg/mmol (OR:1.23, 95% CI:1.06–1.45, p = 0.008), retinopathy (OR:6.06, 95% CI:1.33–27.53, p = 0.02), and composite cardiovascular endpoint (OR:1.95, 95% CI:1.19–3.19, p = 0.008). Our study revealed that age, elevated HbA1c levels, significant albuminuria, retinopathy, and cardiovascular complications may increase the risk of DSPN. Further investigation of these associations is necessary to understand the impact of patient characteristics during the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.","author":"Attila Pető","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2062d4fa0a242a5d99b4775f628fab502cead43cdabeb767df4605c62d205581","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
