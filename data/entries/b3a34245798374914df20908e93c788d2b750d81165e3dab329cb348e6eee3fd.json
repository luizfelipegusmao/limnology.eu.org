A suite of techniques, combining elemental, optical, and mass information, work to answer most of these questions. However, there are cases where the usual toolbox of techniques is not enough. This introduces the need for a new technique to be added to the conservation science toolkit: pump-probe microscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b3a34245798374914df20908e93c788d2b750d81165e3dab329cb348e6eee3fd","category":"Environment"}
