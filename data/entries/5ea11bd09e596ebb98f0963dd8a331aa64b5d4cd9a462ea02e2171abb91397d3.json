{"title":"Investigation on Electrical and Thermal Performance of Water-Based Photovoltaic Thermal Collector in Nigeria.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1086/v1","date":1713333898000,"content":"The research work explores the impact of temperature on Silicon photovoltaic (PV) panels considering Nigeria as case study. It is found that high solar radiation in Nigeria increases surface temperature of PV panel above 25oC of optimal operating temperature of PV panels. Redundant energy gain from incident solar energy is dissipated at the rear of PV panels as heat, which reduces the efficiency of PV panel. Cooling mechanism is needed to cool the PV panels to increase the efficiency. In this study we demonstrated a unique design of a bifunctional photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system by employing heat exchanger at the rear of PV panel and water is used as a working fluid that is circulated through the heat exchanger to remove the excess heat. It is observed from the simulation results that Maiduguri peak annual electrical power output gives 1907kWh/kWp which is the highest, because of high solar radiation average of 727W/m2 in a year. And for Makurdi the peak annual electrical power output of 1542kWh/kWp while for Port Harcourt the peak power output of 1355kWh/kWp respectively. Interestingly, Polycrystalline Si-PV surface temperature decrease from 49.25oC to 38.38oC. Electrical power increased from 1526.83W to 1566.82W in a day and efficiency increase from 13.99% to 15.01%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ea11bd09e596ebb98f0963dd8a331aa64b5d4cd9a462ea02e2171abb91397d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
