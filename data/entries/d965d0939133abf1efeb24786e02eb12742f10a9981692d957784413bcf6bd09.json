{"title":"Empowering Education 4.0: Impact of Using ChatGPT as a Virtual Mentor on K-12 Students Learning Science","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1323/v1","date":1726577313000,"content":"Education 4.0 arises to provide citizens with the technical/digital competencies and cognitive/interpersonal skills demanded by Industry 4.0. New technologies drive this change, though time-independent learning remains a challenge, because students might face a lack of support, advice and surveillance when teachers are unavailable. This study proposes complementing presential lessons with online learning driven by ChatGPT, applied as an educational tool able to mentor K-12 students learning science at home. First, ChatGPT’s performance in the field of K-12 science is evaluated, scoring A (9.3/10 in 2023, and 9.7/10 in 2024) and providing detailed, analytic, meaningful, and human-like answers. Then, an empirical interventional study is performed to assess the impact of using ChatGPT as a virtual mentor on real K-12 students. After the intervention, the grades of students in the experimental group improved 30%, and 70% of students stated a positive perception of the AI, suggesting a positive impact of the proposed educational approach. After discussion, the study concludes ChatGPT might be a useful educational tool able to provide K-12 students learning science with the functional and social/emotional support they might require, democratizing a higher level of knowledge acquisition and promoting students’ autonomy, security and self-efficacy. The results probe ChatGPT’s remarkable capacity (and immense potential) to assist teachers in their mentoring tasks, laying the foundations of virtual mentoring and paving the way for future research aimed at obtaining a more realistic view of the AI impact on education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d965d0939133abf1efeb24786e02eb12742f10a9981692d957784413bcf6bd09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
