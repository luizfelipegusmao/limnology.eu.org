{"title":"Professional Positioning of General Practitioners in the Management of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis in Community Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0579/v1","date":1723099734000,"content":"INTRODUCTION: While postmenopausal osteoporosis management evolved in recent years, it nonetheless remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.\nGiven that general practitioners are the keystone of patient screening and referral in France, the present study was conducted to assess their professional positioning in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. \n\nMETHODS: The present is a qualitative study based on semi-directed interviews, carried out between July 2020 and February 2021, with randomly chosen Alsatian general practitioners. Interviews were conducted until data saturation. Consolidated criteria for qualitative research reporting grid was used as well as Nvivo software to categorize the datas.\nRESULTS: Twenty-three general practitioners (GPs) were interviewed. Study participants recognized that the investigation and treatment of osteoporosis begins at a primary care level, typically with the GP. While some initiated screening by prescribing bone mineral density (BMD) assessments, only few prescribed the associated laboratory assessment and spinal X-rays in search of curable osteopathy or vertebral fracture. For those GPs who do take the opportunity to initiate treatments for patients, there is an understanding that first line options often include calcium and vitamin D, at a “preventive” level.  The interviewed physicians interacted mainly with gynecologists and rheumatologists. Fracture liaison services were widely acclaimed. Several barriers were identified in their care management. The absence of a defined role between specialists and the lack of communication between the latter were an additional highlighted barrier. \n\nCONCLUSION: This study sheds further light on the discrepancy between the means available to treat osteoporosis, and the modest impact of the care observed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57346cf2dd1518957b2b7ee3411811729808d22344e40bace421e8f81ea06c87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
