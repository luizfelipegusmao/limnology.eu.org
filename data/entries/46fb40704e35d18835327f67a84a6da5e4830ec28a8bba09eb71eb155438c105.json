{"title":"Target and non-target effects of insecticide use during ornamental milkweed production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/648/7690635?rss=1","date":1717977600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>There are widespread public efforts to conserve wildlife in urbanized landscapes via the installation of nursery-grown plants that support Lepidoptera taxa. Insecticides are commonly used during nursery production to suppress key plant pests, and many products have extended periods of toxicity and affect a wide range of herbivore taxa. While there are plentiful toxicological data on bee species, predominantly the Western honey bee (<span>Apis mellifera</span> L.), little is known about how insecticides affect nonpest lepidopterans. Lepidoptera has different modes of exposure (e.g., leaf-feeding) and differences in susceptibility to insecticide target sites compared to bees. Consequently, many products compatible with bee conservation pose an uncertain risk to nonpest lepidopterans and thus may represent an under-recognized conflict with conservation efforts. Using the monarch butterfly (<span>Danaus plexippus</span>, L.), tropical milkweed (<span>Asclepias curassavica</span>, L.), and oleander aphid (<span>Aphis nerii</span>, Fonscolombe, 1841) system, we conducted leaf and whole-plant feeding assays to evaluate effects of acute and chronic monarch exposure to industry standard and alternative reduced-risk insecticides used during nursery production. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides against their target pest, the oleander aphid. Our results indicate that insecticides used to control pests on ornamental milkweed can cause monarch larval mortality up to 4 wk after treatment application. Furthermore, the duration of aphid suppression is often shorter than the duration of adverse effects on monarchs. This study demonstrates a conflict between insect pest management and Lepidoptera conservation during ornamental plant production and has implications for the conservation value of ornamentals after retail sale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"46fb40704e35d18835327f67a84a6da5e4830ec28a8bba09eb71eb155438c105","category":"Environment"}
