{"title":"The effect of titanium-platelet rich fibrin on periodontal intrabony defects: A randomized controlled split-mouth clinical study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304970","date":1717682400000,"content":"<p>by Didem Ozkal Eminoglu, Taner Arabaci, Gurbet Alev Oztas Sahiner</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to determine the contribution of titanium prepared platelet-rich fibrin (T-PRF) with open flap debridement (OFD) on clinical, biochemical and radiographic measurements of periodontal regeneration. Twenty periodontitis patients with bilateral intrabony defects and stage III grade A periodontitis were included in the study. A total of 40 defects were randomly selected for OFD alone (control group, n = 20) or combined OFD+ T-PRF (test group, n = 20). Clinical and radiographic parameters (at baseline and nine months after surgery), and growth factor levels in gingival crevicular fluid (at baseline and at two, four, six, and twelve weeks after surgical treatment) were also evaluated. Considering the clinical parameters, alterations in probing pocket depth, gingival marginal level and clinical endpoint in the test regions treated with T-PRF significantly improved (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Fibroblast growth factor-2 and platelet-derived growth factor-BB levels between the two groups in the second and fourth weeks were also significantly different (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio between the groups was significantly different in the second, fourth, sixth, and twelfth weeks (P&lt;0.05). The bone-filling rate was also significantly greater in the test group than in the control group (P &lt;0.001). Compared with OFD alone, combining T-PRF with the procedure was more successful with regards to clinical, radiographic, and biochemical measurements of periodontal regeneration.","author":"Didem Ozkal Eminoglu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"203c937b08d3337fc775ac4c324c56b9b76a0a20199493e7b431e061fa3d75e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
