{"title":"Effect of transglutaminase on ovalbumin emulsion gels as carriers of encapsulated probiotic bacteria","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13232?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The use of emulsion gels to protect and deliver probiotics has become an important topic in the food industry. This study used transglutaminase (TGase) to regulate ovalbumin (OVA) to prepare a novel emulsion gel. The effects of OVA concentration and the addition of TGase on the microstructure, rheological properties, water-holding capacity, and stability of the emulsion gels were investigated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>With the addition of TGase and the increasing OVA, the particle size of the emulsion gels decreased significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The gels with TGase exhibited greater water holding, hardness, and chewiness to some extent by forming a more uniform and stable system. After simulated digestion, the survival rate of <i>Bifidobacterium lactis</i> embedded in OVA emulsion gels improved significantly in comparison with the oil–water mixture as a result of the protective effect of the emulsion gel encapsulation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>By increasing the OVA content and adding TGase, the rheological characteristics, stability, and encapsulation capability of the OVA emulsion gel could be enhanced, providing a theoretical basis for the use of emulsion gels to construct probiotic delivery systems. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yujuan Tian, \nShurui Wang, \nTianyun Li, \nJiran Lv, \nXianli Zhang, \nDeog‐Hwan Oh, \nXing Fu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ddf8b0825bfaa499560a9d5b37fa6b6d030733937218493a0e039b2c9211523f","category":"Environment"}
