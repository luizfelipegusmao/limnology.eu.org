{"title":"Improving Shale Stability through the Utilization of Graphene Nanopowder and Modified Polymer Based Silica Nanocomposite in Water-Based Drilling Fluids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1973/v1","date":1719506089000,"content":"Shale formations present significant challenges to traditional drilling fluids due to fluid infiltration, cuttings dispersion, and shale swelling, which can destabilize the wellbore. While oil-based drilling fluids (OBM) effectively address these problems concerns about their environmental impact and cost limit their widespread use. Recently, nanomaterials (NPs) have emerged as a promising approach in drilling fluid technology, offering an innovative solution to improve the efficiency of water-based drilling fluids (WBDF) in shale operations. This study evaluates the potential of utilizing modified silica nanocomposite and graphene nanopowder to formulate a nanoparticle-enhanced water-based drilling fluid (NP-WBDF). The main objective is to investigate the impact of these nanoparticle additives on the flow characteristics, filtration efficiency, and inhibition properties of the NP-WBDF. In this research, a silica nanocomposite was successfully synthesized using emulsion polymerization and analyzed using FTIR, PSD, and TEM techniques. Results showed that the silica nanocomposite exhibited a unimodal particle size distribution ranging from 38 nm to 164 nm, with an average particle size of approximately 72 nm. Shale samples before and after interaction with Graphene nanopowder-WBDF and NFC-WBDF were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The NP-WBM underwent evaluation through API filtration tests (LTLP), high-temperature/high-pressure (HTHP) filtration tests, and rheological measurements conducted with a conventional viscometer. Experimental results showed that silica nanocomposite and graphene nanopowder effectively bridged and sealed shale pore throats, demonstrating superior inhibition performance compared to conventional WBDF. Post adsorption, the shale surface exhibited increased hydrophobicity, contributing to enhanced stability. Overall, silica nanocomposite and graphene nanopowder positively impacted rheological performance and provided favorable filtration control in water-based drilling fluids.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a74219b78f268f52a1911ce7979306883884854d684154440a12439949e1a41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
