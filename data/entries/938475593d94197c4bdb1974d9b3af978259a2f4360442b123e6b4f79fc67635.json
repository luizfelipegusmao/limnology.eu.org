{"title":"Abscisic acid reduced methoxypyrazines concentration and its derived unpleasant odors in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wines","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13534?af=R","date":1713780239000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The influences of abscisic acid (ABA) applications on precursors and gene expression in 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines (MPs) biosynthetic pathway, MPs concentration and sensory evaluation of its derived peculiar odors in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wines were investigated. At the vineyard, ABA solution with 25, 100 and 400 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (AT1, AT2 and AT3, respectively) and an aqueous solution (control) were sprayed three times from veraison to pre-harvest.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Higher concentration ABA applications (AT2 and AT3) in grapes could significantly reduce MPs concentration and its derived peculiar odors in grapes and wines compared to a lower concentration ABA application (AT1) and control, with AT2 application having the strongest effect. The changes in MPs were mainly a result of the downregulated expression of <i>VvOMTs</i> genes at higher concentration ABA applications, independent of the levels of their potential precursors.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study reveals that ABA application had the potential to decrease production of MPs in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wines, and this result provides reference values for the removal of unpleasant vegetable odors from Cabernet Sauvignon wines in production. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xianghan Cheng, \nFeifei Liu, \nXiaolei Liu, \nXuan Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"938475593d94197c4bdb1974d9b3af978259a2f4360442b123e6b4f79fc67635","category":"Environment"}
