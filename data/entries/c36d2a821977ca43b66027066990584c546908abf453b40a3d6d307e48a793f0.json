{"title":"Influence of Al and Ti Alloying and Annealing on the Microstructure and Compressive Properties of Cr-Fe-Ni Medium-Entropy Alloy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1787/v1","date":1727140039000,"content":"This research investigates the impact of Al and Ti elements on the formation of self-generated ordered phase in high-entropy alloys (HEA), which have been receiving widespread concentration in present times thanks to their remarkable multifunctional properties and wide range of component selection. By adjusting the dual elements of Al and Ti, the study explores the regulation of quantity and distribution of the in-situ self-generated ordered phases in the alloy. The results of the annealing heat treatment process demonstrated that, through accession Al and Ti elements, the Cr-Fe-Ni medium-entropy alloy transfer from BCC phase to BCC+FCC phase and the precipitation of new phases such as B2, L21, and Ïƒ. This led to a synergistic impact of second phase strengthening, and also of solid solution strengthening, resulting in improved compressive properties of HEA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c36d2a821977ca43b66027066990584c546908abf453b40a3d6d307e48a793f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
