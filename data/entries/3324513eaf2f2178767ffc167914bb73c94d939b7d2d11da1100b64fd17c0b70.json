{"title":"How Supervisors Managed Their OHS Roles with Workers Working from Home During the COVID Epidemic: A Qualitative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1273/v1","date":1729072204000,"content":"During the Covid-19 pandemic, although the experience of workers and managers was examined, the role, experiences and functions of supervisors was relatively underexplored, with no investigation into their changing health and safety responsibilities. This project attempted to fill this gap. Twenty supervisors across Canada were interviewed for an hour. A Framework Method guided the study. We used a conceptual framework of 10 supervisor functions to help direct the data collection, identify codes, manage and organize the data analysis, and identify major themes which were highlighted in the findings. What was found was that since supervisors did not have access to workers’ homes, they could not execute most of their OHS functions. They were obliged to give workers more control over how and when they worked. They Increased their communications with their workers in response to workers’ psychological health concerns. Notably, supervisors reported that they were under extreme stress. A hybrid work environment, with workers sometimes working at home, has become the new norm. Supervisor stress will continue to escalate unless upper management provides more support, supervisors get training on how to deal with the psychological health and safety of workers, and supervisors’ responsibilities are re-defined for at-home workers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3324513eaf2f2178767ffc167914bb73c94d939b7d2d11da1100b64fd17c0b70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
