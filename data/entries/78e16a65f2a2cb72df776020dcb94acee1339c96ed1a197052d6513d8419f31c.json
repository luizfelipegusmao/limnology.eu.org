Renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind plants and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have been integrated in multi-objective dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED) for a day to reduce windâ€“thermal energy cost and emission of pollutant gases. The several practical and nonlinear constraints have been considered to make system more realistic. The equilibrium optimizer (EO) has been proposed to solve the DEED model with RES and PEVs from different aspects. The four cases of ten and twenty thermal generating units have been considered to validate and analyze the efficacy of different types of integration in the proposed model. The results obtained by proposed technique have been compared with other recently developed techniques to show accuracy, efficiency, and speed of this technique in solving the proposed problem.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"78e16a65f2a2cb72df776020dcb94acee1339c96ed1a197052d6513d8419f31c","category":"Environment"}
