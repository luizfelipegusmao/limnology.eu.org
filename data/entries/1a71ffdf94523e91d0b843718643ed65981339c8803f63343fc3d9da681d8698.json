{"title":"Synthesis and Antiproliferative Effect of New Alkyne-Tethered Vindoline Hybrids Containing Pharmacophoric Fragments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2151/v1","date":1717150327000,"content":"In the frame of our diversity-oriented research on multitarget small molecule anticancer agents, utilizing convergent synthetic sequences terminated by Sonogashira coupling reactions, a preliminary selection of representative alkyne-tethered vindoline hybrids was synthesized. The novel hybrids with additional pharmacophoric fragments of well-documented anticancer agents, including FDA-approved tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (imatinib and erlotinib) or ferrocene or chalcone units, were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity on malignant cell lines MDA-MB-231 (triple negative breast cancer), A2780 (ovarian cancer), HeLa (human cervical cancer) and SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma) as well as human embryonal lung fibroblast MRC-5 served as reference non-malignant cell line for the assessment of the therapeutic window of the tested hybrids. The biological assays identified a trimethoxyphenyl-containing chalcone-vindoline hybrid (36) as a promising lead compound exhibiting submicromolar activity on A2780 cells with a marked therapeutic window. These results suggest that ovarian cancer might be considered as a prioritized target of treatment with 36.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a71ffdf94523e91d0b843718643ed65981339c8803f63343fc3d9da681d8698","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
