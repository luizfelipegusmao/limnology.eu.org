{"title":"Phytochemical profiling of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) honey and investigation of compounds related to its pollen occurrence","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13375?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Red raspberry (<i>Rubus idaeus</i> L.) is an important nectar source for honey production in some specific habitats as well as an important crop, so the definition of the features of this kind of honey is noteworthy. However, due to its rarity on the market, red raspberry honey is poorly characterized. The aim of this work was the phytochemical characterization of honey containing red raspberry from different geographical origins, through melissopalynological analyses concurrently with untargeted metabolomics achieved with different chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometry: solid-phase micro-extraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC–MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography/Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HPLC-Orbitrap).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Only 4 out of the 12 samples involved in the study contained raspberry pollen as dominant pollen, although these honeys did not group in the hierarchical cluster analysis nor in the classical multidimensional scaling analyses used for data evaluation. The first result was the detection of mislabelling in two samples, which contained raspberry pollen only as minor or important minor pollen. Of the 188 compounds identified by HPLC-Orbitrap and of the 260 identified by SPME-GC–MS, 87 and 31 compounds were present in all samples, respectively. The structurally related compounds nicotinaldehyde and nicotinamide, nicotinic acid and nicotinyl alcohol were present in 100% of the samples and correlated with <i>R. idaeus</i> pollen count (<i>r</i> &gt; 0.60, Pearson's correlation analysis).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study reveals important aspects about the characterization of red raspberry honey and could give new insights on bee diet and preferences, since niacin compounds resulted interestingly to be related to the presence of red raspberry pollen. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Valeria Leoni, \nSara Panseri, \nLuca Giupponi, \nRadmila Pavlovic, \nCarla Gianoncelli, \nGloria Coatti, \nGiangiacomo Beretta, \nAnnamaria Giorgi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"91ac1e705040909994e993bced39cd85ea3767ceaf9cd8a2a7d49ead19d39c7c","category":"Environment"}
