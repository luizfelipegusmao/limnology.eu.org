{"title":"Chanting of Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo in the Context of the Buddhist Liturgy of Nichiren Shoshu: Study of Sound Frequencies, Brain Activity, and Microbial Metabolism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0236/v2","date":1722983177000,"content":"This study investigates the effects of chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo by a long-term Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist practitioner on sound frequencies (A), brain activity (B), and microbial metabolism(C).A. Analysis of sound frequencies: Spectral analysis of chanting revealed peaks at 8 Hz and 116 Hz, corresponding to the first Schumann resonance and a frequency linked to chloride ion movements, respectively. Additionally, five peaks (417, 528, 639, 741, 852 Hz) corresponding to solfeggio frequencies were identified. These frequencies are known to exert a positive impact on the human endocrine and autonomous nervous systems; improve survival of human brain cells; decrease anxiety in rats; reverse cognitive and endocrine deficits in zebra fish; reduce total concentration of reactive oxidative species in brain tissue. B. Study of Brain activity: Brain activity changes were measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Prefrontal cortex activity increased modestly during chanting compared to a pre-chanting baseline, but significantly increased afterwards. This suggests a shift towards focused attention during chanting and enhanced activity afterward. C. Effects on microbial metabolism: Probiotic cultures exposed to chanting, either directly or indirectly, showed increased metabolic activity. This suggests local and non-local effects, similar to previously reported phenomena. Importantly, this study clarifies that the spiritual practice of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism transcends mere neurophysiological explanations. While brain activity and other bodily processes may be correlated with the practice, the religious and spiritual experience of chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyoencompasses a mystical dimension that, though not contradicting science, cannot be fully explained by scientific methods alone.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e19394b80b0cc8085929acf3f4ec410eaff589c65cf54e7aaad3feedeaaabd22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
