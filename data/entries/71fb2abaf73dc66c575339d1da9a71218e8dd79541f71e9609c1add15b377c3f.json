Efficient management of supplier relationships not only improves the efficiency of the supply chain, but also has an impact on the procurement of ingredients, the variety of menu options, and the integration of technology.Research Limitations/Implications: Although technology developments were shown to enhance operational efficiency, their influence on customer satisfaction was minimal. The research highlights the complex nature of factors that influence customer happiness, indicating the need of adopting a well-rounded strategy that combines technology with personalised care. Identified continuous improvement opportunities provide valuable insights for restaurant owners to enhance strategy and better meet consumer expectations.Practical Implications: This research provides useful insights on the management of Italian restaurants, but it has limitations due to its qualitative approach and dependence on self-reported data.Social Implications: However, the results add to the current knowledge and provide practical consequences for restaurant owners who want to improve their operational efficiency and customer pleasure.Originality/Value: Italian restaurants may achieve long-term success in a highly competitive culinary industry by acknowledging the interdependence of management strategies and using customer-focused techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71fb2abaf73dc66c575339d1da9a71218e8dd79541f71e9609c1add15b377c3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
