{"title":"Toward Alleviating the Stigma of Hearing Aids: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1192/v1","date":1728986502000,"content":"Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in hearing aid technology, adoption rates remain low, with stigma continuing to be a major barrier. This review aims to systematically assess the origins and current state of hearing aid stigma, as well as explore potential strategies for allevi-ating it. The review examines societal perceptions, psychological impacts, and recent technolog-ical advancements that can influence hearing aid adoption and reduce stigma. \nMethods: A systematic review of literature from peer-reviewed journals and reputable sources was conducted, analyzing papers on hearing aid stigma, adoption rates, and technological solu-tions. The articles were categorized by their focus on either stigma causes, societal factors, or technological advancements aimed at improving adoption. \nResults: The review identifies stigma as a complex, multifaceted issue driven primarily by ageism, disability perception, and the association of hearing aids with aging and incapability. Despite technological improvements, the studies surveyed listed stigma as a major factor in non-adoption. Technological advancements such as artificial intelligence in sound processing, multifunctional features, and innovative design have shown potential in reducing stigma and improving user experience. \nConclusions: Alleviating the stigma of hearing aids requires a multi-pronged approach, com-bining improvements in technology with changes in societal perceptions. Multifunctional devices, advanced signal processing, and aesthetic improvements can drive adoption, but broader public health campaigns and education are also essential to changing societal attitudes and fostering greater acceptance of hearing aids.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54e4c4a31522c978489c72fe10c573644cefad87de70d0edb9a469592a13511e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
