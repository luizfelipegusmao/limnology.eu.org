To provide comprehensive spatiotemporal information about biological processes in developing seeds of cultivated barley (<span>Hordeum vulgare</span> L. subsp. <span>vulgare</span>), we performed a transcriptomic study of the embryo, endosperm, and seed maternal tissues collected from grains 4â€“32 days after pollination. Weighted gene co-expression network and motif enrichment analyses identified specific groups of genes and transcription factors (TFs) potentially regulating barley seed tissue development. We defined a set of tissue-specific marker genes and families of TFs for functional studies of the pathways controlling barley grain development. Assessing selected groups of chromatin regulators revealed that epigenetic processes are highly dynamic and likely play a major role during barley endosperm development. The repressive H3K27me3 modification is globally reduced in endosperm tissues and at specific genes related to development and storage compounds. Altogether, this atlas uncovers the complexity of developmentally regulated gene expression in developing barley grains.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"27b734e09fb11838ad8e17f4aea7597ffded77dd8bf89fc52f8a43390824ced1","category":"Environment"}
