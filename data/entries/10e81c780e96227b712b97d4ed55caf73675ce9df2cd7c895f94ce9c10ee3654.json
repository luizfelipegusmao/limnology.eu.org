{"title":"Status of Fishery Discards and By-Products in Greece and Potential Valorization Scenarios towards a National Exploitation Master Plan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1070/v1","date":1715853300000,"content":"The valorization of aquaculture/fisheries processing by-products, as well as unavoidable/unwanted catches and discards in Greece is currently an underutilized activity despite the fact that there are several best practices in Northern Europe and overseas. One of the main challenges is to determine whether the available quantities for processing are sufficient to warrant valorization of discards and fish side streams. This is the first attempt to systematically record and analyze the available quantities of fish by-products and discards in Greece in a spatial and temporal way in an effort to create a national exploitation Master Plan for the valorization of this unavoidable and unwanted biomass. A thorough survey conducted within the VIOAXIOPIO project unveiled a substantial biomass of around 19,000 tonnes annually that could be harnessed for valorization. Furthermore, the production of various High Added Value Biomolecules (HAVB) was investigated, and experimental trials were conducted to assess the potential yields and the collected data were used to formulate four valorization scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10e81c780e96227b712b97d4ed55caf73675ce9df2cd7c895f94ce9c10ee3654","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
