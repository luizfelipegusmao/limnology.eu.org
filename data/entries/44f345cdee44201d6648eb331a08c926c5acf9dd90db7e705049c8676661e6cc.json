{"title":"Attachment Styles and Hypersexuality in Mexican Emerging Adults: Assessing the Influence on Couple and Sexual Satisfaction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0462/v1","date":1717740175000,"content":"This study delves into the complex interplay among attachment styles, hypersexuality, and sexual and couple satisfaction in emerging adults within the Mexican population. Despite established correlations between anxious and avoidant attachment styles and emotion dysregulation and hypersexuality, the roles of sexual and couple satisfaction in this context have remained relatively unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by examining how these variables interact and contribute to psychological distress and sexual risk behaviors. Data analysis on 214 emerging adults, utilizing the Experiences in Close Relationships scale, Couple Satisfaction Index, Sexual Satisfaction Scale, SCL-90, and SAST-R, revealed a significant association between risky sexual behaviors—such as a higher number of sexual partners, drug and alcohol use during sexual activity, and lack of sexual protection—and heightened levels of hypersexuality. Notably, individuals with hypersexual tendencies reported diminished levels of sexual satisfaction but elevated levels of couple satisfaction. Avoidant attachment emerged as the attachment style most strongly correlated with early sexual experiences. Moreover, the abbreviated versions of the Couple Satisfaction Index (CSI-4) and the Experiences in Close Relationships scale (ECR-8) exhibited commendable psychometric properties, enhancing their applicability for research and clinical purposes. This research furnishes valuable insights into the complex dynamics among attachment styles, hypersexuality, and couple and sexual satisfaction, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to foster healthier sexual and relationship behaviors among emerging adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44f345cdee44201d6648eb331a08c926c5acf9dd90db7e705049c8676661e6cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
