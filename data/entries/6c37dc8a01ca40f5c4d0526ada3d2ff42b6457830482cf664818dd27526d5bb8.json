{"title":"Quasi-Analytical Solution of Kepler’s Equation as an Explicit Function of Time","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1019/v1","date":1715763285000,"content":"Although the empirical Kepler’s laws can be proven by applying Newton’s laws to the dynamics of two particles attracted due to the gravitational interaction, there is no explicit formula for the motion as a function of time. In this paper, a quasi-analytical solution for this problem is proposed. It approximates the real behavior of celestial bodies with an acceptable degree of accuracy. All calculations involved require a low computational cost. This problem is closely related to Kepler’s equation, since, the solution for the equations of motion as a function of time gives us the solution to Kepler’s equation as well. The results are presented for each planet of the solar system (including Pluto), and the solution is compared against the real orbits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c37dc8a01ca40f5c4d0526ada3d2ff42b6457830482cf664818dd27526d5bb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
