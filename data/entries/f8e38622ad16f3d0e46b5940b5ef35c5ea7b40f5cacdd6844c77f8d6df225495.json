{"title":"A Theory of Gravity in Minkowski Space","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0634/v1","date":1725877433000,"content":"In this paper, we present a theory of gravity in Minkowski space. The basic idea is that the presence of mass affects the worldline of particles in the flat Minkowski background. Although General Relativity is in complete agreement with observations so far, the theory discussed in this paper is capable of solving some of the conceptual difficulties of GR, such as the energy problem, and is at the core of constructing this theory. We also discuss the cosmic expansion of the present universe and comment on the early universe. We also argue how the flatness problem and horizon problem are solved within this framework. As it will become clear, this is a theory of principle and not a theory of construction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8e38622ad16f3d0e46b5940b5ef35c5ea7b40f5cacdd6844c77f8d6df225495","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
