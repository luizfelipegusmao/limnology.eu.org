{"title":"A Short Article on Marine Litter: From Land to Sea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1785/v1","date":1719316423000,"content":"Marine litter, comprising persistent and human-made solid materials discarded in marine environments, poses a severe threat to Nigeria's coastal and marine ecosystems. Despite existing international, regional, and national regulations, ineffective enforcement and compliance have led to widespread environmental degradation (UNEP, 2021). This study examines the factors contributing to the proliferation of marine litter in Nigeria, focusing on regulatory gaps, insufficient waste management infrastructure, and the lack of public awareness. The findings reveal that the marine ecosystem is deteriorating due to inadequate waste disposal practices and limited understanding of the impacts of marine litter on both the environment and human health (UNEP, 2021). The paper concludes with recommendations for improving regulatory enforcement, enhancing public education, and investing in waste management infrastructure to address the growing crisis of marine litter. Throughout this article, the limited information on the impacts of marine pollution across Africa is highlighted, emphasizing the value of these insights despite their scarcity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb51e686a14f3a6235f97b61b55fc0f68b606e108f3699bc2a7d95d4b4eff18d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
