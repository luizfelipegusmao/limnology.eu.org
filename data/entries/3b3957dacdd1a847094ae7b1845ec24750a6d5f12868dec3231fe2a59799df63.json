{"title":"Reflectance Confocal Microscopy Can Help in Detecting Clinically Silent Mammary Paget Disease: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1138/v1","date":1726618893000,"content":"Breast cancer remains a significant health concern worldwide, necessitating early detection and treatment. The rapid appearance or a change in the shape of skin lesion on the breast or just of the nipple-areola complex(NAC), especially if it is unilateral needs to be evaluated. Several primary or secondary tumours such as inflammatory skin lesions can affect this body area. Ultrasound, mammography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most used non-invasive diagnostic techniques for breast cancer, but in recent years reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and optical coherence tomography have emerged as additional tools to diagnose cases characterized by cutaneous changes.The introduction of new techniques such as reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), may open new perspectives in the non-invasive diagnosis of mammary paget disease (MPD). RCM is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that allows high-resolution images of the skin at microscopic level in real time. It is non-invasive, painless and repeatable, making it a valuable tool in the early diagnosis and monitoring of skin diseases. We describe an atypical clinical presentation of mammary paget disease early diagnosed by reflectance confocal microscopy evaluation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b3957dacdd1a847094ae7b1845ec24750a6d5f12868dec3231fe2a59799df63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
