{"title":"A Comparative Study of Swarm-Optimized Machine Learning Models for Diabetic Kidney Disease Prediction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1528/v1","date":1729490620000,"content":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is regarded as a silent assassin due to its delayed signs. It is a progressive illness that can appear in various ways, from mild to severe. The severity of DKD must be determined in order to make educated treatment decisions and understand the hazards that the patient may encounter. DKD is one of the primary causes for death and morbidity among noncommunicable illnesses, affecting 10% to 15% of the global population. Timely prediction of DKD is expected to improve patients' health and reduce mortality. This study aims to predict DKD using machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Bagging Tree Model and Support Vector Machine, to help in timely detection and cure of this deadly disease. Clinical data required for model training were taken from Kaggle's public repository and additional samples of 50 individuals were collected from local hospital, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Meta-heuristic algorithms based on Swarm Intelligence, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, and Firefly Optimization, were employed to optimize the selected models. The main aim of this study is to compare the predictions of different models and identify models that best agree with the given  scenario.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cc61bfccd723cc899f5c049247ed777a202bbb18c43e44620d9a4de589c904f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
