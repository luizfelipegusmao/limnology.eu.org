{"title":"Mass Mortality of the Invasive Sea Urchin Diadema setosum in Türkiye, Eastern Mediterranean Possibly Reveals Vibrio Bacteria Infection","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12837?af=R","date":1725893342000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The invasive <i>Diadema setosum</i> (Leske, 1778) long-spined sea urchin has been in the Mediterranean Sea since 2006, and then, it has been known that its population density has reached high values on the southern Aegean coasts of Türkiye. This study aimed to report the mass mortality event of <i>D. setosum</i> with the determined agent on the Aegean coast of Türkiye. In addition, it was targeted to provide information on the current status of its density based on seasonal SCUBA diving observations for the period between January 2023 and November 2023. The results showed that the mass mortality of <i>D. setosum</i> was determined in Muğla, Aegean Sea, in August 2023. Spine loss, the mucoid layer at the bottom of the appendages, and the outer body surface were observed as the clinical symptoms of the diseased samples. Bacterial growth was detected on Vibrio-selected TCBS agar plates, while no other parasitic agents were determined in the coelomic fluid of sea urchins. The results of the biochemical (API 20E) and molecular tests confirmed the isolated bacteria as <i>Vibrio</i> spp. The density of <i>D. setosum</i> showed statistically significant temporal changes, and the highest and lowest mean density values were recorded in autumn and spring, respectively. Environmental stressors, such as increasing sea temperature levels, affect the marine ecosystem and lead to opportunistic pathogens. Long-term monitoring of disease outbreaks is necessary to understand the interactions between species and the ecosystem.</p>","author":"Ezgi Dinçtürk, \nFikret Öndes, \nVahit Alan, \nEmre Dön","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"4a29cf09d73bed3704a57212e0c49668365d9a6d93e5b7b24cec441b4112af39","category":"Environment"}
