{"title":"Developing a Lexicon to Measure Food-Elicited Emotions: Standard Methodology Extended to Using the World Wide Web and Social Media","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0262/v1","date":1725509713000,"content":"Questionnaires for self-report of food-elicited emotions are an established practice in consumer studies. However, most tools are originally developed in English and translated into other languages, which limits their use. The aim of this study was to develop the first Greek emotion lexicon and measurement tool for consumers, using standard methodology and extending it. The lexicon was compiled using linguistic sources and extended using the World Wide Web and a popular social media platform for the collection of authentic language and usage data. Terms were also collected from consumers using questionnaires and a variety of stimuli. Terms collected from consumers only comprise: healthy, distrustful, curious, childish, impressed, tolerant, impatient It was validated by application in various case studies, providing discrimination across and within food categories, and by comparison to the Greek translation of a standard tool in English, the EsSense Profile. The comparison was conducted by measuring emotions elicited by six food categories and demonstrated that it is preferable to use emotion measurement tools developed in the linguistic and cultural context of intended use, as they convey consumersâ€™ emotions naturally and more accurately. This tool can be used as a Check- or Rate- All-That-Apply questionnaire to measure consumer responses to food categories and products. The methodology and validation presented can be applied for the compilation of emotion lexicons in languages less studied than English.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89c86778650a99fcef651cd2082e75c8529e64f45b118dc93c29410104345ebe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
