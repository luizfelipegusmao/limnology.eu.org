The remarkable results they achieved in their preliminary work sparked our interest to move from in-situ electrochemical STEM experiments to cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.870-B3\">3-6</a>], as targeted cryo-FIB lift-outs allow interfacial structures to be extracted and characterized from battery electrodes cycled in standard coin cells typical of battery research, unlike model form factors used for in-situ STEM. Inspired by the work of Dr. Lena Kourkoutis, multiscale cryogenic microscopy methods have been pursued to collect images from battery electrodes on a millimeter-to-atomic scale. We continue to build and develop these cryo-EM methods to better understand and correlate the structures of electrochemical interfaces in macroscale battery stacks with nano- and atomic-scale structural, compositional, and strain maps from cycled battery electrode materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"646b09ceac41d35cab1f3974aaa779db23757f0fd103d375d6c4c9adeb0cdb2a","category":"Environment"}
