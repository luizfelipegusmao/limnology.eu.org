Disruptions or failures in these critical links can lead to reduced connectivity within the road network. Under this circumstance, this manuscript proposed a novel identification of critical links mathematical optimization model based on the optimal reliable path with consideration of link correlations under demand uncertainty. The method presented in this paper offers a solution to bypass the necessity of conducting a full scan of the entire road network. Due to the non-additive and non-linear properties of the proposed model, a modified heuristic algorithm based on K-shortest algorithm and inequality technical is presented. The numerical experiments are conducted to show that improve a certain road link may not necessarily improve the overall traffic conditions. Moreover, the results indicate that if the travel time reliability is not considered, it will bring errors to the identification of key links.","author":"Yi Sun","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4611240aed234543f1e9fb2dd3a07b0d6617a059bb7b625081e1a308345fe9c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
