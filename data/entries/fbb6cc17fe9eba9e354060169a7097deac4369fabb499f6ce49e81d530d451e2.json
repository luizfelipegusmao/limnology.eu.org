{"title":"Transcription factor CsMYB36 regulates fruit neck length via mediating cell expansion in cucumber","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/958/7623303?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The fruit neck is an important agronomic trait of cucumber (<span>Cucumis sativus</span>). However, the underlying genes and regulatory mechanisms involved in fruit neck development are poorly understood. We previously identified a cucumber <span>yellow-green peel</span> (<span>ygp</span>) mutant, whose causal gene is MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 36 (<span>CsMYB36</span>). This study showed that the <span>ygp</span> mutant exhibited a shortened fruit neck and repressed cell expansion in the fruit neck. Further functional analysis showed that <span>CsMYB36</span> was also a target gene, and its expression was enriched in the fruit neck. Overexpression of <span>CsMYB36</span> in the <span>ygp</span> mutant rescued shortened fruit necks. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays revealed that CsMYB36 positively regulates the expression of an expansin-like A3 (<span>CsEXLA3</span>) in the fruit neck, which is essential for cell expansion. Yeast 1-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays revealed that CsMYB36 regulates fruit neck elongation by directly binding to the promoter of <span>CsEXLA3</span>. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that <span>CsMYB36</span> is an important gene in the regulation of fruit neck length in cucumber plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"fbb6cc17fe9eba9e354060169a7097deac4369fabb499f6ce49e81d530d451e2","category":"Environment"}
