{"title":"Ulp1 Regulates Cell Proliferation Through INO1 in Pichia pastoris","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1797/v1","date":1729677467000,"content":"Pichia pastoris is extensively employed as a host for expressing foreign proteins, and its secretion system is especially advantageous for efficient protein purification. Ulp1 is essential for the cell cycle. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the absence of Ulp1 leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest. Similarly, in Pichia pastoris, we also observed G2 phase stalling in Ulp1 knockout cells. RNA-seq data revealed significant changes in seven genes, including INO1. Interestingly, overexpressing INO1 in Ulp1 knockout cells restored cell proliferation, suggesting that Ulp1 regulates cell proliferation through INO1. However, adding extra inositol to Ulp1 knockout cells was not able to restore cell prolifera-tion, indicating that the enzyme activity of INO1 is not essential for cell proliferation. Our data provide new insights into Ulp1 functions in the cell cycle and raise new questions about yeast cell cycle regulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff2b9764eb044191fbdb536352420caed21ae03952f24ace08283bd4fba1b16d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
