{"title":"Adopting Internet of Things (IoT) in Supply Chain Operations: Challenges and Opportunities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1634/v1","date":1724317010000,"content":"The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in supply chain operations has emerged as a pivotal advancement, offering the potential to significantly enhance operational efficiency, visibility, and responsiveness. This study explores the multifaceted impact of IoT integration in supply chains, emphasizing both the opportunities and challenges associated with its implementation. Through a combination of semi-structured interviews, case studies, and a comprehensive literature review, the research uncovers how IoT technologies contribute to improved asset tracking, real-time inventory management, and optimized logistics. Key benefits include enhanced operational efficiency, predictive maintenance capabilities, and better supply chain collaboration, which collectively lead to increased customer satisfaction and cost savings. However, the study also identifies several challenges, including the high costs of IoT infrastructure, difficulties in integrating new technologies with existing systems, and concerns over data security and privacy. These challenges pose significant barriers to adoption, particularly for smaller organizations. Despite these obstacles, the study highlights the substantial opportunities presented by IoT, such as fostering innovation, developing new business models, and enhancing supply chain resilience. The findings suggest that while the path to successful IoT adoption may be complex and resource-intensive, the potential benefits make it a valuable investment for organizations seeking to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market. Addressing the identified challenges while leveraging the advantages of IoT will be crucial for companies aiming to optimize their supply chain operations and achieve long-term success.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa6a5a77f7349367c63ba1b888188ea531c87bf36cd54da0dedb62849a2e205d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
