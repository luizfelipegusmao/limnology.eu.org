These HEOs have shown potential applications as thermoelectrics [<a href=\"#ozae044.663-B2\">2</a>], ionic conductors [<a href=\"#ozae044.663-B3\">3</a>], electrocaloric materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.663-B4\">4</a>], etc. Since these systems have multiple aliovalent cations in a single lattice, it necessitates the understanding of elemental distribution and structure of these novel oxides. This would help us understand how the HEOs navigate the configurational space and enable us to establish a correlation between structure and property.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2e047e7107b9e08b4d83f763c3401d232bebdaf71bb5a928b31c0562537c5a8e","category":"Environment"}
