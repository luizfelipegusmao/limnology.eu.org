{"title":"Masterminding the Giant : Shannonian Entropic Threshold Perplexity AI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1274/v1","date":1716195826000,"content":"Undoubtedly,  there is a potential impact of large language models like ChatGPT in revolutionizing information retrieval and knowledge discovery, particularly in the context of the vast amount of electronic material available. On another strong note, the current work offers a first time ever mathematical approach to accurately fine tune perplexity AI, which sets a giant step ahead towards accurate next generations AI. Having started this world leading discovery, the upper and lower bounds of perplexity AI, namely  , , respectively, are obtained for the first-time ever. Concluding remarks combined with emerging open problems and next research phase are provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef8fdd2d2253a0f3eb3abceba0cc357f3d33b7bcf14b5cb59beb8dabadb041f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
