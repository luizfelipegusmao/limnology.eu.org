This serves as the first report of these parasitoids reared from a host in the state of Tennessee, USA. Despite routine pesticide applications in the surveyed nursery and directed treatments of the infested plants to control the scale outbreak, the percentage of parasitized scale in privet and euonymus shrubs averaged 7.0% and 7.9%, respectively. These parasitoids may be useful in the natural or managed control of this pest in the United States, but additional research is needed to understand how these parasitoids contribute to the control of <span>L. japonica</span> in the landscape and how nursery production practices can be modified to promote parasitoid populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"d9c0dd77e0ca00264dcfa8ae900a31ebcd7264444e076ec875427681256b2e79","category":"Environment"}
