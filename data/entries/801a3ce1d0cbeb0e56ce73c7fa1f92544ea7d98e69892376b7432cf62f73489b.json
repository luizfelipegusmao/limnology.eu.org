{"title":"What are olfaction and gustation, and do all animals have them?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae009/7616566?rss=1","date":1709164800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Different animals have distinctive anatomical and physiological properties to their chemical senses that enhance detection and discrimination of relevant chemical cues. Humans and other vertebrates are recognized as having 2 main chemical senses, olfaction and gustation, distinguished from each other by their evolutionarily conserved neuroanatomical organization. This distinction between olfaction and gustation in vertebrates is not based on the medium in which they live because the most ancestral and numerous vertebrates, the fishes, live in an aquatic habitat and thus both olfaction and gustation occur in water and both can be of high sensitivity. The terms olfaction and gustation have also often been applied to the invertebrates, though not based on homology. Consequently, any similarities between olfaction and gustation in the vertebrates and invertebrates have resulted from convergent adaptations or shared constraints during evolution. The untidiness of assigning olfaction and gustation to invertebrates has led some to recommend abandoning the use of these terms and instead unifying them and others into a single categoryâ€”chemical sense. In our essay, we compare the nature of the chemical senses of diverse animal types and consider their designation as olfaction, oral gustation, extra-oral gustation, or simply chemoreception. Properties that we have found useful in categorizing chemical senses of vertebrates and invertebrates include the nature of peripheral sensory cells, organization of the neuropil in the processing centers, molecular receptor specificity, and function.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"801a3ce1d0cbeb0e56ce73c7fa1f92544ea7d98e69892376b7432cf62f73489b","category":"Environment"}
