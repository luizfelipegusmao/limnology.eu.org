Previous anecdotal sightings exist for tiger sharks in this region; however these records have not been reported within the scientific domain. The present sighting occurred in a period of unusually warm sea surface temperature, which has been shown to influence tiger shark range extensions elsewhere. Novel and historic species occurrence records are valuable for determining and predicting species' environmental tolerances, migratory routes, and distributional limits.</p>","author":"Amy Rose Coghlan, \nNaiti Morales","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"6a85e2de5ced2c01b28ea926797cd33fde7fdb86923bbd798bfe121fd6039421","category":"Environment"}
