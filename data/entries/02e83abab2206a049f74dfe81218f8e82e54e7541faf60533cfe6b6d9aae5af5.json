Cryogenic Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) have emerged as powerful tools, enabling scientists to explore quantum materials under extreme conditions of ultra-low temperatures, vacuum conditions and applied stimulus such as bias. This cutting-edge combination of techniques integrates the high-resolution imaging and diffraction capabilities of STEM with cryogenic technology and the analytical capabilities of EELS, allowing for the investigation of materials at these low temperature exotic emergent phases, while simultaneously probing their electronic structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"02e83abab2206a049f74dfe81218f8e82e54e7541faf60533cfe6b6d9aae5af5","category":"Environment"}
