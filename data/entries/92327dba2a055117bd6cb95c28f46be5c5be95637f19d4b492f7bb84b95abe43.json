Here, we investigated the impact of <i>Acacia mangium</i> and <i>Eucalyptus urophilla x E</i>. <i>grandis</i> mixed plantations in the Congolese coastal plains on soil mycobiota community structure and diversity by ITS metabarcoding sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Higher Faith’s phylogenetic diversity and Evenness’ was found in Eucalyptus monoculture relative to stands containing Acacia. Differences in beta diversity were found among Eucalyptus and Acacia monoculture, and mixed-species stands highlight the effects of plant species on fungal community structure. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Rozellomycota phyla were predominant in all stands, with both Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) accounting for more than 70% in all stands. Correlation analysis revealed that sulfur (S) was the most correlated soil attribute with the three predominant phyla but also with Mucoromycota and Calcarisporiellomycota phyla, although mostly negatively correlated (4 out of 5). Phosphorus was mostly positively correlated to soil attributes (3 out of 4) and nitrogen was correlated twice, positively and negatively. Distance-based redundancy analysis revealed a positive correlation of nitrogen (p-value = 0.0019, contribution = 22%) and phosphorus (p-value = 0.0017, contribution = 19%) with soil mycobiota. A high prevalence of generalists (28% to 38%) than specialists (9% to 24%) were found among the different sites. In stands containing Acacia (pure and mixed species) the soil mycobiota harbor the prevalence of generalist strategies with the potential to withstand environmental stresses and utilize a higher number of resources against specialists in Eucalyptus stands. Stronger positive correlation between soil attributes and main fungal taxa, higher generalists’ strategies and lower Faith’s phylogenetic diversity and Evenness were reported in stands containing Acacia. This highlights the potential of mixed-species in preserving community stability following environmental disturbances and increasing the number of resources confirming their important ecological role in boosting the resilience of the forest ecosystems to climate and land-use (plant species as shown by PCA analysis) changes.","author":"Lydie-Stella Koutika","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"92327dba2a055117bd6cb95c28f46be5c5be95637f19d4b492f7bb84b95abe43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
