{"title":"The hidden costs of inflation: A critical analysis of industrial development and environmental consequences","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297413","date":1722866400000,"content":"<p>by Dan Zheng, Abdullah Addas, Liaqat Ali Waseem, Syed Ali Asad Naqvi, Muneeb Ahmad, Kashif Sharif</p>\r\n\r\nThe study draws attention to the associations between monetary and economic elements and their potential environmental impacts. The study uses time series data from 1960 to 2022 to examine the connection between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, industrial growth, GNE, and inflation in China. The researchers utilized the well-known econometric technique of nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) to examine nonlinear correlations between these variables. The results reveal that GDP, inflation, and economic development influence long-term CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The strong positive correlation between gross national expenditures and economic activity increases CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the short run, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are positively and statistically significantly affected by inflation. While inflation temporarily affects CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, this effect dissipates with time. Industrial activity increases CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and Chinaâ€™s fast industrialization has damaged the environment. The energy-intensive fertiliser manufacturing process and fossil fuels increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The research shows how government officials and academics may collaborate to create tailored measures to alleviate the environmental impacts of economic activity.","author":"Dan Zheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8c0a728ed8ce5932289db9d94aa48e65f57e495242638f20ccc0e4a155f9fa20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
