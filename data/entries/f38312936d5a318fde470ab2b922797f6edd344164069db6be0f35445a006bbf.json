{"title":"Results on Cumulative Entropic Properties of Consecutive Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1381/v1","date":1724118059000,"content":"This paper reveals some properties of the cumulative entropy of consecutive k-out-of-n:F\nsystem's lifetime. First, we introduce a method for calculating the cumulative entropy of\ntheir lifetime and explore its preservation properties using established stochastic orders. Ad-\nditionally, we obtain useful bounds that can used in situations where the distribution function\nof the system's component lifetimes are complicated or systems have large components. To\nsupport practical applications, we present two nonparametric estimators for the cumulative\nentropy of these systems. The efficiency and performance of these estimators are illustrated\nwith simulated datasets and further validated with real data sets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f38312936d5a318fde470ab2b922797f6edd344164069db6be0f35445a006bbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
