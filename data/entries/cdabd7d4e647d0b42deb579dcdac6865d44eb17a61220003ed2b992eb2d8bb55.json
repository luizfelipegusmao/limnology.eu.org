{"title":"Enhancing Significant Wave Height Retrieval With FY-3E GNSS-R Data: A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2022/v1","date":1721897830000,"content":"Significant Wave Height(SWH) is a crucial parameter in oceanographic research, essential for understanding various marine and atmospheric processes. Traditional methods for obtaining SWH, such as ship-based and buoy measurements, face limitations like limited spatial coverage and high operational costs. With the advancement of Global Navigation Satellite Systems reflectometry(GNSS-R) technology, a new method for retrieving SWH has emerged, demonstrating promising results. This study utilizes Radio occultation sounder(GNOS) data from the FY-3E satellite and incorporates the latest Vision Transformer(ViT) technology to investigate GNSS-R-based SWH retrieval. We designed and evaluated various deep learning models, including ANN-Wave, CNN-Wave, Hybrid-Wave, Trans-Wave, and ViT-Wave. Through comparative training using ERA5 data, the ViT-Wave model was identified as the optimal retrieval model. The ViT-Wave model achieved an Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) accuracy of 0.4052 meters and Mean Absolute Error(MAE) accuracy of 0.2700 meters, significantly outperforming both traditional methods and newer deep learning approaches utilizing Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite Systems(CYGNSS) data. These results underscore the potential of integrating GNSS-R technology with advanced deep learning models to enhance SWH retrieval accuracy and reliability in oceanographic research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdabd7d4e647d0b42deb579dcdac6865d44eb17a61220003ed2b992eb2d8bb55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
