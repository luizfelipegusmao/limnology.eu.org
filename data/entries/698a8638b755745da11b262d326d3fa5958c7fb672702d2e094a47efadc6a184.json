WHO guidelines and the patient centred approach stress the need to increase patient involvement in hand hygiene promotion in healthcare settings. Patients’ and health care workers’ perspectives are critical for developing interventions to foster patient involvement in promoting hand hygiene. This study explored perceptions of health care workers and patients towards patients’ involvement in hand hygiene promotion.</p> Methods <p>An exploratory qualitative study was conducted in four health facilities: three public, and one private non-profit in central Uganda. We conducted key informant interviews (KIIs) with health care workers and focus group discussions (FGDs) with patients. Respondents were asked their views about a patient reminding a health care worker to practice hand hygiene and how best this can be done. Interviews were audio-recorded, and transcribed. Thematic content analysis was used.</p> Results <p>We led seven FGDs grouped by sex (6 participants each), with patients from different units of the study health care facilities and 23 KIIs with the in-charges of the health care facilities, wards, and infection control committee members. The majority of the KIIs were in the age category 30 to 45 years (10/23), females (14/23), and 7/23 were nurses by cadre. For the FGD participants, the majority were aged 30 to 45 years (23/42), 24/42 were females, 21/42 had attained secondary education as their highest level of education and 21/42 were Catholics. The health care workers’ and patients’ views towards patients’ participation in promoting hand hygiene among health care workers are presented according to the four themes that emerged: i) Patients reminding health care workers to practice hand hygiene was offensive; ii) Patients fear of negative response from health care workers, including being denied or receiving poor quality services; iii) Role of management in influencing hand hygiene (patient reminding a health care workers to wash hands could be acceptable in private health facilities compared to the public ones); iv) Suggestions on how patients’ reminders to health care workers can be done, included empowering patients to do the reminders in a friendly and polite approach to the HCW.</p> Conclusion <p>Patients are reluctant to remind health workers to practice hand hygiene, because they feel it is confrontational and embarrassing, while health care workers find it offensive. Patient involvement seems to threaten patient-provider relationships. However patient empowerment was reported to be critical in promoting it and this is in-line with the hand hygiene guidelines.</p>","author":"Esther Buregyeya","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"698a8638b755745da11b262d326d3fa5958c7fb672702d2e094a47efadc6a184","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
