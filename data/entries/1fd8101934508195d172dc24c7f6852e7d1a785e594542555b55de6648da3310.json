{"title":"Socio-Economic Impacts of Extreme Floods on Agroextractive Socio-Ecological Systems in the Western Amazon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1913/v1","date":1719477835000,"content":"The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world; however, data on its socio-economic impacts in regions such as the Amazon are still insufficient. Thus, this article aims to reveal the socio-environmental vulnerability of riverine communities to climate change through an analysis carried out in the middle Juruá region, Brazil, focusing on the loss of agricultural production that occurred after the extreme flooding in 2021. Data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires with the participation of 638 agro-extractivists from traditional riverine communities in the municipality of Carauari in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as the collection of documentary information and field visits to quantify and qualify the damage caused by the flood. The loss of agricultural production in the territory exceeded the value of US$ 1,300,000 with greater losses in the production of cassava flour, an essential food for the riverine communities. Production chains of non-timber products, such as the case of rubber tapping and the harvesting of oilseeds, were also directly impacted. The damages caused by climate change to the Amazonian riverine sociological systems are already being experienced by the traditional communities of the middle Juruá region. Governments need to assist these populations in building adaptive measures and strengthening local resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fd8101934508195d172dc24c7f6852e7d1a785e594542555b55de6648da3310","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
