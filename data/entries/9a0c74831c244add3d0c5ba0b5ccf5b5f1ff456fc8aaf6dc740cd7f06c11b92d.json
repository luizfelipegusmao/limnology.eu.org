{"title":"Soybean Meal Protein Extraction and Comparative Analysis with Soy Protein Isolate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1254/v1","date":1711005631000,"content":"This study delves into the extraction and compositional analysis of soybean meal protein isolates (SMPI) compared to soy protein isolates (SPI), focusing on their functional and structural properties, digestibility, amino acid composition, and the impact of various proteases on antinutritional factors. By leveraging alkaline (0.25 % of NH4OH) extraction and isoelectric precipitation, SMPI was efficiently obtained. Compositional characteristics revealed that SMPI has high moisture, protein, and ash, but lower fat, and carbohydrate content compared to SPI. Alcalase, Neutrase and Pepsin hydrolysis indicated lower digestibility of SMPI than SPI. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis provided similar molecular structure and protein molecular weight distribution. This comprehensive analysis underscores the valorization of soybean meal, promoting its use beyond conventional animal feed towards nutritional supplements and bio-based products, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability and the enhancement of global food systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a0c74831c244add3d0c5ba0b5ccf5b5f1ff456fc8aaf6dc740cd7f06c11b92d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
