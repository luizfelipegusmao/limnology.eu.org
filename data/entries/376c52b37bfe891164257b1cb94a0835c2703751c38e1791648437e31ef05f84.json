{"title":"Personal Resources for Psychological Well-Being in University Students: The Role of Psychological Capital and Coping Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2208/v1","date":1722323499000,"content":"In recent years, research has noted the increasing prevalence of mental health problems among university students. The current mental health needs of the university population, along with the multitude of stressors they face, increase the importance of examining their psychological well-being and determining the personal resources that effectively promote it. In this context, the present research aims to analyze the role of psychological capital (PsyCap) and coping strategies as personal resources facilitating psychological well-being (PWB) of university students. Specifically, the mediating role of coping strategies (both adaptive and maladaptive) in the relationship between PsyCap and PWB is explored. The study involved 391 university students from Spain. The results found a partial mediation effect of adaptive coping strategies on the relationship between PsyCap and PWB. Likewise, PsyCap was shown to be a direct positive predictor of adaptive coping strategies and PWB, as well as a direct negative predictor of maladaptive coping strategies. Therefore, it is concluded that PsyCap serves as a valuable personal resource that enhances and strengthens PWB in university students, as well as adaptive coping strategies. PsyCap also decreases the tendency to engage in maladaptive coping strategies. Similarly, the use of adaptive coping strategies contributes to improving students' PWB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"376c52b37bfe891164257b1cb94a0835c2703751c38e1791648437e31ef05f84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
