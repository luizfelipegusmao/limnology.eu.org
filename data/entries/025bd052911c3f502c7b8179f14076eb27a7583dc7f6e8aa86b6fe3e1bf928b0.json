However, for many species facing recent increases in fishing or environmental pressure, accurate information on population structure is lacking. Reef Bugs (<em>Thenus australiensis</em>), commonly known as Moreton Bay Bugs, are iconic shovel-nosed lobsters in northern Australia and an increasingly important fisheries resource. Around 80% of landings occur in the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery (ECOTF) where the first stock assessment of the species is underway. However, knowledge about population structure to inform stock assessment is lacking. We used genome complexity reduction-based sequencing to characterise high-quality Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) used to evaluate population structure among three management zones of the ECOTF. Post-filtering, a total of 3,031 SNPs were used to infer no genetic differences among locations indicating strong genetic population connectivity. The presence of a single panmictic population was further supported by cluster and kinship analyses. Broad-scale genetic connectivity likely results from pelagic larval dispersal due to limited adult movements. Findings of high gene flow among connected populations indicate a single biological stock of <em>T. australiensis</em> on Australia’s east coast and will inform future fisheries management initiatives.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"025bd052911c3f502c7b8179f14076eb27a7583dc7f6e8aa86b6fe3e1bf928b0","category":"Environment"}
