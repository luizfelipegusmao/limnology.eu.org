{"title":"Hardware Testing Methodology for Wide Bandgap  High Power Converters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0601/v1","date":1725866231000,"content":"Wide bandgap (WBG) power semiconductor devices are increasingly replacing silicon IGBTs in high-power and high-voltage power electronics applications. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding efficient testing methodologies for high-power and high-voltage converters under constrained laboratory resources. This paper addresses this gap by presenting comprehensive, hardware-focused testing methodologies for high-power and high-voltage WBG power semiconductor based converters, preceding the control evaluation phase. The proposed methods enable thorough evaluation and evaluation of converter hardware, including device switching characteristics, driving circuit functionality, thermal management performance, insulation integrity, and sustained operation at full power. We utilize the double pulse test (DPT) to characterize switching performance in a two-level phase leg configuration, extract circuit parasitics, and validate magnetic components. The DPT is further applied to optimize gate driving circuits, validate overcurrent protection mechanisms, and measure device on-resistance. Additionally, a multicycle test is introduced to rapidly assess steady-state converter performance and estimate efficiency. Recognizing the critical role of thermal management in high-power converters, our methodologies extend to the experimental extraction of key thermal parameters—such as junction-to-ambient thermal resistance and thermal capacitance—via a heat loss injection method. A correlation method between temperature sensor measurements and junction temperature is presented to enhance the accuracy of device temperature monitoring during tests. To ensure reliability and safety, dielectric withstand tests and partial discharge measurements are conducted at both component and converter levels under conventional 60 Hz sinusoidal and high-frequency PWM waveforms. Finally, we highlight the importance of testing converters under full voltage, current, and thermal conditions through power circulating tests with minimal power consumption, applicable to both non-isolated and isolated high-power converters. Practical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of these hardware testing methodologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46b266fe0b4be95ed545a08af0456e0a6a0247123179b3d05f8c8885b7314fa0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
