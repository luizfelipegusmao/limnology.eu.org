{"title":"Metabolic Syndrome in Patients With Epilepsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0590/v1","date":1718088644000,"content":"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) refers to the group of several interconnected risk factors that collectively double the risk of cardiovascular disease. Epilepsy is linked to MetS across all age groups, though its prevalence differs across various studies. This can be understood from the perspective of seizure-related metabolic abnormalities, long-term antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) use, and a more sedentary lifestyle due to epilepsy. The factors that are considered in developing MetS for patients with epilepsy (PWE) are age, residence, level of physical activity, food intake status, epilepsy subtype, epilepsy duration, current (AEDs) use, drug responsiveness status, body-mass index (BMI), total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. A deeper understanding of the epilepsy-AED-MetS connection and the exploration of lifestyle interventions hold the promise of significantly improving the overall health and well-being of PWE. Clinicians managing PWE should closely monitor various risk factors for developing MetS and consider them when selecting AED treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15249515b5e69d286e37d7d676343ce2ae2d6d17bd05dbbfb3d4755dc92f3a5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
