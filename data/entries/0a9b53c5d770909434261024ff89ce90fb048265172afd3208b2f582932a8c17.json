{"title":"Histological Findings of Resected Tracheal Ring in SARS-CoV-2 Positive and Negative Tracheostomized Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1402/v1","date":1726655990000,"content":"Introduction: The aim of this study is to compare the histopathological findings in the resected tracheal ring of tracheotomized critically ill patients with or without severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Material and Methods: Prospective case-control study. Data collection period was between May 2020-2022. 80 tracheostomies on patients with long intubation were performed and the resected tracheal ring was examined by standard microscopy. 40 consecutive tracheotomies in COVID-19 patients and 40 in patients without COVID-19 disease were carried out. Results: The mean age was 68.18 years in the COVID group and 56.1 years in the NO COVID group. The male/female ratio was 32/8 versus 29/11 respectively. No relevant histological alterations were found in 82.5% of samples. Chronic subepithelial inflammation was found in 13.8% of cases. Two cases presented vasculitis (2,5%) and one case thrombotic microangiopathy (1,2%), all cases in the COVID group. We found no statistically significant dependence between relevant histologic findings versus no alterations (X2=0.779) no significant indices for measuring association (Rho= 0.1316) and no significant risk indices (RR = 1.8, OR=2.032, PAR= 44%). Conclusion: There is no evidence of increased risk of histopathological findings of the resected tracheal ring in patients with long intubation and COVID-19 disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a9b53c5d770909434261024ff89ce90fb048265172afd3208b2f582932a8c17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
