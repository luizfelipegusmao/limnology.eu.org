While DTG has been implicated as an obesogen associated with greater weight gain compared to other antiretrovirals, there is a paucity of data in pregnant women and their children. The Obesogenic oRigins of maternal and Child metabolic health Involving Dolutegravir (ORCHID) study is investigating associations between DTG, weight gain, and metabolic outcomes in the context of HIV.</p> Materials &amp; methods <p>ORCHID is a prospective observational study taking place in Cape Town, South Africa (NCT 04991402). A total of 1920 pregnant women with and without HIV infection are being followed from ≤18 weeks gestational age to 24 months postpartum with their children. Participants attend eleven study visits: 3 antenatal, delivery, and 7 postnatal visits. Several embedded sub-studies address specific scientific aims. Primary outcome measurements in mothers include anthropometry, blood pressure, body composition, dysglycemia, insulin resistance (IR), and dyslipidemia. Other maternal measures include demographics, resting energy expenditure, viral load, physical activity, dietary intake, hepatic steatosis, and repository specimens. Sub-study measurements include markers of adipose inflammation, gut integrity, and satiety/hunger, subcutaneous adipose tissue morphology and mitochondrial function, and metabolomics. Primary outcome measurements in children include anthropometry, adipose tissue mass, dysglycemia, IR, and dyslipidemia. Other variables include fetal growth, birth outcomes, medical/breastfeeding history, caloric intake, neurodevelopment, and repository specimens. Sub-study measurements include metabolites/lipid subspecies in umbilical cord blood, as well as breast milk composition and DTG exposure.</p> Discussion <p>ORCHID will play a pivotal role in defining obesogenic mechanisms and clinical consequences of DTG use in pregnancy in women with HIV and their children. It will provide insights into metabolic disease risk reduction in the context of HIV/DTG, identify intervention targets, and inform public health approaches to diminish chronic metabolic co-morbidities for women and children.</p>","author":"Elaine J.
