However, this view is strongly based on data from grasslands due to the limited empirical evidence from tree diversity experiments. Here we report on the relationship between tree diversity and productivity over 10 years in a field experiment established in 2005 that was then affected by the 2018 mega-drought in central Europe. Across a number of years, tree species diversity and productivity were significantly positively related; however, the slope switched to negative in the year of the drought. Net diversity effects increased through time, with complementarity effects making greater contributions to the net diversity effect than selection effects. Complementarity effects were clearly positive in three- and five-species mixtures before the drought (2012–2016) but were found to decrease in the year of the drought. Selection effects were clearly positive in 2016 and remained positive in the drought year 2018 in two-, three-, and five-species mixtures. The survival of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) plummeted in response to the drought, and a negative relationship between species diversity and spruce survival was found. Taken together, our findings suggest that tree diversity per se may not buffer communities against the impacts of extreme drought and that tree species composition and the drought tolerance of tree species (i.e., species identity) will be important determinants of community productivity as the prevalence of drought increases.</p>","author":"Tanvir Ahmed Shovon, \nHarald Auge, \nJosephine Haase, \nCharles A.
