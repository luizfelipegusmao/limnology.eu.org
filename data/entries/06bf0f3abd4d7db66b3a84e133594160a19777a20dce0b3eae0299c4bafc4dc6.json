This environment is now known to influence not only the functionality of the early embryo but potentially the future phenotype of the offspring. Using transcriptomic and epigenetic molecular analysis, and the bovine model, recent research has shown that both the female and the male metabolic status, for example age, can affect gene expression and gene programming in the embryo. Evidence demonstrates that milking cows losing body weight at the time of conception generates compromised embryos and offsprings with a unique metabolic signature. A similar phenomenon has been associated with different culture conditions and the IVF procedure. The general common consequence of these situations is an embryo behaving as “economy” mode where translation, cell division and ATP production is reduced, potentially to adapt to the perceived future environment. New epidemiologic studies in bovine to assess if these changes result in a different phenotype especially with animals created by IVF which shows consequences later in life.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"06bf0f3abd4d7db66b3a84e133594160a19777a20dce0b3eae0299c4bafc4dc6","category":"Environment"}
