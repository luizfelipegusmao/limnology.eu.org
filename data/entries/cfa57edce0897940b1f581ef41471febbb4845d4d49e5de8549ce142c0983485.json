{"title":"H3K4me1 recruits DNA repair proteins in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2410/7635455?rss=1","date":1711411200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>DNA repair proteins can be recruited by their histone reader domains to specific epigenomic features, with consequences on intragenomic mutation rate variation. Here, we investigated H3K4me1-associated hypomutation in plants. We first examined 2 proteins which, in plants, contain Tudor histone reader domains: PRECOCIOUS DISSOCIATION OF SISTERS 5 (PDS5C), involved in homology-directed repair, and MUTS HOMOLOG 6 (MSH6), a mismatch repair protein. The MSH6 Tudor domain of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) binds to H3K4me1 as previously demonstrated for PDS5C, which localizes to H3K4me1-rich gene bodies and essential genes. Mutations revealed by ultradeep sequencing of wild-type and <span>msh6</span> knockout lines in Arabidopsis show that functional MSH6 is critical for the reduced rate of single-base substitution (SBS) mutations in gene bodies and H3K4me1-rich regions. We explored the breadth of these mechanisms among plants by examining a large rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) mutation data set. H3K4me1-associated hypomutation is conserved in rice as are the H3K4me1-binding residues of MSH6 and PDS5C Tudor domains. Recruitment of DNA repair proteins by H3K4me1 in plants reveals convergent, but distinct, epigenome-recruited DNA repair mechanisms from those well described in humans. The emergent model of H3K4me1-recruited repair in plants is consistent with evolutionary theory regarding mutation modifier systems and offers mechanistic insight into intragenomic mutation rate variation in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cfa57edce0897940b1f581ef41471febbb4845d4d49e5de8549ce142c0983485","category":"Environment"}
