{"title":"286 Impact of rate of overwinter gain in March-born yearling range heifers on growth rates and reproductive performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/430/7757026?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Our objective was to determine the impact of rate of overwinter gain in March-born yearling heifers on pre- and post-breeding growth rates and reproductive performance. Red Angus x Simmental crossbred beef heifers [n = 182; weaning body weight (BW) = 242 kg ± 23 kg] were utilized in a 3-yr study conducted at the University of Nebraska, Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory (GSL) near Whitman, NE. Using 3-d BW averages collected in January, heifers were stratified by BW and randomly assigned to one of two treatments: 1) to achieve a low overwinter rate of gain at 0.34 kg/d (LO, n = 106), or 2) to achieve a high overwinter rate of gain at 0.68 kg/d (HI, n = 76). To achieve gains, heifers were managed together and had individual access to a dried distillers grain supplement via a C-lock Smart Feeder (Rapid City, SD). Each year, treatments were initiated in January and ended in May (111 ± 4 d). Heifer BW was collected at the start of trial (January), end of the trial (May), pre-breeding (May), pregnancy diagnosis (October), and pre-calving (February). Heifer body condition score (BCS) was collected at pregnancy diagnosis (October) and pre-calving (February; Yr 1 and 2). Before the breeding season, two blood samples were collected 10-d apart via coccygeal venipuncture to determine the percentage of heifers cycling. At breeding, HI-fed heifers had a greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) BW than LO-fed heifers (813 and 788 kg, respectively; Table 1). However, heifer BW at pregnancy diagnosis and pre-calving were not impacted (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.16) by supplemental treatment. Additionally, there were no differences (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.16) in BCS at pregnancy diagnosis and pre-calving among treatments. Furthermore, rate of gain did not influence (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.38) the percent pubertal prior to the breeding season, pregnancy rates, or the percent that calved in the first 21-d of the calving season. Moreover, rate of gain did not impact (<span>P</span> = 0.89) subsequent calf BW at birth. There was a significant treatment x year interaction (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) for subsequent calving date, where HI treatment heifers calved 7-d earlier than LO treatment heifers in Yr 1. This study implies that producers can develop heifers at a less overwinter rate of gain without impacting reproductive performance or subsequent calf birth weight.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"6e4523dd2712fca97c595b987bca144fc33fd2492e72d180f3a88a73de3913c9","category":"Environment"}
