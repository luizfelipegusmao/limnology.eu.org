{"title":"Modular Quasi-pseudo Metrics and the Aggregation Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1133/v1","date":1715959330000,"content":"The applicability of  the distance aggregation problem has attracted the interest of many authors. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we face the modular quasi-(pseudo-)metric aggregation problem. We  characterize those functions that allow merging a collection of modular quasi-(pseudo-)metrics into a single one. Specifically,  a  description of such functions in terms of triangle triplets is given and, in addition, the relationship between modular quasi-(pseudo-)metric aggregation functions and modular (pseudo-)metric aggregation functions is discussed. Such characterizations are illustrated with appropriate examples. A few methods to construct modular quasi-(pseudo-)metrics are yielded.  Several properties of modular quasi-(pseudo-)metric aggregation functions are explored and used to develop quick tests for discarding candidate functions to aggregate modular quasi-(pseudo-)metrics. Moreover, a characterization of those modular quasi-(pseudo-)metric aggregation functions that preserve modular quasi-(pseudo-)metrics is also provided. Furthermore, the relationship between modular  quasi-(pseudo-)metric aggregation functions and quasi-(pseudo-)metric aggregation functions is studied in such a way that significative differences are displayed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5aa223da725aecc70961d6622f02bc4bd5b65b731dfe8de11d932346a86161f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
