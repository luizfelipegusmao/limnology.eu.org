{"title":"On The Incompleteness Of Einstein-De Sitter Spacetime","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2043/v1","date":1721907271000,"content":"This paper presents a mathematically rigorous investigation into the incompleteness of Einstein-de Sitter spacetime. The incompleteness of the spacetime is proved using results regarding isometries between connected Semi-Riemannian manifolds following the computation of the Einstein tensor of the Einstein-de Sitter spacetime. Various properties of the Einstein-de Sitter spacetime apart from its incompleteness is also discussed based on its incompleteness with the help of various results of Semi-Riemannian manifolds. Also, few properties of spacetime which cannot be concluded from the incompleteness of the spacetime is also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c80905bcad4fd2a7d02e2861c3028fccddb6dbcd55aa1c4a028feca7e2cdb0b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
