{"title":"Unintended exposure to e-liquids and subsequent health outcomes among US youth and adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308006","date":1722348000000,"content":"<p>by Juhan Lee, Grace Kong, Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, Deepa R. Camenga</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of oral, ocular, or dermal e-liquid exposure and subsequent outcomes (becoming sick, going to the hospital) in the US. We examined survey data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study Wave 5 (2018–2019). The analytic sample included US youth (aged 12–17 years), young adults (aged 18–24 years), and older adults (aged ≥ 25 years) who reported e-cigarette use in the past 12 months. We first determined the prevalence of self-reported e-liquid exposure (in the mouth, skin, or eyes), subsequently “becoming sick” from the exposure, and “going to the hospital” after the exposure. We also examined associations between these outcomes and the device type used (refillable tank /mod system, replaceable prefilled cartridges, disposable/ other device type). E-liquid exposure was reported by 25% of youth (aged 12–17 years), 25% of young adults (aged 18–24 years), and 19% of older adults (aged≥ 25 years). Among individuals reporting e-liquid exposure, subsequent sickness was reported by 10% of youth11% of young adults, and 14% of older adults, and “going to the hospital” was reported by 3.5% of youth, 2.7% of young adults, and 6.8% of older adults. Among young adults, the use of a refillable tank /mod system was associated with higher odds of e-liquid exposure (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2, 4.1) than the use of other device types, including disposables. The findings suggest that, at a minimum, e-cigarettes/e-liquids may need warning labels that state the risks of e-liquid exposure and packaging regulations that promote device and bottle designs that minimize e-liquid spills.","author":"Juhan Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e96dfbd457a352c91bfba1d924ea7417a8ddd55375072f74c0afca6e13ede68e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
