{"title":"The Dark Web And Cybercrime: Identifying Threats And Anticipating Emerging Trends","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0147/v1","date":1727867294000,"content":"Background/Objective: The Dark Web has played a pivotal role in the progress and sophistication of cybercrime.  It provides an incubation network beyond the reach of traditional search engines where cybercriminals create and display exploit kits, offers illicit goods and services, and exchange confidential insider intelligence.  Cybercriminals are extremely adept at selecting targets, applying tools to achieve their objectives, and minimizing red tape. The increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and the exponential rise of cybercrime against critical infrastructure underlines the necessity of identifying emerging threats. The objective of this research is to investigate the evolving threats within the Dark Web including crimeware-as-a-service and the integration of AI/ML into cyberattacks to inform risk management strategies and strengthen security measures.Research Problem: The exponential rise in cybercrime against critical infrastructure reflects growing sophisticationpresenting a significant challenge to organizations and society. The motivation behind cybercrime is fundamentally driven by self-greed which has contributed drastically to the magnitude and changes in methods used by cybercriminals to enhance profitability.  The impact of cybercrime on business organizations presents an adverse impact on society and carries significant risks for the progress of individuals and the world at large. As cybercriminals adopt new technologies and services such as crimeware-as-a-service, identifying emerging trends becomes crucial to developing proactive strategies for the detection and prevention of cyber threats.Methodology: This research employs a systematic literature review approach to analyze emerging trends in cybercrime originating from the Dark Web. The review includes scholarly articles, news sources, and blog posts sourced from platforms like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and various libraries. The key focus is to answer questions regarding the relationship between the Dark Web and cybercrime, accelerating cybercrime activities, and the benefits and implications of these new trends.Results: Key findings of this paper range from the rise of crimeware-as-a-service attacks and the increasing use of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning capabilities by cybercriminals to automate attacks across various businesses and organizations are also propounded along with information related to entry points and cybercrime attack pathways. The emergence of sophisticated cybercrime techniques, including ransomware-as-a-service, targeted attacks using AI, and exploitation of IoT vulnerabilities, are identified as critical trends. Social engineering, malware, and the rise of remote work have expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals.Discussion: As the use of cybercrime continues to metamorphose, the identification of new threats and extrapolation of emerging trends is critical to investigate the challenges associated with the monitoring and detection of illegitimate activities on the Dark Web as well as for the establishment of proactive risk management strategies and implementation of robust security measures. The research highlights the transformation of cybercrime into a structured and scalable ecosystem driven by technological advancements and service-based attack models. Cybercriminals now leverage AI/ML increasing the sophistication and success of their attacks. The commoditization of cybercrime has enabled less skilled individuals to participate amplifying the volume and diversity of threats faced by organizations.Conclusion: As cybercrime continues to evolve and adopt emerging technologies, organizations must remain vigilant and adaptable. The findings emphasize the need for proactive risk management, continuous monitoring of cybercrime trends, and robust security measures to mitigate the increasing threats originating from the Dark Web. Future research should focus on deeper exploration of AI-driven attacks and the development of more advanced countermeasures to safeguard critical infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b907719faa88b8a2c89ec11608bf809bb59b305dc5a24ad45af9f8804eb78843","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
