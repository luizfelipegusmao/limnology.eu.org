{"title":"Fabrication of dry S/O/W microcapsule and its probiotic protection against different stresses","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13175?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Encapsulation is commonly used to protect probiotics against harsh stresses. Thus, the fabrication of microcapsules with special structure is critical. In this work, microcapsules with the structure of S/O/W (solid-in-oil-in-water) emulsion were prepared for probiotics, with butterfat containing probiotics as the inner core and with whey protein isolate fibrils (WPIF) and antioxidants (epigallocatechin gallate, EGCG; glutathione, GSH) as the outer shell.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Based on the high viscosity and good emulsifying ability of WPIF, dry well-dispersed microcapsules were successfully prepared via the stabilization of the butterfat emulsion during freeze-drying with 30–50 g L<sup>−1</sup> WPIF. WPIF, WPIF + EGCG, and WPIF + GSH microcapsules with 50 g L<sup>−1</sup> WPIF protected probiotics very well against different stresses and exhibited similar inactivation results, indicating that EGCG and GSH exerted neither harm or protection on probiotics. This significantly reduced the harmful effects of antioxidants on probiotics. Almost all the probiotics survived after pasteurization, which was critical for the use of probiotics in other foods. The inactivation values of probiotics in microcapsules were around 1 log in simulated gastric juice (SGJ), about 0.5 log in simulated intestinal juice (SIJ), and around 1 log after 40 days of ambient storage.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Dry S/O/W microcapsule, with butterfat containing probiotics as the inner core and WPIF as the outer shell, significantly increased the resistance of probiotics to harsh environments. This work proposed a preparation method of dry S/O/W microcapsule with core/shell structure, which could be used in the encapsulation of probiotics and other bioactive ingredients.</p>","author":"Qianwan Guo, \nBo Cui, \nChao Yuan, \nLi Guo, \nZhao Li, \nQingqing Chai, \nNa Wang, \nMichael Gänzle, \nMeng Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"dae77e4879cbbb6f1d9178f46d1fb80a217321daed6fc1a613df9957ee168006","category":"Environment"}
