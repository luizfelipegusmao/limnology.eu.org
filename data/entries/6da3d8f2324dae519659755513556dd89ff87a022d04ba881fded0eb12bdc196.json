The current increase in technology adoption in the immunisation supply chain promises the attainment of universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on immunisation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of technology integration in Vaccine and Immunization Health Supply Chain Management (VIHSCM) in Tanzania. This study adopted an exploratory descriptive cross-sectional design. The study collected data using structured questionnaires from health facilities that adopted VIHSCM technologies in Arusha, Mwanza, Morogoro and Mbeya regions, Tanzania. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations with the aid of the Statistical Package of Social Sciences 23<sup>rd</sup> Edition (SPSS). The study included 37 health facilities in Tanzania, mainly district hospitals (59.5%). Respondents were mostly female (70.3%), averaging 45 years old, with 1â€“5 years of immunization experience. While all facilities had refrigerators, digital reporting tool usage was low, with many relying on paper forms. District hospitals and health centres had higher digital tool adoption rates compared to dispensaries. Despite the underutilization of systems like ILS, TImR, and GoTHOMIS, digital tools were deemed crucial for vaccine supply management. While District Hospitals report high relevance of digital tools, Health Centres and Dispensaries show moderate relevance. Challenges include incomplete technology adoption, inadequate infrastructure, and variable perceptions of technology effectiveness. Digital technologies significantly improve vaccine and immunization supply chain management, particularly in larger facilities. Technologies like the Tanzania Immunization Registry (TImR) and Integrated Logistics Systems (ILS) enhance data accuracy and efficiency. Addressing facility-specific challenges and increasing investment in digital tools are crucial for optimizing vaccine supply chains and achieving immunization targets in Tanzania. Future research should involve larger samples to generalize findings and further explore technology impacts on VIHSCM.","author":"Henry A.
