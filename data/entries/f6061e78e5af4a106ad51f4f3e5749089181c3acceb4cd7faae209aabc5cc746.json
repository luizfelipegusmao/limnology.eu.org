{"title":"Born Digibal - The Internationalization of Enterprises in the Context of the Digital Transformation of the Global Economy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1154/v1","date":1723725898000,"content":"The digital transformation of the global economy presents new challenges and opportunities for businesses and nations. With the growing role of digital technologies and the dynamic changes in the structure of the economy, there is a need for a better understanding of the processes shaping contemporary enterprises. This article analyzes the impact of digital transformation on businesses and the global economy, identifying key areas where these changes are most evident. As part of this discussion, a modification of the “9 Pillars of Industry 4.0” concept is proposed, incorporating solutions that have emerged since its inception. The resulting model, “11 Pillars of Industry 4.0,” enabled the analysis of the “born digital” and “born global” concepts, highlighting their numerous common features in the context of the digital transformation of economies. This became the basis for proposing a new concept: “born digibal” — enterprises that from the outset operate in multiple markets, with their main sphere of activity based on digital solutions.The conclusions of the article provide an assessment of the changes occurring in businesses and the global economy in the digital age. They suggest that the dynamics of globalization in the 21st century will be shaped by complex interactions between digital transformation and the actions of businesses and nations, requiring flexibility and innovation in adapting to new economic realities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6061e78e5af4a106ad51f4f3e5749089181c3acceb4cd7faae209aabc5cc746","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
