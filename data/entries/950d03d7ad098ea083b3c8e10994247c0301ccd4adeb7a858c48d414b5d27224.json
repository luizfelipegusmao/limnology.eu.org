{"title":"The Influence of Perceived Overqualification on Constructive Deviant Behavior: The Moderating Role of Digital Leadership Across Generations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1545/v2","date":1727360411000,"content":"This study, based on proactive motivation theory, explores the relationship between perceived overqualification, digital leadership, and constructive deviant behavior, as well as generational differences. Using data collected in two waves from 596 employees, the results show that perceived overqualification positively influences constructive deviant behavior, and digital leadership enhances this effect. Employees born in the 1980s are most influenced by both factors, followed by those born in the 1990s, where the effect of digital leadership is less significant. The study suggests that effectively utilizing digital leadership and recognizing generational differences in perceived overqualification can help organizations better manage overqualified talent, improving employee satisfaction and productivity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"950d03d7ad098ea083b3c8e10994247c0301ccd4adeb7a858c48d414b5d27224","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
