{"title":"Exploring Social Participation Among Adults with Spinal Cord Injury During the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2557/v1","date":1722431963000,"content":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic challenged people with spinal cord injury (SCI) regarding a variety of mental and physical issues. New challenges may arise as the effects of the pandemic continue. The objective of the present study was to explore the social participation of Canadians with SCI during the second wave of COVID-19. Methods: Participants with SCI from two Canadian provinces (Quebec and British Columbia) were interviewed. Results: Eighteen participants completed interviews. Facilitators of social participation remain similar since the first wave of COVID-19, such as the use of technology, help received by relatives and the use of delivery services to obtain groceries and other essentials. Obstacles to mobility due to winter conditions and lack of considerations related to COVID-19 public health measures specific to wheelchair users were also discussed by participants. Conclusions: People with SCI perceived participation restrictions, little changes in life habits, and uncertainty about the future during the second wave of COVID-19. The unique living conditions of people with SCI, ability to adapt life habits, and the lived experiences of people with SCI may have contributed to an overall resilience during the pandemic. Adaptive families, social contacts and technology made a difference during the pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b48f911fc6e6987e3012daa783dbd9eacd3432f03d1cc506a0c8fec6b68f94f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
