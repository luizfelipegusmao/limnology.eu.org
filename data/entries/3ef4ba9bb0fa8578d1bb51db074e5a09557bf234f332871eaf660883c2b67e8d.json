{"title":"Differential Signal Amplitude Modulated Multi-beam Remote Optical Touch Based on Grating Antenna","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1758/v1","date":1716806097000,"content":"As screen sizes are becoming larger and larger, which are beyond human’s physical limitation for direct touching interaction, remote controls are inevitable. However, as techniques applied so far, inertial gyroscopes are susceptible to position inaccuracies, and gesture recognition is limited by cameras’ focus depth and viewing angle. Grating antenna light trapping technology will be an ideal candidate providing the ghost point problem for multipoint inputs can be solved. Therefore, we propose a differential amplitude modulation scheme for grating antenna based multi beam optical touch, which can recognize different incidence points. Where, the amplitude of the incident beams was coded with different pulse width at first. Then, after been trapped by the grating antenna and been transferred into currents by the lined detector arrays, the incident points of the individual beams were recognized and differentiated. The scheme was successfully verified on an 18-inch screen, where two-point optical touch with position accuracy error under 3mm and response time less than 7ms under modulation frequency of 10kHz on both incident beams are obtained. This work paves a practical way for remote multi-point touch, which can make digital mouse in consistent to the users pointing direction obeying natural three-point one ling aiming rule instantaneously.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ef4ba9bb0fa8578d1bb51db074e5a09557bf234f332871eaf660883c2b67e8d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
