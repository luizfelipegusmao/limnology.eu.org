This is further jeopardised by global warming and resistance of <i>Sparicotyle chrysophrii</i> to available anthelminthic compounds. Future research should be directed toward design of sound measures to mitigate the infection, based on close monitoring of parasite epidemiology.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Following the intensification of the Mediterranean aquaculture over the years, <i>Sparicotyle</i> (syn. <i>Microcotyle</i>) <i>chrysophrii</i> (van Beneden and Hesse, 1863; Microcotylidae, Monogenea) became one of the most pathogenic ectoparasites for the gilthead seabream (<i>Sparus aurata</i> L.) aquaculture. It has demonstrated a remarkable versatility to expand over its known host range, accomplish an efficient transfer between the wild and farmed sparid populations over wide geographic areas, and establish itself as the most detrimental gilthead seabream pathogen. Even though the incidence of <i>S. chrysophrii</i> is closely monitored in marine aquaculture system throughout the Mediterranean, there is a general lack of recent and publicly available data on its epidemiology. Being considered as a parasite whose proliferation is expected to increase under global warming conditions, such lack of data additionally humpers the implementation of integrated pest management strategy at national and Mediterranean level. While EU scientific initiatives greatly contributed to our understanding of <i>S. chrysophrii</i> biology, ecology and sparicotylosis treatment and pathogenesis, there is more ahead to elucidate about the mitigation of the diseases, particularly towards the development of genomic selection breeding programs of parasite-resilient gilthead seabream, omic-based screening of novel drug targets and reversed vaccinology.</p>","author":"Ivona Mladineo, \nDonatella Volpatti, \nPaola Beraldo, \nGeorge Rigos, \nPantelis Katharios, \nFrancesc Padros","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"b0273a77bdd346c914876d342dff7e192d24fab94aafea3da572b91d97faa733","category":"Environment"}
