{"title":"Examination of the Vitreolenticular Interface in Relation to Uneventful Phacoemulsification over One-Year Postoperative Period","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1835/v1","date":1714281555000,"content":"Background: Swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-AS- OCT) is a suitable examination for the vitreolenticular interface. Methods: In a prospective study using Anterion (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) 102 eyes of 102 patients were examined, in pupil dilation, preoperatively and 6 times over 1-year follow-up. Preoperatively anterior hyaloid membrane (AHM) visibility was determined with Imaging App with high reliability. Postoperatively capsular bag–AHM distance was measured on six points by using Metrics App. Results: The AHM was visible in 18.6% preoperatively and postoperatively as well (Group 1), 49% of the preoperatively adherent AHMs became visible (Group 2A), 32.4% remained attached (Group 2B). Group 1: the average deepest point first day was 782.5 ± 324.1 microns, and it significantly differed from the later follow-up values. Group 2A: the average deepest value was 184.1 ± 220.1 microns, and there was no statistically significant difference between the postoperative visit values. The difference between the groups was statistically significant at every location and at each time points. Conclusions: AS-SS-OCT can be used to check BS both preoperatively(with limitations) and postoperatively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ca3126ba1fcfb87d1fc0e55d503afe6c62df7b4228cd25fb557515858ddff5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
