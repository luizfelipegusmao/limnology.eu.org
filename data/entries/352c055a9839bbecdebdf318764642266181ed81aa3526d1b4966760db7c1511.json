{"title":"Scalable kernel balancing weights in a nationwide observational study of hospital profit status and heart attack outcomes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/3/736/7484571?rss=1","date":1703030400000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>Weighting is a general and often-used method for statistical adjustment. Weighting has two objectives: first, to balance covariate distributions, and second, to ensure that the weights have minimal dispersion and thus produce a more stable estimator. A recent, increasingly common approach directly optimizes the weights toward these two objectives. However, this approach has not yet been feasible in large-scale datasets when investigators wish to flexibly balance general basis functions in an extended feature space. To address this practical problem, we describe a scalable and flexible approach to weighting that integrates a basis expansion in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with state-of-the-art convex optimization techniques. Specifically, we use the rank-restricted Nystr√∂m method to efficiently compute a kernel basis for balancing in nearly linear time and space, and then use the specialized first-order alternating direction method of multipliers to rapidly find the optimal weights. In an extensive simulation study, we provide new insights into the performance of weighting estimators in large datasets, showing that the proposed approach substantially outperforms others in terms of accuracy and speed. Finally, we use this weighting approach to conduct a national study of the relationship between hospital profit status and heart attack outcomes in a comprehensive dataset of 1.27 million patients. We find that for-profit hospitals use interventional cardiology to treat heart attacks at similar rates as other hospitals but have higher mortality and readmission rates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"352c055a9839bbecdebdf318764642266181ed81aa3526d1b4966760db7c1511","category":"Environment"}
