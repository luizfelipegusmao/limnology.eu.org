{"title":"Machine Learning Meets Meta-heuristics: Bald Eagle Search Optimization and Red Deer Optimization for Feature Selection in Type II Diabetes Diagnosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1948/v1","date":1719489201000,"content":"This article investigates the effectiveness of feature extraction and selection techniques for enhancing the performance of classifiers accuracy in Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) detection using microarray gene data. To address the inherent high dimensionality of the data by employing three Feature Extraction (FE) methods are used namely, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Ridge Regression (RR), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). To further refine the data, meta-heuristic algorithms like Bald Eagle Search Optimization (BESO) and Red Deer Optimization (RDO) are utilized for feature selection. The performance of seven classification techniques such as Non-Linear Regression - NLR, Linear Regression - LR, Gaussian Mixture Model - GMM, Expectation Maximization - EM, Logistic Regression - LoR, Softmax Discriminant Classifier - SDC, and Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel - SVM-RBF are evaluated with and without feature selection. The analysis reveals that the combination of PCC with SVM-RBF achieved a promising accuracy of 92.85% even without feature selection. Notably, employing BESO with PCC and SVM-RBF maintained this high accuracy. However, the highest overall accuracy of 97.14% was achieved when RDO was used for feature selection alongside PCC and SVM-RBF. These findings highlight the potential of feature extraction and selection techniques, particularly RDO with PCC, in improving the accuracy of DM detection using microarray gene data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4a9fb4d810015cfe36f2a6386a435869ac5a7fd05315451a131112e95cabdd9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
