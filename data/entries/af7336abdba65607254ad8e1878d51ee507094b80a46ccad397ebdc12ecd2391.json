{"title":"How will better data (and better use of data) enable us to save the planet?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002689","date":1717509600000,"content":"<p>by Frank Hawkins</p>\r\n\r\nThe potentially catastrophic loss of biodiversity happening around the globe is largely caused by economic activity that is not connected to its environmental impacts. To improve positive and reduce negative outcomes for nature, investment decision-makers in companies, governments, and the finance sector need data on the impacts of economic activity, especially production of food and other commodities, on biodiversity, at fine geographical scales. This Essay argues that the data allowing us to identify the most important factors causing biodiversity loss are already available. However, we need more data to track impacts on biodiversity up value chains into pathways, toolkits, and approaches that will facilitate verified, concrete actions by companies and consumers to reduce threats to biodiversity in particular places. Our current knowledge is insufficient to deliver complete responses to the biodiversity crisis, but this is no excuse for delaying action.","author":"Frank Hawkins","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"af7336abdba65607254ad8e1878d51ee507094b80a46ccad397ebdc12ecd2391","category":"Environment"}
