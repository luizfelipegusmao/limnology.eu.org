{"title":"Rhizosphere microbial community assembly as influenced by reductive soil disinfestation to resist successive cropping obstacle","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13952?af=R","date":1728624306000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Reductive soil disinfestation (RSD), which involves creating anaerobic conditions and incorporating large amounts of organic materials into the soil, has been identified as a reliable strategy for reducing soilborne diseases in successive cropping systems. However, limited research exists on the connections between soil microorganism composition and plant diseases under various types of organic material applications. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of distinct RSD strategies (control without soil amendment; RSD with 1500 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> molasses powder; RSD with 3000 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> molasses powder; RSD with 3000 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> molasses powder and 37.5–41.3 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> microbial agent) on the plant disease index, bacterial community composition and network structure in rhizosphere soil.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>RSD treatments significantly reduced the occurrence of black shank disease in tobacco and increased soil bacterial diversity. High amounts of molasses powder in RSD treatments further enhanced disease inhibition and reduced fungal abundance and Shannon index. RSD also increased the relative abundance of bacterial phylum Firmicutes and fungal phylum Ascomycota, while decreasing the relative abundance of bacterial phyla Chloroflexi and Acidobacteriota and fungal phylum Basidiomycota in rhizosphere soil. A multiple regression model identified bacterial positive cohesion as the primary factor influencing the plant disease index, with a greater impact than bacterial negative cohesion and community stability. The competition among beneficial bacteria for creating a healthy rhizosphere environment is likely a key factor in the success of RSD in reducing plant disease risk.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>RSD, especially with higher rates of molasses powder, is a viable strategy for controlling black shank disease in tobacco and promoting soil health by fostering beneficial microbial communities.
