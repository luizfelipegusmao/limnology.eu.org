{"title":"Accuracy of Lung Point-of-Care Ultrasound (Pocus) for Diagnosing Acute Respiratory Diseases in Pediatric Intensive Care Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1247/v1","date":1723807681000,"content":"Objectives: Imaging exams are requested in intensive care units as a diagnostic, evaluation, and clinical monitoring method. While Chest Computed Tomography is the gold standard, Chest X-ray is the exam usually performed in routine care. Lung ultrasound has been gaining ground as it is a reliable exam performed at the bedside without exposure to radiation and at a low cost. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of bedside lung ultrasounds performed by pediatric intensivists as a diagnostic method. Methods: A prospective, diagnostic test-type study comparing bedside lung ultrasound performed by a pediatric intensivist with the evaluation of chest X-ray and lung ultrasound performed by a radiologist. Result: 48 patients on mechanical ventilation, aged from 1 month to 14 years, were analyzed, corresponding to 95 chest X-ray exams and 95 lung ultrasound exams. The Kappa agreement coefficients between the pediatric intensivist and the radiologist, both analyzing the lung ultrasound, were: normal report (1.0), atelectasis (1.0), pneumothorax (1.0), consolidation (0.97), pleural effusion (0.95), and pulmonary edema (0.90). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of lung ultrasound were, respectively, normal report (50%; 91.8%; 82.1%), consolidation (88.3%; 57.1%; 76.8%), atelectasis (11.1%; 90.7%; 83.2%), edema (0; 70.2%; 70.5%), pneumothorax (83.3%; 94.4%; 93.7%), and pleural effusion (71.4%; 73%; 72.6%). Conclusion: The pediatric intensivist was skilled in examining and diagnosing lung injuries. Lung ultrasound showed good sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy when the pediatric intensivist performed when diagnosing consolidation, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. Furthermore, lung ultrasound demonstrated better accuracy in evaluating pulmonary edema when compared with chest X-ray.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1548704e9c2c8133e63036de2e7049f0da678e3b991bc140df077feadcd365db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
