{"title":"Evaluation of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Polyphenols Combined with Saccharomyces cerevisiae as Antimicrobials for Growth of Listeria monocytogenes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2465/v1","date":1727726797000,"content":"This study used a completely randomized design with a bifactorial arrangement in triplicate to evaluate dif-ferent concentrations of flavonoid extracts from orange (Citrus sinensis), onion (Allium cepa), tamarillo (So-lanum betaceum) and cocoa (Theobroma cacao) peels in combination with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to inhibit the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in fruit juices. The shells were dehydrated at 50-57 °C for 8 hours and pulverized. The dehydration yields were: orange (32 %), onion (13 %), tamarillo (14 %) and cocoa (34 %). Flavonoids were extracted with Soxhlet using 70% ethanol for 5 hours, concentrating with a rotary evaporator. They were quantified by UV spectrophotometry and the Folin-Ciocalteu method, being the highest in orange (300,75-372,60 mg Q/L) and onion (205,70-534,96 mg Q/L), while tamarillo presented the lowest, with possible errors in the measurement. Soluble solids losses ranged from 2,30 g (cocoa) to 5,27 g (orange). Cocoa and orange extracts showed greater potential as natural preservatives, inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in fruit juices, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 300 µg/mL and 400 µg/mL, re-spectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"668e02aac9439b945051d6f51a7dcca74f9c3ef0fc36a4d05900340f13f662de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
