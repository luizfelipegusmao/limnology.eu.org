{"title":"Therapeutic Potential of Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Liver Injury","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2016/v1","date":1724833547000,"content":"Liver injury caused by various factors significantly impacts human health. Stem cell transplantation has potential for enhancing liver functionality, but safety concerns such as immune rejection, tumorigenesis, and the formation of emboli in the lungs remain. Recent studies have shown that stem cells primarily exert their effects through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs have been shown to play crucial roles in reducing inflammation, preventing cell death, and promoting liver cell proliferation. Additionally, they can function as carriers to deliver targeted drugs to the liver, thereby exerting specific physiological effects. EVs possess several advantages, including structural stability, low immunogenicity, minimal tumorigenicity targeting capabilities, and convenient collection,. Consequently, these factors have garnered significant attention from researchers and are expected to become alternative therapeutic agents to stem cell therapy. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current research progress on the use of stem cell-derived EVs in the treatment of liver injury.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e7e1dff89203bd5bd419f634b2893b0c4855cf6a9a90e96cc1ce789e5072d26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
