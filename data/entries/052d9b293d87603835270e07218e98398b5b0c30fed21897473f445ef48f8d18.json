{"title":"Interaction between bacterial microbiota and nematode parasite communities in sheepâ€™s gastrointestinal tract","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306390","date":1719496800000,"content":"<p>by Laura Mate, Luis Ignacio Alvarez, Mercedes Lloberas, Fernanda Imperiale, Carlos Edmundo Lanusse, Juan Pedro Liron</p>\r\n\r\nThe economic impact of gastrointestinal (GI) nematode infections on livestock production is well documented worldwide. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that parasite colonization induces significant changes in the GI tract environment and, therefore, in the landscape where the microbiota and parasites occur. Understanding the interactions between bacterial and parasite populations in the digestive tract of livestock may be useful to design parasite control strategies based on microbiota modification. The aims of this work were to investigate the impact of the oxytetracycline-mediated manipulation of the gut microbial community on the composition of GI nematode populations in naturally infected sheep and to explore changes in the GI microbial communities after nematode population treatment with the anthelmintic compound monepantel. Extensive manipulation of the GI microbiota with a therapeutic dose of the long-acting oxytetracycline formulation did not induce significant changes in the GI nematode burden. The gut microbiota of treated animals returned to control levels 17 days after treatment, suggesting strong resilience of the sheep microbial community to antibiotic-mediated microbiota perturbation. A significant decrease of the bacterial <i>Mycoplasmataceae</i> family (Log<sub>2</sub>FC = -4, P<sub>adj</sub> = 0.001) and a marked increase of the <i>Methanobacteriaceae</i> family (Log<sub>2</sub>FC = 2.9, P<sub>adj</sub> = 0.018) were observed in the abomasum of sheep receiving the monepantel treatment. While a comprehensive evaluation of the interactions among GI mycoplasma, methanobacteria and nematode populations deserves further assessment, the bacteria-nematode population interactions should be included in future control programs in livestock production. Understanding how bacteria and parasites may influence each other in the GI tract environment may substantially contribute to the knowledge of the role of microbiota composition in nematode parasite establishment and the role of the parasites in the microbiota composition.","author":"Laura Mate","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"052d9b293d87603835270e07218e98398b5b0c30fed21897473f445ef48f8d18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
