{"title":"Advancing Sustainable Construction: A Systematic Review of the Role of Blockchain Technology in 3D Concrete Printing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1981/v1","date":1729780793000,"content":"This systematic review explores how blockchain technology (BcT) can enhance the sustainability, efficiency, and transparency of 3D concrete printing (3DCP) in the construction industry. BcT offers promising solutions to persistent challenges such as resource inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and complex project management. 3DCP, as a cutting-edge construction method, has shown potential in reducing waste, optimizing resources, and enabling intricate designs that traditional methods struggle to achieve. However, its adoption is slowed by supply chain and execution issues. Blockchain’s decentralized and immutable nature allows for secure, traceable, and transparent data management, improving material tracking and automating workflows via smart contracts. Following PRISMA guidelines, an initial search identified 767 papers from Web of Science and Scopus, and through an extended search using additional keywords, a total of 3,227 materials were found. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 10 studies were analyzed through scientometric and content analysis. The review highlights blockchain’s potential to promote material reuse and support circular economy principles, improving 3DCP’s sustainability. While promising, the integration of these technologies lacks real-world case studies, underscoring the need for further research. This review positions blockchain as a key driver for advancing sustainable practices in 3DCP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09cc53010347dbcb05d5eba13cddb55d4a11679cba381257f095a5e5cec016cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
