{"title":"Environmental enrichment improves growth and fillet quality in rainbow trout","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13234?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Some environmental enrichment methods, such as occupational enrichment (OE), can improve fish growth, but little is known about its effects on fillet quality. In this study, we evaluated the effects of OE using underwater currents on different aspects of fillet quality and muscle metabolism in rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>), before and after a handling procedure (fasting). The trout were placed in groups of 30 in separate tanks in three treatments for 30 days: no artificial currents (CON), randomly fired underwater currents (RFC), and continuous underwater currents (CUC). Additionally, half of the individuals in each treatment were fasted (5 days, 45.2 °C days).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Slaughter weight, condition factor, and relative growth were lower in CON fish, indicating a positive effect of OE on growth. Rigor mortis, muscle pH, and muscle glycogen levels were similar among treatments, indicating no effect of OE on classical measures of fillet quality. However, significant differences were found regarding fillet colour and muscle enzymes. The fillets of RFC fish were more salmon-pink in colour, which is favoured by consumers. Also, activity levels of pyruvate kinase and glycogen phosphorylase in muscle were significantly higher in CUC fish, probably due to increased energy demands, as pumps were on continually in that treatment.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Overall, RFC fish seemed to have received enough stimulation to improve growth while not being excessive in terms of exhausting the animals (avoiding negative effects on muscle metabolism), whereas OE may have provided a hormetic effect, allowing fish to better adjust to fasting. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Álvaro De la Llave‐Propín, \nAndrea Martínez Villalba, \nMorris Villarroel, \nConcepción Pérez, \nElisabeth González de Chávarri, \nMaría Teresa Díaz, \nAlmudena Cabezas, \nRoberto González Garoz, \nJesús De la Fuente, \nRubén Bermejo‐Poza","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"b9d37fcd51eb2d312392728349f6ccc92063a725e619bfe88c2a5bd51f035956","category":"Environment"}
