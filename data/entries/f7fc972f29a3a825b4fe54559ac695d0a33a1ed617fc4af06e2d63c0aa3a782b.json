{"title":"Psychometric properties of the Functional Literacy Questionnaire among Portuguese adolescents","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306802","date":1728396000000,"content":"<p>by Raquel Martins, Carolina Capitão, Rodrigo Feteira-Santos, Ana Virgolino, Osvaldo Santos</p>\r\nBackground <p>Robust tools to assess self-reported adolescent functional health literacy are lacking. In Portugal, the only available tool is the Newest Vital Sign for Portuguese adolescents (NVS-PTeen), though presenting modest validity and reliability properties. A new instrument–the Functional Literacy Questionnaire (FLiQ)–was developed, inspired by the NVS-PTeen, but following the European Regulation for food labeling and targeting a balanced assessment of numeracy and verbal comprehension skills. This study aimed to evaluate several psychometric properties of the FLiQ when administered to Portuguese adolescents.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a longitudinal observational study with three phases: (1) Delphi panel with health literacy experts; (2) self-administration of FLiQ and NVS-PTeen to adolescents in 7<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> grades; and (3) re-administration of FLiQ four weeks after baseline, to the same group of participants.</p> Results <p>FLiQ’s content validity was excellent, with an Average-Content Validity Index of .95. Overall, 372 adolescents (50.3% girls) aged between 12–17 years (median age: 13) participated in the study. Of these, 150 completed the test-retest assessment. Internal consistency was good (Kuder-Richardson Fornula-20 = .70), as well as test-retest reliability (Intraclass Coefficient Correlation = .82). FLiQ total score was weakly correlated with the school year (rho = .174), and moderately with Portuguese (rho = .348) and Mathematics grades (rho = .333). Factor analysis indicated a two-dimension structure, reflecting numeracy and verbal comprehension skills. Item response theory analysis revealed differences in difficulty and discrimination capacity among items, all with adequate fit values.</p> Conclusion <p>FLiQ is a valid and reliable tool. It can be used to monitor functional health literacy levels in Portuguese adolescents.</p>","author":"Raquel Martins","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f7fc972f29a3a825b4fe54559ac695d0a33a1ed617fc4af06e2d63c0aa3a782b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
