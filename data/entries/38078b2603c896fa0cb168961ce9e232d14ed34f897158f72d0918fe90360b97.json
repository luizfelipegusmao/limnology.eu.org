{"title":"Artisan Cheese Cream Fermented with Kefir Grains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0969/v1","date":1720708492000,"content":"This is the first study that investigates the effect of kefir with an emphasis on the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) during the fermentation process in food products. The products developed and characterized were an artisanal cream cheese without cream and with added cream and for the analysis of the fatty acid profile, both cream cheeses were compared with commercial cream cheese. The artisan cream cheese had a high amount of lactic acid bacteria characterizing the product formed by lactobacilli and a low concentration of lactose due to the fermentation process. Compared to commercial cream cheese, our products without and with added cream had a higher concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyric acid which is important for the health of the gastrointestinal tract and oleic fatty acid which has been associated with the prevention and control of some diseases. Overall, the artisan cream cheese cream with fermented cream with kefir grains is a functional product with an innovative character compared to current products on the market and was well accepted by the younger public. This new product comes as an option for those who need to change their eating habits and maintain a healthy lifestyle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"38078b2603c896fa0cb168961ce9e232d14ed34f897158f72d0918fe90360b97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
