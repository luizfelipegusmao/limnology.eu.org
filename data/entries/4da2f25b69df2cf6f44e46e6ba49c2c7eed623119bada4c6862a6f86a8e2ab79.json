{"title":"Physicochemical properties of esterified/crosslinked quinoa starches and their influence on bread quality","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13265?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Starch is the main component of quinoa seeds. However, quinoa starch has poor solubility in cold water and poor mechanical resistance and is easily aged, which limit its application. Therefore, modification of its structure to improve its functional properties is necessary.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>This research used acetic anhydride and sodium trimetaphosphate to modify the structure of starch molecules and investigated their influence on bread quality. The results showed that both esterification and crosslinking prevented the aggregation behavior of starch molecules. Moreover, they both decreased the gelatinization enthalpy change and relative crystallinity of the starch. Compared with native starch, modification significantly decreased the gelatinization temperature from 57.01 to 52.01 °C and the esterified starch exhibited the lowest enthalpy change with a 44.2% decrease. Modified starch increased the specific volume and decreased the hardness and chewiness of bread. Modification did not influence the moisture content in bread but impacted the water retention capacity, depending on the degree of modification. Low and medium degrees of modification improved the water retention capacity during storage. By contrast, a high degree of modification (10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> crosslinking agent) decreased the water retention capacity. The dually modified quinoa starch (esterified and crosslinked) showed no influence on the textural properties of bread.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study demonstrated that both esterification and crosslinking significantly improved the functional properties of quinoa starch. Crosslinked or esterified quinoa starches have the potential to improve the textural properties of bakery products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Donghai Wang, \nZhiyi Tang, \nRui Chen, \nXu Zhong, \nXiaoyao Du, \nYi‐Xuan Li, \nZhengtao Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4da2f25b69df2cf6f44e46e6ba49c2c7eed623119bada4c6862a6f86a8e2ab79","category":"Environment"}
