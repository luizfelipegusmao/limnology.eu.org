{"title":"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting raphe nucleus (CsfR) in mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0501/v1","date":1723020445000,"content":"A unique nucleus, the cerebrospinal fluid-contacting nucleus (CsfR), has been identified in the brain parenchyma. This nucleus features neurons with somas located within the parenchyma and processes extending into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This anatomical configuration suggests that the CsfR may serve as a crucial interface between the nervous and body fluid regulatory systems, potentially playing a significant role in overall physiological modulation. Despite its importance, the precise biological significance of the CsfR remains to be fully elucidated. Previous research has characterized the CsfR in rats, detailing its position, adjacency, neuron distribution, size reconstruction, and stereotaxic coordinates in rats and non-human primates. Given the relevance of mice as a model organism, especially the C57BL/6J strain, this study aims to explore the existence and morphology of the CsfR in mice. Our findings confirm the presence of the CsfR, consistently located in the ventral gray area of the lower part of the aqueduct and the upper part of the fourth ventricle floor. It is bilaterally symmetrical and heart-shaped, which is slightly different from the Y-shape observed in rats. This study provides significant references for researchers investigating this specialized nucleus.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90cf0eaa90a7cb97843b9abd67d8e5b70827d5ddb021c236102920871a375eef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
