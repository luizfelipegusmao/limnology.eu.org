{"title":"Iodophor/H2O2 Mediated 2-Sulfonylation of Indoles and N-Methylpyrrole in Aqueous Phase","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0182/v1","date":1719907693000,"content":"A convenient and efficient strategy for the preparation of 2-sulfonylindoles has been achieved through iodophor/H2O2-mediated 2-sulfonylation of indoles with readily available sulfonyl hydrazides in aqueous phase. Iodophor is commercially available and serves as the green catalyst and aqueous phase. A series of 2-sulfonylated products from indoles and N-methylpyrrole were synthesized in moderate yields in only 10 min. Control experiments were also conducted to reveal the mechanism. This method is environment friendly, easy to operate and suitable for a wide range of substrates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d332e90bb6b5dcfff8768fe8b1981644b4bdc4ba7e178aeb2f0a903bc92a84b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
