{"title":"Identification and characterization of two O-methyltransferases involved in biosynthesis of methylated 2-(2-phenethyl)chromones in agarwood","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3452/7630922?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The 2-(2-phenethyl)chromones (PECs) are the signature constituents responsible for the fragrance and pharmacological properties of agarwood. <span>O</span>-Methyltransferases (OMTs) are necessary for the biosynthesis of methylated PECs, but there is little known about OMTs in <span>Aquilaria sinensis</span>. In this study, we identified 29 <span>OMT</span> genes from the <span>A. sinensis</span> genome. Expression analysis showed they were differentially expressed in different tissues and responded to drill wounding. Comprehensive analysis of the gene expression and methylated PEC content revealed that <span>AsOMT2</span>, <span>AsOMT8</span>, <span>AsOMT11</span>, <span>AsOMT16</span>, and <span>AsOMT28</span> could potentially be involved in methylated PECs biosynthesis. <span>In vitro</span> enzyme assays and functional analysis in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> demonstrated that AsOMT11 and AsOMT16 could methylate 6-hydroxy-2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone to form 6-methoxy-2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone. A transient overexpression experiment in the variety ‘Qi-Nan’ revealed that AsOMT11 and AsOMT16 could significantly promote the accumulation of three major methylated PECs. Our results provide candidate genes for the mass production of methylated PECs using synthetic biology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"fc76f0c6f91e821f9aa72d592bf0925544cc2f740d894c5d6e23245b69c72b0e","category":"Environment"}
