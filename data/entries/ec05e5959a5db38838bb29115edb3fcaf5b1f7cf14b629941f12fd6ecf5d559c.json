{"title":"Exponential Convergence-(t, s)-Weak Tractability of Approximation in Weighted Hilbert Spaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1207/v1","date":1716180746000,"content":"We study L_2-approximation problems in the  weighted Hilbert spaces in the worst case setting. Three interesting weighted Hilbert spaces appear in this paper, whose weights  are equipped with two positive parameters $\\ga_j$ and $\\az_j$ for $j=1,\\,2,\\dots,\\,d$. We consider the worst case error of algorithms that use finitely many arbitrary continuous linear functionals. We discuss the exponential convergence-(t,s)-weak tractability (EC-(t,s)-WT) of these L_2-approximation problems  under the absolute or normalized error criterion. In particular, we obtain  the sufficient and necessary conditions for EC-(1,1)-WT and EC-(t,1)-WT with t","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec05e5959a5db38838bb29115edb3fcaf5b1f7cf14b629941f12fd6ecf5d559c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
