{"title":"Nutritional, Metabolic and Inflammatory Alterations in Children with Chylous Effusion in the Postoperative Period of Cardiac Surgery: A Descriptive Cohort","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1477/v1","date":1729254093000,"content":"Objective: The occurrence of chylous effusion in children undergoing cardiac surgery is progressively increasing due to technical advances that have led to a rise in the number of surgeries. In this context, the objective was to describe the clinical profile of a cohort of patients at the time of chylous effusion diagnosis.\nMethods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted between January 2011 and July 2023, involving patients aged zero to 18 years, treated at a Quaternary University Hospital in southeastern Brazil. Data were obtained from the follow-up records of the Multidisciplinary Nutritional Therapy Team (MNTT) for patients who received nutritional support after developing chylous effusion in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery.\nResults: The younger population predominated (median age of 6 months), with a high prevalence of malnutrition (60.9%). At the time of chylous effusion diagnosis, 83% had lymphopenia, and 74% had hypoalbuminemia. The longer the time elapsed after surgery for the onset of chylous effusion, the lower the HDL cholesterol, the lower the albumin levels, the greater the surgical complexity, and the younger and lower weight the patient. Hypocalcemia occurred in nearly half of the sample, and hypophosphatemia in 26% of the analyzed cases.\nConclusions: There was a notable presence of lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and low HDL cholesterol, as well as a high incidence of mineral imbalances, particularly hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, which, if untreated, may lead to unfavorable outcomes. Therefore, clinical and laboratory monitoring of children in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery is important and can aid in the early diagnosis of chylous effusion and, consequently, in the timely initiation of treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6d5151fd4d6f238602abbc94af85ec79df37af8bd9e2e50be08fcf1979fa8c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
