{"title":"Identifying the Leading Sources of Saturated Fat and Added Sugar in U.S. Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0452/v1","date":1715157296000,"content":"The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting intakes of saturated fat and added sugars (SF/AS) to 88% of the representative sample of U.S. adults. The top sources of SF were cheese, pizza, ice cream, and eggs. The leading sources of AS were soft drinks, tea, fruit drinks, and cakes and pies. This analysis reflects a parsimonious approach to reliably identify foods and beverages that contribute to SF/AS intakes in U.S. adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"747b684314a63f8185a85540df228834305b4269a59042ab50ec0503045e3a63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
