{"title":"Cross-task Differences in Cortical Activations for Dynamic \nBalance in Neurotypical Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0625/v1","date":1725877693000,"content":"Although significant progress has been made in understanding the cortical correlates underlying balance control, these studies focused on a single task limiting the ability to generalize the find-ings. Different balance tasks may elicit cortical activations in the same regions but show different levels of activation because of distinct underlying mechanisms. In this study, we instructed twenty young, neurotypical adults to maintain standing balance while the standing support surface was either translated or rotated and investigated the differences in cortical activations between these two widely used tasks using whole head electroencephalography (EEG). Addi-tionally, we investigated whether transcranial magnetic stimulation could modulate these cortical activations. We found higher delta and lower alpha relative power over the fronto-central region during the platform translation task when compared to the platform rotation task suggesting greater engagement of attentional and sensory integration resources for the former. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) significantly reduced delta activity in the fronto-central region but did not alter alpha activity during the platform translation task. Our results provide a direct comparison of neural activations between two commonly used balance tasks and are expected to lay a strong foundation for designing neuro-interventions for balance improvements with effects generalizable across multiple balance scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60e986ba52321466a3d2f22e9ce95e8db1db9b68116d8b259c1fcc1a6fe01109","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
