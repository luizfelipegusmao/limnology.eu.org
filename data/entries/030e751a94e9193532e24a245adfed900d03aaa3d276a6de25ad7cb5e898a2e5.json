{"title":"A leak K+ channel TWK-40 sustains the rhythmic motor program","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae234/7691353?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Leak potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) currents, conducted by two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels, are critical for the stabilization of the membrane potential. The effect of K<sub>2P</sub> channels on motor rhythm remains enigmatic. We show here that the K<sub>2P</sub> TWK-40 contributes to the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in <span>Caenorhabditis elegans</span>. Disrupting TWK-40 suppresses the expulsion defects of <span>nlp-40</span> and <span>aex-2</span> mutants. By contrast, a gain-of-function (<span>gf</span>) mutant of <span>twk-40</span> significantly reduces the expulsion frequency per DMP cycle. In situ whole-cell patch clamping demonstrates that TWK-40 forms an outward current that hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential of dorsorectal ganglion ventral process B (DVB), an excitatory GABAergic motor neuron that activates expulsion muscle contraction. In addition, TWK-40 substantially contributes to the rhythmic activity of DVB. Specifically, DVB Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations exhibit obvious defects in loss-of-function (<span>lf</span>) mutant of <span>twk-40</span>. Expression of TWK-40(<span>gf</span>) in DVB recapitulates the expulsion deficiency of the <span>twk-40(gf)</span> mutant, and inhibits DVB Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in both wild-type and <span>twk-40(lf)</span> animals. Moreover, DVB innervated enteric muscles also exhibit rhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> defects in <span>twk-40</span> mutants. In summary, these findings establish TWK-40 as a crucial neuronal stabilizer of DMP, linking leak K<sub>2P</sub> channels with rhythmic motor activity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"030e751a94e9193532e24a245adfed900d03aaa3d276a6de25ad7cb5e898a2e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
