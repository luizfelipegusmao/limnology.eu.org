{"title":"Comparison of Methane Emissions from Dairy Cows Quantified by Maximum Amplitude of Eructation Peaks and other Concentration Metrics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0605/v1","date":1723164096000,"content":"The aim of this study was to quantify methane (CH4) emissions from dairy cows during milking by maximum amplitude of eructation peaks and compare estimates with other metrics for CH4 emissions. Spot measurements of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were recorded for at least 7 days of continuous sampling using an infrared gas analyser in a robotic milking station whilst cows were milked. Concentrations of CH4 and CO2 were measured at 1 second intervals. A total of 105,701 CH4 spot measurements were obtained from 2,206 dairy cows on 18 farms. Methane emissions per individual cow were quantified by maximum amplitude of eructation peaks, average area under eructation peaks (integral of eructation), average concentration during milking and ratio of CH4 to CO2 concentration. There was a high correlation (r = 0.71) between CH4 emissions quantified by maximum amplitude and integral of eructation peaks. The correlation between maximum amplitude and average CH4 concentration was low, and there was no correlation between maximum amplitude and ratio of CH4 to CO2. As both approaches identify and extract eructation peaks to quantify enteric CH4 emissions, the substantial association between maximum amplitude and eructation integral was expected.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a7c4dfbd045a3f7f4973283b5030472bfc0fea68161621446666ea9995af8f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
