{"title":"Evaluation of Trenchless Pressure Pipeline Inspection Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0442/v1","date":1725526742000,"content":"Within the research of pressure pipeline inspection methods there is an industry that is constantly growing and becoming more efficient. The purpose of inspection methods on pressure pipelines comes back to the issue of resolving leaks, corrosion, and inability of a pipeline to function (eventually). Evidently, these issues can hurt the environment, the public using the material being carried out by these pressure pipelines such as natural gas or petroleum and can hurt the pockets of pipeline companies that did not react quick enough to their pipeline solely for the reason that they may have not noticed there was an issue with their pressure pipeline. In-line inspection methods are continuously growing and have already made an impact to prevent the catastrophes that occur when a pipeline is not maintained. Technology such as smart pigs, MFLs, and ultrasounds are the future of pressure pipeline inspection. This research paper explains their pros and cons and how theyâ€™re overall more efficient and preferred as the primary inspection method for a pipeline. Older, more traditional methods such as aerial inspection, by-foot inspection, hydrostatic pressure testing, and Direct Assessment does not cover every base of inspection like in-line inspection technology does and this research explains why that is and the areas of where in-line inspection technology can be improved and deemed not as useful. This is where trenchless renewal and replacement methods come into play with inspection methods and determining the characteristics of a pipeline that matches with which inspection method and which trenchless method to use. The future of inspection methods for pressure pipelines is attainable and is somewhat already here, this research discusses the new emerging technologies and how designing in-line inspection technology to be cheaper and more versatile with pipeline characteristics can make everyone a winner in the future. A winner as far the environment being safe, neighborhoods near pressure pipelines being safe, companies being able to install in-line inspection technology at a fraction of the cost of today and the efficiency of pipelines by monitoring the characteristics with this new technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73ac895d31f5c80320377c604813408a5d93d2c1e46cc7ab1401f4027ecd43e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
