{"title":"Assessing the Impact of Brackish Water on Soil Salinization Using Time-Lapse Electromagnetic Induction Inversion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0843/v1","date":1712908278000,"content":"In the last decade Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) measurements have been increasingly used for investigating the soil salinization caused by the use of brackish or saline water as irrigation source. EMI measurements proved to be a powerful tool for providing spatial information of the investigated soil because of the strict correlation between the output geophysical parameter, i.e. the electrical conductivity, to soil moisture and salinity. In addition, their non-invasive nature and their capability to collect a high number of data over broad areas and in relatively short time, makes these measurements attractive for monitoring flow and transport dynamics, otherwise undetectable with conventional measurements. In an experimental field, EMI measurements were collected during the growth season of the tomato, irrigated with three different irrigation strategies. The data were collected over three months in a time-lapse mode in order to visualize changes in electrical conductivity to be associated with soil salinity. A rigorous time-lapse inversion procedure has been set for modeling the soil salinization induced by brackish irrigation water.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"555d5748a725a71ea62338995e74773b75d1aed0d1489daa6a096302d4cf8652","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
