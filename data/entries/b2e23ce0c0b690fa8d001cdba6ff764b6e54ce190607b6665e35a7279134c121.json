{"title":"Computational Identification of Promising CRYGD Inhibitors for Cataract Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1282/v1","date":1724051705000,"content":"This study employs a comprehensive computational approach to identify and evaluate potential inhibitors of gamma D crystallin (CRYGD), a key protein implicated in cataract formation. A library of compounds, including natural products and FDA-approved drugs, was screened using molecular docking simulations and binding energy calculations. The top-scoring compounds were further assessed for drug-likeness properties and potential toxicity. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on the most promising candidates to investigate their interactions with CRYGD at the atomic level. The study identified CNP0185903, CID 3741, and CNP0151361 as the most promising compounds, with CNP0151361 demonstrating the most favorable combination of binding affinity, structural stabilization, and conformational modulation of CRYGD. These findings provide a foundation for the development of novel pharmacological interventions for cataract treatment, potentially offering alternatives or complements to current surgical approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2e23ce0c0b690fa8d001cdba6ff764b6e54ce190607b6665e35a7279134c121","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
