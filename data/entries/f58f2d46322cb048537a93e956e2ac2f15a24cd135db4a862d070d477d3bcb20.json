{"title":"Papillary Thyroid Cancer Remodels the Genomic Fabrics of DNA Replication, Repair and Transcription","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0364/v1","date":1712217031000,"content":"The genetic causes of the differentiated, highly treatable and mostly non-fatal papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) are not yet fully known. The widely accepted PTC etiology blames altered sequence or/and expression level of certain biomarker genes. However, our previous studies found that the PTC biomarkers played significantly lower roles than the personalized PTC Gene Master Regulators. Our publicly accessible gene expression data from the cancer nodule and the surrounding normal tissue of surgically removed PTC tumor were re-analyzed to determine the transcriptomic effects on the genomic fabrics responsible for the DNA replication, repair and transcription. Tumor results were compared to the gene expression profiles of the papillary (BCPAP) and the anaplastic (8505C) human thyroid cancer cell lines. The analyses were carried out from the Genomic Fabric Paradigm (GFP) perspective that provides the most theoretically possible comprehensive characterization of the transcriptome and its alterations in disease. The study indicated that, in addition to regulating numerous genes, changes in the homeostatic control of transcript abundances and remodeling of the gene networks had major contributions to the PTC occurrence, resilience and proliferation. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms responsible for gene expression control and inter-coordination should also be considered when designing personalized anti-cancer gene therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f58f2d46322cb048537a93e956e2ac2f15a24cd135db4a862d070d477d3bcb20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
