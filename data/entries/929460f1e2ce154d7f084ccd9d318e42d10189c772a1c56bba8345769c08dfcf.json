{"title":"Antifungal Efficacy and Biofilm Inhibition of Candida albicans by Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) in Vietnam: A Comprehensive Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0422/v2","date":1729771354000,"content":"Candida albicans, a significant human pathogen due to its biofilm-forming ability, poses a serious health risk. This study investigates the antifungal activity and biofilm inhibition potential of Tea Tree Oil (TTO) from Melaleuca alternifolia cultivated in Vietnam. Renowned for its bioactive compounds, including terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole, and terpinolene, the essential oil of M. alternifolia, commonly referred to as TTO, is scrutinized for its impact on C. albicans. The study meticulously determines the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of TTO against C. albicans in both planktonic and biofilm states. Additionally, it assesses the biofilm-forming capacity of C. albicans and establishes the Minimum Biofilm Inhibitory Concentration (MBIC) and Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) of TTO. Employing a liquid culture dilution method within a defined concentration range of 0.1 μL/mL to 10 μL/mL, the experimental approach adheres to established protocols. The outcomes reveal a noteworthy MIC and MIC80 of 0.1 μL/mL and 2 μL/mL, respectively, and an MFC of 10 μL/mL for TTO against C. albicans. Furthermore, TTO exhibits an MBIC of 2 μL/mL, showcasing its efficacy in inhibiting biofilm formation. However, the MBEC of TTO remains uncertain, possibly due to insufficient concentration tested, which may not effectively disrupt over 50% of the pre-formed biofilm mass within 24 hours. These findings highlight TTO’s significant potential as both an antifungal agent and a biofilm inhibitor against C. albicans, providing essential insights that could guide the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating fungal infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"929460f1e2ce154d7f084ccd9d318e42d10189c772a1c56bba8345769c08dfcf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
