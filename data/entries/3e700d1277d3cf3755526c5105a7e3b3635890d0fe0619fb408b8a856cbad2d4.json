{"title":"Expression Patterns of Grainyhead-Like 2 and Ovo-Like 2 in Mouse Mammary Gland Development During Pregnancy, Lactation, and Weaning","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/3/552/7687674?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Grainyhead-like 2 (Grhl2) is a transcription factor that regulates cell adhesion genes in mammary ductal development and serves as a repressor of the epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition. Conversely, Ovo-like2 (Ovol2) is a target gene of Grhl2 but functions as a substitute in Grhl2-deficient mice, facilitating successful epithelial barrier formation and lumen expansion in kidney-collecting ductal epithelial cells. Our objective was to examine the expression patterns of Grhl2, Ovol2, and their associated genes during the intricate phases of mouse mammary gland development. The mRNA expression of Grhl2 and Ovol2 increased after pregnancy. We observed Grhl2 protein presence in the epithelial cell's region, coinciding with acini formation, and its signal significantly correlated with E-cadherin (Cdh1) expression. However, Ovol2 was present in the epithelial region without a correlation with Cdh1. Similarly, Zeb1, a mesenchymal transcription factor, showed Cdh1-independent expression. Subsequently, we explored the interaction between Rab25, a small G protein, and Grhl2/Ovol2. The expressions of Grhl2 and Ovol2 exhibited a strong correlation with Rab25 and claudin-4, a tight junction protein. These findings suggest that Grhl2 and Ovol2 may collaborate to regulate genes associated with cell adhesion and are crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity during the different phases of mammary gland development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3e700d1277d3cf3755526c5105a7e3b3635890d0fe0619fb408b8a856cbad2d4","category":"Environment"}
