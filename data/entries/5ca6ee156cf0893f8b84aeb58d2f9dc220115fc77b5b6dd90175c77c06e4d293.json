{"title":"Spatial frequency–based correction of the spherical aberration in living brain imaging","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/1/37/7197924?rss=1","date":1686700800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Optical errors, including spherical aberrations, hinder high-resolution imaging of biological samples due to biochemical components and physical properties. We developed the Deep-C microscope system to achieve aberration-free images, employing a motorized correction collar and contrast-based calculations. However, current contrast-maximization techniques, such as the Brenner gradient method, inadequately assess specific frequency bands. The Peak-C method addresses this issue, but its arbitrary neighbor selection and susceptibility to the noise limit its effectiveness. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of a broad spatial frequency range for accurate spherical aberration correction and propose Peak-F. This spatial frequency–based system utilizes a fast Fourier transform as a bandpass filter. This approach overcomes Peak-C’s limitations and comprehensively covers the low-frequency domain of image spatial frequencies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"5ca6ee156cf0893f8b84aeb58d2f9dc220115fc77b5b6dd90175c77c06e4d293","category":"Environment"}
