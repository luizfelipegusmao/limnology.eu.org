The basis for a healthy life of any organism, including plants, is found at the cellular level, where mechanisms of protein synthesis and degradation act in concert to guarantee protein homeostasis, or proteostasis for short. Many misfolded, short-lived, or nonfunctional proteins are degraded via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS) that plays a major role in the maintenance of proteostasis. Modifications to the amino-terminal (Nt) residue of numerous proteins are known to determine protein stability; N-degrons are specific Nt modifications that tag proteins for degradation (via the UPS or other pathways), created by the cleavage activity of endopeptidases or by modifications introduced by other enzyme classes (e.g. arginylation of the Nt residue by arginyl tRNA transferases). N-degron pathways form an important entry point to the UPS (<a href=\"#koae138-B3\">Holdsworth et al. 2020</a>). Some plant E3 ligases, also known as N-recognins, specifically recognize different N-degrons and catalyze their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation via the UPS. PROTEOLYSIS6 (PRT6) shows high specificity toward basic residues (e.g. Arg), while PRT1 has been shown to preferentially recognize aromatic residues (e.g. Phe).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"95b9871b40828e203cb395d2cd3efff37dc20df6990fdeb59b66d27494dc775b","category":"Environment"}
