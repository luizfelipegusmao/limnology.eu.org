{"title":"Osteoporosis induced by cellular senescence: A mathematical model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303978","date":1716904800000,"content":"<p>by Nourridine Siewe, Avner Friedman</p>\r\n\r\nOsteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass, where bones become fragile and more likely to fracture. Bone density begins to decrease at age 50, and a state of osteoporosis is defined by loss of more than 25%. Cellular senescence is a permanent arrest of normal cell cycle, while maintaining cell viability. The number of senescent cells increase with age. Since osteoporosis is an aging disease, it is natural to consider the question to what extend senescent cells induce bone density loss and osteoporosis. In this paper we use a mathematical model to address this question. We determine the percent of bone loss for men and women during age 50 to 100 years, and the results depend on the rate <i>η</i> of net formation of senescent cell, with <i>η</i> = 1 being the average rate. In the case <i>η</i> = 1, the model simulations are in agreement with empirical data. We also consider senolytic drugs, like fisetin and quercetin, that selectively eliminate senescent cells, and assess their efficacy in terms of reducing bone loss. For example, at <i>η</i> = 1, with estrogen hormonal therapy and early treatment with fisetin, bone density loss for women by age 75 is 23.4% (below osteoporosis), while with no treatment with fisetin it is 25.8% (osteoporosis); without even a treatment with estrogen hormonal therapy, bone loss of 25.3% occurs already at age 65.","author":"Nourridine Siewe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dddaaf3618f7d70eebf2a5846fc91a11ba0ab7aacabb5c1e964324163b61acc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
