{"title":"Atypical postmortem redistribution in chronic methadone consumers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/5/343/7630425?rss=1","date":1708992000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Available literature demonstrates that methadone is prone to moderate postmortem redistribution, but subject to high interindividual variability in the central to peripheral blood concentration ratios (C/P). In this case series, 10 cases of chronic methadone users displaying C/P &lt; 1 (range 0.26–0.82) are described. Femoral, cardiac and ante-mortem blood concentrations of methadone and its metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) are reported for all cases, as well as sex, age, case history, results of the pathological investigation, other toxicological findings and cause and manner of death. EDDP blood concentrations, similar in both central and peripheral blood, as well as antemortem blood concentration results in Case 4, demonstrate that this atypical C/P &lt; 1 finding is attributable to postmortem changes and not analytical or pre-analytical artifacts. Case 4 is a particularly instructive example, with femoral blood concentration (966 ng/mL) approximately twice as high as cardiac blood (499 ng/mL) and ante-mortem blood (418 ng/mL, collected 38 min prior to death)—clearly demonstrating that cardiac blood methadone concentration is more representative of the antemortem blood concentration in this case. In Case 4 and four others, toxicological interpretation based on femoral blood concentration alone would have been misleading. Based on these results and evidence from the literature, it is hypothesized that methadone bioaccumulates in the tissues of chronic users and redistributes from thigh tissues into femoral blood, increasing the concentration postmortem. This case series highlights how femoral blood is not always preserved from postmortem changes and that the analysis of multiple blood sources is necessary to avoid a misleading toxicological interpretation—particularly for cases of chronic methadone users.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"04ad1a5fc87099ef12ca68a87c38483b05c4ba711537654d67a19e0087e214ea","category":"Environment"}
