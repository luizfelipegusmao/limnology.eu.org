{"title":"Clinical Outcomes and Risk Factors of Heart Transplantation Patients Experiencing Gastrointestinal Bleeding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0835/v1","date":1720648988000,"content":"Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after heart transplantation (HT) remains a significant clinical issue. The study aimed to explore its incidence, trends, outcomes and clinical predictors of GIB in HT patients. Adult patients who underwent HT between 2015 and 2021 at Union Hospital were recruited and divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of postoperative GIB. Primary outcomes were evaluated by follow-up. Independent predictors of GIB after HT were identified by logistic regression analysis. A nomogram prediction model was constructed according to these independent variables, and the accuracy of the model was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the calibration curve. Among 461 patients, 40 (8.7%) developed GIB post-HT. HT patients with postoperative GIB exhibited higher in-hospital, 30-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality (all P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified age, preoperative warfarin, postoperative continuous renal replacement therapy and postoperative nasogastric tube as independent risk factors for GIB following HT. The nomogram prediction model was performed using the 4 variables. The area under the curve (AUC) of this model was 0.852(95% CI: 0.787-0.917, P &lt; 0.001) and the calibration curve was close to the ideal diagonal line. GIB following HT is associated with a poor clinical prognosis. The constructed nomogram, incorporating its independent risk factors, demonstrated a favorable predictive value for GIB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1752a851d4373634ca2549193e824c9631dd699fa39bba8ecfaf3499e2325c33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
