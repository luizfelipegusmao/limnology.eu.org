{"title":"Design and Experiment of Extended-range Power Supply System for Electric Tractor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2383/v1","date":1722330241000,"content":"Electric tractors have many advantages, including high torque, excellent controllability, energy efficiency, simple structure, and electric interface for expansion. However, a significant limitation lies in their endurance. This study presents the design of an extended-range power supply system to ensure continuous endurance of electric tractor. The objective is to provide a continuous power source for our self-developed electric tractor while preserving the benefits of electric propulsion. Extended-range power systems utilize a primary mover, typically an oil-fueled internal combustion engine, to drive the generator for electricity generation, and the generated AC form electricity is subsequently converted into stable DC bus voltage by a power electronic converter. The hardware and control design of the extended-range power supply system have been finalized and validated through experimental trials. Results demonstrate the system’s capability to sustain a stable DC bus voltage amidst disruptions such as sudden load shifts and fluctuations in prime mover speed. Even with 50% sudden load change, the voltage drop is within 12% and could recover to ±3% within 4 seconds. The range extender can be used alone without battery to power the electric tractor, or it can used in parallel with other extended-range extenders or battery thanks with the droop control ability for power sharing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78f675c418274d69c5996a852782676823bac02d940c0c13b9b3d02fce386342","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
