{"title":"Fundamental Physics as the General Solution to a Maximization Problem on the Shannon Entropy of All Measurements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1009/v2","date":1714629668000,"content":"We present a novel approach to quantum theory construction that involves maximizing the Shannon entropy of quantum measurements relative to their initial preparation. By constraining the maximization problem with a phase that vanish under measurements, we obtain quantum mechanics (vanishing U(1)-valued phase), relativistic quantum mechanics (vanishing Spin^c(3,1)-valued phase), and quantum gravity (vanishing ${\\rm SL(4,\\mathbb{R})}$-valued phase). The first two cases are equivalent to established theory, whereas the later case yields a quantum theory of accelerated reference frames, in which a quantized version of the Einstein field equation lives. Specifically, the spacetime interval is promoted to an observable, effectively building the metric tensor from the underlying quantum structure. Subsequently, the Schr√∂dinger equation generates metric tensor diffeomorphisms and SO(3,1) transformations. Remarkably, the quantized Einstein Field Equations are provably non-perturbatively finite. Moreover, the SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetries of the Standard Model arise naturally without additional assumptions.  Finally, the solution is consistent only with 3+1 spacetime dimensions, as it encounters obstructions in all other dimensional configurations. This framework integrates quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, spacetime dimensionality, and particle physics gauge symmetries from a simple entropy maximization problem constrained by a vanishing phase, yielding the most parsimonious formulation of fundamental physics to date.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee914bbf2e244ccc334dc971a27cbaadb174449592bcb95b72d974907422d781","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
