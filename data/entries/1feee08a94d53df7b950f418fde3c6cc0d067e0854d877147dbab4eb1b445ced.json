{"title":"Experimental warming of embryos accelerates metabolism of postnatal songbirds, influences growth, but has no effects on parental feeding and brooding rates","link":"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/doi/10.1093/ornithology/ukad058/7463977?rss=1","date":1701993600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Here we investigate possible carryover effects of experimentally increased incubation temperatures for postnatal growth, metabolism, and parental care within and among 6 north temperate and one tropical songbird species. Increased temperatures during embryonic development consistently caused higher postnatal resting metabolism compared to control nests, among but not within the 7 species studied. The effects of the experiment on growth were species specific and depended on the morphometric considered. Size before the fledge date was positively correlated with feeding rate, and metabolism was lower in larger broods. Our experiment did not elicit changes in parental food delivery rates or brooding effort during the postnatal stage, and higher brooding effort was associated with nestlings of smaller mass and faster metabolism independently from treatment. Consequently, parental care seemed unlikely to be the cause of the differences in growth rates between treatments. Instead, physiological mechanisms triggered by our heating treatment appear to be responsible for the observed variation in growth. These intrinsic changes unmatched by adjustments in parental effort may contribute to longer-term consequences for individual quality and survival that deserve further attention.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithology Current Issue","siteHash":"4b42e15d9ceec568e037973cb16bc8a0448c103c6eaf3f714117d3650f8eefe7","entryHash":"1feee08a94d53df7b950f418fde3c6cc0d067e0854d877147dbab4eb1b445ced","category":"Environment"}
