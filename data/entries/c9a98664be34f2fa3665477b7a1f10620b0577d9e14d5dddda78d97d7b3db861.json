{"title":"An update on the biological parameters of the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/3/426/7596726?rss=1","date":1706832000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Norway lobster, <span>Nephrops norvegicus</span>, is one of the most valuable fishery resources in many coastal countries of the Mediterranean Sea and the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. In the Mediterranean Sea, several stocks are being overexploited, with ecological, economic, and social consequences. To perform an adequate stock assessment and provide guidance on maximum sustainable yield, reliable biological parameters of the species are required. Considering that biological parameters may change over time in overexploited populations, in the present study, we updated key biological parameters for the <span>N. norvegicus</span> stock of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea: size at which 50% (L50) of females were in reproductive condition, lengthâ€“weight relationship, and individual size structure. Moreover, daily landings were combined with the spatial position of the vessels tracked by their Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), to obtain information on the geographical distribution and time series of Landings Per Unit Effort (LPUE), as well as total landings from 2008 to 2021. Our results suggest overexploitation of the resource, revealing a severe reduction in size at 50% maturity, an earlier spawning and brooding period, and a clear decrease of LPUE over time.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"c9a98664be34f2fa3665477b7a1f10620b0577d9e14d5dddda78d97d7b3db861","category":"Environment"}
