{"title":"Integrating Depth Measurements From Gaging Stations With Image Archives for Spectrally Based Remote Sensing of River Bathymetry","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR037295?af=R","date":1721477085000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Remote sensing can be an effective tool for mapping river bathymetry, but the need for direct measurements to calibrate image-derived depth estimates impedes broader application of this approach. One way to circumvent the need for field campaigns dedicated to calibration is to capitalize upon existing data. In this study, we introduce a framework for Bathymetric Mapping using Gage Records and Image Databases (BaMGRID). This workflow involves retrieving depth measurements made during gaging station site visits, downloading archived multispectral images, and then combining these two data sets to establish a relationship between depth and reflectance. We developed a processing chain that involves using application programming interfaces to obtain both depth measurements made during site visits and images centered on the gage and then linking depth to reflectance via an optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) algorithm modified for small sample sizes. Applying this workflow to selected gages within two river basins indicated that depth retrieval from multispectral satellite images could be highly accurate, but with variable results from one image to the next at a given site. High resolution aerial photography was less conducive to bathymetric mapping in one of the basin considered. Of the four predictors of depth retrieval performance we evaluated (mean and standard deviation of depth, width, and an index of water clarity), only width was consistently significantly correlated with OBRA <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.026). Currently, BaMGRID is best-suited for site-by-site analysis to support practical applications at the reach scale; continuous, basin-wide mapping of river bathymetry will require additional research.</p>","author":"Carl J.
