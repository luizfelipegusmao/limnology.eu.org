{"title":"A Pi-Theorem-Based Advanced Scaling Methodology for Similarity Assessment of Marine Shafting Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1358/v1","date":1713534977000,"content":"This paper introduces a rigorous and comprehensive approach for the assessment of marine shafting systems through the utilization of an advanced Pi-Theorem based scaling methodology. Integrating journal bearing similarity assessment and shaft-line scaling methodology with advanced dimensional analysis, the study aims to provide a methodology foundation for systematic replication and analysis of marine shafting systems through scaled models. The proposed scaling methodology ensures geometric and mechanical similarity in terms of shaft-line deflection, considering key scaling parameters such as shaft length, diameter, weight, loads, rotational speed, material properties, bearing locations, and offsets. The advanced dimensional analysis computes specific non-dimensional ratios to guarantee a close resemblance between a real-size system and a scaled lab model, enabling meaningful experimentation. The methodology is analytically derived and validated with numerical simulations for a case study, conducting comparative analysis, evaluating discrepancies, and utilizing the integrated framework for experimentation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06a5e64ee997d05a2d7bb2d13f8952e3088830d3d40c28b85721de64665624c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
