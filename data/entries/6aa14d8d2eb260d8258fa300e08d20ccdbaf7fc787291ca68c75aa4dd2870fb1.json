{"title":"Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of bHLH Gene Family in Hevea brasiliensis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2240/v1","date":1727674260000,"content":"The basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors play crucial roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, their identification and insight understanding in rubber trees remain largely uncovered. In this study, the bHLH gene family was explored and characterized in rubber trees using systematic bioinformatics approaches. In total, 180 bHLH genes were identified in the rubber tree genome, distributed unevenly across 18 chromosomes, and phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into 23 distinct subfamilies. Promoter regions revealed a high density of cis-elements responsive to light and hormones. Enrichment analysis indicated involvement in numerous biological processes, including growth, development, hormone responses, abiotic stress resistance, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Protein interaction network analysis identified extensive interactions between HbbHLH genes and other functional genes, forming key clusters related to iron homeostasis, plant growth, and stomatal development. Expression profiling of HbbHLH genes have demonstrated varied responses to endogenous and environmental changes. RT-qPCR of eleven HbbHLH genes in different tissues and under ethylene, jasmonic acid, and cold treatments revealed tissue-specific expression patterns and significant responses to these stimuli, highlighting the roles of these genes in hormone and cold stress responses. These findings establish a framework for exploring the molecular functions of bHLH transcription factors in rubber trees.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6aa14d8d2eb260d8258fa300e08d20ccdbaf7fc787291ca68c75aa4dd2870fb1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
