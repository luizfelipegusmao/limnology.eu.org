{"title":"Use of Light Emitting Diodes on the In Vitro Rooting of Apple Tree Rootstocks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1742/v1","date":1729664649000,"content":"This study presents a novel investigation into the use of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for the in vitro rooting of 'Marubakaido' and 'M9' apple tree rootstocks, marking the first time this approach has been reported in the literature. The research compares four different light sources: blue LED (450 nm), red LED (660 nm), a combination of red and blue LEDs, and traditional fluorescent lamps as a control. Mini-cuttings were inoculated in Murashige &amp;amp; Skoog (MS) medium with reduced nutrient concentrations and supplemented with indoleacetic acid (IAA) and sucrose. The explants were incubated under controlled conditions for 30 days, allowing for a thorough evaluation of the effects of different light sources on various growth metric. The study found that blue LEDs significantly increased dry mass accumulation in 'Marubakaido' seedlings compared to both red LEDs and fluorescent lamps, demonstrating the effectiveness of LEDs in promoting plant growth. Utilizing LEDs not only enhances seedling development but also offers economic benefits over fluorescent lamps. LEDs are known for their high luminous efficiency, low energy consumption, and long lifespan, which can lead to reduced operational costs in plant production systems. This research not only contributes to the understanding of light effects on plant tissue culture but also suggests that the combination of blue and red LEDs can serve as a viable alternative to fluorescent lamps, potentially transforming practices in the field of horticulture and plant propagation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"235c526d598817bbe4e27ee34ef1ccfb3877b6db7252d7f5f9a4bba75f087fe0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
