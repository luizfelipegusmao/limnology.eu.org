{"title":"A sucrose-binding protein and β-conglycinins regulate soybean seed protein content and control multiple seed traits","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1298/7721310?rss=1","date":1721952000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Expanded agriculture production is required to support the world's population but can impose substantial environmental and climate change costs, particularly with intensifying animal production and protein demand. Shifting from an animal- to a plant-based protein diet has numerous health benefits. Soybean (<span>Glycine max</span> [L.] Merr.) is a major source of protein for human food and animal feed; improved soybean protein content and amino acid composition could provide high-quality soymeal for animal feed, healthier human foods, and a reduced carbon footprint. Nonetheless, during the soybean genome evolution, a balance was established between the amount of seed protein, oil, and carbohydrate content, burdening the development of soybean cultivars with high proteins (HPs). We isolated 2 high-seed protein soybean mutants, <span>HP1</span> and <span>HP2</span>, with improved seed amino acid composition and stachyose content, pointing to their involvement in controlling seed rebalancing phenomenon. <span>HP1</span> encodes β-conglycinin (<span>GmCG-1</span>) and <span>HP2</span> encodes sucrose-binding protein (<span>GmSBP-1</span>), which are both highly expressed in soybean seeds. Mutations in <span>GmSBP-1</span>, <span>GmCG-1</span>, and the paralog <span>GmCG-2</span> resulted in increased protein levels, confirming their role as general regulators of seed protein content, amino acid seed composition, and seed vigor. Biodiversity analysis of <span>GmCG</span> and <span>GmSBP</span> across 108 soybean accessions revealed haplotypes correlated with protein and seed carbohydrate content. Furthermore, our data revealed an unprecedented role of GmCG and GmSBP proteins in improving seed vigor, crude protein, and amino acid digestibility. Since <span>GmSBP</span> and <span>GmCG</span> are present in most seed plants analyzed, these genes could be targeted to improve multiple seed traits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"c57ca9faca83e2b7cb6f9fe626a938f73cfe1ec531e49e07bb64460cd7568ac4","category":"Environment"}
