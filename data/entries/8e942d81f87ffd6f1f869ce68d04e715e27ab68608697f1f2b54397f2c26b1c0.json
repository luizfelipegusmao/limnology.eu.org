{"title":"Exploring Stroke Patients&rsquo; Needs: A Cross Cultural Adaptation and Validation of  the Modified Needs Assessment Questionnaire","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0111/v1","date":1714635858000,"content":"Stroke survivors often face diverse unmet needs, highlighting the significance of identifying and addressing these needs to enhance rehabilitation outcomes and overall quality of life. This study aimed to validate the modified Needs Assessment Questionnaire (mNAQ) as a reliable and valid tool for assessing the needs of stroke patients in the Greek context. Additionally, the research sought to identify potential differences in the assessment of stroke patients' needs based on their stroke phase and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. A sample of 71 adult stroke survivors, adhering to World Health Organization guidelines and providing autonomous consent, participated in the study. The mNAQ, comprising 141 items across 12 domains, was uti-lized to evaluate stroke patients' needs. The NIHSS and Barthel Index (BI) were employed for functional independence and mobility assessment. Data analysis incorporated confirmatory fac-tor analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and Cronbach's reliability analysis to establish con-struct validity and internal consistency. Concurrent and known-groups validity analyses were conducted, and Spearmanâ€™s rho correlation explored the relationship between mNAQ and BI scores. Non-parametric analyses were applied to identify differences based on stroke phase and NIHSS scores. The study revealed that the mNAQ initially lacked satisfactory psychometric properties in the Greek context. Subsequent modifications, guided by confirmatory and explora-tory factor analyses, resulted in a refined three-factor scale encompassing 31 items in the domains of communication, mobility, and social functioning needs. This adapted measure effectively dif-ferentiated between acute and chronic stroke patients and those with minor and moderate strokes. In conclusion, the validated 31-item Greek mNAQ emerges as a crucial tool for compre-hensively assessing the needs of stroke patients. Its application holds promise for optimizing post-stroke care, improving functional outcomes, and ultimately enhancing the overall well-being and quality of life for stroke survivors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e942d81f87ffd6f1f869ce68d04e715e27ab68608697f1f2b54397f2c26b1c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
