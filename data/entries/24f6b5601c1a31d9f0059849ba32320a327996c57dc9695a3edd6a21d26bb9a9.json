We obtain to the leading order for large distances: a cosmological constant term and a logarithmic term in addition to the usual General Relativistic terms. The novel logarithmic term has important implications in explaining phenomena such as flat galactic rotation curves and stronger gravitational lensing than predicted that are generally attributed to the presence of dark matter.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24f6b5601c1a31d9f0059849ba32320a327996c57dc9695a3edd6a21d26bb9a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
