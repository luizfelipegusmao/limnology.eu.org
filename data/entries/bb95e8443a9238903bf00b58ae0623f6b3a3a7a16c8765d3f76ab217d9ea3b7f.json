{"title":"Do genetic loci that cause reproductive isolation in the lab inhibit gene flow in nature?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/6/1025/7630243?rss=1","date":1710460800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The genetic dissection of reproductive barriers between diverging lineages provides enticing clues into the origin of species. One strategy uses linkage analysis in experimental crosses to identify genomic locations involved in phenotypes that mediate reproductive isolation. A second framework searches for genomic regions that show reduced rates of exchange across natural hybrid zones. It is often assumed that these approaches will point to the same loci, but this assumption is rarely tested. In this perspective, we discuss the factors that determine whether loci connected to postzygotic reproductive barriers in the laboratory are inferred to reduce gene flow in nature. We synthesize data on the genetics of postzygotic isolation in house mice, one of the most intensively studied systems in speciation genetics. In a rare empirical comparison, we measure the correspondence of loci tied to postzygotic barriers via genetic mapping in the laboratory and loci at which gene flow is inhibited across a natural hybrid zone. We find no evidence that the two sets of loci overlap beyond what is expected by chance. In light of these results, we recommend avenues for empirical and theoretical research to resolve the potential incongruence between the two predominant strategies for understanding the genetics of speciation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"bb95e8443a9238903bf00b58ae0623f6b3a3a7a16c8765d3f76ab217d9ea3b7f","category":"Environment"}
