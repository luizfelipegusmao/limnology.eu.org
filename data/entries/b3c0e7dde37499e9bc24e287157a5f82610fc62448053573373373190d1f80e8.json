{"title":"Title Foliar Fertilization with Organic-Mineral Compounds: A Sustainable Approach to Enhancing Winter Wheat Yields on Low-Fertility Soils","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0798/v1","date":1728608458000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of foliar fertilizers containing mineral nitrogen, organic matter, amino acids, organic acids, and trace elements on winter wheat's grain yield to regulate the crop's mineral nutrition. The research was conducted during the 2022-2023 agricultural years on separate plots, with three repetitions and five variants of foliar fertilizer application: urea, the biostimulant Amino Turbo, the organic-mineral fertilizer Ruter AA, and Geofert, alongside calculated doses of phosphorus-potassium fertilizers. Treatments were applied during the early phases of winter wheat development: the first feeding at the third stage of organogenesis (BBCH 25-29) and the second feeding at the fourth to fifth stages of organogenesis (BBCH 30-31).On average, over three years of research, the most effective results were achieved by applying Ruter AA fertilizer on the leaves, yielding 43.7 kg of grain per hectare. This yield is 3.4 kg/ha higher than that obtained through traditional foliar application of urea. The Geogumat fertilizer, which contains strains of microorganisms, demonstrated similar effectiveness to urea.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3c0e7dde37499e9bc24e287157a5f82610fc62448053573373373190d1f80e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
