{"title":"Weakening Indian Ocean carbon uptake in 2015: The role of amplified basin‐wide warming and reduced Indonesian throughflow","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10397?af=R","date":1713356720000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In 2015, the Indian Ocean exhibits an exceptionally weakened CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, highlighting strong interannual variability of ocean carbon sink. By utilizing multiple ocean CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (<i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>) data and a state-of-the-art ocean biogeochemical model, we show that the 2015 ocean CO<sub>2</sub> anomaly is characterized by a basin-wide amplification of ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>, differing from ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> responses to other Indian Ocean Dipole events (e.g., 1997 and 2019). The distinct ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> anomaly is attributed to an amplified warming and an unprecedented weakening Indonesian Throughflow under the influence of co-occurrence of positive IOD and extreme El Niño in 2015. The amplified warming drives higher ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in the western and central Indian Ocean, while the ITF transports anomalously high ocean <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> water from the Pacific Ocean to the southeastern Indian Ocean. This newly identified ocean carbon response provides deeper insights into the Indian Ocean carbon interannual variability.</p>","author":"Enhui Liao, \nWenfang Lu, \nLiang Xue, \nYan Du","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography Letters: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e3d6bd1d0a248694da65f62e7591c05124a8fbc5456d1cafb66209dfd7ae6238","entryHash":"0ca9ddf4959cd4b27dfb689310fa1c397d000007722b99e39c62155d8097fc9f","category":"Environment"}
