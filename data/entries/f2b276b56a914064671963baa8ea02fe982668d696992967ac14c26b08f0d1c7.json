{"title":"Quantifying Genetic Parameters for Blackleg Resistance in Rapeseed: A Comparative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2257/v1","date":1725268561000,"content":"Selection is a fundamental part of the plant breeding process, enabling the identification and development of varieties with desirable traits. Thanks to advances in genetics and biotechnology, the selection process has become more precise and efficient, resulting in faster breeding progress and better adaptation of crops to environmental challenges. Genetic parameters related to gene additivity and epistasis play a key role and can influence decisions on the suitability of breeding material. In this study, 188 rapeseed doubled haploid lines were assessed in field conditions for resistance to Leptosphaeria spp. Through next-generation sequencing, a total of 133,764 molecular markers (96,121 SilicoDArT and 37,643 SNP) were obtained. The similarity of the DH lines at the phenotypic and genetic levels was calculated. The results indicate that the similarity at the phenotypic level was markedly different than the similarity at the genetic level. Genetic parameters related to additive gene action effects and epistasis (double and triple) were calculated using two methods: based on phenotypic observations only and using molecular marker observations. All evaluated genetic parameters (additive, additive-additive and additive-additive-additive) were statistically significant for both estimation methods. The parameters associated with the interaction (double and triple) had opposite signs depending on the estimation method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2b276b56a914064671963baa8ea02fe982668d696992967ac14c26b08f0d1c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
