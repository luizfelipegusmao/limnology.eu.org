{"title":"Less water, more seeds? The E3 ligase TaGW2 regulates drought resistance in wheat","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/495/7471971?rss=1","date":1702857600000,"content":"<span>Water deficit is a limiting factor for agriculture and can severely affect crop yield (<a href=\"#koad311-B1\">Eckardt et al. 2023</a>). Physiological responses to drought commonly include the increase of water uptake, control of water loss, and osmotic adjustment within tissues. These processes are tightly controlled at the gene expression level and commonly involve abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, and other hormone signaling pathways (<a href=\"#koad311-B2\">Gupta et al. 2020</a>). Current crop breeding programs are focused on enhancing plant resistance to harsh environments while maintaining or increasing yield. In the effort to increase drought resistance or yield in wheat, some genes have been identified. For instance, <span>TaGW2</span>, which controls grain size in wheat (<a href=\"#koad311-B6\">Zhang et al. 2018</a>), increases plant survival after drought stress when overexpressed (<a href=\"#koad311-B5\">Li et al. 2015</a>); however, it also causes a reduction in yield. Thus, finding a good balance between drought resistance and yield is critical for breeding programs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"bc14a8768ead5ff8852d779310d4da4e7bb218b48edff7172e2588d2a9c5fc94","category":"Environment"}
