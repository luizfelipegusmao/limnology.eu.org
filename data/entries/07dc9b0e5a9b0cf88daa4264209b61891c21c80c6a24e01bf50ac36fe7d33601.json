{"title":"The Impact of Fatigue of Foot Stabilizing Muscles on Foot Pronation and a Comparison of Static and Dynamic Navicular Drop Assessment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0482/v1","date":1720437232000,"content":"Individuals may exhibit altered foot mechanics, in this case foot pronation, only when fatigue sets in. Therefore, a more evidence-based understanding of these fatigue-induced changes may be helpful for future gait analysis and return to play tests, since fatigue could provide new insights that might explain a person’s complaints. Methods: 25 healthy test persons (24.3±2.7 years, BMI: 22.7±2.8) participated in this controlled non-randomized study of unilateral fatigue of the right foot stabilizing muscles with regard to the pronation of the foot, measured by navicular drop (ND) in a static (statND) und dynamic (dynND) state. The left foot served as a control. Surface electromyography was used to verify fatigue. Results: While statND didn’t change, the dynND increased significantly by 1.44±2.1 mm (= 22.3 %) after fatigue of the foot stabilizing muscles. No correlation was found between statND and dynND. Conclusion: Muscular fatigue can affect foot pronation. The dynND appears to be more representative of the loads in everyday life, whereby most studies work with the statND.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07dc9b0e5a9b0cf88daa4264209b61891c21c80c6a24e01bf50ac36fe7d33601","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
