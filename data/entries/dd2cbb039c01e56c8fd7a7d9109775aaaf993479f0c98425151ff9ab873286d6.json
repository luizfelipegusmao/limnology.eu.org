{"title":"Sub-Sharvin Conductance and Incoherent Shot-Noise in Graphene Disks at Magnetic Field","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1507/v1","date":1713858235000,"content":"Highly-doped graphene samples show the conductance reduced and the shot-noise\npower enhanced compared to standard ballistic systems in two-dimensional\nelectron gas. These features can be understood within a model assuming\nincoherent scattering of Dirac electrons between two interfaces separating the\nsample and the leads. Here we find, by adopting the above-mentioned model for\nthe edge-free (Corbino) geometry and by means of the computer simulation of\nquantum transport, that another graphene-specific feature should be observable\nwhen the current flow through a doped disk is blocked by high magnetic field.\nIn case the conductance drops to zero, the Fano factor approaches the value of\n$F\\approx{}0.56$, with a very weak dependence on the disk radii ratio. The role\nof finite source-drain voltages and the system behavior upon tuning the\nelectrostatic potential barrier from a rectangular to parabolic shape are also\ndiscussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd2cbb039c01e56c8fd7a7d9109775aaaf993479f0c98425151ff9ab873286d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
