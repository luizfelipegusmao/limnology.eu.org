{"title":"PSIV-6 Blood biomarkers of oxidative stress in offspring from dams infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus during late-term gestation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/550/7757795?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this experiment was to examine the impact of dams infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) during late gestation on inflammatory blood biomarkers in their offspring. Fetal infection with BVDV before d 125 to 150 of gestation results in the birth of immunotolerant, persistently infected (PI) calves. Infection of BVDV during late gestation results in transient fetal infections (TI). It was hypothesized that offspring of dams transiently infected with BVDV on d 175 of gestation would have greater inflammatory blood biomarkers than control offspring. Unvaccinated, yearling Hereford heifers (n = 24), seronegative for antibodies to BVDV1 and BVDV2 were bred by artificial insemination with X chromosome-bearing sperm from an Angus sire. On d 175 of pregnancy, heifers were intranasally inoculated with either Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium + 2% horse serum (sham control) or 4.0 log TCID50 noncytopathic type 2 BVDV to generate control and transient infected calves, respectively. All BVDV-inoculated dams seroconverted by d 14 post-inoculation and all sham-inoculated control dams remained seronegative. Twelve, seronegative control heifer calves were born to the control dams, and 11 seropositive (to type 2 BVDV) TI heifer calves were born to BVDV-inoculated dams. All offspring were raised on pasture until weaning. At weaning, all calves were transported to our feedlot research facility, housed in one group feedlot pen, and transitioned to a high-energy concentrate-based diet until reaching an approximate body weight (BW) of 600 kg. Upon arrival, all animals received a standard heifer growth implant containing 200 mg of testosterone propionate and 20 mg of estradiol benzoate, a modified live viral vaccine containing IBR-BRSV-PI3, and were dewormed. Jugular blood samples were obtained every 28 d until harvest (280 d on feed) and analyzed for biomarkers of inflammation. Data were analyzed as a randomized block design with the MIXED procedures of SAS. There was a treatment x time interaction (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) for plasma ceruloplasmin and the oxidized form of glutathione. On d 0 and 28 of the feeding period, all biomarkers were similar across treatments. By d 56 of the feeding period, ceruloplasmin (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) and the oxidized form of glutathione (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), indicators of chronic inflammation, were increased in plasma samples from TI heifers compared with controls. These parameters remained greater in TI heifers compared with controls throughout the feeding period. There were no treatment or treatment x time interactions for plasma interferon (INF)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and haptoglobin. These data suggest that TI heifers may be experiencing a greater level of oxidative stress later in the finishing period.
