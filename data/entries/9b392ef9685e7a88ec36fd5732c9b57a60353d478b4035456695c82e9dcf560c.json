{"title":"Mental Skills Training for Youth Experiencing Multiple Disadvantage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2554/v1","date":1722584251000,"content":"(1) Background: Youths with multiple risks and severe disadvantages experience poorer health and educational outcomes than less disadvantaged peers. To address problems with coping and self-regulation in this group, mental skills training (MST) approaches more commonly used in sport are an emerging intervention approach. (2) Methods and Results: This narrative review synthesizes literature to explain the need for MST, how it works, and evidence to support it works by focusing on two well evaluated programmes: LifeMatters and My Strengths Training for Lifeâ„¢. (3) Conclusions: To support positive youth development, MST is a strengths-based, flexible and adaptable approach to help fill the shortage of available evidence-based programs for those youths facing multiple disadvantages. The findings of this review may facilitate policy makers, commissioners, program planners, and researchers in the uptake of MST or similar psychoeducational approaches in future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b392ef9685e7a88ec36fd5732c9b57a60353d478b4035456695c82e9dcf560c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
