{"title":"Vertical Jump Height Estimation using Low-Sampling IMU in Countermovement Jumps: A Feasible Alternative to Motion Capture and Force Platforms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1153/v1","date":1728978363000,"content":"Vertical jump height is a reliable measure of lower limb functionality for countermovement jumps. Motion capture systems and force platforms are considered gold standards to assess athletes’ performance during these motions, however their use in ecological settings is limited by high costs and lack of portability. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of low-sampling rate Inertial Measurement Units as an alternative to gold standard systems. The validity of three computational methods for IMU-based data—Numerical Double Integration, Take-Off Velocity and Flight Time—was assessed using data from 18 healthy subjects who performed five bilateral and ten unilateral countermovement jumps. Data were simultaneously collected from an IMU positioned at the L5 level, a motion capture system, and two force platforms. Comparisons revealed that the Numerical Double Integration method exhibited the highest correlation (0.87), the lowest bias (2.5 cm) compared to gold standards, and excellent reliability (0.88). Although the Take-Off Velocity and Flight Time methods demonstrated comparable performance for bilateral jumps, their accuracy in unilateral jumps was reduced. Overall, low-sampling rate IMU with Numerical Double Integration method proves to be a reliable and portable alternative for field-based CMJs assessment, warranting future investigation across diverse populations and jump modalities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90eb2c08cd7eff4348da5feb07015ddb872bc86f296cd3c3efdf4e451d6c426a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
