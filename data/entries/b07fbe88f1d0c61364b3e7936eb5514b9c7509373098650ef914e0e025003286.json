The aim of this study was to compare microbiome composition and diversity in primary and post-treatment endodontic infections from a cohort of patients from the UAE.</p> Design <p>Intracanal samples were collected from primarily infected (n = 10) and post-treatment infected (n = 10) root canals of human teeth using sterile paper points. Bacterial DNA was amplified from seven hypervariable regions (V2–V4 and V6–V9) of the 16S rRNA gene, then sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. The data was analyzed using appropriate bioinformatic tools.</p> Results <p>Analyses of all the samples revealed eight major bacterial phyla, 112 genera and 260 species. <i>Firmicutes</i> was the most representative phylum in both groups and was significantly more abundant in the post-treatment (54.4%) than in primary (32.2%) infections (p&gt;0.05). A total of 260 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, of which 126 (48.5%) were shared between the groups, while 83 (31.9%) and 51 (19.6%) disparate species were isolated from primary and post-treatment infections, respectively. A significant difference in beta, but not alpha diversity was noted using several different indices (p&lt; 0.05). Differential abundance analysis indicated that, <i>Prevotella maculosa</i>, <i>Streptococcus constellatus</i>, <i>Novosphigobium sediminicola</i> and <i>Anaerococcus octavius</i> were more abundant in primary infections while <i>Enterrococcus faecalis</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium dentium</i>, <i>Olsenella profusa</i> and <i>Actinomyces dentalis</i> were more abundant in post-treatment infections (p &lt;0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>Significant differences in the microbiome composition and diversity in primary and post-treatment endodontic infections were noted in our UAE cohort. Such compositional differences of microbiota at various stages of infection could be due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors impacting the root canal ecosystem during disease progression, as well as during their therapeutic management. Identification of the key microbiota in primarily and secondarily infected root canals can guide in the management of these infections.</p>","author":"Sheela B.
