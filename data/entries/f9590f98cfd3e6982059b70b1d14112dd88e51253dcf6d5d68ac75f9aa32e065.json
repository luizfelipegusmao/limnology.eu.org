{"title":"CO2-Breathing Prior to Simulated Diving Increases Decompression Sickness Risk in a Mouse Model: The Microbiota Trail Is Not Forgotten","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1553/v1","date":1718980805000,"content":"Decompression sickness (DCS) with neurological disorders is the leading cause of diving accidents. Exposure to high levels of CO2 during diving is a safety concern for occupational , groups at risk of DCS. However, the effects of prior exposure to CO2 have never been evaluated.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of CO2 breathing prior to a provocative dive on the occurrence of DCS in mice. 50 mice were exposed to a maximum CO2 concentration of 70 hPa for one hour at atmospheric pressure. Another 50 mice breathing air under similar conditions served as controls. In the AIR group (controls), 22 out of 50 mice showed post-dive symptoms compared to 44 out of 50 in the CO2 group.\nWe found that CO2 breathing is associated with a decrease in body temperature in mice and that CO2 exposure dramatically increases the incidence of DCS. More unexpectedly, it appears that a lower temperature of the animals even before exposure to the accident-prone protocol leads to an unfavorable prognosis. This study also suggests that the composition of the microbiota may influence thermogenesis and thus accidentology. Depending on prior exposure, some bacteria identified in this work could be perceived as protective or pathogenic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9590f98cfd3e6982059b70b1d14112dd88e51253dcf6d5d68ac75f9aa32e065","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
