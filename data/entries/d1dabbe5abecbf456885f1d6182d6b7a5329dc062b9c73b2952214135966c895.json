VOs generated from human pluripotent stem cells exhibit remarkable self-organization capabilities, forming complex three-dimensional structures that closely mimic human blood vessel architecture and function, while VoCs engineered with groundbreaking microfluidic systems that meticulously recreate the physical and functional attributes of blood vessels. These innovative constructs serve as powerful tools for investigating vascular development, disease progression, and therapeutic efficacy. By enabling the creation of patient-specific VOs and VoCs, they pave the way for personalized medicine approaches, allowing researchers to delve into genetic variations, intricate cellular interactions, and dynamic processes with exceptional resolution. The synergy between VOs and VoCs with cutting-edge technologies such as single-cell sequencing and high-resolution imaging has further amplified their potential, unveiling novel mechanisms underlying CVDs and identifying promising therapeutic targets. Herein, we summarize different types of VOs and VoCs and present an extensive overview on the generation and applications of VOs and VoCs in CVDs. We will also highlight clinical and translational challenges and future perspectives around VOs and VoCs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1dabbe5abecbf456885f1d6182d6b7a5329dc062b9c73b2952214135966c895","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
