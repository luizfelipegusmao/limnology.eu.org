Mulogo</p>\r\n\r\nTraditional medicinal knowledge and healing practices of indigenous spiritual healers play important roles in health care, and contribute towards achieving Universal Health Care. Traditional spiritual healers (TSHs) are grouped into three categories. One category of Baganda TSHs, <i>Balubaale</i>, engage ancestral spirits during health management. <i>Balubaale</i> are socially significant but not legally accepted. Their initiation and training practices have not been documented in Uganda. The study purpose was to understand and establish the training of traditional spiritual healers. Twelve (10M, 2F); practicing TSHs in Central Uganda were purposively selected and recruited between 15<sup>th</sup> July 2019 and 29<sup>th</sup> April 2020, and were prospectively interacted with for 24 months. Transcribed data was coded and thematically analyzed using ATLAS ti. 22 computer software and presented based on an inductive approach. Findings show key areas of TSHs training include connecting with ancestral spirits and the spiritual powers of non-materials and materials such as living and non-living things through rituals. Spiritual healers train in diagnosis and health management based on ancestral spirits and they finally pass out in a communal ceremony witnessed by family and community members. We conclude that TSHs undergo training and are supervised and supported by experienced spiritualists, family and the community. We recommend similar studies among other ethnic groups to contextualize the process of becoming a TSH, compare and harmonize findings to facilitate inter-medical systems communication and policy considerations.","author":"Yahaya H.
