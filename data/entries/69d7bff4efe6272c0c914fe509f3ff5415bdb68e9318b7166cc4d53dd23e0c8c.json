{"title":"Effect of Citrus Fruit Constructions on Gas Diffusion Resistance and Internal Gas Concentration of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide for Various Cultivars of Citrus Fruits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0996/v1","date":1726131442000,"content":"Various cultivars of citrus fruits have unique construction, such as thick outer skin. These constructions generate gas diffusion resistance between atmosphere and fruit, which can limit a gas exchange of O2 and CO2. However, it has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study on 7 cultivars of citrus fruit, it was aimed firstly to investigate a gas diffusion resistance utilizing ethane efflux method and secondly to investigate internal gas concentration of O2 and CO2. As a result, a cultivar of citrus fruit with slimer outer skin thickness had lower resistance. For the internal gas, a high CO2 concentration in comparison with the atmosphere was observed even in the fruits with the minimum resistance, which no considerable difference among all cultivars was observed in regardless of gas diffusion resistance value. However, when the fruits stored at 25 Â°C for 2 weeks, it was tended to increase CO2 gas concentration and decrease O2 gas concentration with increase in the resistance value. Therefore, when respiration of citrus fruits is activated at ambient temperature, self-control system of internal gas concentration can be driven to suppress their respiration, which was induced by gas diffusion resistance generated from their construction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69d7bff4efe6272c0c914fe509f3ff5415bdb68e9318b7166cc4d53dd23e0c8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
