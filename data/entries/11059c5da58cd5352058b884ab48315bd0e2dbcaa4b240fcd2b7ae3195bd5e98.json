Any new data on the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of circulating metastatic cells will help to develop the concept of antimetastatic therapy. In this study we found a number of differences in spectroscopic and morphological features of circulating metastatic cells. FTIR and Raman spectra of cultivated by adhesive and de-adhesive methods (last as a model for metastatic cells) have showed spectroscopic features, namely in FTIR in the region of CH - stretching vibrations associated with structural rearrangements in the cell membrane, as well as changes in the intensity and position of the PO2- group vibrations bands correlated with a proliferative activity. The spectral features in the regions of OH stretching and Amid I vibrations and other spectral markers of the metastatic cells under different cultivation conditions were derived. Raman spectra showed redistribution of amino acid Tyr/Trp ratio and  in Tyr duplet intensity in the region  of 500-900 cm-1 , as well different glycogen level in different cells. The spectroscopic markers are in the accordance with biochemical data. CARS and confocal optical microscopy were applied for determination a state of the cells and F-actin expression level that turned out to be higher for adhesive cells in comparison with de-adhesive cells. Shape and morphological property of the cells drastically differs. The correlation of vibrational markers with biochemical data and cytofluorometric method were discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11059c5da58cd5352058b884ab48315bd0e2dbcaa4b240fcd2b7ae3195bd5e98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
