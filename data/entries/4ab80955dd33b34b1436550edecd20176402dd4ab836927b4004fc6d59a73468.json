The suggested method processes partitioning of the time interval and utilizes the epsilon-entropy and epsilon-capacity of the partition for finding an optimal partition. Optimality of the partition is specified based on its epsilon-information. The suggested method is illustrated by defining the intervals for histograms of differently distributed samples and demonstrated its effectiveness in comparison with the existing methods","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ab80955dd33b34b1436550edecd20176402dd4ab836927b4004fc6d59a73468","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
