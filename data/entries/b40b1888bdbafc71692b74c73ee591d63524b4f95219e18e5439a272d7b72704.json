In the current study, we identified CAP1 SUPPRESSOR 1 (CAPS1) as a genetic suppressor of the <span>cap1-1</span> mutation. The <span>CAPS1</span> mutation largely rescued the short root hair phenotype of <span>cap1-1</span>. Loss of CAPS1 function resulted in significantly longer root hairs in <span>cap1-1</span>. MutMap analysis revealed that <span>CAPS1</span> is identical to <span>NIMA</span> (<span>NEVER IN MITOSIS A</span>)<span>-RELATED KINASE 2</span> (<span>NEK2</span>). In addition, our studies showed that <span>NEK2</span> is expressed in root and root hairs. Its distribution was associated with the pattern of microtubule (MT) arrangement and partially colocalized with CAP1. Further biochemical studies revealed that CAP1 physically interacts with NEK2 and may enhance its phosphorylation. Our study suggests that NEK2 acts as a potential phosphorylation target of CAP1 in maintaining the stability of root hair MTs to regulate root hair elongation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"b40b1888bdbafc71692b74c73ee591d63524b4f95219e18e5439a272d7b72704","category":"Environment"}
