For optimal performance in this and other contexts, maximized stimuli-responsiveness is frequently desirable. We demonstrate on the example of soft magnetoelastic systems how analytical theoretical measures in combination with computer simulations provide tools to develop optimized components. To enhance the overall macroscopic response, we adjust microstructural properties. Our strategy guides us towards ideally structured soft materials that can be fabricated using modern technologies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"85cdab361714bf7a668c9bd1387ae941eecca1fa92f0b87121650413f6fb2f96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
