{"title":"The Effect of Cardiac Rehabilitation in Paediatric Fontan Circulation Patients: A Prospective Intervention Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1388/v1","date":1724143975000,"content":"Introduction: The Fontan procedure, a palliative surgery for univentricular heart physiology, of-ten reduces exercise capacity and quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on improving outcomes in Fontan patients to inform evidence-based care. Methods: Fontan patients aged 8-30 participated in a structured CR program for at least three months. The program included weekly aerobic and resistance training sessions, with educational and nutritional guidance. Baseline and post-CR assessments included cardiac function, fitness, daily activity, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Results: The cohort included ten Fontan patients, of whom six had a right systemic ventricle. CR significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness, as seen in VO2 max (from 27.92 ± 5.15 to 34.69 ± 1.14 mL/kg/min, p = 0.0089) and per cent predicted VO2 (from 0.67 ± 0.18 to 0.90 ± 0.02, p = 0.005). VCO2 increased by +8.68 ± 8.59 mL/kg/min, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.05). Most haemodynamic and ventila-tory parameters showed no significant improvement. All the SF-36 questionnaire domains showed significant HRQOL gains (p &lt; 0.001). High adherence (85-93%), no adverse events, and reduced NT-proBNP levels supported the program's safety. Conclusion: This study's findings have im-portant implications for the care of Fontan patients. CR significantly improved exercise capacity and HRQOL in Fontan patients across various anatomies, particularly in the right systemic ven-tricle. Integrating physical conditioning into standard care could reduce long-term morbidity and mortality; however, further research is needed to refine the protocols and confirm sustained ben-efits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e77e79bb2f3a42540a1c1daa112b566262e9f5d7e4440e1c01f4517f31d87272","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
