{"title":"Characterization of Aerosols Elementary Composition Emitted by Fires in the North of the Pantanal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0504/v2","date":1720525031000,"content":"The Brazilian Pantanal region suffers intensely from biomass burning during the dry season. Large quantities of gases and particles are emitted into the atmosphere during this period, with serious implications for fauna and flora. Understanding the dynamics of these emissions is es-sential for mitigating the ecosystem, its functioning, and possible anthropogenic disturbances. In this sense, this study analyzed emissions over the north of the Brazilian Pantanal during the 2022 drought. Measurements of concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), Black carbon (BC), and elemental concentration (25 chemical elements) were determined by gravimetry, reflectance analysis, and X-ray fluorescence, respectively, for samples collected between August and Octo-ber 2022. The average concentrations of PM2.5 and BC had their values increased by approxi-mately 4 and 2.5 times, respectively, when compared to the averages from a decade ago. The maximum concentrations found are close to values typical of the southern Amazon region, a re-gion with high rates of deforestation and changes in land use. The elemental analysis showed large changes in concentrations, mainly associated with biomass burning emission (BB) and soil resuspension. Furthermore, analyses of lead (Pb) concentrations showed strong anthropization at the study site.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60ff51740695e1e6d0e297fe1a08c837c4b6c4b5174e6de440090d6d635a4f9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
