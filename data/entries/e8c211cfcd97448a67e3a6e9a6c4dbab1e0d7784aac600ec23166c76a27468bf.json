{"title":"Quantifying Aspect‐Dependent Snowpack Response to High‐Elevation Wildfire in the Southern Rocky Mountains","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036539?af=R","date":1726631974000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Increasing wildfire frequency and severity in high-elevation seasonal snow zones presents a considerable water resource management challenge across the western United States (U.S.). Wildfires can affect snowpack accumulation and melt patterns, altering the quantity and timing of runoff. While prior research has shown that wildfire generally increases snow melt rates and advances snow disappearance dates, uncertainties remain regarding variations across complex terrain and the energy balance between burned and unburned areas. Utilizing paired in situ data sources within the 2020 Cameron Peak burn area on the Front Range of Colorado, U.S., during the 2021–2022 winter, we found no significant difference in peak snow water equivalent (SWE) magnitude between burned and unburned areas. However, the burned south aspect reached peak SWE 22 days earlier than burned north. During the ablation period, burned south melt rates were 71% faster than unburned south melt rates, whereas burned north melt rates were 94% faster than unburned north aspects. Snow disappeared 7–11 days earlier in burned areas than unburned areas. Net energy differences at the burned and unburned weather station sites were seasonally variable, the burned area snowpack lost more net energy during the winter, but gained more net energy during the spring. Increased incoming shortwave radiation at the burned site was 6<i>x</i> more impactful in altering the net shortwave radiation balance than the decline in surface albedo. These findings emphasize the need for post-wildfire water resource planning that accounts for aspect-dependent differences in energy and mass balance to accurately predict snowpack storage and runoff timing.</p>","author":"Wyatt Reis, \nDaniel McGrath, \nKelly Elder, \nStephanie Kampf, \nDavid Rey","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"e8c211cfcd97448a67e3a6e9a6c4dbab1e0d7784aac600ec23166c76a27468bf","category":"Environment"}
