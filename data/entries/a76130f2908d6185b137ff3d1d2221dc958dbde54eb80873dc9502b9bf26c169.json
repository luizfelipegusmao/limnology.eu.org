{"title":"Conceptualizing Ethical AI-Enabled Marketing: Current State and Agenda for Future Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0786/v1","date":1712820917000,"content":"This paper addresses the conceptual exploration of various issues that form an integral part of the ethical dimensions surrounding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of marketing. We critically review some of the main ethical challenges AI poses to humanity: privacy, data security, bias, transparency, and accountability. Therefore, we will discuss the delicate balance between exploiting the transformation potential of AI for personally designed marketing strategies and ethical imperatives to safeguard the rights of consumers to retain trust. Then, the present regulatory landscape responding to these ethical challenges will be assessed by building on effective regulation, like the GDPR, existing proposed legislative frameworks, and industry guidelines. To underscore the role of an ongoing dialogue between marketers, technologists, ethicists, and regulators for developing a responsible AI ecosystem in marketing. Further, strategic recommendations for implementing company-based ethical AI marketing practices. The further strong guidelines provide enhancement transparency to consumers and investment in research to remove biases from algorithms. It also underscores principal scopes of further research and development, focusing on the need for new-age solutions to guide the ethical quagmires that AI-led marketing throws up. We suggest that integration should be done proactively and collaboratively. Thus, if attention is paid more to ethics and multidisciplinary dialogue, only such hyperbolic promises can be realized by AI-driven marketing. There are such promises through which AI-driven marketing will meet business goals and be huge at societies' values.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a76130f2908d6185b137ff3d1d2221dc958dbde54eb80873dc9502b9bf26c169","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
