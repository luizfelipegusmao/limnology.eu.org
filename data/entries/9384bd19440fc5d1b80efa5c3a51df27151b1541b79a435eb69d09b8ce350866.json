{"title":"Healthcare Students’ Knowledge of and Attitude Toward Suicide: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2006/v1","date":1719543690000,"content":"Future healthcare professionals can play a significant role in managing those with    \nthoughts of suicide. This scoping review aims to determine healthcare students’ knowledge and attitude towards suicide. A systematic search was conducted across five databases: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and DARE. Only primary studies written in English, from database inception until 31st December 2023 were included. A total of 44 studies were included. Overall, healthcare students demonstrated low to moderate confidence in managing patients with thoughts of suicide and low levels of relevant education despite acknowledging their importance in preventing suicide. Increased personal exposure to suicide was associated with increased suicide literacy, confidence in managing patients with thoughts of suicide, and reduced stigma. Demographics and culture were shown to affect knowledge and attitude as well. Further research is needed to better understand various contributing factors to healthcare students’ knowledge and attitude regarding suicide. Evaluating healthcare curricula should be considered to implement effective suicide training program.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9384bd19440fc5d1b80efa5c3a51df27151b1541b79a435eb69d09b8ce350866","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
