{"title":"Mortality for Laryngeal Cancer before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0314/v1","date":1714990628000,"content":"(1) Background: The interplay between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and laryngeal cancer represents a substantial challenge for both patients and healthcare. To garner information on recent mortality data for laryngeal cancer, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed real-world data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (2) Methods: We searched the CDC WONDER on-line database 2018-2022 using with the ICD-10 code for laryngeal cancer (C32; malignant neoplasm of larynx). We also performed a sub-analysis between genders, and across ten-year age groups. Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post-hoc test. (3) Results: The trend of age-adjusted mortality Ã—100,000 did not change significantly between 2018-2022 (p=0.553). Males had higher age-adjusted mortality rates (M/F ratios between 4.6 and 5.0), but no significant variation was found in both genders (males: p=0.676; females: p=0.596). Although the mortality rate remained unchanged in people aged 35-84 years, the variation reached statistical significance in those aged 85 or older (p=0.004), displaying significant increase in 2021 compared to 2018 (p=0.006) and 2019 (p=0.039). (4) Conclusions: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality for laryngeal cancer seemed to be relatively modest in the general US population. Nevertheless, closer attention must be paid to older people, in whom the unfavorable consequences of misdiagnosis or mistreating can be exacerbated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"377defb933d1ba1d063b6eebf7d7a8a7fc053819f819e98da5c020f4b4f97c8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
