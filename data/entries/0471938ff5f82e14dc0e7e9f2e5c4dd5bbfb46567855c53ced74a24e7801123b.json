{"title":"The Relationship of Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease and Neuropsychological Test Performance in Older Adults with Unimpaired Cognition: The Impact of Ethnicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0223/v1","date":1712063749000,"content":"There has been significant increase of studies investigating plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s and their relationship to cognitive functioning. The impact of ethnicity on this relationship has not been extensively studied. The current research investigated the relationship between the plasma biomarkers of total tau, Aβ40, Aβ42 and NfL and neuropsychological test performance in a bi-ethnic sample of cognitively unimpaired, older community dwelling adults. The 1326 cognitively unimpaired participants drawn from The Health &amp; Aging Brain Study – Health Disparities (HABS-HD) study included 765 Mexican American participants and 860 non-Hispanic White participants with complete plasma biomarkers and neuropsychological testing. Plasma samples were assayed using Simoa technology. Significant differences in concentrations were found for all of the plasma biomarkers. NHWs had significantly higher levels of each of the biomarkers with a lower Aβ42/ Aβ40. With none of the biomarkers related to performance on any of the neuropsychological tests. For MAs, Aβ40 was the only biomarker that was significantly related to neuropsychological test performance. Aβ40 levels were negatively related to performance on Trails A, Trails B and Digit Symbol Substitution.  Results suggest that the relationship of these biomarkers to cognitive functioning is impacted by ethnicity and may be domain specific.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0471938ff5f82e14dc0e7e9f2e5c4dd5bbfb46567855c53ced74a24e7801123b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
