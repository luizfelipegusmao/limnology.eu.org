{"title":"Telomere Length and Telomerase in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: An Update and a Reappraisal of the Evidence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1584/v1","date":1724322104000,"content":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental disorder caused by exposure to traumatic stress, affects 5-10% of the worldâ€™s population. PTSD is associated with several medical and neurological comorbidities. It has been suggested that these are due to accelerated aging, and that changes in telomere length (TL) and telomerase enzyme activity may serve as biomarkers of this process. Early research in this field suggested that TL was significantly reduced in PTSD. The current review was conducted to provide a critical analysis of recent clinical and translational research on telomere length and telomerase in PTSD. The results of 26 clinical studies suggest that TL in PTSD is highly variable, and may be influenced by methodological, demographic, trauma-related and psychosocial factors. There is no evidence for altered telomerase activity in PTSD, though this was hypothesized by earlier workers in the field. Translational research suggests that exposure to traumatic stress does lead to TL shortening. Overall, it is likely that TL in PTSD depends on several variables that are specific to individuals and groups. Other markers of cellular aging, such as epigenetic changes, may be more specific indices of accelerated aging in patients with PTSD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbdbbd3542bada7cb31825cf76c74fb5c3ba018973b4d9cccd802be613bb077f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
