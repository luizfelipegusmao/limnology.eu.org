{"title":"Friendship Through a Narcissistic Lens: The Role of Narcissism in Perceived Humor Similarity Among Friends in Germany and the US","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1902/v1","date":1727168828000,"content":"Objective: Although much of the research literature has found that individuals tend to perceive their friends as similar to themselves, we hypothesized that individuals with strong narcissistic traits may be less likely to do so because of their tendency to view themselves as unique. Method: We used self-reports and friend-reports in two studies with 129 participants from Germany and 131 participants from the US to examine the moderating effects of narcissistic personality features on the tendency to perceive one’s friends as having similar humor styles. Results: The results revealed that individuals generally tend to view themselves as similar to their friends in terms of humor styles. As expected, we found a moderating effect of narcissism such that higher levels of narcissism were associated with lower levels of perceived similarity. Interestingly, individuals high in grandiose narcissism tended to devalue their close friends’ humor, and individuals high in vulnerable narcissism tended to enhance their friends’ humor compared with themselves. Conclusion: The results suggest that narcissistic individuals may tend to view their friends through a particular lens, regardless of their friends’ actual traits. This mechanism may be related to the narcissistic need to feel unique.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1bbdee643546eccef13cb8044cefd56575d0698400e83f917979e64d8a01f6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
