By analyzing gene expression differences between cancerous and normal endometrial tissues, 42 aging-related genes were identified as differentially expressed. Utilizing the TCGA-UCEC sample, consensus clustering divided the samples into two molecular subgroups, Aging low and Aging high, based on their expression profiles. These subgroups showed distinct prognoses and survival rates, with the Aging high group associated with DNA repair and cell cycle pathways, and the Aging low group showing suppressed metabolic pathways and increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting a potential for better immunotherapy outcomes. Mutation analysis did not find significant differences in mutation frequencies between the groups, but a high Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) correlated with better prognosis. A risk score model was also developed, showcasing significant prognostic power. Further analysis of the SIX1 gene revealed its overexpression in cancer cells. Drug sensitivity tests indicated that the low-risk group might respond better to chemotherapy. This research underscores the significance of aging-related genes in endometrial cancer, offering insights into their prognostic value and therapeutic potential, which could lead to personalized treatment approaches and enhanced patient management.</p>","author":"Yongchao Yin, \nQian Niu, \nZhiqiang Wei, \nYefei Wang, \nGang Li, \nWeican Zhang, \nKai Guo, \nXinyu Yao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"1e08bcf6a7789e313cdb2a73c70cf6008d60e1a765d8eb08f328dab23a21e892","category":"Environment"}
