{"title":"Experimental study on stepped solar still equipped with reflectors for the concentration of sugarcane juice","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14477?af=R","date":1726305231000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present study accentuate the noteworthiness of ongoing research in evolving sustainable sugarcane juice evaporation technologies to help the non-centrifugal sugar (NCS) industry. Concentrated sugarcane juice (CSJ) is the raw material for the production of variety of value added products. A stepped solar still (SSS) could be one of the inexpensive solutions to evaporate water from sugarcane juice. In this study, a SSS having internal and external reflectors (SSS-IR-ER) is tested at 25 mL/min of sugarcane juice for obtaining CSJ. The thermo-enviro-economic performance of SSS-IR-ER unit is compared with SSS and SSS-IR (SSS having internal reflectors) units. The final brix content (<sup>o</sup>B) of the CSJ obtained from SSS-IR-ER is found to be maximum (20.7 <sup>o</sup>B) which is respectively, 16.90% and 7.25% higher than those of SSS and SSS-IR units. The total distillate output (condensate) and heat transfer coefficients show similar trends as that of brix values, which proves thermal dominance of SSS-IR-ER unit. For SSS-IR-ER, the convective and evaporative heat transfer coefficients were found to be maximum as 3.89 and 73.78 W/m<sup>2</sup>°C, respectively. The average values of energy and exergy efficiencies for SSS-IR-ER were, respectively, evaluated as 55.25% and 2.7% which were also observed maximum among the tested units. SSS-IR-ER also found to command in environmental and economic aspects with maximum values of total productive cost ($0.218), CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation (14.93 tonnes) and carbon credit earned ($186.73). It is inferred that SSS-IR-ER is more economical and thermally efficient than SSS and SSS-IR units.</p>","author":"Rahul Grewal, \nMahesh Kumar, \nAshok Chaudhary, \nPankaj Yadav","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"17f5910937358c79c05f42c50bc81c407712eededc6dfa8a1f96bf09209adbb3","category":"Environment"}
