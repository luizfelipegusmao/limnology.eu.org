{"title":"The ATTO 565 Dye and its Applications in Microscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0975/v1","date":1720750545000,"content":"ATTO 565, a Rhodamine-type dye, has garnered significant attention due to its remarkable optical properties, such as a high fluorescence quantum yield, it is a relatively stable structure, and has low biotoxicity. ATTO 565 has found extensive applications in combination with microscopy technology. In this review, the chemical and optical properties of ATTO 565 are introduced, along with the principles behind them. Then, the functionality of ATTO 565 in confocal microscopy, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, single-molecule tracking (SMT) techniques, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is discussed. These studies demonstrate that ATTO 565 plays a crucial role in areas such as biological imaging and single-molecule localization, thus warranting further in-depth investigation. Finally, we present some prospects and concepts for the future applications of ATTO 565 in the fields of biocompatibility and metal ion detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"abf57c21bae2ebcea62b44f4eff2b3ecebc81368001bdadd276595a24dcba716","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
