{"title":"Differences in the Duration of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement Leading to CLABSI versus Colonization by Multi-drug Resistant Pathogens: A Single Centre Retrospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1173/v1","date":1715941619000,"content":"Background: While it is established that intravenous catheter placement duration is strongly linked to the risk of catheter colonization and bloodstream infections, there are still substantial knowledge gaps concerning the varying durations of PICC placement that lead to either infection or colonization by common pathogens, particularly MDR pathogens.\nThe present study aims to compare the dwell time required for MDR pathogens to colonize with the time required to cause Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSIs) in critically ill patients with PICCs and compares it with non-MDR pathogens, shedding light on the significance of preventive procedures to control MDR infections in clinical settings.\nMethods: Data from critically ill patients with PICCs admitted consecutively to «Metropolitan» Hospital in Athens, Greece, from May 2017 to May 2020 were retrospectively analysed.\nResults: In this study, 86 hospitalized patients, consisting of 56 (65.1%) males and 30 (34.9%) females, with a mean age of 55.67±21.1 years (range 16-91 years), presented with both CLABSIs and colonization following PICC placements. Specifically, 42 (48.8%) of them presented with CLABSIs, while 44 (51.2%) presented with colonization. Among the total participants, an MDR pathogen was isolated from 26 (30.2%) PICCs, while other pathogens were isolated from 60 (69.8%). The mean duration of catheter dwell time for all participants was 20.94±14.22 days (range 3-72 days). When analysed separately for each group, the dwell time for PICCs with CLABSIs was 25.73±16.19 days and 16.36±10.28 days for those with colonization (T test, p=0.002). Additionally, the mean dwell time for PICCs infected by non-MDROs was 22.48±15.64 days whereas for PICCs with MDROs, it was 17.38±9.5 days (T test, p=0.005). In PICCs with CLABSIs, the mean indwelling time for MDR pathogens was 21.50±12.31 days, while for non-MDROs, it was 27.73±16.98 days (T test, p=0.417). In PICCs with colonization, the mean dwell time for MDR pathogens was 15.55±7.73 days, while for non-MDROs, it was 16.92±11.85 days (T test, p=0.124). Among PICCs with MDR pathogens (n=26), the mean duration in CLABSIs events (n=18) was 21.5±12.31 days and in colonization events 15.55±7.73 days, (n=8) (T test, p=0.146).\nConclusions: The present study reveals that colonization of PICCs exhibited a shorter dwell time compared to those with CLABSIs. Moreover, PICCs infected by MDROs had a shorter mean dwell time than those with non-MDROs. These findings underscore the importance of considering infection status and microbial resistance patterns when evaluating PICC dwell times.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e413edf8f20aaa7ac5ed6a374783137cd474e79ac95da2835e44c69e7193913","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
