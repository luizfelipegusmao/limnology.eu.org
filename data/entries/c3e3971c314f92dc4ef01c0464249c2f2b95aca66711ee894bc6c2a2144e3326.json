{"title":"The extracellular vesicle proteomes of Sorghum bicolor and Arabidopsis thaliana are partially conserved","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1481/7458366?rss=1","date":1701648000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound organelles involved mainly in intercellular communications and defense responses against pathogens. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of proteins, nucleic acids including small RNAs, and lipids along with other metabolites in plant EVs. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of EVs from sorghum (<span>Sorghum bicolor</span>). Nanoparticle tracking analysis, dynamic light scattering, and cryo-electron tomography showed the presence of a heterogeneous population of EVs isolated from the apoplastic wash of sorghum leaves. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that EVs had a median size of 110â€…nm and distinct populations of vesicles with single or multiple lipid bilayers and low or high amounts of contents. The heterogeneity was further supported by data showing that only a subset of EVs that were stained with a membrane dye, Potomac Gold, were also stained with the membrane-permeant esterase-dependent dye, calcein acetoxymethyl ester. Proteomic analysis identified 437 proteins that were enriched in multiple EV isolations, with the majority of these also found in the EV proteome of Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). These data suggest a partial conservation of EV contents and function between the monocot, sorghum, and a distantly related eudicot, Arabidopsis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"c3e3971c314f92dc4ef01c0464249c2f2b95aca66711ee894bc6c2a2144e3326","category":"Environment"}
