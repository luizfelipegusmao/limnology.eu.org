{"title":"Exploring the Impact of IL-33 Gene Polymorphism (rs1929992) on Susceptibility to Chronic Urticaria and its Association with Serum Interleukin-33 levels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2089/v1","date":1727363242000,"content":"Chronic urticaria (CU) is a debilitating skin condition affecting up to 20% of the global popula-tion, characterized by erythematous, maculo-papular lesions and significant quality of life im-pairment. This study focused on the role of interleukin 33 (IL-33) and its polymorphisms, partic-ularly SNP rs1929992, in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from CU patients and controls, we aestimated allele and genotype frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium condition, and serum IL-33 levels, using unconditional binomial logistic regression for association analysis. Results revealed that CU patients had significantly higher frequencies of the minor allele of IL33 rs1929992 compared to controls (31.25% vs. 17.35%, p = 0.024), and carriers of the AG genotype exhibited increased odds of CU (adjusted OR = 2.208, p â‰¤ 0.001). Additionally, serum IL-33 levels were markedly elevated in CU patients, par-ticularly those with the GA genotype. The findings suggest that the IL-33 SNP rs1929992 is asso-ciated with an increased susceptibility to CSU, emphasizing its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker. This study underscores the genetic and immunological underpinnings of CSU, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9318ed0d2ced46f4d9a5283058ef841efabdb007ed8ea92c86360e66c50a4c5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
