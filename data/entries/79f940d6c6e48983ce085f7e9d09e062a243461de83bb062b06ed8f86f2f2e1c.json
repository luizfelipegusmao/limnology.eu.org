Therefore, examining the behaviour of Tehran Province Water and Wastewater (TPWW) subscribers to identify high-consumption subscribers and explain methods to encourage and educate them more about the correct water consumption pattern can help deal with this crisis. This study aims to use machine learning algorithms to build a robust model for the classification of subscribers in Tehran. Then, new subscribers can be classified into similar classes. For this reason, ensemble algorithms, support vector machines and neural networks are used to predict subscribers' behaviour. Then, the random forest algorithm from the set of ensemble algorithms is considered the best model for the TPWW case with 99% and 98% in train and test accuracy, respectively.</p>","author":"Arezoo Dahesh, \nReza Tavakkoli‐Moghaddam, \nAmirReza Tajally, \nAseman Erfani‐Jazi, \nMilad Babazadeh‐Behestani","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"79f940d6c6e48983ce085f7e9d09e062a243461de83bb062b06ed8f86f2f2e1c","category":"Environment"}
