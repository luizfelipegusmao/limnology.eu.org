{"title":"Early absolute lymphocyte count was associated with one-year mortality in critically ill surgical patients: A propensity score-matching and weighting study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304627","date":1717077600000,"content":"<p>by Duc Trieu Ho, The Thach Pham, Li-Ting Wong, Chieh-Liang Wu, Ming-Cheng Chan, Wen-Cheng Chao</p>\r\nBackground <p>Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is a crucial indicator of immunity in critical illness, but studies focusing on long-term outcomes in critically ill patients, particularly surgical patients, are still lacking. We sought to explore the association between week-one ALC and long-term mortality in critically ill surgical patients.</p> Methods <p>We used the 2015–2020 critical care database of Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH), a referral hospital in central Taiwan, and the primary outcome was one-year all-cause mortality. We assessed the association between ALC and long-term mortality by measuring hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Furthermore, we used propensity score-matching and -weighting analyses, consisting of propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS), to validate the association.</p> Results <p>A total of 8052 patients were enrolled, with their one-year mortality being 24.2%. Cox regression showed that low ALC was independently associated with mortality (adjHR 1.140, 95% CI 1.091–1.192). Moreover, this association tended to be stronger among younger patients, patients with fewer comorbidities and lower severity. The association between low ALC and mortality in original, PSM, IPTW, and CBPS populations were 1.497 (95% CI 1.320–1.697), 1.391 (95% CI 1.169–1.654), 1.512 (95% CI 1.310–1.744), and 1.511 (95% CI 1.310–1.744), respectively. Additionally, the association appears to be consistent, using distinct cutoff levels to define the low ALC.</p> Conclusions <p>We identified that early low ALC was associated with increased one-year mortality in critically ill surgical patients, and prospective studies are warranted to confirm the finding.</p>","author":"Duc Trieu Ho","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8e3f95686cee34abf08e4f82a0282281fbb4011907553ee644dbd27cab73cc44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
