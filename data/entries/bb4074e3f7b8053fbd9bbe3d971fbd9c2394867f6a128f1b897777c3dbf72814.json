{"title":"Gravity and the Riemannian Hypothesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0289/v4","date":1721126483000,"content":"Theoretical physics addresses the fundamental principles of nature and the mysteries of the universe. In the last century, the theory of relativity challenged people's understanding of time and space, while quantum mechanics revealed various forms of energy. However, the concept of gravity remains elusive. All matter in the universe is composed of energy that can be converted into other forms, yet it is always conserved. However, achieving a state of equilibrium, represented by the equal sign, can be challenging to achieve on both macro and quantum scales. A phenomenon that can transition from one state to infinity is called collision and is essential for understanding natural phenomena and physical processes throughout the universe. In the study of general relativity cannot be three-dimensional problems to gain mathematical inspiration, understand the application of new dimensions. Here, we elucidate the nature of gravity, which inspires the solution of the Riemann hypothesis. Our results show that the conduction mode of dimensional energy is defined by Euler's formula. And a special mode of collision is derived which translates into vibration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb4074e3f7b8053fbd9bbe3d971fbd9c2394867f6a128f1b897777c3dbf72814","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
