{"title":"Multi-locational Evaluation of Forage-suited Selected Sudan Pearl Millet (Pennisetum glaucum L. R.Br.) Accessions Identified High-Yielding and Stable Genotypes in Irrigated, Arid Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1662/v1","date":1711526766000,"content":": Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L) R. Br) is a subtropical grain and forage crop. It is privileged with several desirable forage attributes. Nevertheless, research on pearl millet is limited especially as a forage crop in the developing countries. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the field performance and stability of pearl millet genotypes for forage yield across seven environments. The study was conducted in seven environments (combination of locations and seasons) during 2016/2017-2018/2019 seasons. Twenty-five pearl millet genotypes, selected based on forage yield from a core collection of 200 accessions, were arranged in alpha lattice design with three replications. The parameters measured were fresh forage yield, days to flowering, plant height, number of culms m-2, leaf to stem ratio, and stem girth. The combined analysis revealed that environments, genotypes and their interaction had significant effects on all traits studied except the genotypic effect on stem girth. Across the seven environments, four genotypes (G14, G01, G12, and G22) out-yielded the check genotype in fresh matter yield by 20.7, 16.5, 11.0 and 9.8%, respectively. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis showed that the genotype, environment and their interaction were highly significant (Pâ‰¤0.001) for fresh matter yield. The results of AMMI Stability Values (ASV) and the genotype selection index (GSI) combined with the AMMI estimate-based selection showed that genotypes G14, G22 and G01 were the most stable and adapted genotypes and were superior to the check genotype. These results indicate that forage pearl millet varieties could be developed directly through evaluation of the wealth available collections or indirectly through hybridization in crop breeding programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d7af9e78ed4a82c6cdb49715998b65e55ecb0a213f6a5da0522315a30d256fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
