{"title":"Crystallization of Calcium Carbonate and Calcium Phosphate Phases in Silica Hydrogel: Morphological and Compositional Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1441/v1","date":1718888916000,"content":"The present study showcases a series of crystallization experiments using a specially designed double diffusion system to grow crystals belonging to the calcium carbonate-phosphate system. The experimental U-shaped device comprised two vertical solution containers, separated by a horizontal column of silica hydrogel. Each container was filled with 0.5 M CaCl2 and 0.5 M Na2CO3 solutions, which diffused through the gel column over time. Na3PO4 solutions, with 50 and 500 ppm concentrations, were incorporated into the gel in different experiments, resulting in a homogeneous distribution of phosphate concentrations within the diffusion column. After 15 and 30 days incubation period post-nucleation, the crystals formed in different sections of the gel were carefully extracted and studied with scanning electron microscopy and electron microprobe. Additionally, Raman spectra were collected from the samples using a confocal Raman microscope, providing further insights into their molecular composition and structural properties. The obtained results show that under the induced experimental conditions (i) phosphate incorporates into calciteÂ´s structure, and (ii) the growth of calcium phosphates in the presence of carbonate ions involves the sequential, heterogeneous nucleation of CO3-bearing OCP/HAP-like phases with Raman spectral characteristics very similar to those of bioapatites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0352e386aa7b18af136225dd868f125fd24a0fd619d7a9e990ed5e9bb0d1f056","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
