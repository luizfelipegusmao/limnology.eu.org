{"title":"Unique Jurassic Fruits Shed a New Light on the Nature of Carpels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0489/v1","date":1717750897000,"content":"Carpels are a reproductive feature restricted to angiosperms, therefore they are a focus of many botanical studies. However, there are controversies over the nature of carpels. A reason underly-ing these controversies is mixing implications given by conflicting interpretations on fossil carpels in early fossil angiosperms from the Cretaceous. These controversies hinder a clear understanding of angiosperm evolution and systematics. A key to these questions is older fossil fruits bearing concerned information. Here we report a new fossil fruit, Xenofructus dabuensis gen. et sp. nov, from the Middle Jurassic of Liaoning, China. Unlike previously reported fruits of early angio-sperms that were interpreted as bearing seeds either on adaxial or abaxial margin by various au-thors, our fossil demonstrates clearly that the seeds in Xenofructus are neither borne on the adaxial nor abaxial margin of the fruit, instead the seeds of Xenofructus are borne on an axis positioned between two margins. This new feature implies that a placenta in carpels is an ovule/seed-bearing axis, a carpel is a composite organ comprising an enclosing leaf (fruit wall) and an axis (placenta). The adaxial or abaxial position of ovules/seeds frequently seen in fossil and extant angiosperms is a consequence derived through long time evolution (coalescence of placenta with either margin of fruits). Carpels can be taken as foliar structures enclosing their associated ovulate branches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf577c74788f49511e53e5cb88e916f01a56c1fc2195c790255d27bf5c3701b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
