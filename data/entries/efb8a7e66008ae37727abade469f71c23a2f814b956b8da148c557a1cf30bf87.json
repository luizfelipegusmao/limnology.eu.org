Three randomized trials (combined N = 330) were combined to assess whether MOUD (extended-release naltrexone or interim methadone) initiated prior to release from jail with or without PN would reduce the likelihood of a DSM-5 diagnosis of OUD 6 months post-release relative to enhanced treatment-as-usual (ETAU). Across the three studies, assignment to MOUD compared to ETAU was not associated with an OUD diagnosis at 6 months post-release (69% vs. 75%, respectively, OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.20). Similarly, PN compared to MOUD without PN was not associated with an OUD diagnosis (63% vs 77%, respectively, OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.53). Results underscore the need to further optimize the effectiveness of MOUD for patients initiating treatment in jail, beginning with an emphasis on post-release treatment adherence.","author":"Joshua D.
