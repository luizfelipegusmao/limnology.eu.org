{"title":"Machine Learning Discoveries of Wnt-X Synergy in ETC-1922159 Treated Colorectal Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0453/v1","date":1725526598000,"content":"Often, in biology, we are faced with the problem of exploring relevant unknown biological hypotheses in the form of myriads of combinations of factors/genes/proteins that might be affecting the pathway under certain conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with ETC-1922159, many genes were found up and down regu- lated, individually. A recently developed search engine ranked combinations of Wnt-X (X, a particular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. These rank- ings reveal which Wnt-X combinations might be working synergistically in CRC. If found true, oncologists can further test the combination of interest in wet lab and deter- mine the mechanism of functioning between the Wnt and X. In this research work, we cover combinations of Wnt with Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (ASCL2), ATP- binding cassette (ABC) domain transporters, Interleukin (IL), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2) family, exosome (EXOSC), caspase (CASP), TP53 and B-cell lymphoma (BCL) family.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"18d633122f608c7e954f94d365c8b8ada840cd3c3f038c4fcfd57fcee7c3edc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
