{"title":"Marijuana Use and Associated Risk Behavior Factors among High School Students in Mississippi: Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System 2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1740/v1","date":1721711572000,"content":"Marijuana is the most used illicit drug among youths in the United States. The objectives of the study were to identify the association between marijuana use and other risk behaviors including suicidality among high school students. The 2021 Mississippi Youth Risk Behavior Survey data sets were combined for this study. Crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval were generated using the survey packages in R to account for weights and the complex sampling design of YRBS data. Tobacco products and alcohol use were significantly associated with marijuana use. Students who responded “Yes” to questions “currently used an electronic vapor product?”, “currently smoked cigarettes or cigars?” or “currently drank alcohol?” were more likely to use marijuana compared to students who responded “No”, after adjusting for other risk factors. Marijuana use is also significantly associated with students who had sex, compared to those who never had sex. The adjusted odds ratio is nearly doubled in those who had sex with the same sex or both sexes, compared to those who had heterosexual sex only. After adjusting for other health risk factors, the association between current marijuana use and attempted suicide was not statistically significant. The impact of students’ not sleeping in their parent's or guardian's home on current marijuana use was not significant after adjusting for other risk factors. Marijuana use is evenly burdened between males and females and between all race categories among Mississippi high school students. The identified associations seem to indicate that electronic vapor, tobacco products, and alcohol use could be the forerunners for drug use and should be treated accordingly in drug use prevention programs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d440b7d9ccfc8f4ddf744f6161e588f356908bedde01570397ed1b26e4fd3d39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
