{"title":"Early Diagnosis of Children with Neurodevelopment Disorders: A Review of Research with Implications for Applying DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria to Young Children","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1055/v1","date":1718603850000,"content":"This survey of research literature is an overview of the current state of science addressing DSM-5 diagnostic criteria as it relates to identifying Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in young children. Selected sources are of high quality and have been published since 2020 in peer-reviewed journals relevant to childrenâ€™s health. The narrative is organized from the earliest to the most recent publications and is divided into sections around categories and themes that highlight the main arguments, findings, and controversies identified by researchers. There are indications in the literature that while ASD can be identified and differentiated from other developmental disorders in young children, doing so requires that clinicians who have relied on the DSM-5 should also use multiple measures, including other formalized screening tools as assessments that gather observational input from parents and caregivers, as well as findings from physical examinations, laboratory investigations, and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI). This high level of corroboration points to an emerging diagnosis paradigm through which transdiagnostic approaches to early diagnosis and intervention may exist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1616425c0d78e5e016a7a0a9ca36f35c3a5d6de22f73db5f4901ec8983b5a8b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
