{"title":"Telomere Length and Telomerase Activity as Potential Biomarkers for Gastrointestinal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1012/v1","date":1723616359000,"content":"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, such as colorectal and gastric cancers, pose significant global health challenges due to their high rates of incidence and mortality. Even with advancements in treatment and early detection, many patients still face poor outcomes, highlighting the critical need for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Telomere length (TL) and telomerase activity (TA) have gained attention in this context. Telomeres, protective nucleotide sequences at chromo-some ends, shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular aging. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme, counteracts this shortening by adding telomeric repeats, a process tightly regulated in normal cells but often dysregulated in cancer. This review critically evaluates the role of TL and TA in the pathogenesis of GI cancers, examining their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. It explores how alterations in telomere biology contribute to the initiation and progression of GI tumors and assesses the therapeutic implications of targeting telomerase. By integrating findings from diverse studies, this review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between telomere dynamics and gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, offering in-sights into how TL and TA could be leveraged to enhance the early detection, treatment, and prognosis of GI cancers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61e14247d958502cbc0090f3bfcbba277644e7a39066487243307f3645f47381","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
