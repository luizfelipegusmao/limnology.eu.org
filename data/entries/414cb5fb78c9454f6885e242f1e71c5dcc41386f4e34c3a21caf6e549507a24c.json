{"title":"TGF&beta; Producing Regulatory T Cells Related Tolerable Immunities and Their Relations to Scleroderma and End Organ Failures Including Heart Failure, Liver Cirrhosis, Uremia, and Pulmonary Fibrosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0615/v1","date":1710159613000,"content":"Regulatory T cells are key immune cells to initiate tolerable immune responses. TGFβ is the key cytokine of regulatory T cells. TGFβ is also the master cytokine to stimulate tissue fibrosis. Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease related to overt organ fibrosis. Thus, systemic sclerosis is a disease related to regulatory T cell over-representation. Besides, many end stage organ failures including heart failure, liver cirrhosis, uremia, and pulmonary fibrosis also related to tissue fibrosis. Thus, TGFβ producing regulatory T cells are also involved in the pathogenesis of these end stage organ failure. Once we know the significance of TGFβ and it induced tolerable immune reactions in the pathophysiology of end organ failure, we can develop better prevention or therapeutic strategies to combat these detrimental disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"414cb5fb78c9454f6885e242f1e71c5dcc41386f4e34c3a21caf6e549507a24c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
