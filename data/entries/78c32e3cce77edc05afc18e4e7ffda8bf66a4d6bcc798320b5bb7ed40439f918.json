{"title":"N-oxide Coordination to Mn(III) Chloride","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0821/v1","date":1726044062000,"content":": We report the synthesis and characterization of Mn(III) chloride (MnIIICl3) complexes coordinated with N-oxide ylide ligands, namely trimethyl-N-oxide (Me3NO) and pyridine-N-oxide (PyNO). The compounds are reactive and, while isolable in the solid-state at room temperature, readily decompose into Mn(II). For example, “[MnIIICl3(ONMe3)n]” decomposes into the 2D polymeric network compound complex salt [MnII(µ-Cl)3MnII(µ-ONMe3)]n[MnII(µ-Cl)3]n•(Me3NO•HCl)n (4). The reaction of MnIIICl3 with PyNO forms varied Mn(III) compounds with PyNO coordination and these react with hexamethylbenzene (HMB) to form the chlorinated organic product 1-cloromethyl-2,3,4,5,6-pentamethylbenzene (8). In contrast to N-oxide coordination to Mn(III), the reaction between [MnIIICl3(OPPh3)2] and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) resulted in electron transfer forming d5 manganate of the [TEMPO] cation instead of TEMPO–Mn(III) adducts. The reactivity affected by N-oxide coordination is discussed through comparisons with other L–MnIIICl3 complexes within the context of reduction potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78c32e3cce77edc05afc18e4e7ffda8bf66a4d6bcc798320b5bb7ed40439f918","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
