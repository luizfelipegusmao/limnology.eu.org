{"title":"Plyometric and Resistance Training: A Dual Approach to Enhance Physical Fitness in 12â€“15-Year-Old Girls","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1188/v1","date":1728985617000,"content":"Background/Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an 8-week combined plyometric and resistance training program on the physical fitness of adolescent girls aged 12 to 15 years. The objective was to determine whether combined training (CT) would yield greater improvements in performance measures compared to resistance training (RT) alone.\nMethods: Forty-seven adolescent girls were randomly assigned to either the CT group or the RT group. Performance measures such as the 20-meter sprint, squat jump, vertical jump, handgrip strength, and flexibility (sit and reach test) were assessed before and after the 8-week interven-tion. Changes in these measures were analyzed to compare the effects of the two training ap-proaches.\nResults: The CT group showed a significant reduction in sprint time (-6.5%) compared to the RT group (-4.1%), although the difference was not statistically significant. Squat jump height im-proved significantly by 5.6% in the CT group compared to 1.1% in the RT group (p &lt; 0.05). Simi-larly, vertical jump height increased by 6.7% in the CT group and by 2.4% in the RT group (p &lt; 0.05). Handgrip strength improved by 7.5% in the CT group and 4.6% in the RT group, with no significant differences between the groups. Flexibility showed slight, non-significant improve-ments in both groups.\nConclusions: The findings suggest that combined plyometric and resistance training is more ef-fective in enhancing explosive power, specifically squat and vertical jump performance, in ado-lescent girls compared to resistance training alone. These results highlight the potential of com-bined training programs for improving overall physical performance in this population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"104bb6d339ce1174f764f612985f7eb268a7b48031d37cad88ba491847851866","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
