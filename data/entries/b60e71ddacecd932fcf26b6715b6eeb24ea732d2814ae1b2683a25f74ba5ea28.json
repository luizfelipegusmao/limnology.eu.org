{"title":"Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy for focal liver lesions: Adverse events and diagnostic yield in a single-centre analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304026","date":1716386400000,"content":"<p>by Theresa Pöschel, Valentin Blank, Tobias Schlosser, Thomas Lingscheidt, Albrecht Böhlig, Johannes Wiegand, Thomas Karlas</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Ultrasound-guided biopsy of focal liver lesions (FLL) is a well-established procedure with crucial impact on therapeutic decisions. The safety and accuracy depend on needle type, tumour location and comorbidities. Modern oncological concepts often require large tumour specimens which may increase the procedural risk.</p> Materials and methods <p>We retrospectively collected data from consecutively scheduled ultrasound-guided FLL biopsies performed in an interdisciplinary ultrasound unit at a university hospital from 2015–2020. We analysed complication rates, diagnostic accuracy, and patient outcome in a one-year period.</p> Results <p>Of 426 scheduled interventions, 339 were included: 322 primary biopsies (40% female, median age 65 years, median BMI 25.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 17 rebiopsies in cases with undetermined diagnosis. Indications comprised 309 (96%) cases with suspected malignant lesions. Important comorbidities were type 2 diabetes (n = 107, 33%) and cirrhosis (n = 64, 20%). A conclusive histopathological diagnosis was achieved in 270 (84%) cases with a weak association with lesion size (OR 1.12 per cm, 95%CI 0.99–1.27). Greater BMI (OR 0.60 per 10 BMI points, 95%CI 0.34–1.05) showed a trend towards an insufficient diagnosis. Relevant complications occurred in 8 (2.5%) cases (2 major; 1 life-threatening). Multiple passes showed a trend towards adverse events (OR 2.32 for &gt; 1 pass, 95%CI 0.99–5.42). 93 (29%) patients died during a median follow-up of 171 days.</p> Conclusion <p>Ultrasound-guided FLL biopsy is an efficient and safe diagnostic measure. The limitations of the procedure and its associated risks should be considered in patients with advanced malignancies.</p>","author":"Theresa Pöschel","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b60e71ddacecd932fcf26b6715b6eeb24ea732d2814ae1b2683a25f74ba5ea28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
