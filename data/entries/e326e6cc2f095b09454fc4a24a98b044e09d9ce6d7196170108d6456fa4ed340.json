{"title":"Nuclear Matter Equation of State in the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock Approach and Standard Skyrme Energy-Density Functionals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0137/v1","date":1712035471000,"content":"The equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter as well as the neutron and proton effective masses and their partial-wave and spin-isospin decomposition are analyzed within the Brueckner–Hartree–Fock approach. Theoretical uncertainties for all these quantities are estimated by using several phase-shift-equivalent nucleon-nucleon forces together with two types of three-nucleon forces, phenomenological and microscopic. It is shown that the choice of the three-nucleon force plays an important role above saturation density, leading to different density dependencies of the energy per particle. These results are compared to the standard form of the Skyrme energy-density functional and we find that it is not possible to reproduce the BHF predictions in the (S,T) channels in symmetric and neutron matter above saturation density, already at the level of the two-body interaction, and even more including the three-body interaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e326e6cc2f095b09454fc4a24a98b044e09d9ce6d7196170108d6456fa4ed340","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
