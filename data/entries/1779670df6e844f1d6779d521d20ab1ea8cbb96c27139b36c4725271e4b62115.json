{"title":"Physical Attributes of Soil and Productivity in Intercropped Sorghum Grain within No-Tillage Cropping System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1895/v1","date":1721819429000,"content":"A favorable physical environment in the soil is necessary and of fundamental importance for the growth and root development of the sorghum crop, in order to maximize the productivity of the planted crops. In this study we evaluated the physical aspects of the soil in no-tillage system in a sorghum grain area intercropped with Urochloa ruziziensis and Crotalaria spectabilis and the productivity of the crop, in off-season (second crop season), based in a long field experiment. The experimental design was a randomized block design in a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement (four cropping systems: sorghum, sorghum + Urochloa ruziziensis, sorghum + Crotalaria spectabilis, sorghum + Urochloa ruziziensis + Crotalaria spectabilis; four soil depths: 0 - 0.10 m, 0.10 - 0.20 m, 0.20 - 0.30 m, 0.30 - 0.40 m). It was analyzed the productivity and the physical soil attributes that were: Soil Bulk Density (DS), Gravimetric Moisture (GM), Total Porosity (TP), Microporosity (MI), Macroporosity (MA) and Resistance to Root Penetration (RP). The study asserts that intercropping sorghum with Crotalaria spectabilis is a promising strategy to increase productivity. The Sorghum + Urochloa ruziziensis + Crotalaria spectabilis combination significantly improves soil structure by reducing penetration resistance and increasing macroporosity, especially at depths greater than 0.20 m. The inclusion of Urochloa enhances moisture retention, while Crotalaria contributes to greater porosity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1779670df6e844f1d6779d521d20ab1ea8cbb96c27139b36c4725271e4b62115","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
