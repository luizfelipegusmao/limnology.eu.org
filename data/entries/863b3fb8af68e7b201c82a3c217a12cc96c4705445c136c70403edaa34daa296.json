{"title":"Judicious use of agricultural and industrial waste to rice is a green technology having GHGs mitigation potential","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13762-023-05430-6","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Waste management and climate change mitigation is the key environmental challenges the world faces today. A huge quantity of industrial and agricultural wastes is generated every year globally. Dumping and burning off those wastes cause air pollution and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions causing global warming and climate change consequences. However, these wastes could be effectively utilized in rice as a green technology for GHGs mitigation and sustaining productivity. The seven treatments, including different dose of two industrial wastes (phosphogypsum and basic slag) and agricultural waste (rice straw, rice-straw compost, rice-straw biochar) are (i) recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) (80:40:40:: N:P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>:K<sub>2</sub>O kg ha<sup>−1</sup>), (ii) RDF; nitrogen through ammonium sulphate (AS), (iii) RDF + rice straw-biochar (5t ha<sup>−1</sup>) (BC), (iv) RDF + phosphogypsum (2t ha<sup>−1</sup>) (PG), (v) RDF + rice straw-incorporation (5t ha<sup>−1</sup>) (RSI), (vi) RDF + rice straw-compost (5t ha<sup>−1</sup>) (RSC), and (vii) RDF + basic slag (1t ha<sup>−1</sup>) (BS). The soil carbon-pools, enzymatic activity, GHGs emissions, global warming potential (GWP), carbon-equivalent emission (CEE), GHG intensity (GHGI) and green income (considering economic profit and carbon-credit compliance) were estimated. The BS and PG had higher GHGs emission-mitigation potential (22.3–20 and 14.8–12.9% reduction of methane and nitrous oxide over RDF, respectively) and lower GHGI. Considering yield performance, production cost, and carbon-credit compliance, BS ranked number one followed by RSC and PG in the green income category and could be promoted as green technology. However, large-scale validation in farmers’ fields is necessary for further assessment.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"863b3fb8af68e7b201c82a3c217a12cc96c4705445c136c70403edaa34daa296","category":"Environment"}
