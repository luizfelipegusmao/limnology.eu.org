{"title":"Pre-Dam Vltava River Valleyâ€”A Case Study of 3D Visualization of Large-scale GIS Datasets in Unreal Engine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2344/v1","date":1722262152000,"content":"This article explores the potential of the Unreal Engine game engine as a tool for creating highly realistic 3D visualizations of GIS data, specifically in the context of significant historical areas. The research will focus on the computational techniques used in the 3D visualization of GIS data and the Unreal Engine software and its potential applications in geomatics. The article also presents several relevant scientific studies and projects that have successfully used game engines for similar purposes, explores the potential for using GIS data within a game engine, including plug-ins that provide additional functionality to GIS software, and the use of procedural modeling to create 3D objects through the CityEngine software plug-in. Finally, the research is applied to a dataset of the historical Vltava Valley covering an area of 1670 km2 to demonstrate the capabilities of Unreal Engine in creating realistic visualizations of large historical landscapes, and the resulting visualizations are presented. This practical application of the research provides valuable insights into the potential of the Unreal Engine as a powerful tool for creating highly realistic 3D visualizations of large historical areas with potential applications in the field of geomatics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b6ca3f90a1a103387039ce0ac4d3a46956f2e0d1ef9989b0a0470d8e45df200","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
