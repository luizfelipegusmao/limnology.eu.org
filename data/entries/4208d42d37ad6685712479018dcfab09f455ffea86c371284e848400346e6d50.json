{"title":"Advancements and Challenges in Artificial Intelligence Applications in Healthcare Delivery Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0938/v1","date":1720769566000,"content":"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has transformed clinical practices by improving the accuracy of diagnosis, optimizing surgical procedures, improving the patient experience, and accelerating drug development. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the many applications of artificial intelligence (AI) across several industries, including fast diagnostics, where ML algorithms greatly enhance the accuracy and velocity of disease diagnosis. State-of-the-art robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgical procedures that shorten patients' hospitalization and improve their chances of recovery, cutting-edge AI applications in healthcare monitoring, and medication development. The article also looks at the primary challenges that AI in healthcare will inevitably encounter, such as differences in product quality, a shortage of skilled workers, privacy and ethical issues, and the need for improved regulatory frameworks. Despite the challenges, AI contributes significant advantages to the healthcare industry, providing novel and remarkable contributions to the efficiency of medical procedures and the progress of medical outcomes. The paper emphasizes the importance of cooperation in overcoming current challenges and enhancing the acceptability of AI technology in clinical settings. This will ensure that AI-driven innovations continue to enhance the standards of patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4208d42d37ad6685712479018dcfab09f455ffea86c371284e848400346e6d50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
