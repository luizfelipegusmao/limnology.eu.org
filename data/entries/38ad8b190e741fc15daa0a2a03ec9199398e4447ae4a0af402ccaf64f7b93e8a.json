{"title":"Regulatory loops between rice transcription factors OsNAC25 and OsNAC20/26 balance starch synthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1365/7627464?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Several starch synthesis regulators have been identified, but these regulators are situated in the terminus of the regulatory network. Their upstream regulators and the complex regulatory network formed between these regulators remain largely unknown. A previous study demonstrated that NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factors, OsNAC20 and OsNAC26 (OsNAC20/26), redundantly and positively regulate the accumulation of storage material in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) endosperm. In this study, we detected OsNAC25 as an upstream regulator and interacting protein of OsNAC20/26. Both <span>OsNAC25</span> mutation and OE resulted in a chalky seed phenotype, decreased starch content, and reduced expression of starch synthesis–related genes, but the mechanisms were different. In the <span>osnac25</span> mutant, decreased expression of <span>OsNAC20</span>/<span>26</span> resulted in reduced starch synthesis; however, in <span>OsNAC25</span>-overexpressing plants, the OsNAC25–OsNAC20/26 complex inhibited OsNAC20/26 binding to the promoter of starch synthesis–related genes. In addition, OsNAC20/26 positively regulated <span>OsNAC25</span>. Therefore, the mutual regulation between OsNAC25 and OsNAC20/26 forms a positive regulatory loop to stimulate the expression of starch synthesis–related genes and meet the great demand for starch accumulation in the grain filling stage. Simultaneously, a negative regulatory loop forms among the 3 proteins to avoid the excessive expression of starch synthesis–related genes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that both promotion and inhibition mechanisms between OsNAC25 and OsNAC20/26 are essential for maintaining stable expression of starch synthesis–related genes and normal starch accumulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"38ad8b190e741fc15daa0a2a03ec9199398e4447ae4a0af402ccaf64f7b93e8a","category":"Environment"}
