{"title":"Development of a Script to Calculate MW Link Budget Using Tkinter in Python","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0735/v1","date":1718109064000,"content":"It is well-known that simulation tools are essential for the design and optimization of wireless communication systems. In this paper proposes a python script that can be used for planning and predicting a connection link budget by analyzing its basic parameters. Our proposal consists of an application that calculates the connection budget for point-to-point links operating at 5 GHz, taking into account all the necessary microwave parameters. For validating the efficiency of the proposed tool, the paper presents comprehensive simulation results derived from comparing our tool to a couple of other simulation tools by means of calculating the same parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb71f5842db5ebe004e7ee670a19604fd3d695e28161f3436ab15f51fff691fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
