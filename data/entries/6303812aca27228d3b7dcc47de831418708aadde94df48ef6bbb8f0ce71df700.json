{"title":"An In-Depth Analysis of Tsallis Statistics: &pi; &plusmn;, K &plusmn; Mesons, and Pp̄ Baryon in Inelastic Pp Collisions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1876/v1","date":1721814472000,"content":"This study explores the inelastic doubly differential transverse momentum spectra of the\nprimary charged particles, (π + + π − ), (K + + K − ) and (pp̄) as a function of underlying event\n√\n(UE) at s = 13 T eV . The particle production is measured on the basis of different angular\nregions like toward, transverse and away, elucidated with respect to the direction of leading\nparticle of an event. To study the thermal freeze-out parameters, the non extensive Tsallis\ndistribution function is used, to extract the temperature Tef f , and chemical potential µ, which\nprovides a basis to explain the QCD matter. The Tsallis distribution function clearly describes\ntransverse momentum spectra in pseudorapidity region of |η| &lt; 0.8. The best fit corresponds to\nminimum χ2 /ndf value for the transverse momentum distribution. It is observed that effective\ntemperature Tef f changes from away to towards and forward region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6303812aca27228d3b7dcc47de831418708aadde94df48ef6bbb8f0ce71df700","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
