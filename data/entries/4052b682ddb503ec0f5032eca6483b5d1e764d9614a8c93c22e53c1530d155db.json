Zahra, S. A. Mardan, Muhammad Bilal Riaz, Rubab Manzoor</p>\r\n\r\nWe propose a new framework for spherical charged compact objects admitting conformal motion in five-dimensional spacetime. The outer spacetime is considered as Reissner-Nordström to obtain matching conditions. The behavior of model characteristics like stress, pressure, and surface tension for the specific density profile is investigated by using Einstein’s Maxwell field equations in a five-dimensional framework. For the proposed solution, all physical parameters behave very well even for variations in electric charge parameters. The existence of charged compact stars is also predicted by this study.","author":"A.
