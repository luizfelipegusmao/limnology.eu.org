We also introduce the notion of modified $\\lambda$-differential  left-symmetric 2-algebra.\n We classify linear deformations and  abelian extensions   of  modified $\\lambda$-differential  left-symmetric algebras   using the second cohomology group and  classify skeletal modified $\\lambda$-differential  left-symmetric 2-algebra using the third cohomology group as  our propose cohomology applications.\nMoreover, we prove that strict  modified $\\lambda$-differential  left-symmetric 2-algebras are equivalent to crossed modules of modified $\\lambda$-differential  left-symmetric algebras.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc0df36cc477f9f5e8004416eff54cdbd619dd022e3bce3de9d09dca69345d60","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
