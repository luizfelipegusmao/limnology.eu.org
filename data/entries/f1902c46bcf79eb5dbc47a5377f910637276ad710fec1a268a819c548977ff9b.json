{"title":"Advancements in Controlled Environment Workflows for Cryo-APT and Correlative Studies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.249/7719836?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Temperature- and pressure-controlled environment workflows became increasingly important for the fields of experimental physics and material science [<a href=\"#ozae044.249-B1\">1</a>]. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) has specifically seen growing interests due to promising capabilities of providing 3D, atomic scale analyses of solid-liquid interfaces in unprecedented ways [<a href=\"#ozae044.249-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.249-B3\">3</a>]. Enabling correlative microscopy using analytical methods such as atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy necessitates the preservation of samples-of-interest at the atomic level during the entire experimental workflow involving the movement of samples between instruments, labs, and even institutes. In an ideally controlled workflow, sample temperature as well as the surrounding atmosphere must be monitored and logged continuously. Controlled environment transfer technology is particularly important for biological samples, electrochemical applications, and other applications that require chemical and structural preservation along with contamination prevention. Keeping a controlled sample environment throughout the sample preparation process is a challenge for anyone working with cryogenically sensitive samples. Ice build-up leads to longer processing times in the FIB (Focused Ion Beam), or even to a total loss of the cryogenic state of interest [<a href=\"#ozae044.249-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f1902c46bcf79eb5dbc47a5377f910637276ad710fec1a268a819c548977ff9b","category":"Environment"}
