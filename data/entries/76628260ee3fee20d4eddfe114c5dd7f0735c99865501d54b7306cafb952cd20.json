Chi</p>\r\nObjectives <p>Periodontitis is a highly prevalent complication of diabetes. However, the association between cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) and periodontitis has not yet been evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess if: 1) CFRD is associated with periodontitis among adults with CF, and 2) periodontitis prevalence differs by CF and diabetes status.</p> Methods <p>This was a pilot cross-sectional study of the association between CFRD and periodontitis in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) (N = 32). Historical non-CF controls (N = 57) from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset were frequency matched to participants with CF on age, sex, diabetes status, and insulin use. We defined periodontitis using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/AAP) case definition, as the presence of two or more interproximal sites with CAL ≥3 mm and two or more interproximal sites with PD ≥4 mm (not on the same tooth) or one site with PD ≥5 mm. Because NHANES periodontal data were only available for adults ages ≥30 years, our analysis that included non-CF controls focused on this age group (CF N = 19, non-CF N = 57). Based on CF and diabetes status, we formed four groups: CFRD, CF and no diabetes, non-CF with diabetes, and non-CF and no diabetes (healthy). We used the Fisher’s exact test for hypotheses testing.</p> Results <p>There was no association between CFRD and periodontitis for participants with CF ages 22–63 years (CFRD 67% vs. CF no diabetes 53%, P = 0.49), this was also true for those ages ≥30 years (CFRD 78% vs. CF no diabetes 60%, P = 0.63). For the two CF groups, the prevalence of periodontitis was significantly higher than for healthy controls (CFRD 78% vs. healthy 7%, P&lt;0.001; CF no diabetes 60% vs. healthy 7%, P = 0.001) and not significantly different than the prevalence for non-CF controls with diabetes (CFRD 78% vs. non-CF with diabetes 56%, P = 0.43; CF no diabetes 60% vs. non-CF with diabetes 56%, P = 0.99).</p> Conclusion <p>Among participants with CF, CFRD was not associated with periodontitis. However, regardless of diabetes status, participants with CF had increased prevalence of periodontitis compared to healthy controls.</p>","author":"Alaa A.
