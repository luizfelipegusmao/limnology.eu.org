{"title":"Chemo-Enzymatic Generation of Highly Fluorescent Nucleoside Analogs Using Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase &ndash; A Mini-Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0891/v1","date":1715667630000,"content":"Reviewed are recent efforts leading to chemo-enzymatic syntheses of strongly fluorescent ribosides of nucleobase analogs, potentially applicable in analytical biochemistry and cell biology. Described are syntheses and properties of fluorescent purine, 8-azapurine and etheno-purine ribosides, obtained using various types of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) as catalysts of ribosylation, and ÔÅ°-ribose-1-phosphate (r1P) as a second substrate. In several instances, the ribosylation sites were different than the canonical purine N9. Some of the obtained ribosides show fluorescence yields close to 100%. Their main applications are assays of PNP, nucleoside hydrolases, and other enzyme activities both in vitro and, possibly, within the living cells, using fluorescence microscopy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d9d60e41b890e1681ddfaec55f896cb044cd205a76e83fdc9b02b9278976768","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
