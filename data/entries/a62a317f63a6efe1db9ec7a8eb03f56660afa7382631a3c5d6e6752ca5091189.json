{"title":"The Impact of Pause and Filler Words Encoding on Dementia Detection with Contrastive Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0665/v1","date":1718098771000,"content":"Dementia, primarily caused by neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), affects millions worldwide, making detection and monitoring crucial. To enable these tasks, we propose encoding in-text pauses and filler words (i.e., “uh” and “um”) in text-based language models, and thoroughly evaluate their effect in performance. Additionally, we suggest using contrastive learning to improve performance in a multi-task framework. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches in enhancing the model’s performance, achieving 87% accuracy and an 86% F1-score. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach has similar performance despite having significantly fewer parameters. This highlights the importance of pause and filler word encoding on the detection of dementia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a62a317f63a6efe1db9ec7a8eb03f56660afa7382631a3c5d6e6752ca5091189","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
