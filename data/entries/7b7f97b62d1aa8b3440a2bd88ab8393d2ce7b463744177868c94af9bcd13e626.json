The generation of an image requires a Fourier transform and an inverse Fourier transform with some optical phase distortions added to the latter transform that limit the final resolution. The phase-less diffraction data collected through conventional crystallographic means is the result of a real space Fourier transform. This data is processed through various methods to assign a phase to the peaks in reciprocal space [<a href=\"#ozae044.148-B2\">2</a>]. This phase assignment, outside of the microscope, is what facilitates the production of the final image (a density or potential map) of the basis unit in the crystal. The transformations from real space to reciprocal space and back are analogous to the same processes in conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) where the sample and source are imaged, respectively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7b7f97b62d1aa8b3440a2bd88ab8393d2ce7b463744177868c94af9bcd13e626","category":"Environment"}
