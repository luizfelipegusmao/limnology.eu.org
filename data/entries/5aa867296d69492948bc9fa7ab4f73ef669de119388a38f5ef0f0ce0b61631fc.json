{"title":"Arithmetic Sequences without Arithmetic Operations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0985/v1","date":1718347173000,"content":"The generation of arithmetic sequences involves arithmetic operations. However, is it possible to generate such sequences without being subject to any arithmetic or related operations, all by just hand? The answer may be negative, as the very rule defining these sequences itself relies on arithmetic operations. Nonetheless, this paper presents a few results demonstrating that the exact sequences of $an$, where, $a \\in \\{ 2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}$ and $n \\in \\mathbb N \\cup \\{0\\}$, can indeed be generated up to any desired number of terms without relying on any arithmetic operations and others derived from such. This is done by the formation of a specialized table that leverages numerical patterns and the notion of concatenation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5aa867296d69492948bc9fa7ab4f73ef669de119388a38f5ef0f0ce0b61631fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
