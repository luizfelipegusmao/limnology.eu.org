{"title":"Performance Optimization of Voice-Assisted File Management Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0876/v1","date":1718242669000,"content":"In this paper, we present a novel approach for managing the file system in Linux using a voice assistant. Our system allows users to perform file system operations such as creating directories, renaming files, and deleting files by issuing voice commands. We develop a voice assistant using Python libraries and integrate it with the file system in Linux. The voice assistant is capable of understanding natural language and executing commands based on the user's voice inputs. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the system and demonstrate that our approach is effective and efficient in managing the file system using voice commands. Our system can enhance the accessibility and usability of the file system in Linux for individuals with disabilities or those who prefer a hands-free approach to file management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a5c8adf536c555305ac2a71487c55f8302f59913b0c69065d1a052238190d27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
