{"title":"Witness for resolution: post-conflict quadratic affiliation in semi-free ranging pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/70/2/233/7143730?rss=1","date":1682553600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In social mammals, post-conflict resolution can involve the reunion of former opponents (reconciliation), spontaneous/solicited post-conflict affiliation of a third party with either opponent (triadic contacts), and affiliation between other individuals (hereafter bystanders; quadratic contacts). Quadratic contacts—possibly informing complex cognitive abilities—have been neglected in post-conflict studies. We investigated quadratic affiliation in semi-free ranging pigs <span>Sus scrofa</span>, at the ethical farm Parva-Domus (Cavagnolo, Italy). Kinship was known. We collected behavioral data on adult pigs (<span>n =</span> 104) via video recordings (43 h) followed by video analyses. Affiliative and anxiety behaviors between bystanders were collected under post-conflict (PC; following a conflict between non-bystanders) and matched-control (MC; no conflict) conditions. Quadratic affiliation was present in pigs, as bystanders affiliated more in PC than MC, and such affiliation was followed by a decrease in the anxiety behaviors of both the interacting bystanders. Thus, quadratic contacts may be partly aimed at reducing one’s own anxiety (intrinsic regulation). Quadratic affiliation was highest between closely related bystanders, which suggests that such affiliation may be most effective when close kin is involved. Quadratic affiliation was lowest after reconciliation and spontaneous triadic contacts. This suggests that direct peacemaking between opponents and spontaneous triadic contacts with close kin may most likely replace quadratic affiliation. Hence, pigs can be influenced by the negative events that affect other pigs—but not themselves—and their response may be modulated by social factors. Such non-random quadratic affiliation may point toward the presence of elements of social appraisal abilities in pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Current Zoology Current Issue","siteHash":"e7197aa0e79464a44186f16a81d9758c42b85acdd06820e73429ff264fcd9f66","entryHash":"a664c57a45cb601cef940dbf5db810aa527a248b76e94fa4536865cfa5f294b2","category":"Environment"}
