{"title":"Image-Guided Mesenchymal Stem Cell Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS) Radionucleotide Therapy for Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0690/v1","date":1720496715000,"content":"Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive, invasive, and growth-factor-independent grade IV glioma. Survival following the diagnosis is generally poor, with a median survival of approximately 15 months, and it is considered the most aggressive and lethal central nervous system tumor. Conventional treatments based on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy only delay progression, and death is inevitable. Malignant glioma cells are resistant to traditional therapies, potentially due to a subpopulation of glioma stem cells that are invasive and capable of rapid regrowth. Methods: Systematic retrieval of information was performed on PubMed. Specified keywords were used in PubMed and the articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals were associated with brain GBM cancer, sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Additionally, the words 'radionuclide therapy', 'radioiodine', 'iodine-131', 'molecular imaging', 'gene therapy', and 'translational imaging' were used. Other keywords such as â€˜glioblastoma', 'targeted', 'theranostic', 'symporter', 'virus', 'solid tumor', 'combined therapy', 'pituitary', or 'plasmid' were also used in appropriate literature databases and search engines. 19 articles were found in this search on Mesenchymal Stem Cell Sodium Iodide Symporter and GBM. \\ These articles were from the years 2000 to 2024. Appropriate studies were isolated, and important information from each of them was understood and entered into a database from which the information was used in this article. Results: For as long as they express functional NIS, mesenchymal stem cells systemically repress T and B cells; however, after that, they are largely replaced by mesenchymal stem cells generated from embryonic stem cells that are functionally competent. As a result of their natural capacity to identify malignancies, MSC are employed as tumor therapy vehicles. Because MSCs may be transplanted in several methods, they have been proposed as ideal vehicles for NIS gene transfer. Conclusion: Non-invasive imaging-based detection of glioma stem cells presents an alternate means to monitor the tumor and diagnose and evaluate recurrence. The sodium iodine symporter gene is a specific gene in a variety of human thyroid disease that functions to move iodine into the cell. In recent years, an increasing number of studies related to the sodium iodide symporter gene have been reported in a variety of tumors and as therapeutic vectors for imaging and therapy. Gene therapy and nuclear medicine therapy for GBM provide a new direction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1eec10496f394ba676c39a71ab4a1208ce4a28a31b97b86706931d58e4db9996","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
