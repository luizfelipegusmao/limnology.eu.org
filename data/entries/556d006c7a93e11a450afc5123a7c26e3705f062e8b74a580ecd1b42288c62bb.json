Here’s how to report it","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/234622/how-to-report-wrong-locations-in-apple-maps.html","date":1632654000000,"content":"<div>\n<section><div></div></section><p>No map is perfect; all are approximations. But it’s galling to business owners when a modern digital map lists the wrong address, has incorrect business hours, or even says the business is closed when it’s still open—a tremendous concern right now for struggling enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people email Mac 911 asking for help with this when customers can’t find them, or, recently, when an address listed offered a dangerous turnoff that wasn’t the main entrance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Clarification: When people find the Mac 911 email address they think we’re Apple. “Mac 911? That must be help!” We do aim to try. Apple doesn’t offer support via direct email.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Maps offers a correction feature that’s changed and expanded slightly in recent releases for iOS/iPadOS and macOS. You don’t have to be a business owner to suggest changes or request a correction. Mistaken addresses and routes of course affect homeowners and renters, too, as well as non-profits, schools, and other organizations. (Google Maps years ago placed my house four miles west for about six months, which was a constant problem for deliveries, service people, and parents trying to bring their kids over for playdates and birthday parties.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the steps below to report errors or add places that aren’t listed. Note that human beings do review the additions and changes; they’re not made higgledy-piggledy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(If you don’t have access to an Apple device or don’t want to use a Maps app to report, you can use <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/3lXTnhP&amp;xcust=1-1-234622-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a little-known form to report the problem</a>. Apple also says you can call their helpline, AppleCare (1-800-APLCARE), to report map problems, though I know no one who has.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Correct and add in iOS/iPadOS</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>To report an issue with a location in iOS 15, use the three-dot menu.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Launch Maps.
