{"title":"Live and Dead Clostridium butyricum GKB7 Diminish Osteoarthritis Pain and Progression in Preclinical Animal Model","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24367?af=R","date":1729043194000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease primarily affecting the elderly. It is characterized by the progressive decline of joint cartilage and alterations in the underlying bone. Several probiotic strains have exhibited immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we examined the functions of live and dead <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> GKB7 (GKB7-L and GKB7-D) in a preclinical anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-enhanced OA procedure. Oral administration of GKB7-L and GKB7-D ameliorated ACLT-induced bone pain as assessed by weight-bearing behavioral testing but did not affect body weight. Micro-computed tomography (CT) results showed that GKB7-L and GKB7-D diminished ACLT-induced bone destruction and loss. GKB7-L and GKB7-D-enriched therapies also reduced ACLT-induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as the chondrolytic factor matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, leading to inhibition of aggrecan and collagen type II degradation and thereby blocking cartilage breakdown. We therefore suggest that oral supplementation with GKB7-L or GKB7-D can be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of OA.</p>","author":"Li‐Chai Chen, \nYen‐You Lin, \nYou‐Shan Tsai, \nChin‐Chu Chen, \nTzu‐Ching Chang, \nHsien‐Te Chen, \nChin‐Jung Hsu, \nChih‐Hsin Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"fc0b8c39e96e6dbc461f4955bfc928d4fde843f2fcfbcd32465d4a766f23297d","category":"Environment"}
