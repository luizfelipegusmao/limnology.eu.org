{"title":"Improving Crops Using Omics Databases of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis Thaliana) and Other Model Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1057/v1","date":1726231904000,"content":"Arabidopsis and other model plants can help improve crops by providing a reference framework for assembling omics data from plants. Arabidopsis is extensively studied and has a well-curated and annotated genome, making it an excellent reference organism for comparative analysis. When there is no reference genome of the organism being investigated, using the genome of Arabidopsis may be an option thanks to the extensive knowledge we have about it. Crop improvement can help to increase crop yields, improve crop quality, and enhance resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses. It can also help to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, which can have negative impacts on the environment and human health. Therefore, crop improvement is essential to ensure food security and sustainability in the face of global challenges such as climate change, land degradation, and water scarcity. The assembly process of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data from plants using carefully selected information on Arabidopsis can lead to a deeper understanding of organisms and their potential for genetic improvement for crops. However, the successful integration of data requires expertise and experience to design more effective and precise crop improvement strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9239c6ee15689c9d60abeb6790c1d06fafd8294d8c1c89800a1a26d12e22211f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
