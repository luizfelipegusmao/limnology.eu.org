{"title":"The impact of official recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical activity and business turnover of manual therapists in Sweden–The CAMP cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308945","date":1723816800000,"content":"<p>by Emmanuel Aboagye, Eva Skillgate, Nathan Weiss, Iben Axén</p>\r\nBackground <p>This study examined manual therapy business owners’ perception of official recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on their clinics’ economic performance, including clinic activity hours and business turnover.</p> Materials and methods <p>In a longitudinal study design, data were collected in November 2021 (baseline), and after three months, six months, and 12 months. Participants were manual therapists who were business owners. A growth curve model was used to analyze differences in clinical activity trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between perceived disruptions in business and turnover. Qualitative text analysis was used to examine participants’ responses to open-ended questions concerning economic measures taken to sustain their business during the pandemic.</p> Results <p>This study of 443 manual therapy business owners found that clinics were initially active with minimal variation, but activity changed following COVID-19 recommendations. Business owners perceived that the disruptions had no significant impact on turnover during the initial stages of the official recommendations. Economic support and the previous decrease in turnover increased the likelihood of experiencing a decreased turnover at 12 months. Business owners implemented cost-cutting measures and diversified income sources to navigate COVID-19 challenges and sustain their businesses.</p> Conclusion <p>The official recommendations in Sweden had an impact on manual therapists’ businesses as the COVID-19 pandemic lingered. Some business owners were concerned at the early stages about lower turnover but showed financial resilience by cutting costs and finding new revenue sources to overcome COVID-19 challenges.</p>","author":"Emmanuel Aboagye","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"99af668f693f873663245c24ed723f090f77b3348c25c8855d5381801fc6275c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
