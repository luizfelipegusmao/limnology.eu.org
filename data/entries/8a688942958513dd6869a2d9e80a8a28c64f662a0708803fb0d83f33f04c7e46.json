{"title":"DLCAS: A Deep Learning-Based CPR Action Standardization Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2102/v1","date":1717143720000,"content":"In emergency situations, ensuring standardized Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) actions is crucial. However, current Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) lack methods to determine whether CPR actions are performed correctly, leading to inconsistent CPR quality. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method called Deep Learning-based CPR Action Standardization (DLCAS). This method involves three parts. First, it detects correct posture using OpenPose to recognize skeletal points. Second, it identifies a marker wristband with our CPR-Detection algorithm and measures compression depth, count and frequency using a depth algorithm. Finally, we optimize the algorithm for edge devices to enhance real-time processing speed. Extensive experiments on our custom dataset have shown that the CPR-Detection algorithm achieves a mAP0.5 of 97.04%, while reducing parameters to 0.20M and FLOPs to 132.15K. In a complete CPR operation procedure, the depth measurement solution achieves an accuracy of 90% with a margin of error less than 1 cm, while the count and frequency measurements achieve 98% accuracy with a margin of error less than 2 counts. Our method meets the real-time requirements in medical scenarios, and the processing speed on edge devices have increased from 8fps to 25fps.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a688942958513dd6869a2d9e80a8a28c64f662a0708803fb0d83f33f04c7e46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
