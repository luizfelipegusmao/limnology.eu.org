{"title":"Towards Synthetic, Physical Fingerprint Targets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1221/v1","date":1710931688000,"content":"Biometric fingerprint identification hinges on the reliability of its sensors, however, calibrating and standardizing these sensors poses significant challenges, particularly in regard to repeatability and data diversity. To tackle these issues, we propose methodologies for fabricating synthetic 3D fingerprint targets, or phantoms, that closely emulate real human fingerprints. These phantoms enable the precise evaluation and validation of fingerprint sensors under controlled and repeatable conditions. Our research employs laser engraving, 3D printing, and CNC machining techniques, utilizing different materials. We assess the phantoms' fidelity to synthetic fingerprint patterns, intra-class variability, and interoperability across different manufacturing methods. The findings demonstrate that a combination of laser engraving or CNC machining with silicone casting produces finger-like shaped phantoms with high accuracy and consistency for rolled fingerprint recordings. For slap recordings, direct laser engraving of flat silicone targets excels and in the contactless fingerprint sensor setting, 3D printing and silicone filling provides the most favorable attributes. Our work enables a comprehensive, method-independent comparison of various fabrication methodologies, offering a unique perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This facilitates a broader understanding of fingerprint recognition system validation and performance assessment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"533d0e2adfb5557383dc5e8051230eab82133dd41fe0bfdebecc5033ef43a21b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
