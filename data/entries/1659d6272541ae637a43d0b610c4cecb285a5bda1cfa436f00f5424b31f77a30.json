The new species can be distinguished from all congeners by having 29 or fewer (vs. 33 or more) total vertebrae. It can further be distinguished from all congeners, except <i>Parauchenoglanis zebratus</i> Sithole et al., 2023 and <i>Parauchenoglanis ngamensis</i> (Boulenger 1911), by having 13 or 14 (vs. 16 or more) pre-anal vertebrae. The species is endemic to the Mfimi River basin, where it has been collected mainly in blackwater tributaries.</p>","author":"Myriam Y. Modimo, \nMaxwell J. Bernt, \nRaoul J. C.
