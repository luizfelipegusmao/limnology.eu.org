{"title":"Change Through Play, Rethinking Masculinity: An Intervention to Gun Violence in the United States","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0297/v1","date":1717594314000,"content":"This scholarly article introduces the \"Change Through Play: Rethinking Masculinity\" program, a potential intervention designed to address gun violence in the United States by targeting its societal roots, particularly through the lens of gender socialization. The program focuses on transforming childrenâ€™s, particularly young boys', perceptions of masculinity away from gun violence by influencing the types of toys they play with. By promoting non-violent play, the initiative aims to foster a future generation less inclined to engage in gun violence. This community-interactive and educational approach emphasizes the importance of evidence-based interventions that respect community values and cultural dynamics. The program employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to evaluate its effectiveness. The program highlights the necessity of sustained, collective action to transform the entrenched practices and beliefs that perpetuate violence, ultimately striving for a society that prioritizes peace, justice, and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68edc8e67744f8ab6c334fbe4330591afcb33c051151cbe9b4d326524941e983","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
