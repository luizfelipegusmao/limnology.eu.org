{"title":"Chromosome ends initiate homologous chromosome pairing during rice meiosis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2617/7628145?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>During meiotic prophase I, chromosomes undergo large-scale dynamics to allow homologous chromosome pairing, prior to which chromosome ends attach to the inner nuclear envelope and form a chromosomal bouquet. Chromosome pairing is crucial for homologous recombination and accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. However, the specific mechanism by which homologous chromosomes recognize each other is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the process of homologous chromosome pairing during early prophase I of meiosis in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) using pooled oligo probes specific to an entire chromosome or chromosome arm. We revealed that chromosome pairing begins from both ends and extends toward the center from early zygotene through late zygotene. Genetic analysis of both trisomy and autotetraploidy also showed that pairing initiation is induced by both ends of a chromosome. However, healed ends that lack the original terminal regions on telocentric and acrocentric chromosomes cannot initiate homologous chromosome pairing, even though they may still enter the telomere clustering region at the bouquet stage. Furthermore, a chromosome that lacks the distal parts on both sides loses the ability to pair with other intact chromosomes. Thus, the native ends of chromosomes play a crucial role in initiating homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and likely have a substantial impact on genome differentiation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"bc181fd2199e9f2bb31b5a830d699fb52d38eec1a3b37a484e0d3b6fbfef3055","category":"Environment"}
