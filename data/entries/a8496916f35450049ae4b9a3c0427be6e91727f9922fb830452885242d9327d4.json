We determined the prevalence and factors associated with HAV susceptibility among cisgender MSM on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in Northeastern Brazil. From September 30, 2021 to June 19, 2023, 282 cisgender MSM receiving HIV PrEP were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and clinical information were collected. Blood samples were collected for screening of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and serum samples were tested for IgM and total anti-HAV antibodies. Non-reactive results for total anti-HAV antibodies were found in 106 of 282 (37.6%) participants. Factors associated with HAV susceptibility included age &lt;30 years (prevalence ratio [PR]: 2.02; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.61–2.53), having health insurance (PR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.19–1.64), sex only with cisgender men (PR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.23–1.89), non-steady partner (PR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01–1.43) and no lifetime history of STIs (PR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.03–1.53). Identifying clinical correlates of HAV susceptibility in key populations is a fundamental step towards development of public policy focused on prevention, especially following the recent hepatitis A outbreak in Brazil.","author":"Hareton Teixeira Vechi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a8496916f35450049ae4b9a3c0427be6e91727f9922fb830452885242d9327d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
