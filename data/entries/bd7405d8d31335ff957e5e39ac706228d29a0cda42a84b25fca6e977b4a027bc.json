{"title":"3D Modelling of HPV-Related Tumors and Their Microenvironment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0798/v1","date":1725957751000,"content":"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers account for a large percentage of cancers. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex structure and contributes significantly to tumor development, progression, and invasion. The TME is particularly pronounced in HPV-related cancers and HPV is known to influence the TME. In cancer research, there is an urgent need for new models to deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and to facilitate the development of innovative therapies. In this context, 3D cell culture has emerged as a promising method in cancer research, that offers significant potential compared to conventional approaches. 3D modelling can produce results that are more consistent with clinical outcomes without the ethical concerns and problems of animal models. In this review, our aim is to discuss the tumor microenvironment in HPV-related cancers and demonstrate the importance of advancing 3D cell culture models for this purpose.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd7405d8d31335ff957e5e39ac706228d29a0cda42a84b25fca6e977b4a027bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
