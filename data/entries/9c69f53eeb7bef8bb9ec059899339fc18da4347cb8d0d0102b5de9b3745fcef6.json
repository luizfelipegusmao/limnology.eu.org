{"title":"Use of tobacco and other illicit drugs among adolescent boys and young men in Kampala, Uganda: A result of low parental attention?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297163","date":1711461600000,"content":"<p>by Alex Mulyowa, Tonny Ssekamatte, Steven N. Kabwama, John Ssenkusu, Rhoda K. Wanyenze, Joseph K. B. Matovu</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Although the use of illicit drugs is common among young people, limited data exists on the use of illicit drugs among adolescent boys and young men (ABYM). We assessed the use of tobacco, marijuana and khat among ABYM to inform the design of harm-reduction interventions.</p> Methods <p>This secondary analysis uses data from a formative study conducted among 2,500 ABYM across the five divisions of Kampala between July and August 2020. Survey questions were adopted from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey and Global School-based Student Health Survey. We computed proportions of ABYM that had ever used any form of tobacco or marijuana or khat in the past year and the proportion that had used any of these products in the past 30 days (i.e. ‘current users’). In a sub-group analysis, we assessed if any patterns existed between ABYM’s use of illicit drugs and selected parental attention attributes.</p> Results <p>Of 2,500 ABYM, 47.3% (n = 1,182) were aged 15–19 years. Overall, 16.4% (n = 410) reported past-year use of tobacco products while 11.6% (n = 289) and 10.5% (n = 263) reported past-year use of marijuana and khat, respectively. Current use of any illicit drugs was higher among past-year khat (46%, n = 133) and marijuana users (36.9%, n = 97) than past-year tobacco users (4%, n = 17). Current use of any illicit drugs was higher among out-of-school than in-school ABYM and increased with increasing age and education levels. However, parental attention was lower among out-of-school than in-school ABYM and decreased with increasing age and education levels.</p> Conclusion <p>Use of illicit drugs is common among ABYM and increased with age and education levels but parental attention among current illicit drug users decreased with increasing age and education levels. These findings suggest that interventions intended to improve parental attention among illicit drug users may help to reduce the prevalence of illicit drug use among ABYM.</p>","author":"Alex Mulyowa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9c69f53eeb7bef8bb9ec059899339fc18da4347cb8d0d0102b5de9b3745fcef6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
