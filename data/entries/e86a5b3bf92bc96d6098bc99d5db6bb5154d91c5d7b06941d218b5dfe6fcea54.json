The level of parents' knowledge about proper nutrition and substances added to food is therefore crucial in promoting appropriate dietary choices in children and adolescents in order to prevent diet-related diseases. Objectives: Assessment of the consumption of snack foods by children and adolescents according to the surveyed parents and analysis of parents' knowledge about additional substances in food. Methods: The study was conducted among 129 parents of students from selected primary schools. The research tool was an original survey questionnaire consisting of 24 questions. Survey interviews were conducted with parents during meetings at schools. Statistical analysis was performed using the Pearson ch2 test, the significance level was set to p&amp;lt;0.05. Results: Parents most often indicated sweets, confectionery products and sweetened drinks (25%) and vegetables or fruit (21%) as the form of snack for their children. 46% of children and adolescents drank sweetened drinks at least once a day. Parents had an average level of knowledge about food additives. Significant correlations were found between the level of knowledge of parents of school-age children about food additives and their level of education. Parents' knowledge and education did not significantly influence the level of snack consumption by their children. Children's eating behavior should be considered unsatisfactory. Conclusions: Research has shown the need for parents to be educated about food additives and to pay more attention to reading food labels so that they can reliably prepare their children to make the right food choices. Measures should be implemented to improve the eating habits of children and adolescents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e86a5b3bf92bc96d6098bc99d5db6bb5154d91c5d7b06941d218b5dfe6fcea54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
