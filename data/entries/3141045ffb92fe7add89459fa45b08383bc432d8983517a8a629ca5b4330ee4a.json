In the present study, a new method based on Raman spectroscopy was developed for assessing the quality changes in dried shrimp (<i>Parapenaeopsis hardwickii</i>) during storage.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A high-quality Raman spectrum of astaxanthin (AST) was obtained from the third abdominal segment of dried shrimp. The intensity ratio (I1520/I1446) of the band from 1520 cm<sup>−1</sup> to that at 1446 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which was ascribed to AST and protein/lipid, respectively, was calculated. I1520/I1446 can probe AST degradation in dried shrimp during storage at both 37 and 4 °C and further reflect quality changes of dried shrimp, as indicated by indices including total volatile basic nitrogen, pH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Compared to conventional methods, the proposed method avoids complex and time-consuming preprocessing and provides significant advantages including cost-effectiveness and rapid detection. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yan Bai, \nYilin Lu, \nPeng Yang, \nYicheng Ding, \nYadan Zheng, \nZhigang Ke, \nShulai Liu, \nYuting Ding, \nXuxia Zhou","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3141045ffb92fe7add89459fa45b08383bc432d8983517a8a629ca5b4330ee4a","category":"Environment"}
