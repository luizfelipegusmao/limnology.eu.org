{"title":"The Beneficial Effects of Nordic Walking Training Combined with Time Restricted Eating 14/24 in Women with Abnormal Body Composition Depend on the Application Period","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0479/v1","date":1712587029000,"content":"The aim of the study was to assess the impact of two lengths of Nordic walking (NW) training interventions combined with time restricted eating (TRE) on improving body composition parameters, lipid profile, and levels of selected adipokines in women with disrupted body mass. Overweight and obese women (n=55, age: 21-85) were recruited. Four groups were selected: 6 weeks (SG6, n=13) and 12 weeks intervention (SG12, n=13); and two control groups: CON6 (n=13); and CON12 (n=13). The training sessions took place 3 times a week (60 minutes each) and were conducted outdoor under the supervision of professional coach. The training intensity was determined individually. The extended NW program combined with TRE induced a significant weight reduction in SG12 by 1.96 kg (p=0.010) and fat tissue by 1.64 kg (p=0.05). The proposed interventions did not affect LBM, TBW [kg], VFA and lipid profile. The LDL/HDL ratio changed with small size effect. Leptin concentration differed between groups (p=0.006), but not over time. For resistin, the differentiating factor was time (p=0.019, with lower results observed after the intervention). The change in leptin concentration was negatively correlated with its baseline concentration. Extended to 12 weeks, this intervention allows for an improvement in body composition. Neither 6 nor 12 weeks of training and fasting affected the lipoprotein profile.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81cba143998209e293db19bf0a0d76d584597501fc43baf9ae1c73e9b7f41f1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
