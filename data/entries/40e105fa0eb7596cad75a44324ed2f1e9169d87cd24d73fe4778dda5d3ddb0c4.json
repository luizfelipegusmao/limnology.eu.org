{"title":"On the Feasibility of Deep GeothermalWells Using Numerical Reservoir Simulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0552/v1","date":1718022640000,"content":"This study examines geothermal energy extraction potential from the basement rock within the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin, focusing on flow performance and heat extraction efficiency of different geothermal well configurations. It specifically compares U-Shaped, V-Shaped, Inclined V-Shaped, and Pipe-in-Pipe configurations against Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) setups. Through numerical modeling, we evaluated the thermal behavior of these systems under various operational scenarios and fracture conditions. Results suggest that while closed-loop systems offer moderate temperature increases, EGS configurations show substantial potential for high-temperature extraction. This underscores the importance of evaluating well configurations in complex geological settings like the DJ Basin. The insights from this study aid in strategic geothermal energy planning and development, marking significant advancements in geothermal technology and setting a foundation for future explorations and optimizations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40e105fa0eb7596cad75a44324ed2f1e9169d87cd24d73fe4778dda5d3ddb0c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
