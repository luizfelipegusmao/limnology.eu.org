The RRNPPA family is the prevalent QS systems in <i>Bacillota</i> and mediating communication through secreted oligopeptides, which are processed into active pheromones by extracellular proteases. Notably, in several cases the propeptides show the presence of multiple putative pheromones within their sequences, which has been proposed as a mechanism to diversify peptide-receptor specificity and potentially facilitate new functions. However, neither the processes governing the maturation of propeptides containing multiple pheromones, nor their functional significance has been evaluated. Here, using 2 Rap systems from bacteriophages infecting <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> that exhibit different types of pheromone duplication in their propeptides, we investigate the maturation process and the molecular and functional activities of the produced pheromones. Our results reveal that distinct maturation processes generate multiple mature pheromones, which bind to receptors with varying affinities but produce identical structural and biological responses. These findings add additional layers in the complexity of QS communication and regulation, opening new possibilities for microbial social behaviors, highlighting the intricate nature of bacterial interactions and adaptation.","author":"Alonso Felipe-Ruiz","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"ebdad1a3f60b254ad46525a21f0895970a55feff7f2e0f131c4c58199fff197f","category":"Environment"}
