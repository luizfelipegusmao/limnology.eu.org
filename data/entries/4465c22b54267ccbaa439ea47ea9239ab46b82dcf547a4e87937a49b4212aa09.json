{"title":"Effect of paternal-maternal parenting styles on college students’ internet addiction of different genders: The mediating role of life satisfaction","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303554","date":1715695200000,"content":"<p>by Zixin Liu, Hui Cheng, Hexu Guan, Xi Yang, Zi Chen</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to understand the current situation of paternal-maternal parenting style, life satisfaction, and internet addiction among college students and explored the influence of paternal-maternal parenting styles and life satisfaction on the internet addiction of male and female college students. A questionnaire survey was administered to 967 college students in China. Life satisfaction partially mediated the effect of the paternal-maternal parenting styles on the internet addiction among college students. However, this mediating role completely varied by gender, and the dimensions of parental styles also had different effects. For male college students, life satisfaction mediated the two dimensions of parenting styles (the father’s emotional warmth, the father’s overprotection) and internet addiction; the mother’s emotional warmth directly related to the internet addiction. Among females, life satisfaction played a partial mediating role between two dimensions of parenting styles (the father’s emotional warmth, the mother’s interference and protection) and internet addiction. the father’s punitiveness and over-involvement were directly related to female students’ internet addiction. The study reveals that the mediating effect of life satisfaction on parenting styles and internet addiction among college students is influenced by gender, and the relationship between different parenting styles and internet addiction also varies. These findings indicate that paying attention to the role of the family, especially the parenting style of fathers, is crucial for preventing internet addiction in the future. Prevention and intervention should be treated differently for male and female students.","author":"Zixin Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4465c22b54267ccbaa439ea47ea9239ab46b82dcf547a4e87937a49b4212aa09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
