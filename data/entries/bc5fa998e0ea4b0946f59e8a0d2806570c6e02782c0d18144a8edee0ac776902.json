{"title":"The Ideal Model on the Cosmic Continuum: A Unified Mechanism on Cosmic and Material Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2046/v1","date":1719634658000,"content":"The fundamental divergence in foundation of modern physics lies in the incompatibility between quantum theory and relativity. This study created a new mathematical tools, proposed the dark particle hypothesis and new equivalent principle, and established an ideal model on the cosmic continuum. According to this study, any cosmic system is a continuum composed of existence continuum relative to the wavelength of bosons energy waves and its dimension continuum, four fundamental interactions form a continuum relative to the wavelength of corresponding boson energy waves, respectively, the elementary particles and their existence fields are the basic units of cosmic continuum, the existence field of an existence body is equivalent to its dimension field, dark matter is a dark mass body composed of dark particles, singularity is a dark matter celestial body formed by collapse of black hole, and the singularity and its existence field constitute an existence continuum of singularity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc5fa998e0ea4b0946f59e8a0d2806570c6e02782c0d18144a8edee0ac776902","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
