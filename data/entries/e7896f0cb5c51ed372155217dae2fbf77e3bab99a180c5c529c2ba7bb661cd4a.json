{"title":"Green Finance in Property Assessed Clean Energy Programs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2218/v1","date":1722333103000,"content":"Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs finance energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements in residential and commercial properties with a special tax assessment added to property taxes. The paper surveys the literature and documents the quantitative estimates of environmental and economic benefits. The paper extends to discuss the securitization of PACE loans. The issuance of PACE green bonds frees up capacity for more PACE improvements. In addition, we summarize the concerns raised after the programs have been implemented. Those concerns include consumer protection, audit after program implementation, and lien-related risks for lenders. We highlight the challenges and discuss measures to continue to grow PACE financing. The success of PACE programs will contribute to mitigating climate change and to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7896f0cb5c51ed372155217dae2fbf77e3bab99a180c5c529c2ba7bb661cd4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
