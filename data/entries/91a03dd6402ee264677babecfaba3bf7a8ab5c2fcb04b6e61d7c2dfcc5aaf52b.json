The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal illumination level for visual function and visual comfort of schoolchildren with low vision and the relationship between them. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess five levels of illumination ranging from 125 lux to 2000 lux to determine the optimal illumination for visual functions and visual comfort in schoolchildren with low vision from a special education school for blind in Malaysia. Purposive sampling was done to recruit forty-two schoolchildren with low vision for this study. Visual functions assessed were visual acuity, measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study LogMAR chart at distance and near, contrast sensitivity (CS) measured using the Pelli-Robson chart at distance and the Mars CS chart at near. Reading speed was determined using the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Malay Language Related Word Reading Text test chart. Subjects were asked to rate their visual comfort using a validated questionnaire at the end of each measurement of visual functions and reading speed for the different illumination levels. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity at distance and near, visual comfort and reading speed improved significantly with increase in illumination levels (p&lt;0.05). However, the interaction between illumination level and level of low vision was not significant (p&gt;0.05). Visual comfort was significantly associated with visual function (p&lt;0.05), while direct association between visual comfort and illumination level was not significant (p&gt;0.05). Optimal illumination for improvement of visual function, reading speed and visual comfort range from 276.67 lux to 701.59 lux. Majority of the schoolchildren with low vision had improved visual function, reading speed and visual comfort with increased illumination. Illumination of at least 600 lux is recommended for maximum visual functioning and visual comfort of schoolchildren with low vision.","author":"Pui Theng Yong","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"91a03dd6402ee264677babecfaba3bf7a8ab5c2fcb04b6e61d7c2dfcc5aaf52b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
