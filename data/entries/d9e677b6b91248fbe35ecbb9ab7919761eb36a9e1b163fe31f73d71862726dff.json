{"title":"3 The impact of early-life cecal microbiota transplantation on injurious behaviors in egg-laying chickens","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/200/7665083?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Injurious behaviors in laying hens are a critical issue facing the poultry egg industry. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota influences host brain function and behavioral characteristics in humans and various animals. In laying hens, it has been reported that injurious behaviors (such as aggression, feather pecking and cannibalism) are associated with dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. To further interrogate the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis on bird behavior, we used two inbred layer chicken lines, 63 and 72 (line 72 displays more aggressive behavior), and transferred pooled cecal contents from either line to day of hatch chicks. Cecal microbiota transplantation (CMT) from each line was conducted once daily, by gavage, from d 1 to 10, then boosted once weekly from wk 3 to 5. We hypothesized that the cecal microbiota composition and animal behavior in recipient birds would be similar to that of their donor animals because of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Microbial communities were compared using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, behavior was recorded in home cages as well as in paired aggression tests, and physiological measurements were taken from brain tissue and blood to measure levels of neurotransmitters and immune function. When examining the differences in the donor birds, hypothalamic serotonin and tryptophan concentrations were greater for line 63 compared with line 72 birds (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Plasma corticosterone, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios, and central norepinephrine concentrations were less for line 63 birds (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Cecal microbial diversity was not statistically different between the lines, but many bacterial taxa were differentially abundant between the two lines. After cecal transplantation, 63-CMT (recipient) birds displayed less aggressive behavior with a greater hypothalamic serotonergic activity at wk 5, similar to donor birds. Correspondingly, two amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to <span>Lachnospiraceae</span> and <span>one Ruminococcaceae</span> UCG-005 ASV were positively correlated with the concentrations of brain tryptophan and serotonin, respectively. Along with greater aggression, 72-CMT birds seemed to have greater physical growth traits (increased body weight, ileal villus/crypt; <span>P</span> â‰¤ 0.05), but decreased concentrations of brain norepinephrine and dopamine, and the greatest ileal serotonin turnover in the ileum at wk 5 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). ASVs belonging to Mollicutes RF39 and GCA-900066225 in 72-CMT birds were negatively correlated with the brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) at wk 5, and one Bacteroides ASV was negatively correlated with plasma serotonin at wk 16. Meanwhile, 63-CMT birds potentially had better gut health and immune function (greater concentrations of ileal mucosal secretory IgA, plasma IL-10; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). These results suggest linkages among serotonergic activity, stress response, innate immunity, and gut microbiota populations and that CMT could be a novel strategy for reducing aggressive behavior through regulating signaling along the microbiota-gut-brain axis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d9e677b6b91248fbe35ecbb9ab7919761eb36a9e1b163fe31f73d71862726dff","category":"Environment"}
