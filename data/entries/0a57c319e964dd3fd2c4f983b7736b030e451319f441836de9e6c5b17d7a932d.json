{"title":"Afromontane forests and human impact after the African Humid Period: wood charcoal from the Sodicho rock shelter, SW Ethiopian highlands","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00334-023-00977-3","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The SW highlands of Ethiopia are a key component in the evolution of modern humans. Yet, palaeoecological studies, essential to understand past human-vegetation relationships, are almost inexistent in this region. In this paper, we present an anthracological study of the Sodicho rock shelter, located at 1,930 m a.s.l. in the SW Ethiopian Afromontane forest zone, reconstructing the past woody vegetation since the end of the African Humid Period (ca. 5,000 cal <span>bp</span>). Our results show that the vegetation around the rock shelter from ca. 4,750 to 1,750 cal <span>bp</span> was an ecotone between Afromontane forest and wooded grasslands of the lowlands, maintained open by the use of fire, although the climatic conditions were favourable for closed forest. The charcoal assemblage also demonstrates strong wood selection, with <em>Syzygium guineense</em>, <em>Acacia</em> and Proteaceae as the preferred taxa, even during a volcanic event when human occupation had been assumed to be absent. We therefore suggest that the rock shelter might have been visited more continuously than previously thought. Finally, under less intense occupation activities from ca. 1,700 to 300 cal <span>bp</span>, forest taxa became comparatively more dominant than before, as documented in the charcoal record. This demonstrates that the forest can recover under reduced human impact. The fact that the Afromontane forest is resilient is of utmost importance, indicating that reforestation is still possible despite the strong agricultural and demographic pressures the Ethiopian highlands are currently facing.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"0a57c319e964dd3fd2c4f983b7736b030e451319f441836de9e6c5b17d7a932d","category":"Environment"}
