{"title":"Differences in fluctuating asymmetry and liver mass in a population of amphibians affected by the rupture of the Fundão dam, the largest environmental disaster in Brazil","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05511-8","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The Fundão dam collapse in 2015 resulted in the largest environmental disaster in Brazil’s history with the release of tons of ore tailings mainly in aquatic environments. Amphibians are susceptible to contamination and they typically develop in aquatic and terrestrial habitats, making them useful indicators of environmental impact. Nonetheless, the effects of mining on amphibians are much overlooked compared with other waterborne organisms. We examined the impact of the disaster on the generalist treefrog <em>Boana albopunctata</em> (Spix, 1824) by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and liver mass in specimens collected in southeastern Brazil, before the disaster (2014) and at two time points after (2018 and 2022). Specimens collected in 2022 had lower FA levels in their tympanic area, which indicates the selection of individuals with more symmetrical eardrums across generations. We found liver hypertrophy after the accident, indicating the resilience of this biotransformative organ after heavy metal exposure but with likely physiological damage. This study is the first to demonstrate the impact of the Fundão dam rupture on an amphibian population living in the affected area. Our findings highlight the diverse impacts of mining on organisms and suggest that studies with amphibians can contribute in comprehending the magnitude of this and similar disasters.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"8e32306917147525ca89e0331f1f92ad50957f59b988dcc06521f3949ce6f6f0","category":"Environment"}
