{"title":"Immunological effects of DNA vaccination and interleukin utilization as an adjuvant in Astyanax lacustris immunized against Ichthyophthirius multifiliis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13979?af=R","date":1723123610000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The increasing significance of the aquaculture sector and commercially valuable species underscores the need to develop alternatives for controlling diseases such as <i>Ichthyophthirius multifiliis</i>-induced ichthyophthiriasis. This ciliated protozoan parasite threatens nearly all freshwater fish species, causing substantial losses in the fishery industry. Despite this, effective large-scale treatments are lacking, emphasizing the necessity of adopting preventive strategies. While the pathogenesis of ichthyophthiriasis and its immune stimulation allows for vaccination strategies, precise adjustments are crucial to ensure the production of an effective vaccine compound. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of immunizing <i>Astyanax lacustris</i> with a genetic vaccine containing IAG52A from <i>I. multifiliis</i> and the molecular adjuvant IL-8 from <i>A. lacustris</i>. Transcript analysis in immunized <i>A. lacustris</i> indicated mRNA production in fish muscles, demonstrating an expression of this mRNA. Fish were divided into five groups, receiving different vaccine formulations, and all groups received a booster dose 14 days after the initial immunization. Samples from vaccinated fish showed increased IL-1β mRNA expression in the spleen within 6 h post the second dose and after 14 days. In the head kidney, IL-1β mRNA expression showed no significant difference at 6 and 24 h but an increase was noted in fish injected with IAG and IAG + IL-8 after 14 days. IL-8 mRNA expression in the spleen and kidney did not significantly differ from the control group. Histological analysis revealed no variation in leukocyte concentration at 6 and 24 h post-vaccination; however, after 14 days, the groups injected with IAG and IAG + IL-8 exhibited a higher leukocyte density at the application sites than the control. The obtained data suggest that the used vaccine is transcribed, indicating its potential to stimulate innate immune response parameters through mRNA cytokine expression and leukocyte migration.</p>","author":"Caroline Munhoz Meira, \nMateus Maldonado Carriero, \nNycolas Levy Pereira, \nPedro Gustavo Macedo Rihs, \nTalita Maria Lázaro, \nNathalia Raissa Alcântara Rocha, \nAntonio Augusto Mendes Maia","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"76f655aef4875ab73dba805ea1604e504145d16c89091d6cd67b23444af88d27","category":"Environment"}
