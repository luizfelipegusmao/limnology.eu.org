{"title":"Ghost Stars in General Relativity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0895/v1","date":1713166747000,"content":"We explore an idea put forward many years ago by Zeldovich and Novikov concerning the existence of compact objects endowed with arbitrarily small mass. The energy-density of such objects, which we call “Ghost stars”, is negative in some regions of the fluid distribution, producing a vanishing total mass. Thus, the interior is matched on the boundary surface to Minkowski space-time. Some exact analytical solutions are exhibited and their properties are analyzed. Observational data that could confirm or dismiss the existence of this kind of stellar object, is commented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccb89a2f0dfa7f4561d9aac7b6c68bb933fa676182fbf2d0604dea81f7e3b0a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
