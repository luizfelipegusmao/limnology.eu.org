{"title":"Application of diceCT to Study the Development of the Zika Virus Infected Mouse Brain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0791/v1","date":1720693092000,"content":"Zika virus (ZIKV) impacts the developing brain. Here a technique was applied to define, in 3D, developmental changes in the brain of ZIKV-infected mice.\nPostnatal day 1 mice were uninfected or ZIKV-infected, then analysed by iodine staining and micro-CT scanning (diffusible iodine contrast enhanced micro-CT; diceCT) at 3-, 6- and 10-days post infection (dpi). Multiple brain regions were visualised using diceCT; olfactory bulb, cerebrum, hippocampus, midbrain, interbrain, and cerebellum, along with the lens and retina of the eye. Brain regions were computationally segmented and quantitated, with increased brain volumes with developmental time in uninfected mice. Conversely, in ZIKV-infected mice, no quantitative differences were seen at 3 or 6 dpi, when there are no clinical signs, but qualitatively, diverse visual defects were identified at 6-10 dpi. By 10 dpi, ZIKV-infected mice had significantly lower body weight and reduced volume of brain regions compared to 10 dpi-uninfected or 6dpi ZIKV-infected mice. Nissl and immunofluorescent Iba1 staining on post-diceCT tissue were successful, but RNA extraction was not.\nThus, diceCT shows utility for detecting both 3D qualitative and quantitative changes in the developing brain of ZIKV-infected mice, with the benefit, post-diceCT, of retaining the ability to apply traditional histology and immunofluorescent analysis to tissue.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"448e9fdd28017006ba4e4651c8aaed0d7cff378250625522be799ee727f9f1d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
