{"title":"Unlocking the Potential of Mannosylerythritol Lipids:  Properties and Industrial Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0958/v1","date":1713182106000,"content":"Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), one of the most promising biosurfactants (BS), are glycolipids produced by yeasts or fungi, with great environmental performance and a high compatibility with the human body. MELs besides working as typical surfactants, can form diverse structures when in the critical aggregation concentration (CAC), reducing the surface tension of water and other solutions, and being stable over a wide range of conditions. Among others, MELs present anti-microbial, antitumor, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, skin and hair repair capacity, which opens possibilities for their use in applications from cosmetics and pharmaceutics to bio-remediation and agriculture. However, their market share is still low when compared to other glycolipids, due to their less developed production process and higher production cost. This re-view gathers information on the potential applications of MELs mentioned on the literature since 1993. Furthermore, it is also explored the current strategies being developed to enhance the market presence of MELs, in parallel with the ones developed for rhamnolipids and sophorolipids.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c5f16f69686189d23b909aab6587e52150d70366b7d397880dc1f8cfe5b0ab8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
