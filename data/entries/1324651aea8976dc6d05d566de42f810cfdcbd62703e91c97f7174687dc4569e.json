{"title":"Qualitative and quantitative determination of xylazine in oral fluid","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/7/482/7713365?rss=1","date":1718841600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Xylazine has emerged in recent years as a dangerous adulterant in illicit fentanyl use, and methods for the detection of xylazine in toxicology panels are still lagging. We developed methods for the screening and quantitation of xylazine in oral fluid (OF), a popular testing medium due to its ease of collection and reflection of presence in blood for many classes of drugs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed for the rapid screening of xylazine directly from the collection device buffer with a cutoff of 1 ng/mL. Solid-phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry facilitated the confirmation and quantification of xylazine as low as 0.1 ng/mL and a dynamic range of 0.1–25 ng/mL. Selectivity, ionization suppression, processed sample stability, and dilution effect were also assessed. The method was validated through the American National Standards Institute/American Academy of Forensic Sciences Standards Board (ANSI/ASB) Standard 036, first edition from 2019, and found to be accurate, precise, and robust. Living human subject OF samples collected within substance use disorder and therapeutic drug monitoring clinics received between September 2023 and January 2024, with the specific request to test for xylazine (<span>n</span> = 57), were screened. Presumptive positive samples were confirmed using the validated method. Xylazine confirmed living human subject OF sample concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 23.3 ng/mL.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"1324651aea8976dc6d05d566de42f810cfdcbd62703e91c97f7174687dc4569e","category":"Environment"}
