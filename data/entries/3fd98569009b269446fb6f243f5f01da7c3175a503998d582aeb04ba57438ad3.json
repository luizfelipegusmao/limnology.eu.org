{"title":"Taking stress with much more than a pinch of salt: osGRF7 regulates salinity resistance in rice through arbutin biosynthesis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2753/7660949?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span>Soil salinity is a major challenge for agricultural crops as it causes a severe reduction in growth, compromising biomass, seed size, and grain yield (<a href=\"#koae139-B5\">van Zelm et al. 2020</a>). To adapt to this salt stress, plants enhance the synthesis of metabolites that act as osmoprotectants (<a href=\"#koae139-B2\">Fatima et al. 2021</a>). For example, arbutin (also known as beta-arbutin) is a metabolite synthesized by some plant species that has been proposed to contribute to abiotic stress tolerance due to its antioxidant properties and ability to stabilize membranes (<a href=\"#koae139-B4\">Oliver et al. 2001</a>). How certain metabolites such as arbutin are connected to growth regulation is still a matter of research, but some molecular players have already been proposed. The <span>GROWTH REGULATOR FACTOR</span> (<span>GRF</span>) clade is a transcription factor family present in several plant species. Together with its cofactors, the <span>GRF-INTERACTING FACTORS</span> (<span>GIFs</span>), they regulate several developmental processes, such as organ growth, plant architecture determination, and abiotic stress responses, including salt stress (<a href=\"#koae139-B3\">Liebsch and Palatnik 2020</a>). However, how this latter role is mediated is yet unknown.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"3fd98569009b269446fb6f243f5f01da7c3175a503998d582aeb04ba57438ad3","category":"Environment"}
