{"title":"Arabidopsis ICS1 produces salicylic acid precursor isochorismate through a gated channel mechanism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/672/7693639?rss=1","date":1718323200000,"content":"<span>When one part of a plant is under attack from pathogens, an extensive network of defense responses is triggered, signaling to other parts of the plant to prepare itself against the infection. This process is called systemic acquired resistance (SAR), and the hormone salicylic acid (SA) is essential for SAR signaling as well as local defense responses (<a href=\"#kiae342-B4\">Peng et al. 2021</a>). In plants, 2 SA biosynthesis pathways have been identified: the isochorismate synthase (ICS) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathways (<a href=\"#kiae342-F1\">Fig. 1</a>). Both pathways use chorismate as a precursor, which is produced from the shikimate pathway. The 2 SA biosynthesis pathways have varying contributions depending on the species, and in Arabidopsis 90% of the defense-related SA production is through the ICS pathway (<a href=\"#kiae342-B1\">Garcion et al. 2008</a>; <a href=\"#kiae342-B5\">Rekhter et al. 2019</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"73bc8050fbc04952e2f8266afa7fd4e358d4803113e3a543aa05dda9bc83e157","category":"Environment"}
