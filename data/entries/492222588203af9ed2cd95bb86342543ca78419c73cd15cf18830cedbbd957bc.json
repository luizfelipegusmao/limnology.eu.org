{"title":"Investigation of Anisotropic Electronic Structure in Graphite by Momentum-Resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (ω-q Mapping) and Electron Spectroscopic Diffraction Patterns","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.583/7720161?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Momentum (<span>q</span>)-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (<span>q</span>-EELS), which analyzes the electron dispersion as a function of frequency (<span>ω</span>) and <span>q</span> transfer (so-called <span>ω</span>-<span>q</span> maps), has been widely employed to investigate the dispersion of surface/volume plasmons and anisotropic electronic excitations. The recent demonstration of <span>q</span>-EELS in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) has become an important advancement in this field [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.583-B2\">2</a>]. AC-STEM enables adjusting the convergent semi-angle (<span>α</span> angle) from 20∼ 40 mrad to 1∼3 mrad to resolve the overlapped diffraction discs that would otherwise average out all possible anisotropic electronic excitations. Combining with an electron monochromator to achieve the energy resolution of a few meV, <span>q</span>-EELS in AC-STEM has successfully been applied to construct the <span>ω</span>-<span>q</span> maps of the vibration phonon dispersion [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.583-B2\">2</a>]. However, the <span>α</span> angle of 1∼3 mrad in AC-STEM is still approximately one order of magnitude larger than the <span>α</span> angle (less than 0.1 mrad) for selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) in conventional TEM (C-TEM) using parallel electron beams [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B3\">3</a>]. C-TEM-EELS has been reported to achieve the <span>q</span> resolution approaching the long-wavelength limit to investigate the dispersions for surface plasmons [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.583-B4\">4</a>]. Meanwhile, the electron spectroscopic diffraction (ESD) patterns obtained from energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B5\">5</a>] have also been explored to study the anisotropic excitations in graphite [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B5\">5</a>], boron nitride [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B6\">6</a>], and lead selenide [<a href=\"#ozae044.583-B7\">7</a>], demonstrating its potential for the investigation of electronic anisotropy in materials. Here, we use both <span>ω</span>-<span>q</span> maps and ESD patterns in C-TEM to study the anisotropic dispersion in graphite.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"492222588203af9ed2cd95bb86342543ca78419c73cd15cf18830cedbbd957bc","category":"Environment"}
