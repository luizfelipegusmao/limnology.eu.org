{"title":"Automated Management of AWS Instances for Training","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1095/v1","date":1723717583000,"content":"Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances provide a convenient way to run training on complex â€™omics data analysis workflows without requiring participants to install software packages or store large data volumes locally. However, efficiently managing dozens of instances is challenging for training providers.  We present a set of Bash scripts that make it quick and easy to manage Linux AWS instances pre-configured with all the software analysis tools and data needed for a course, and accessible using encrypted login keys and optional domain names. Creating over 30 instances takes 10-15 minutes.  A comprehensive online tutorial describes how to set up and use an AWS account and the scripts, and how to customise AWS instance templates with other software tools and data. We anticipate that others offering similar training may benefit from using the scripts regardless of the analyses being taught.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79999cd8c847fa051345f726eecc92824b7631aa803bd6f0e76d239a329952ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
