{"title":"Telecommunication Infrastructure Construction and Development to Impact of Innovation and Development in China: A Panel Data Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1873/v1","date":1714377346000,"content":"Telecommunication infrastructure, as a technology-intensive industry, provides fundamental support for informatization construction. This paper empirically studies the impact of telecommunication infrastructure construction on economic and social innovative development using provincial panel data from China spanning from 2009 to 2022. The research findings indicate the following: (1) Telecommunication infrastructure significantly promotes innovation in terms of R&amp;amp;D investment, knowledge output, and application output. (2)At various stages of telecommunication technology development, the impact on innovative development varies. Iterative updates in telecommunication technology drive higher R&amp;amp;D expenditures, facilitating better utilization of innovation outcomes in industries. (3) There are regional disparities in the influence of telecommunication infrastructure on economic and social innovative development. In the eastern regions, telecommunication infrastructure construction primarily promotes mobile communication, with clear spillover effects. In contrast, in western regions, it mainly facilitates fixed communication networks. Therefore, in the new development stage of China, further strengthening telecommunication infrastructure construction provides a new impetus and space for economic and social innovative development. It is essential to persistently advance the coordinated construction of mobile and fixed communication infrastructure to achieve regional development coordination.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5775c91dbebfed6623012f73935286dd1789d1efbd8f494dd62f72d4918c212c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
