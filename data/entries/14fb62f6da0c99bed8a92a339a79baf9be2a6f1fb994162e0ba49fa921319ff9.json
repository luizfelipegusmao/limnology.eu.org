{"title":"An experimental study of the effect of thermoelectric and water cooling on the performance of a basin solar still with an integrated condenser","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14270?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigates the impact of cooling methods on the performance of a basin solar still integrated with a condensation chamber wall. Two different cooling techniques of the condensation chamber, namely water cooling and radiative cooling, were tested in Algerian climatic conditions. The findings revealed that the type of cooling system significantly affects the temperature of different components of the solar still. Moreover, the output of Peltier-cooled still was better on the basin side, while the water-cooled still was better on the condensation chamber side. The solar stills equipped with Peltier and water cooling produced 2.95 and 2.44â€‰kg/m<sup>2</sup> day, respectively. Additionally, the use of radiative cooling increased the solar still production by 43% compared to water cooling. The cost analysis indicated that the radiative-cooled solar still is more cost-effective with a cost of $0.09237 per liter of freshwater produced, compared to $0.29320 per liter produced by the water-cooled still over the 15-year system lifespan.</p>","author":"Rabah Kerfah, \nKhaled Yahia Mahammed, \nFerhat Kamel Benabdelaziz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"14fb62f6da0c99bed8a92a339a79baf9be2a6f1fb994162e0ba49fa921319ff9","category":"Environment"}
