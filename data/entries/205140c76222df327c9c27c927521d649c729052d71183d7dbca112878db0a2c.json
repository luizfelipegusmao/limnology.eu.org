{"title":"Magnetostrophic Flow and Electromagnetic Columns in Magneto-Fluid Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0971/v2","date":1726474682000,"content":"An analogy between magneto-fluid dynamics (MFD/MHD) and geostrophic flow in a rotating frame of reference including the existence of electromagnetic columns identical to Taylor-Proudman columns is identified and demonstrated theoretically. The latter occurs in the limit of large values of a dimensionless group representing the magnetic field number. Such conditions are shown to be easily satisfied in reality. Consequently, the electromagnetic fluid flow subject to these conditions is two dimensional and the streamlines are being shown to be identical to the pressure lines in complete analogy to rotating geostrophic flows. An experimental setup is suggested to confirm the theoretical results experimentally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"205140c76222df327c9c27c927521d649c729052d71183d7dbca112878db0a2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
