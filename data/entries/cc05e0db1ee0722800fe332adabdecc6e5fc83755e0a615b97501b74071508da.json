{"title":"Line Loss Comprehensive Evaluation Management System Based on Knowledge Graph","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0082/v1","date":1722563922000,"content":"This study constructs a comprehensive line loss management evaluation knowledge graph, considering the impact of various factors such as power grid structure characteristics, equipment's physical parameters, power grid operation characteristics, electricity consumption features, and natural conditions. It establishes the association between line loss characteristics and line loss retrieval and configures the data source for line loss management evaluation indicators. Based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), this study selects comprehensive evaluation indicators for line loss management, verifies the rationality of the indicators, and proposes an integrated evaluation method for municipal power grid line loss management. A full-process composite evaluation method based on DEMATEL-Entropy Weight-TOPSIS is constructed, and the accuracy of the evaluation method is verified through ablation experiments. The TOPSIS analysis method is applied to empirical research on cross-sectional data from a city in Guangxi from 2012 to 2022 to validate the evaluation system's effectiveness, scientific nature, and objectivity. The case analysis shows that the line loss evaluation index system established in this paper effectively reduces the redundancy of line loss data and can objectively and rationally reflect the actual status of line loss management work, serving as a basis for decision-making in future line loss management evaluations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc05e0db1ee0722800fe332adabdecc6e5fc83755e0a615b97501b74071508da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
