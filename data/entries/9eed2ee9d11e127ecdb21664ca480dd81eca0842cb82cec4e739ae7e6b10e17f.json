{"title":"A revision of the genus Wrangelia (Wrangeliaceae, Ceramiales) in Bermuda resolves six new species including W. ryancraigii from the mesophotic zone","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13466?af=R","date":1724695876000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Four species of the genus <i>Wrangelia</i> are presently known from the western Atlantic Ocean: <i>W. argus</i>, <i>W. bicuspidata</i>, <i>W. penicillata,</i> and <i>W. gordoniae</i>, with the first three historically being reported from Bermuda. Morphological and molecular barcode (COI-5P) and phylogenetic analyses used in this study (SSU, LSU, <i>rbc</i>L) indicated eight species groupings of <i>Wrangelia</i> in Bermuda, excluding two of the historically recognized species, retaining only <i>W. argus</i> while adding seven new species, of which six are formally described. What had been historically reported as <i>W. penicillata</i> from Bermuda was shown to be distinct from Mediterranean Sea specimens (type locality) and was shown to be a mixture of <i>W. hesperia</i> sp. nov. and <i>W. incrassata</i> sp. nov. Along with these two, three other new species (<i>W. laxa</i> sp. nov., <i>W. ryancraigii</i> sp. nov., and <i>W. secundiramea</i> sp. nov.) have complete rhizoidal cortication tightly covering axial cells of indeterminate axes below the apices, distinguishing them from the two local incompletely corticated congeners <i>W. argus</i> and <i>W. abscondita</i> sp. nov., the latter a morphologically cryptic sister species with <i>W. bicuspidata</i> from the Caribbean Sea. Only one of the new species, <i>W. ryancraigii</i>, has thus far been observed in the mesophotic zone off the Bermuda platform, and it is morphologically cryptic with the euphotic zone's <i>W. laxa</i>.</p>","author":"Walter M.
