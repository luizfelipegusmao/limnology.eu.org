The Lady Tasting Tea experiment consists in mixing eight cups of tea, four in one way and four in the other, and presenting them to the Lady for judgment in a random order. This short article presents a Bayesian Network (BN) for modelling the Lady Tasting Tea experiment that provides a comprehensive perspective in inferential analysis of all the data samples possibly generated from the experiment. More specifically, with respect to a prior distribution of three possible levels (pure guessing, 75% sure, and 100% sure) of the Ladyâ€™s ability in correctly deciding how a served cup of tea has been made, the proposed BN model enables us to calculate the posterior probabilities of any judgment outcomes possibly made by the Lady.","author":"Gang Xie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"84e6b95a0923b3d73baa957b5bc14670fc45235fa6995658215b2327e04d81a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
