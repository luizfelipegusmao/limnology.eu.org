{"title":"Perturbations in gut microbiota composition in schizophrenia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306582","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by YiMeng Wang, SiGuo Bi, XiaoLong Li, YuTao Zhong, DongDong Qi</p>\r\n\r\nSchizophrenia is a severe, complex and long-term psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Gut microbes influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Consequently, investigations of the relationship between gut microbes and schizophrenia are warranted. This study involved 29 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-matched normal controls. After 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial diversity, composition, and function. According to 16S rRNA and metagenomic gene sequencing results, patients with schizophrenia had higher abundances of <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Megasphaera</i>. Functional analysis showed that sphingolipid, phosphonates and phosphinates, as well as glutamine metabolism were associated with the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota exerts an effect on patients with schizophrenia, providing valuable insights into the potential regulation of in the context of this disorder.","author":"YiMeng Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"52384fe336f387bde41478a75c832a97affc765b179b33da77e1f5ff9a693a19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
