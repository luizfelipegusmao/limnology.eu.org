Detecting risk areas requires a strong surveillance system for pathogenic viruses in possible sources such as wastewater. To build an environmental surveillance system, we aimed to identify group A rotavirus (RVA) and human adenovirus (HAdV) in wastewater. We also focused on three different methods of viral concentration to determine suitability for a regular surveillance system. We screened 20 wastewater samples for HAdV and RVA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR). Sixteen posi-tives (18/20) and ten (14/20) positives for HAdV and RVA, respectively, were obtained on qPCR, representing a prevalence of 90% and 70%. Twelve (12) positives were successfully amplified. Bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS) and skimmed milk (SM) flocculation were the most consistent viral concentration methods for HAdV and RVA, respectively. Human adenovirus was identified with nucleotide identity range of 98.48% to 99.53%. Statistical analysis of positives showed that viral burden differed by site (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"adbd353ea1610757635363cca645e68e17852bbd42852db90613cb62e0308def","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
