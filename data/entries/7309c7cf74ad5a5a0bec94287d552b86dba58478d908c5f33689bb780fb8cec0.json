{"title":"Sharpening Skills: The Role of Virtual Simulation in Enhanc-ing Spinal Neurosurgical Proficiency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0735/v1","date":1725963000000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Traditional neurosurgical training involves a steep learning curve. The introduction of advanced simulation technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), provides an alternative method for skill acquisition, allowing for repeated practice and objective assessment. This study focuses on evaluating the learning curve associated with lumbar pedicle Kirschner wire insertion using a virtual fluoroscopic simulator among neurosurgical residents. Methods: Eighteen neurosurgery residents and two interns participated in this study. Participants’ initial skill levels were assessed through a questionnaire. Performance metrics, including insertion accuracy, time, and the number of virtual X-ray scans, were recorded across multiple attempts until a “practical learning plateau” was reached. Statistical analyses were conducted to model learning curves, assess the correlation between pre-training experience and performance. Results: The average number of attempts required to stabilize performance was 5.61. Learning rates varied, with some residents showing rapid improvement while others progressed more slowly. Higher accuracy in wire placement correlated with reduced usage on X-rays over time. However, experienced residents did not necessarily learn faster, indicating potential challenges in adapting to new simulation-based methods. Post-training feedback highlighted the simulator’s utility in increasing confidence and skill levels, although some limitations in anatomical accuracy were noted. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of virtual simulation to enhance neurosurgical training by providing a controlled environment for repeated practice and objective feedback. Simulation-based training can effectively complement traditional methods, though individualized approaches may be necessary to accommodate varying learning rates among residents. Further refinement of simulation tools and their integration into standard training curricula are recommended.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7309c7cf74ad5a5a0bec94287d552b86dba58478d908c5f33689bb780fb8cec0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
