{"title":"We are doing it wrong: Putting homology before phylogeny in cyanobacterial taxonomy","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13491?af=R","date":1723890330000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The rapid expansion of whole genome sequencing in bacterial taxonomy has revealed deep evolutionary relationships and speciation signals, but assembly methods often miss true nucleotide diversity in the ribosomal operons. Though it lacks sufficient phylogenetic signal at the species level, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene is still much used in bacterial taxonomy. In cyanobacterial taxonomy, comparisons of 16S–23S Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions are used to bridge this information gap. Although ITS rRNA region analyses are routinely being used to identify species, researchers often do not identify orthologous operons, which leads to improper comparisons. No method for delineating orthologous operon copies from paralogous ones has been established. A new method for recognizing orthologous ribosomal operons by quantifying the conserved paired nucleotides in a helical domain of the ITS, has been developed. The D1′ Index quantifies differences in the ratio of pyrimidines to purines in paired nucleotide sequences of this helix. Comparing 111 operon sequences from 89 strains of <i>Brasilonema</i>, four orthologous operon types were identified. Plotting D1′ Index values against the length of helices produced clear separation of orthologs. Most orthologous operons in this study were observed both with and without tRNA genes present. We hypothesize that genomic rearrangement, not gene duplication, is responsible for the variation among orthologs. This new method will allow cyanobacterial taxonomists to utilize ITS rRNA region data more correctly, preventing erroneous taxonomic hypotheses. Moreover, this work could assist genomicists in identifying and preserving evident sequence variability in ribosomal operons, which is an important proxy for evolution in prokaryotes.</p>","author":"Chelsea D.
