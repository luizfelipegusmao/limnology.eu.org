{"title":"Probing the Cardinality of Space with a Computer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0821/v1","date":1728566492000,"content":"A straightforward way to avoid the problem of the infinite zero-point energy principally is to negate the axiom of infinity of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. However, in so doing the real numbers and, as a corollary, the concept of infinitesimals would be given up making mathematical analysis, as it is known today, impossible. That said, consider a set whose members uniquely index points comprising a region of space. Providing four binary operations and their properties are defined on an index set, it is a field. The present paper demonstrates that to find the characteristic of an index field of the space of the observable universe is computationally intractable. Accordingly, such field cannot be distinguished from that of characteristic zero in any way possible. Meaning that one can negate the axiom of infinity and still use the real numbers inside the space of the observable universe for all intents and purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"791c5c699aec325cc5aaa2b33ad2f84ff1b3c6ebbf606ae1073f81f800a8d656","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
