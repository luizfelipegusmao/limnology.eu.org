The effect of heatwaves on phytoplankton is of particular concern because they are a key source of C, N, P and essential fatty acids to aquatic ecosystems. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that phytoplankton grown at warmer temperatures are a lower quality food source, but how heatwaves affect phytoplankton quality at the community scale is currently unclear.\n\nHere we address this knowledge gap by growing natural assemblages of freshwater phytoplankton at “ambient”, “constant warming” or “heatwave” conditions. We next fed these phytoplankton communities to natural assemblages of zooplankton to test the prediction that zooplankton that consume heatwave-exposed phytoplankton will exhibit reductions in biomass.\n\nOur experiment demonstrated that zooplankton that consumed “heatwave” phytoplankton attained lower community biomass than those fed “constant warming” or “ambient” phytoplankton. Additionally, despite receiving similar total heat input, phytoplankton exposed to “heatwave” conditions contained lower C, N, P and fatty acid concentrations compared to phytoplankton grown in “constant warming” conditions.\n\nCorrelations between zooplankton biomass and all measured phytoplankton traits revealed that decreases in zooplankton biomass were best explained by low quantities of C, N and monounsaturated fatty acids in “heatwave” phytoplankton.\n\nOur study demonstrates that the effects of heatwaves on phytoplankton quality are clearly distinct from those caused by constant warming temperatures and that heatwave-mediated decreases in resource quality have immediate effects on consumer productivity.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/02/07/heatwave-mediated-decreases-in-phytoplankton-quality-negatively-affect-zooplankton-productivity/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Jihyun Olivia Kim, \nAlexandra Dimitriou, \nIan Forster, \nMichelle Tseng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"cc4599eb5b585155ddfa16d5c52a86ccf7b9125212507dc83104609e46011746","category":"Environment"}
