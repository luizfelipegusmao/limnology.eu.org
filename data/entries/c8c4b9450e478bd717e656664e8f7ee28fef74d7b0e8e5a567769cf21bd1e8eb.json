{"title":"Acoustic recordings, biological observations, and genetic identification of a rare(?) beaked whale in the North Pacific: Mesoplodon carlhubbsi","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13059?af=R","date":1704967856000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Although Hubbs' beaked whale (<i>Mesoplodon carlhubbsi</i>) was previously known from over 60 strandings on both sides of the North Pacific, it had been identified alive in the wild only once, off Oregon in 1994. In September 2021, we conducted a search effort for beaked whales off the coast of Oregon using a towed hydrophone array and a visual search team. Approximately 350 km off the Columbia River mouth, we detected the vocalizations of an unidentified mesoplodont whale; we stopped our vessel and waited in the area until two unidentified juvenile <i>Mesoplodon</i> surfaced and stayed near our vessel for almost 2 hr. During that time, we took numerous photographs and videos, made behavioral observations, and recorded their vocalizations. The DNA sequence from a biopsy sample identified them as <i>M. carlhubbsi</i>. In this paper, we discuss our biological observations, including color patterning and acquired markings, behavioral observations, and describe for the first time the acoustic characteristics of this species. We confirm that <i>M. carlhubbsi</i> is the source of a previously unidentified acoustic signal known as BW37V, and we update what is known about the at-sea distribution of this species based on previous recordings and observational records.</p>","author":"Lisa T.
