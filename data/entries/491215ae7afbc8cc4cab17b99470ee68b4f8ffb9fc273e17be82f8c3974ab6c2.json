{"title":"Precision Medicine Approaches in Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Adverse Genetics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0836/v1","date":1710407288000,"content":"The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with adverse genetics remains unsatisfactory, with very low response rates to standard chemotherapy and shorter durations of remission commonly observed in these patients. The complex biology of AML with adverse genetics is continuously evolving. Herein, we discuss recent advances which have investigated the contribution of cell intrinsic mechanisms as well as of the immune system to myeloid leukemogenesis in this specific subset of AML. We focus on the biological rationales for combining targeted therapy and immunotherapy, which are currently being investigated in ongoing trials, and could hopefully ameliorate the poor outcomes for these patients","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"491215ae7afbc8cc4cab17b99470ee68b4f8ffb9fc273e17be82f8c3974ab6c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
