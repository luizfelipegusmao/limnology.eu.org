{"title":"Immune Response to GeneVac-B&reg; (rDNA I.P. Hepatitis B Vaccine) in Vaccinated Persons with a Standard Schedule in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0333/v1","date":1715062659000,"content":"GeneVac-B® was recently licensed in Burkina Faso and is widely used for population vaccination. This study aimed to evaluate the immune response in people fully vaccinated against hepatitis B with the GeneVac-B® vaccine in Burkina Faso under actual conditions of use. This cross-sectional study included individuals fully vaccinated with GeneVac-B®. For each consenting participant, sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Approximately 4 mL of whole blood was collected for immunological (anti-HBs, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV) and biochemical (blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides) testing. The anti-HBs titer was used to determine the immune response. A total of 392 participants were included in the study. The mean age was 35.5±15 years. Approximately 56.1% had been previously exposed to HBV. Three hundred eighty (380) participants had an anti-HBs titer ≥ 12 mIU/mL, a seroprotection rate of 96.9%, and 12 had a titer &amp;lt; 12 mIU/mL, a nonresponse rate of 3.1%. Among the nonresponders, 11 (11/12; 91.7%) had high total cholesterol levels (&amp;gt; 240 mg/dL), and 8 (8/12; 66.7%) were older than 40 years of age. The results showed an excellent immune response to GeneVac-B® in our study population. However, age &amp;gt; 40 and high total cholesterol appear to be factors associated with nonresponse.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7cdf7e9e60451bcd4418b4d8ab04296faa9067825e85523c2847fe511f6e8ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
