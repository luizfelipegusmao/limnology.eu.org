Weaned pigs [n = 40; initial body weight (BW) = 6.4 ± 0.1 kg] at 21 d of age were individually housed and assigned to 4 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design, with initial BW and sex as blocking factors. Basal diets were formulated following NRC (2012) and fed to pigs for 28 d in 3 phases (P1:11 d, P2:10 d and P3:7 d). Treatments were NC: basal diet, non-challenge; PC: basal diet, challenged with F18<sup>+</sup><span>E. coli</span>; AV1: basal diet supplemented with 1% phytobiotic containing herbal extracts and essential oils in powder form, challenged with F18<sup>+</sup><span>E. coli</span>; AV2: basal diet + 1% phytobiotic containing herbal extracts and essential oils in liquid form, challenged with F18<sup>+</sup><span>E. coli</span>. Growth performance and fecal score (FS) were measured weekly. On d 7, the challenged groups were orally inoculated with F18<sup>+</sup><span>E. coli</span> (2.0 × 10<sup>10</sup>), whereas unchallenged pigs received a sterile saline solution. On d 28, all pigs were euthanized to collect jejunal samples to evaluate inflammatory status, oxidative stress, and diversity and relative abundance of mucosa-associated microbiota. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure on SAS 9.4. During the post-challenge period, PC decrease (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) when compared with NC. The PC increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) FS during d 7 to 11 when compared with NC, whereas AV1 and AV2 decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) FS during d 7 to 11 when compared with PC. The AV1 decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) Chao1 and Shannon indexes when compared with PC. The PC increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the relative abundance of <span>Prevotellaceae</span>, <span>Lachnospiraceae</span>, <span>and Ruminococcaceae</span> compared with NC. The AV1 reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the relative abundance of <span>Veillonellaceae</span>, <span>Prevotellaceae</span>, <span>Lachnospiraceae</span> and tended to reduce (<span>P</span> = 0.062) the relative abundance of <span>Ruminococcaceae</span> when compared with PC. The AV2 tended to reduce the relative abundance of <span>Streptococcaceae</span> (<span>P</span> = 0.073) and <span>Ruminococcaceae</span> (<span>P</span> = 0.074) when compared with PC. The PC increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) occludin and tended to increase (<span>P</span> = 0.096) TLR4 when compared with NC. The AV1 tended to increase (<span>P</span> = 0.053) protein carbonyl when compared with PC. In conclusion, F18<sup>+</sup><span>E. coli</span> challenge increased FS, disrupted the mucosa-associated microbiota, increased TLR4 expression, consequently reduced growth performance of pigs. The AV1 showed promise in reducing oxidative stress during F18<sup>+</sup><span>E. coli</span> challenge, seen through decreased protein carbonyl levels possibly due to alterations on mucosa-associated microbiota, although without affecting growth performance. The AV2 had a moderate impact on reducing FS and altering mucosa-associated microbiota, without effect on growth performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b55c43a3720a8641e18c71996c2cb79572ce1fcd64daa8219cf9b6ce279e2b28","category":"Environment"}
