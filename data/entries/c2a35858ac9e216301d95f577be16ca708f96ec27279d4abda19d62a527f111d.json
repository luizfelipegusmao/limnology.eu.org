{"title":"<i>dtool</i> and <i>dserver</i>: A flexible ecosystem for findable data","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306100","date":1719324000000,"content":"<p>by Johannes L.

Olsson</p>\r\n\r\nMaking data FAIR—findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible—has become the recurring theme behind many research data management efforts. <i>dtool</i> is a lightweight data management tool that packages metadata with immutable data to promote accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility. Each dataset is self-contained and does not require metadata to be stored in a centralised system. This decentralised approach means that finding datasets can be difficult. <i>dtool’s</i> lookup server, short <i>dserver</i>, as defined by a REST API, makes <i>dtool</i> datasets findable, hence rendering the <i>dtool</i> ecosystem fit for a FAIR data management world. Its simplicity, modularity, accessibility and standardisation via API distinguish <i>dtool</i> and <i>dserver</i> from other solutions and enable it to serve as a common denominator for cross-disciplinary research data management. The <i>dtool</i> ecosystem bridges the gap between standardisation-free data management by individuals and FAIR platform solutions with rigid metadata requirements.","author":"Johannes L.
