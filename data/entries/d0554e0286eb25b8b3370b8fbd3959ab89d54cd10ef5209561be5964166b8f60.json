{"title":"Coupling hydrological methods with ‘Flow Health’ to simulate ecological flow in the Weihe River Basin, China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4332?af=R","date":1727828914000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Reducing river flows significantly affects livelihoods, ecology and industrial production. Therefore, allowing for ecological flow requirements has been applied to limiting human water consumption and is incorporated into water allocation planning. However, the unavailability of ecological data greatly limits e-flow studies and this lack of sufficient ecosystem data is mostly addressed by using hydrological metrics as surrogates of the river ecosystem. This study employed the nine indicators of the ‘Flow Health’ model to assess river hydrological health and explore optimal ecological flow regimes. The modelling estimated the required flow and the extra flood flows of ecosystem conservation under default and custom thresholds. Ecological flows were calculated for five stations of the Weihe River through coupling with three hydrological methodologies. The index of flow deviation indicated that the flow regimes in Weihe River have partially changed from the reference period. Fish and other aquatic habitats have changed by reduced flows, but the health of the floodplain ecosystem has not been seriously affected. The ecological flow modelling results showed that the extra flow required for the ecology restoration in five stations is concentrated from July to September. The optimal ecological flows in dry seasons by coupling three hydrological methods were less than the average current flow, which is reasonable. This coupling provides ideas on how environmental flow assessments are undertaken in similar regions.</p>","author":"Dandan Liu, \nJiancang Xie, \nXue Yang, \nShuang Gao","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"d0554e0286eb25b8b3370b8fbd3959ab89d54cd10ef5209561be5964166b8f60","category":"Environment"}
