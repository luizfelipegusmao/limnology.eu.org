In this study, we evaluate the efficiency of image processing using parallel techniques compared to sequential techniques. We use Dask to parallelize the loading and processing of images and compare the execution times for various image processing techniques, including smoothing, edge detection, rotation, and thresholding. The results show that parallel processing significantly reduces execution time compared to sequential processing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c5b8f368ad64bf60f82f9afee6e58732bd6d190f864766e295028bfa116bccb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
