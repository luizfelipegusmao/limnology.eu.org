{"title":"Whole-Tree Green Density Equations for Loblolly and Slash Pine Trees","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/4/271/7692855?rss=1","date":1718236800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Using extensive legacy and new datasets, two equations of whole-tree green density, defined as the ratio of the green weight of stem wood with bark (<span>GWob</span>) divided either by the stem outside-bark volume (<span>Vob</span>) or by the stem inside-bark volume (<span>Vib</span>), were developed along with individual tree <span>Vob</span>, <span>Vib</span>, and <span>GWob</span> equations for loblolly and slash pines. The green density equations indicated that the <span>GWob</span>/<span>Vob</span> ratio increases while the <span>GWob</span>/<span>Vib</span> ratio decreases with an increase in tree size for both species. The transition from low-intensity management to intensive management has a notable impact on tree green weight characteristics. Generally, trees from older established plantations exhibited a higher <span>GWob</span>/<span>Vob</span> ratio compared with trees from more recently established plantations, spanning both loblolly and slash pines.<strong>Study Implications</strong>: Derived whole-tree green density equations, alongside updated stem green weight and volume equations, are valuable tools for estimating the volume and green weight of entire stem boles, facilitating volume-to-green-weight conversion for specific sections for loblolly and slash pines, the primary commercial timber species in the southern United States.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"78a0d1a0c7511b93088bd269f9457859dc04a86fd3486b345ad32875e3a26e5d","category":"Environment"}
