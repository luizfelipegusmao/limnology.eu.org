{"title":"Plant‐derived biostimulant as priming agents enhanced antioxidant and nutritive properties in brassicaceous microgreens","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13416?af=R","date":1718692178000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Microgreens constitute dietary sources of bioactive compounds imparting numerous health benefits and enhancing sensory experience. They can be successfully cultivated in soilless systems where biostimulants can be easily integrated as seed-priming and post-germination agents improving the sustainability of a crop's final production. Compared to an untreated control, three priming agents (a commercial legume-derived protein hydrolysate (A250), a novel protein hydrolysate derived from peanut biomass (H250) and hydropriming (H<sub>2</sub>O)) were applied to Komatsuna and Mibuna seeds grown as microgreens and compared for their effects on yield parameters, mineral composition, ABTS and FRAP antioxidant capacity, carotenoid concentration and phenolic compounds.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Significant effects of the main experimental factors and their interactions were identified on antioxidant capacity. Compared to the control and hydropriming, the highest ABTS and FRAP values were observed in Mibuna with the A250 and H250 treatments, respectively. Additionally, the H250 treatment increased the total concentrations of phenolic acid derivatives and flavonoid derivatives in Mibuna and Komatsuna, in tune with the levels of total flavonoids. Concerning mineral composition, the highest concentrations in both species were those of phosphorus and nitrate.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results highlight the potential of select plant-based biostimulants as priming agents to enhance the antioxidant capacity, nutrient content and bioactive compound content, thus further increasing their functional and nutritive quality. In the light of this, the possibility of reducing the application of fertilizers by promoting a green transition for the intensive production of microgreens could subsequently be evaluated. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Michele Ciriello, \nEmanuela Campana, \nMarios C Kyriacou, \nChristophe El‐Nakhel, \nGiulia Graziani, \nMariateresa Cardarelli, \nGiuseppe Colla, \nStefania De Pascale, \nYoussef Rouphael","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"26ee0ea117ea03fca89f2714a7510b8db8c8914da5f70e2809a4188a583b4619","category":"Environment"}
