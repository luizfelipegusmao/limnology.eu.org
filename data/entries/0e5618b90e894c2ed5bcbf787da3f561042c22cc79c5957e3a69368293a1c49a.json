{"title":"Virtual Hemodynamic Assessment of Coronary Lesions: The Advent of Functional Angiography and Coronary Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1369/v1","date":1711104736000,"content":"Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is well recognized as a gold standard measure for the estimation of functional coronary stenosis. Technological progressions in image processing have   empowered the reconstruction of three-dimensional models of the coronary arteries via both non-invasive imaging modalities, such as Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA), and invasive coronary angiography or intravascular imaging. The application of    computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to coronary 3D anatomical models allows the virtual evaluation of the hemodynamic significance of a coronary lesion with high diagnostic  accuracy in comparison to the invasive FFR using pressure wires. These opportunities providing hemodynamic information based on anatomy have given rise to a new era of functional angiography and coronary imaging. However, further validations are needed to overcome several scientific and computational challenges before these methods are applied in everyday clinical practice. This review aims to present all the data on the studies and methodologies that have been presented for the virtual estimation of FFR, and the diagnostic execution of the virtual tools for the hemodynamic assessment of coronary lesions compared to the invasive FFR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e5618b90e894c2ed5bcbf787da3f561042c22cc79c5957e3a69368293a1c49a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
