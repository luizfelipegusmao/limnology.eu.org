{"title":"Deciphering Epigenetic Mechanisms: The Role of DNA Methylation in Driving Phenotypic Diversity and Evolutionary Adaptation in Chickpea (Cicer arietinum)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2062/v1","date":1724918151000,"content":"This study explores the critical role of DNA methylation in shaping phenotypic diversity and driving evolutionary adaptation in chickpea (Cicer arietinum). By employing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and advanced genomic techniques, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns across various chickpea cultivars, focusing on key adaptive traits such as drought tolerance, disease resistance, seed size, and flowering time. Our results revealed significant methylation changes associated with these traits, providing novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and its impact on phenotypic variation. Additionally, we investigated the dynamic responses of DNA methylation under different environmental stresses, highlighting the plasticity of the chickpea epigenome. This research not only enhances our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying plant evolution but also opens up new avenues for developing epigenetic-based strategies for crop improvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5d2213c440685541032cfc94cff11e21156cef2b1e9599e0189f459928121ace","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
