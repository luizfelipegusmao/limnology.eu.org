{"title":"A maize semi-dwarf mutant reveals a GRAS transcription factor involved in brassinosteroid signaling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/3072/7665558?rss=1","date":1714953600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Brassinosteroids (BR) and gibberellins (GA) regulate plant height and leaf angle in maize (<span>Zea mays</span>). Mutants with defects in BR or GA biosynthesis or signaling identify components of these pathways and enhance our knowledge about plant growth and development. In this study, we characterized three recessive mutant alleles of <span>GRAS transcription factor 42</span> (<span>gras42</span>) in maize, a GRAS transcription factor gene orthologous to the <span>DWARF AND LOW TILLERING</span> (<span>DLT</span>) gene of rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). These maize mutants exhibited semi-dwarf stature, shorter and wider leaves, and more upright leaf angle. Transcriptome analysis revealed a role for GRAS42 as a determinant of BR signaling. Analysis of the expression consequences from loss of GRAS42 in the <span>gras42-mu1021149</span> mutant indicated a weak loss of BR signaling in the mutant, consistent with its previously demonstrated role in BR signaling in rice. Loss of BR signaling was also evident by the enhancement of weak BR biosynthetic mutant alleles in double mutants of <span>nana plant1-1</span> and <span>gras42-mu1021149</span>. The <span>gras42-mu1021149</span> mutant had little effect on GA-regulated gene expression, suggesting that GRAS42 is not a regulator of core GA signaling genes in maize. Single-cell expression data identified <span>gras42</span> expressed among cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle consistent with its previously demonstrated role in cell cycle gene expression in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). <span>Cis</span>-acting natural variation controlling GRAS42 transcript accumulation was identified by expression genome-wide association study (eGWAS) in maize. Our results demonstrate a conserved role for GRAS42/SCARECROW-LIKE 28 (SCL28)/DLT in BR signaling, clarify the role of this gene in GA signaling, and suggest mechanisms of tillering and leaf angle control by BR.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"9ecd79c0d64989d008e3301a739fedcebabe9ee0d2d618fbb49664f425da5fb3","category":"Environment"}
