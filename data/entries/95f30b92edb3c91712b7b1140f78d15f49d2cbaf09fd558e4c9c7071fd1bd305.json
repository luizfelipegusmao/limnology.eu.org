{"title":"High internal phase emulsions stabilized by fluorescent phycocyanin for improved stability and bioaccessibility of β‐carotene","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13868?af=R","date":1725961341000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>High internal phase emulsions (HIPE) are distinguished from ordinary emulsions by higher oil-phase percentage and better storage stability. Recently, HIPE stabilized with protein-based particles has received more attention. However, organic precipitation, chemical cross-linking and thermal denaturation are often needed to stabilize emulsions with natural proteins, and there is an urgent need to reduce the pollution of organic reagents.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>HIPE loaded with β-carotene stabilized by phycocyanin was prepared under mild conditions. It demonstrated strong stability in terms of temperature and storage, as evidenced by its 94.17% retention rate and 81.06% bioavailability. This stability was ascribed to the efficient defense against heat and UV rays, which was probably associated with the oil-droplet environment and interfacial protection of phycocyanin. It is speculated that the possible main interaction site between phycocyanin and sorbitol exists near amino acids 110 to 120 of the B chain. The hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction between them make the phycocyanin fully adsorbed on the oil–water interface when sorbitol is stable, forming a strong oil–water structure, which increases the stability of the emulsion.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The outstanding fluorescence characteristics provide a feasible alternative for fluorescent emulsions to distribute and trace active compounds <i>in vitro</i>. HIPE loaded with β-carotene might have potential as a 3D printing material for edible functional foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yu Cheng, \nXiaolin Sun, \nZhong Zhang, \nWenjun Li, \nLi Yuan, \nXingbin Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"95f30b92edb3c91712b7b1140f78d15f49d2cbaf09fd558e4c9c7071fd1bd305","category":"Environment"}
