This article explores the roles played by environmental organizations, particularly those focused on rivers and watersheds, in catalyzing interaction and action driven by human–river relationship goals. Interviews were conducted with representatives from 64 river and watershed organizations in Montana, Utah, and Wyoming in 2022. Organizational representatives were asked about mission focus areas, human–river relationships, the knowledge they draw upon to guide their efforts, and factors and obstacles that enable and constrain their progress and success. These qualitative data reveal a strong orientation toward steward and partner types of human–nature relationship concepts; however, there are discrepancies in conceptual interpretations. For river and watershed organizations in the US Intermountain West, human–river relationship goals depend strongly on human–human relationships in the form of diverse knowledge integration, collaboration, partnerships, trust, and communication in order to achieve their river-related goals.</p>","author":"Courtney G.
