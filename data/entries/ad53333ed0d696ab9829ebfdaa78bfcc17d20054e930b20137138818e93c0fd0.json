{"title":"Are There Non-invasive Biomarker(s) That Would Facilitate the Detection of Ovarian Torsion? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1558/v1","date":1724301590000,"content":"Ovarian torsion (OT) is a rare gynaecological emergency that requires a prompt diagnosis for optimal patient management. To determine whether there were any biomarkers suitable for the non-invasive detection of OT, two independent reviewers performed systematic searches of five literature databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Full-texts of 24 selected articles were assessed for risk of bias and quality assurance using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).  15 articles described studies on animals and all described serum biomarkers comparing results between OT versus a sham operation, a control group or readings before and after OT. Ischaemia modified albumin (IMA), serum D-dimer (s-DD), heat shock protein-70 (hsp-70), Pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) and c-reactive protein (CRP) showed the most promise, each with p-values for the difference between groups achieving ≤0.001. In studies of humans, the biomarkers ranged from 16.4-92.3% sensitivity and 77-100% specificity. The most promising biomarkers for the early prediction of OT in patients included s-DD, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IMA and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-. IL-6 had the highest sensitivity of any biomarker identified in this review and was raised in all 13 patients with proven OT, with values of ≥10.2pg/ml, indicative of a 16 times higher risk of having OT. Signal peptide, CUB domain and EGF like domain containing 1 (SCUBE1) had a high specificity at 93.3%, second only to s-DD and a positive likelihood ratio (LR)&amp;gt;10. IMA was the only other biomarker that also had a positive LR&amp;gt;10, making it a promising diagnostic biomarker. The studies identified by this systematic literature review each analysed small patient groups but IMA, DD and SCUBE1 nevertheless showed promise as serum biomarkers with a pooled LR&amp;gt;10. However, further well-designed studies are needed to identify and evaluate individual markers, or diagnostic panels to help clinicians manage this important, organ-threatening condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad53333ed0d696ab9829ebfdaa78bfcc17d20054e930b20137138818e93c0fd0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
