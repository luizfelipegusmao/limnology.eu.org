{"title":"The Effect of an Interval Training Program on Aerobic and Anaerobic Indices of Adolescent Soccer Players","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2035/v1","date":1727336046000,"content":"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is widely used in team sports, particularly in soccer. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a short-term, progressive- load HIIT program on the performance of under-15 soccer players. The sample consisted of 30 adolescent soccer players, aged 14, who were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (CG, n=15) and the intervention group (EX, n=15), which performed additional HIIT sessions. The duration of the training program was six weeks, with progressive overload applied every two weeks. Performance indicators, including speed over 10 and 30 meters, change of direction (COD) to the right and left (505 right and left), maximal oxygen uptake (30-15IFT), and repeated sprint ability (RSA) (RSAtotal, RSAmean, RSAdecrement), were measured before and after the training program. Significant improvement were observed in the intervention group in COD (505 right and left), 30-15IFT, and RSAtotal and RSAmean (p=0.027, p=0.005, p=0, p=0.015, p=0.031, p=0.028, respectively). The findings of the present study suggest that a short-term, progressively overloaded HIIT program can enhance direction change ability, aerobic capacity, and repeated sprint performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2b319eca9d5d886392216d8fb9ab4a854b28e26a13f97118d6712bfa17a6736","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
