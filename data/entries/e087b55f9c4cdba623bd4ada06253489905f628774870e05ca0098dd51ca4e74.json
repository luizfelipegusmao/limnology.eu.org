{"title":"Live Iterative Ptychography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/1/103/7611447?rss=1","date":1708387200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We demonstrate live-updating ptychographic reconstruction with the extended ptychographical iterative engine, an iterative ptychography method, during ongoing data acquisition. The reconstruction starts with a small subset of the total data, and as the acquisition proceeds the data used for reconstruction are extended. This creates a live-updating view of object and illumination that allows monitoring the ongoing experiment and adjusting parameters with quick turn around. This is particularly advantageous for long-running acquisitions. We show that such a gradual reconstruction yields interpretable results already with a small subset of the data. We show simulated live processing with various scan patterns, parallelized reconstruction, and real-world live processing at the hard X-ray ptychographic nanoanalytical microscope PtyNAMi at the PETRA III beamline.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e087b55f9c4cdba623bd4ada06253489905f628774870e05ca0098dd51ca4e74","category":"Environment"}
