{"title":"Modeling the Dynamics of Pleasure, Pain, and Stress: A Neurochemical Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0623/v1","date":1728456002000,"content":"This article presents a mathematical model that captures the temporal dynamics of efficiencies in the responses to pleasure and pain, represented by $k_P(t)$ and $k_D(t)$, as well as the interaction factor $k_{PD}(t)$ between cortisol and dopamine. The model allows for the analysis of how these parameters evolve over time as a function of an individual's activities and physiological states, incorporating processes of tolerance, sensitization, and homeostasis. We present the updated differential equations, qualitative analyses, potential simulation scenarios, implications, and potential applications of the model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8260f28f5242e46c507633cdb2cf2410c2eb5168e90963c8aeaa5c2cb965693","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
