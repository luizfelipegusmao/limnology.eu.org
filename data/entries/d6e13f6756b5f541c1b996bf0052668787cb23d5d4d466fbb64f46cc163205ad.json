{"title":"Single nucleotide polymorphisms in SEPALLATA 2 underlie fruit length variation in cucurbits","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4607/7731807?rss=1","date":1723420800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Complete disruption of critical genes is generally accompanied by severe growth and developmental defects, which dramatically hinder its utilization in crop breeding. Identifying subtle changes, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in critical genes that specifically modulate a favorable trait is a prerequisite to fulfill breeding potential. Here, we found 2 SNPs in the E-class floral organ identity gene cucumber (<span>Cucumis sativus</span>) <span>SEPALLATA2</span> (<span>CsSEP2</span>) that specifically regulate fruit length. Haplotype (HAP) 1 (8<sup>G</sup>2667<sup>A</sup>) and HAP2 (8<sup>G</sup>2667<sup>T</sup>) exist in natural populations, whereas HAP3 (8<sup>A</sup>2667<sup>T</sup>) is induced by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. Phenotypic characterization of 4 near-isogenic lines and a mutant line showed that HAP2 fruits are significantly longer than those of HAP1, and those of HAP3 are 37.8% longer than HAP2 fruit. The increasing fruit length in HAP1-3 was caused by a decreasing inhibitory effect on <span>CRABS CLAW</span> (<span>CsCRC</span>) transcription (a reported positive regulator of fruit length), resulting in enhanced cell expansion. Moreover, a 7638<sup>G/A</sup>-SNP in melon (<span>Cucumis melo</span>) <span>CmSEP2</span> modulates fruit length in a natural melon population via the conserved <span>SEP2-CRC</span> module. Our findings provide a strategy for utilizing essential regulators with pleiotropic effects during crop breeding.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"d6e13f6756b5f541c1b996bf0052668787cb23d5d4d466fbb64f46cc163205ad","category":"Environment"}
