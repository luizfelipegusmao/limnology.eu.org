{"title":"Effect of Slaughter and Drying Temperatures on Protein Hydrolysis of Black Soldier Fly Larvae Meal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0465/v1","date":1715150638000,"content":"In recent years, the potential of insects has been explored as a sustainable protein alternative to sustain the growing world population. Differences in the way insects are processed can affect their proximate composition and digestibility. This work studies the effects of the combination of different types of slaughter methods and drying temperatures on the proximate composition, organic matter digestibility (OMd), hydrolysis degree (DH/NH2 and DH/100 g DM), total hydrolysis (TH) and hygienic sanitary study of BSFL (black soldier fly larvae). Four types of slaughter methods were used: frozen (F), blanched + frozen (B), Melacide® + frozen (M) and liquid nitrogen (N), each with three drying temperatures (50, 70 and 90 °C). A negative correlation between acid detergent fibre (ADF) and protein digestibility parameters was obtained. 70 °C was the most suitable drying temperature, as it reported higher values of protein digestibility (DH, TH), resulting in hygienic and sanitary conditions suitable for food use. Slaughtering with liquid nitrogen and blanching were more convenient than traditional freezing or the use of Melacide® to achieve higher protein digestibility results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6dd4d3b057f16a2b342df843989085ff778725af93f0df691e34df35e772264","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
