{"title":"Optimizing Fermentation Strategies for Enhanced Tryptophan Production in Escherichia coli: Integrating Genetic and Environmental Controls for Industrial Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2245/v1","date":1727576371000,"content":"Tryptophan is an essential aromatic amino acid widely used in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food industries. Microbial fermentation, mainly using Escherichia coli, has become the preferred method for its production due to sustainability and lower costs. Optimizing tryptophan production requires careful control of various fermentation parameters, including nutrients, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. Glucose, as the primary carbon source, must be fed at controlled rates to avoid metabolic overflow, which leads to byproduct accumulation and reduced production efficiency. Nitrogen sources, both organic (such as yeast extract) and inorganic (like ammonium), influence biomass growth and tryptophan yield, with ammonium levels requiring careful regulation to avoid toxic accumulation. Phosphate enhances growth but can lead to byproduct formation if used excessively. pH is another critical factor, with an optimal range between 6.5 and 7.2, where enzyme activity is maximized. Temperature control promotes growth and production, particularly between 33°C and 36°C. High DO levels increase tryptophan titers by boosting the pentose phosphate pathway and reducing byproducts like acetate. Furthermore, surfactants and supplements such as betaine monohydrate and citrate help alleviate osmotic stress and enhance precursor availability, improving production efficiency. Careful manipulation of these parameters allows for high-density cell cultures and significant tryptophan accumulation, making microbial fermentation competitive for large-scale production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c92c2845e420a8f83d0e315633dbb5507e6594b00a417ccb225717aa49beb364","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
