{"title":"Gestational Interrelationships among Gut-Metabolism-Transcriptome in Regulating Early Embryo Implantation and Placental Development in Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1652/v1","date":1724337401000,"content":"Decidualization of the uterine endometrium is a critical process for embryo implantation in mammals, primarily occurring on gestational day 8 in pregnant mice. However, the interplay between the maternal gut microbiome, metabolism, and the uterus at this specific time point remains poorly understood. This study employed a multi-omics approach to investigate the metabolic, gut microbiome, and transcriptomic changes associated with early pregnancy (gestational day 8 (E8)) in mice. Serum metabolomics revealed a distinct metabolic profile in E8 compared to controls, with differential metabolites primarily enriched in amino acid metabolism pathways. Gut microbial composition showed that E8 mice exhibited higher alpha-diversity and a significant shift of beta-diversity. Specifically, the E8 group displayed a decrease in pathogenic Proteobacteria and an increase in beneficial Bacteroidetes and S24-7 taxa. Transcriptomics identified myriads of distinct gene between E8 and control mice. The differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways involved in Alanine, Aspartate and Glutamate metabolism, PI3K-Akt signaling, and PPAR signaling pathway. Integrative analysis of the multi-omics data uncovered potential mechanistic relationships among the differential metabolites, gut microbiota, and uterine gene expression changes. Notably, the gene Asns showed strong correlations with specific gut S24-7 and metabolite L-Aspartatic acid, suggesting its potential role in mediating the crosstalk between the maternal environment and embryo development during early pregnancy. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between the maternal metabolome, gut microbiome, and uterine transcriptome in the context of early pregnancy, which may contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of embryo implantation and development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef20940a8432b85b687c3989cac1a11f47a78892fc3196783ef920f4929e90d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
