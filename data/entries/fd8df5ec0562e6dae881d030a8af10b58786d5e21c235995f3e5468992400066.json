Unlike flooding, there are limited national guidelines in Canada that provide recommendations on how to best assess riverine erosion hazards. Instead regional and local jurisdictions rely on techniques based on varying levels of policy maturity. The current study presents findings of a nationwide survey on Canadian perspectives on predicting river channel migration and river bank erosion which received more than 40 responses from across Canada. Results showed that predictions were used for a variety of purposes, but that confidence intervals were rarely reported. Aerial imagery and survey-based methods were the well-known and widely-used techniques for predicting river channel migration and river bank erosion. A majority of respondents identified both technical and financial challenges to improving accuracy including client willingness to pay, data quality/cost issues, and hydrologic changes due to land use and climate change. Several recommendations for improving best-practices are provided, with a focus on the development of erosion datasets, improving data access, and providing additional training opportunities.</p>","author":"C.
