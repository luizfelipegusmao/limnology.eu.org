{"title":"Gender-Difference in Response to Treatment with Liraglutide 3.0 mg","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0568/v1","date":1715232277000,"content":"Background: Gender differences characterize the prevalence and attitudes toward weight management. Despite limited evidence suggesting greater weight loss in women with anti-obesity pharmacotherapy, gender-specific analysis remains underexplored. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the gender-specific response to liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment in people with obesity without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: Data were collected from 47 patients (31 women, 16 men), with age &gt; 18 years, BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m^2, absence of T2D, and with exclusion of prior anti-obesity treatment, comorbidities, or bariatric surgery. Only patients who maintained the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose for at least 6 months were included. Results: Both sexes showed significant reductions in weight and BMI at 3 and 6 months. Men achieved greater weight loss (WL), BMI reduction, % WL, WL &gt;5% and &gt;10% than women, and they also showed more significant improvements in metabolic parameters (total and LDL cholesterol, Fibrosis-4 Index FIB-4). No significant gender differences were observed in glucose metabolism or renal function. Conclusion: This study showed a greater therapeutic effect of liraglutide 3.0 mg in men. Given men's higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and underrepresentation in clinical weight loss programs, these findings may increase male engagement and improve their CVD risk.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b1dbb6591d3336bb346953ba9d9a7448f1a57cbb6b41c6428e30f6c5dad0204","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
