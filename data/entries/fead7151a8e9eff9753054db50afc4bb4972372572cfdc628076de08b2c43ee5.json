Furthermore, we also introduce the work done on the unification of the gravitation and electromagnetic fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fead7151a8e9eff9753054db50afc4bb4972372572cfdc628076de08b2c43ee5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
