{"title":"Carbon Yield Model for a Makino Bamboo (Phyllostachys makinoi Hayata) Plantation by Various Thinning Intensities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1365/v1","date":1721204499000,"content":"This study aimed to develop a carbon yield model for a Makino bamboo plantation and addressed a monoculture Makino bamboo plantation in central Taiwan. We established a long-term trial to monitor the stand dynamic following thinning. A total of 16 plots were installed based on four thinning treatments, each sharing four plots. After thinning, data were collected from two investigations, resulting in 32 records. We calculated the number of culms (N), mean diameter at breast height (MDBH), and basal area (BA) for each record. An allometric function developed by previous research was used to predict aboveground biomass and to obtain aboveground carbon storage (AGCS). The model used the N, MDBH, and BA with various types (reciprocal and natural logarithm types) as independent variables to predict ln(AGCS) by the stepwise method. According to the Radj2 value, the best predictive models were: ln(ABCS) = -0.004 + 0.820 ln(MDBH) + 1.008 ln(BA), and ln(ABCS) = 7.550 - 0.820 ln(N) + 1.828 ln(BA). From these two models, we found the factors, either BA and MDBH or BA and N, can effectively predict AGCS. It indicated that stand density was critical in affecting AGCS, especially the variable BA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08fe6e9ae69efd31698fd3f9b24189f44a70773575f2d824eb6c1d0c3d7edad4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
