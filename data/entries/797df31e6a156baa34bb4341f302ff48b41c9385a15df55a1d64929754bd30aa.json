{"title":"Enhancing Collaborative Filtering with Deep Neural Networks and User Reviews","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1949/v1","date":1729776057000,"content":"In the era of information explosion in e-commerce, users face an overload problem. Recommender systems alleviate this by filtering target products based on user preferences. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a popular method but struggles with high-quality recommendations due to data sparsity. Utilizing review texts to capture user preferences has improved CF recommendations. This paper proposes a deep learning-based recommendation framework leveraging bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRUs) and an attention-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) structure. This framework addresses insufficient user rating data by utilizing user reviews to infer preferences. Experimental results on three datasets show that the proposed Bi-GRUCF model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 55.4% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over traditional methods and a 77.8% improvement over other deep learning approaches. This demonstrates the framework's superior recommendation quality, particularly in sparse data scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"797df31e6a156baa34bb4341f302ff48b41c9385a15df55a1d64929754bd30aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
