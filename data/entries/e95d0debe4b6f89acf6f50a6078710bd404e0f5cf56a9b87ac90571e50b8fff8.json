{"title":"Sustainability in Additive Manufacturing: Analyzing the Environmental Impact of Additive Manufacturing Processes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2573/v1","date":1722419469000,"content":"Sustainability in Additive Manufacturing (AM) is an emerging area of research that examines the environmental impacts and potential benefits of AM processes compared to traditional manufacturing methods. This paper analyzes the environmental footprint of additive manufacturing technologies, including material usage, energy consumption, and waste production. AM techniques, such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and selective laser sintering (SLS), are evaluated for their efficiency and sustainability. Key factors such as resource utilization, lifecycle emissions, and recyclability are assessed to determine how AM can contribute to a more sustainable manufacturing paradigm. The study highlights that while AM offers advantages such as reduced material waste and the potential for localized production, it also poses challenges, including high energy consumption and limited material options. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving the environmental performance of AM, including advancements in material science, energy-efficient technologies, and the integration of circular economy principles. By addressing these aspects, AM can play a significant role in achieving sustainability goals in manufacturing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e95d0debe4b6f89acf6f50a6078710bd404e0f5cf56a9b87ac90571e50b8fff8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
