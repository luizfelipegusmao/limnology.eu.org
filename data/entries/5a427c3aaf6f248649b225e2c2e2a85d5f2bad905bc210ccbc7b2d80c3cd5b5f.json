{"title":"Treatment of Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma Using RNAi and CRISPR Targeting the WNT Pathway","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0053/v1","date":1711958711000,"content":"Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a rare epithelial tumor located in the craniopharyngeal duct, often associated with high morbidity and a high long-term recurrence rate. ACP is predominantly diagnosed in children below the age of 15 and accounts for a majority of Craniopharyngioma cases in the United States. It is most commonly caused by a mutation in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene, which promotes overaccumulation of β-Catenin in the WNT pathway. As β-Catenin accumulates, it over-activates the transcription factor, causing an over-transcription of WNT proteins and uncontrolled cell growth. Current methods of treatment for ACP are centered around surgical intervention and radiotherapy, including gross-total resection (GTR), subtotal resection (STR), and a combination of subtotal resection and adjuvant radiotherapy (STR+XTR). These methods of treatment are associated with high risk due to the proximity of ACP to critical structures near the craniopharyngeal duct. High recurrence rates and morbidity are closely associated with current methods of treatment and other methods have yet to be attempted in craniopharyngioma. This review will explore two possible methods of non-surgical and non-radiological therapeutic interventions. The use of RNAi therapy and CRISPR may provide insight and be a potential way to treat ACP with increased quality of life and decreased recurrence rates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a427c3aaf6f248649b225e2c2e2a85d5f2bad905bc210ccbc7b2d80c3cd5b5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
