Ferritic P91 steel, known for its high creep strength, is often used for high-temperature applications such as steam pipes and boiler headers. However, its susceptibility to steam oxidation restricts its application temperatures below 620°C. [<a href=\"#ozae044.302-B1\">1</a>]. The junction of boiler headers typically involves the joining of P91 with austenitic stainless steel, leading to some crack formation primarily due to disparities in thermal expansion coefficients between the graded materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.302-B2\">2</a>]. In addition, the interface suffers from a steep fluctuation in the Carbon chemical potential gradient at the graded regions, resulting in Carbon depletion near to P91-rich side and causing premature failure during service. In this study, we fabricated graded joints between P91 and 347H alloys with the Directed Energy Deposition method and conducted creep testing at 650°C-100 MPa and 650°C-50 MPa. We analyzed the types and spatial distributions of precipitates and defects in pure alloy systems, as well as the transition zone, using a hierarchical examination approach. We determined the compositions of precipitates and identified preferential sites for crack formation. The mechanical testing of graded joints showed 478±16 MPa yield strength, which is comparable to P91 while higher than 347H steels which were conventionally produced. We investigated the microstructural evaluation under long-term creep exposure to determine its effect on carbide formation and chemical segregation by employing both low- and high-resolution imaging techniques. This study establishes the baseline properties of these joints in their as-fabricated condition and facilitates the development of new designs capable of joining alloys with incompatible melting temperatures and thermal expansion coefficients.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9b9c89995f614a197c3cbd2bb5cc1efacc7f017dd9b0bbb0ae7181958a35b81b","category":"Environment"}
