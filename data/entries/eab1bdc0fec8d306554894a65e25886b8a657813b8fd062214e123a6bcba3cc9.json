{"title":"Effect of Biochar Amendment and Organic Fertilization on the Yield and Nutritional Quality of Artichoke (Cynara cardunculus L.) Plants.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2315/v1","date":1722251790000,"content":"Organic fertilization is gaining importance as an alternative to chemical fertilization. However, the effects of organic products on crop quality need to be characterized, especially in those new products. Therefore, the effect of an enriched-biochar supplied with an organic fertilizer (Biochar) on yield and nutritional compounds of artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var scolymus) heads was analyzed and compared to inorganic conventional fertilization (Control). For that, number of fruits and their weights were determined together with nutritional properties of artichoke heads, as mineral content, fatty acids, content phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Results showed that biochar increased crop yield as registered by the higher number of marketable or commercial artichokes, as compared to the Control. Besides, biochar-treated plants presented significantly higher contents of Ca, Mg, and S, in the artichoke heads, but a decreased content of Co, Cu, and Zn. The fatty acids content in the Biochar-treated artichokes was also significantly higher, mainly because of the palmitic acid. On the contrary, the contents of phenolic compounds (e.g. flavonoids), were negatively and significantly affected by the Biochar application. In conclusion, the application of Biochar as soil amendment in combination with organic matter, for growing artichokes in the Semiarid Mediterranean area (e.g. Murcia Region) favoured an increasement in yield without comprising its nutritional composition. Further developments to establish protocols for extended use of Biochar in this agri-food production area are guaranteed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eab1bdc0fec8d306554894a65e25886b8a657813b8fd062214e123a6bcba3cc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
