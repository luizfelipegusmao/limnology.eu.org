Developing rapid and efficient testing methods was critical, especially for events with a high risk of virus spread. The queueing theory offers a powerful tool to manage the flow of people through testing centers. This study uses the M/M/c model to examine how different floor plan configurations impact the efficiency of RADT testing centers.\nAim of the study: This research applies queueing theory to optimize the Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Test (RADT) processes at mass gatherings. The study uses the M/M/c queueing model to evaluate the dynamics of RADT centers configured in U-shaped and straight-line layouts. The primary goal is to assess the feasibility of using RADTs efficiently at events and mass gathering entrances, aiming to enhance throughput and minimize wait times. \nMethodology: The study involved 500 healthy participants, managed by medical staff across a U-shaped and a straight floor plans. Agile management techniques were employed to enhance operational efficiency. The process stages included queue number issuance, registration, sample collection, sample mixing, and results dissemination.\nResults: Both floor plans enabled the completion of RADT screening in approximately 2 minutes per participant. The U-shaped layout slightly outperformed the straight-line setup in efficiency, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing the testing process. \nConclusion: This study confirms the feasibility of implementing Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Test (RADT) processes at mass gatherings. It was found that the U-shaped floor plan configuration is particularly effective, indicating its potential suitability for future mass testing scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41f5d8e96f93ef8f4d2e564d88f63ecdd71b66c75a378d3804f42976805a0f11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
