{"title":"Site selection for suitability of dam construction using analytic hierarchy process (AHP): A review study on rihand dam, uttar pradesh, india","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12517-024-12097-x","date":1728432000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Dam vulnerability analysis is a process that assesses the susceptibility of a dam to various risks, including structural failure, overtopping, and other potential hazards. In the present study, dam vulnerability analysis of Rihand Dam has been done using multi-proxy methods such as thematic layers (rainfall, lineaments, geomorphology, geology, soil, slope, drainage density, elevation, and land use/landcover) using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in the ArcGIS and ERDAS IMAGINE platforms. AHP and overlay weighting technique of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) to understand the terrain and geological features of the area help in evaluating the vulnerability of dam sites. The Rihand Dam is situated at a low elevation (159–278 m), which can fill during heavy rains causing uncontrolled water. Due to hydro pressure, water can penetrate micro lineament which can cause large cracks. The moderately ranked rainfall (722.232–729.98 mm/year) are surrounding the dam. The strike direction of the lineament/faults (0.665–1.327 km/km<sup>2</sup>) is parallel to the dam axis, which is favorable for the foundation of the dam. In the study area, there are 672 lineaments identified, predominantly oriented in an east–west strike direction, with some oriented northeast–southwest. Geologically, the dam is constructed on granite formations, which is considered more favorable for the dam site. Rihand Dam area is composed of loamy soil which is less erodible than sandy soil, which is important for dams. High drainage density can contribute to increased sediment transport in the watershed. This accumulation of sediment can reduce the storage capacity of the reservoir and increase the frequency of maintenance activities, resulting in a greater load of sediment being carried into the reservoir. Thus, dam vulnerability analysis is essential to ensuring the safety and functionality of dams, protecting downstream communities, and ecosystems to reducing the risks associated with dam failures, water resource management, flood control, and energy production.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"e6390bb4ca9e426eda7ff726c6ad7865d9d6c80f2a864b1ba288190ac6d24f88","category":"Environment"}
