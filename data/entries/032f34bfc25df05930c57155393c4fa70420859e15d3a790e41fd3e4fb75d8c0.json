{"title":"Genetic structure and demographic history of Anguilla bicolor from Tanzania based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequence: Implications for effective management and conservation strategies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4225?af=R","date":1721286000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nA genetic analysis was conducted on <i>Anguilla bicolor</i> from Tanzania using the mitochondrial COI region. The study aimed to understand the population genetic structure and demographic history of <i>A. bicolor</i>. In this study, 42 samples of <i>A. bicolor</i> were collected from the Lower Rufiji River Basin and Pangani River in Tanzania between January and June 2023. The mtDNA COI sequences of 65 <i>A. bicolor</i> from various Indo-Pacific countries were retrieved from GenBank. 2.\nThe findings revealed an overall high haplotype diversity (0.83 ± 0.033) and moderate nucleotide diversity (0.63% ± 0.000).\nA limited genetic differentiation between populations was observed (<i>F</i>\n<sub>ST</sub> = −0.00322, <i>p</i> = 0.0494), indicating gene flow, leading to an absence of population structure. The haplotype network tree also supported a panmictic stock in the Indo-Pacific region with 44 haplotypes clustered around three principal haplotypes.\nFurthermore, the significantly overall negative values of both Tajima's <i>D</i> (−2.27, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and Fu's Fs (−26.36, <i>p</i> = 0.000) and the multimodal mismatch distribution suggested the presence of multiple demographic events in <i>A. bicolor</i> populations.\nGiven the lack of substantial genetic structure among populations, managing the fishery as a single-stock unit is advised, aligning with the current fisheries management practices in Tanzania. It is also crucial to ensure habitat quality along migratory paths to facilitate genetic exchange and long-term species viability.\n</p>","author":"Farhiya Ismail Elmy, \nLydia Gaspare, \nProsper Laurent Mfilinge, \nJames Leonard Lusana","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"032f34bfc25df05930c57155393c4fa70420859e15d3a790e41fd3e4fb75d8c0","category":"Environment"}
