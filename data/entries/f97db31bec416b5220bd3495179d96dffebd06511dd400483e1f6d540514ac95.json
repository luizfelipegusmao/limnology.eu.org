{"title":"The impact of nuclear energy consumption and green technological innovation on the sustainable environment in the USA. The role of trade openness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1129/v1","date":1718609479000,"content":"Nuclear energy, along with renewable and alternative energy sources, is a crucial green energy source. However, the existing literature often overlooks the role of nuclear energy in achieving sustainable development goals. This study analyzes the impact of green technological innovation, nuclear energy consumption, and trade openness on environmental quality in the US, which consumed the most nuclear energy from 1990 to 2019. The ARDL bounds testing approach was applied for its effectiveness in smaller samples, suitable for the data set used in this study, to determine cointegration relationships. Additionally, the Toda-Yamamoto causality test was employed to explore causal links without requiring series stationarity or cointegration. The ARDL cointegration results indicate a significant long-term relationship between CO2 emissions, green technological innovation, nuclear energy consumption, and trade openness. The results suggest that promoting green technological innovation and nuclear energy (although this effect is less certain) can be effective strategies for reducing CO2 emissions, while the impact of trade openness requires careful consideration due to its potential to increase emissions. Green technological innovation has a significant unidirectional causal effect on CO2 emissions. These results will help policymakers design policies to achieve sustainable environmental goals in the US economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f97db31bec416b5220bd3495179d96dffebd06511dd400483e1f6d540514ac95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
