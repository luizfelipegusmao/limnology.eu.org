{"title":"A Conceptual Device Turning Quantum-Mechanical Interactions into Macroscopically Observable Events","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1082/v1","date":1715849164000,"content":"The paper is concerned with the concept of elementary observations (EO). EOs are experimental answers to the question whether a matter-instrument interaction had taken place at the micro-scale of quantum phenomena. Focusing on the specific case of photon detection, we show that during their lifetimes EOs proceed through the four phases of initiation, detection, erasure and reset. Once generated, the observational value of EOs can be measured in units of the Planck quantum of physical action h=4.136×10^(-15) eVs. Once terminated, each unit of entropy of size k_B=8.617×10^(-5)  eV⁄K, which had been created in the instrument during the observational phase, needs to be removed from the instrument to ready it  for a  new round of photon detection. This withdrawal of entropy takes place at an energetic cost of  at least two units of the Landauer minimum energy bound of E_La=ln⁡〖(2) k_B T_D 〗 for each unit of entropy of size k_B.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"519edd1543e47f69e7d3c77f7d9192a188642e3413c9d791e830c5129eb16a53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
