{"title":"A Mini-Review on Diagnostic Methods for Antigen and Antibody Detection of Rocky Mountain and Brazilian Spotted Fever","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1812/v1","date":1714273183000,"content":"Rocky Mountain or Brazilian spotted fever, caused by Ricketsia ricketssi, is a fulminant, seasonal, and neglected disease that occurs in focal points of North America and South America. Rapid detection are essential for a better prognosis and survival rate of the infected individual. However, disease diagnosis still faces challenges as the accuracy of many of the available laboratory tests fluctuates. Therefore, this review aimed to identify methods for antibody or antigen detection, its gaps, and evolution over time. A search was conducted to find all studies in the Pubmed database that described antibody or antigen detection for Ricketsia ricketsii infection. Initially, a total of 403 articles were screened. Of these articles, only 19 fulfilled the pre-established inclusion criteria and were selected. Among the different methods applied, the IFA technique was the one most frequently found in the studies. However, it presented varied results such as low specificity using the indirect method. Other techniques, such as ELISA and immunohistochemistry, were also found, although in smaller numbers and with their own limitations. Although some studies showed promising results, there is a pressing need to find new techniques to develop a rapid and effective Ricketsia ricketssi infection diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"676cd0e9dd168436790866bacd60aa84eaf3997fc2a72b417db9aac5871792fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
