{"title":"Dietary Exposure to Pesticide and Veterinary Drugs Residues and Their Effects on Human Fertility and Embryo Development: A Global Overview","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0752/v1","date":1723511882000,"content":"Drug residues that contaminate food and water represent a serious concern for human health, since their irrational use is constantly increasing the amplitude of exposure. Multiple sources contribute to the overall exposure to contaminants, including agriculture, domestic use, personal, public, and veterinary healthcare, increasing the possible origin of contamination. In this review, we focus on crop pesticides and veterinary drug residues because of their extensive use in modern agriculture and farming, which ensures food production and security for the ever-growing population around the world. We discuss crop pesticides and veterinary drug residues with respect to their worldwide distribution and impacts, with special attention on their harmful effects on human reproduction and embryo development, as well as their link to epigenetic alterations, leading to intergenerational and transgenerational diseases. Among the contaminants, the most commonly implicated in causing such disorders are organophosphates, glyphosate and antibiotics, with tetracyclines being the most frequently reported. This review highlights the importance of finding new management strategies for pesticides and veterinary drugs. Moreover, due to the still limited knowledge on inter- and transgenerational effects of these contaminants, we underlie the need to strengthen research in this field, so as to better clarify the specific effects of each contaminant and their long-term impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b7ee54f98e5c9749928a8f75a87f135b10c2e512bf46e32f4c0df8bc3c620a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
