{"title":"210 Sleeping beauties: A daily time budget for individually housed research pigs at 6-d of age","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/6/7664776?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The pre-wean period of development is difficult to manage and can impact the success of subsequent production stages. Behavior observations can provide insight into the health and welfare status of animals and allow for efficient and timely management interventions. A validated time budget can be utilized as a baseline for further comparisons and the detection of changes in behavior over time. In this project, 24-h of video data for 21 individually housed research pigs at 6 d of age was evaluated using a validated behavior ethogram. The behavior ethogram contained 5 main categories (inactive, consumption, exploratory, social, and other) and 23 behavior labels. The ethogram was applied using a validated sampling strategy, which included 5-min continuous sampling intervals at the start of each hour for active behaviors and 5-min instantaneous sampling intervals for inactive behaviors. The data from each behavior observation was quantified into durations and presented as percentage of observations spent performing a specific behavior label within the observation period. The daily time budget revealed the following time occupation across the 5 main behavior categories: inactive, 98.60% (lying, 85.43%; not lying, 13.14%); consumption, 0.30%; exploratory, 0.97%; social, 0.01%, and other, 0.12%. As expected for very young pigs, most of the day was inactive, with almost 21 h lying. The most performed behavior was “lying socially”, and this behavior represented 38.48% of the overall daily time budget. The remaining 46.95% of time spent lying was spent “lying sternal”, “lying lateral”, or “lying on an object” in the pen. The pigs are housed individually, but they are able to see, hear, and smell a neighboring pig through a plexiglass barrier. The behavior observation “lying socially” is defined as follows: “The piglet is lying (sternal or lateral) touching the plexiglass barrier. The piglet in the adjacent pen is lying directly on the other side of the barrier, and the piglets would be touching each other if the barrier was not in place.” This observation provides insight into the importance of social resting for young pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8a42a28ea7374e07d95a668e3e86aae939171f4e6818adcdb2007e0a789ed79d","category":"Environment"}
