Most cases of Van Wyk Grumbach syndrome present in women, and classic hypothyroidism symptoms always precede the diagnosis; 11% of patients have Down Syndrome, sometimes tumor markers get elevated, and some develop severe symptoms (myopathy, short stature, mental delay, ascites, pericardial effusion, Cullen sign, pituitary hyperplasia, and severe anemia), that respond to levothyroxine treatment; Conclusions: Children with peripheral precocious puberty and gonadal masses, must be studied for hypothyroidism before any radical decision is made.
