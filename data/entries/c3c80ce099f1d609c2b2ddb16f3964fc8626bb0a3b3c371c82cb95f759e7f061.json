{"title":"Evaluating serum and salivary free light chains levels as a potential indicator of acute kidney injury post cardiac surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1194/v1","date":1715950688000,"content":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication post-cardiac surgery, impacting short- and long-term survival. Free light chains (FLCs) are being explored as markers for assessing kidney damage risk. A study aimed to validate early AKI detection by studying FLCs (kappa, lambda, and kappa/lambda ratio) in serum and saliva samples. Clinical data was collected from 149 patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Baghdad. Ninety of these patients provided saliva samples in addition to serum samples for free light chain evaluation. Patients were grouped by proteinuria severity. Serum kappa levels were significantly higher in severe proteinuria patients compared to mild or no proteinuria. Salivary kappa levels were significantly higher in mild proteinuria patients compared to severe or no proteinuria. Salivary lambda levels decreased with increasing proteinuria severity. Serum kappa increase could be due to immune system activation and kidney compromise. Both serum and salivary kappa showed good predictive ability for post-surgery AKI prognosis compared to lambda and the kappa/lambda ratio, depending upon ROC performance. The study suggests FLCs, especially kappa, could be valuable in early AKI detection post-cardiac surgery, indicating potential for improved patient outcomes through proactive monitoring and intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3c80ce099f1d609c2b2ddb16f3964fc8626bb0a3b3c371c82cb95f759e7f061","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
