{"title":"A microbial perspective on speciation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/evolinnean/kzae023/7757984?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding what a microbial species is and the process of speciation in microbes has been and still is a puzzle with many challenges. But there is now emerging consensus that speciation in microbes does follow certain rules and limitations. Just like in macrobes, it can be driven by divergent natural selection and is maintained by barriers to gene flow, either genetic or ecological in nature. However, whether microbial speciation mirrors that of sexually reproducing eukaryotes is up for debate, as extensive horizontal gene flow can blur patterns and processes. Here, I provide intriguing examples of speciation in bacteria, viruses, and yeast, which are arguably similar to what we see in eukaryotes. I synthesize recent insights from microbial evolutionary genomics, which may mitigate the traditional view that microbes are ‘messy’ and do not fit eukaryotic species concepts and speciation models. Finally, I highlight the benefits of microbial experimental evolution to answer fundamental questions in speciation research (especially why, how, and when speciation occurs). Speciation research with microbes, as opposed to the organisms traditionally used in this field, may suffer less from observational bias and the experimental control we have over selection types, gene flow, and reproductive modes in microbial systems may allow us to determine the mechanisms and timing of ecological divergence, reproductive isolation, and speciation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"3a6bf3189332aa8d860b0369d5aa2ac065f7385b7c3f4543469ad2a55950d26a","entryHash":"c59be5bf241439d13905aaf2508f5dcf38994f93a62ace2d8742baf6be80b93c","category":"Environment"}
