{"title":"Properties of a Pressureless Sintered 2Y-TZP Material Combining High Strength and Toughness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1607/v1","date":1716532688000,"content":"Yttria stabilized zirconia materials are frequently used in mechanical engineering and biomedical applications. Demanding loading conditions require materials combining a high level of strength and fracture toughness. A ready to press alumina doped 2 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia powder was shaped by axial pressing and sintering in air at 1250 - 1500 °C for 2 h. The best combination of strength and toughness value of 7.8 MPa√m. Materials sintered in the middle of the chosen temperature range combine fully density, high transformability and small grain size. Toughness measurements by direct crack length measurements delivered unrealistically high fracture toughness values.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c16989bd039d01b5c2f1fe04614c0dbcf9e58c2da6989cc82fcd01b5137a8b62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
