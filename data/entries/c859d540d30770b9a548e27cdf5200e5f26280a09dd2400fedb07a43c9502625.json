Crystallography is commonly used to determine the structure of proteins, organic and inorganic molecules, and other materials by analyzing the diffraction patterns formed when X-rays or electron beams pass through them. While X-ray crystallography has been the go-to method for many years, it requires large, well-ordered crystals, which can be challenging to obtain for certain materials like membrane proteins [<a href=\"#ozae044.936-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c859d540d30770b9a548e27cdf5200e5f26280a09dd2400fedb07a43c9502625","category":"Environment"}
