{"title":"Towards the Sustainability of Electric Vehicles in Africa: An Overview","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0394/v1","date":1722930084000,"content":"In recent years, the introduction of electric vehicles as a means of transportation has been gradually growing in most developing and developed countries, especially in terms of energy efficiency, energy diversification, and environmental sustainability. While developed countries have been trying to keep up with electric vehicle usage and buying trends, most developing countries, especially African countries, are still riddled with severe power outages and electricity load shedding. The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to a corresponding increase in the availability of charging infrastructure, thereby exerting notable impacts on the power grids of most African countries. Recent evidence suggests that various charging strategies and grid integration approaches are being developed to mitigate the negative impacts of electric vehicle (EV) charging and enhance the advantages of integrating EVs with the grid. However, transportation researchers have struggled to develop applicable and sensible mitigation strategies to tackle this issue, which has seriously rendered the sustainability of electric vehicle usage in Africa in serious doubt. The primary aim of this research is to provide a conceptual theoretical framework based on previous and current literature reviews on electric vehicles to examine the challenges facing the adoption of electric vehicles in Africa. In addition, we explored the environmental and economic benefits of electric vehicles in Africa regarding urban sustainability and charging infrastructure on the existing transportation infrastructure in the African transportation network. This study contributes to the expanding body of literature on electric vehicles by emphasising the significance of incorporating sustainability principles in the adoption and usage of electric vehicles in Africa. It also examines the effects of electric vehicle usage on the existing transportation infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e80fe278b5a995e2c5e4b5c1870a44eebae7b1355dfa642ebcf9fa8fed1c695","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
