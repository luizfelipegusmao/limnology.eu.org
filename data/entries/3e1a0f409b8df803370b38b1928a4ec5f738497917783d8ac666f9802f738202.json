{"title":"Exploring the extraction, functional properties, and industrial applications of papain from Carica papaya","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13776?af=R","date":1722337445000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Papain a protease enzyme naturally present in the <i>Carica papaya</i> has gained significant interest across several industries due to its unique properties and versatility. The unique structure of papain imparts the functionality that assists in elucidating how papain enzyme works and making it beneficial for a variety of purposes. This review highlights recent advancements in papain extraction techniques to enhance production efficiency to meet market demand. The extraction of papain from the <i>Carica papaya</i> plant offers various advantages such as cost-effectiveness, biodegradability, safety, and the ability to withstand a wide range of pH and temperature conditions. Key findings reveal that non-conventional papain extraction techniques offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, product quality, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, papain treatment enhances the value of final products due to its anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, and anti-obesity properties. The ability of papain to hydrolyze a wide range of proteins across various conditions makes it a suitable protease enzyme. While the study emphasizes the advantages of papain, the study also acknowledges limitations such as the continuous research and development to optimize extraction processes which will help unlock papain's potential and meet the growing demand.
