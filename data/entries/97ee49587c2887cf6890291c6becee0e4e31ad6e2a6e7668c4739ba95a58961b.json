{"title":"Approaches to Enhance the Potency of Poultry Vaccines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2319/v1","date":1727600828000,"content":"Outbreaks of avian pathogens such as Newcastle disease virus, avian influenza virus and Salmonella have a major impact on economies and food security worldwide. Some pathogens also pose a significant zoonotic potential, especially avian influenza viruses. Vaccination plays a key role in controlling many poultry diseases and there are many vaccines licenced in the United Kingdom for diseases of poultry caused by viruses, bacteria, and parasites. However, these vaccines often do not provide complete protection and can cause unwanted side effects. Several factors affect the potency of poultry vaccines including the type of vaccination used, the mechanism of delivery and the use of adjuvants. Advancements in technology have led to the study and development of novel vaccines and vaccine adjuvants for use in poultry. These induce stronger immune responses compared to current vaccine technology and have the potential to protect against multiple poultry diseases. This review aims to discuss existing poultry vaccine technology, the effect of delivery mechanisms of vaccine efficacy, the use of current and novel adjuvants, the ability to target antigen to antigen presenting cells, the use of probiotics, multivalent vaccines, and nanotechnology to enhance the potency of poultry vaccines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97ee49587c2887cf6890291c6becee0e4e31ad6e2a6e7668c4739ba95a58961b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
