{"title":"Considerations in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Post-Traumatic Neuropathic Pain: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0148/v1","date":1717490394000,"content":"This study aims to provide an updated overview of the systematic evaluation and management of Post-Traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain (PTTN) resulting from dental procedures or trauma. PTTN arises following an injury to the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensory and motor functions in the maxillofacial region. The etiology encompasses various dental procedures and craniofacial trauma, leading to a spectrum of symptoms, from tingling to severe pain. Diagnostic challenges stem from the absence of standardized criteria and the overlap with focal neuralgia, necessitating comprehensive evaluation. Misdiagnosis can result in prolonged suffering and unnecessary procedures. Successful management hinges on prompt diagnosis and interdisciplinary collaboration, with early intervention crucial in mitigating chronicity. While nerve recovery post-trauma is challenging, preventive measures through accurate evaluation and treatment are paramount. Â Management for PTTN includes non-invasive and surgical interventions. Non-invasive intervention includes systematic and local pharmacological management. This review enhances uniformity in PTTN evaluation and treatment approaches despite standardized study limitations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f6a135d98b34dd8c954a993df67996ee166566614ec5aa5a2e96c3380f8dc59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
