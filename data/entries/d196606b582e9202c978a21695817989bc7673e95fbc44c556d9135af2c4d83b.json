{"title":"Synthesising a network of evidence on a seabird bycatch mitigation measure","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12864?af=R","date":1727103088000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Robust estimates of the relative efficacies of alternative management interventions are essential for developing evidence-informed fisheries bycatch policy. Bycatch is a major threat to the conservation of albatrosses and other pelagic seabirds. Branchline weighting is one approach prescribed by regional fisheries management organisations and the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. We used a Bayesian multilevel network meta-regression modelling approach to conduct the first synthesis of available evidence to assess the relative efficacies at mitigating seabird bycatch of alternative pelagic longline weighting designs. Unlike conventional pairwise meta-analysis, network meta-analysis enables the simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions within a coherent modelling framework. There was a &gt; 97% probability that all weighting designs significantly reduced seabird bycatch compared to a reference design with no weight within 5 m of the hook. Nonetheless, some weighting designs were significantly more effective at reducing seabird bycatch than others—for instance, the 2 designs with weights &gt;60 g and &gt;1 m from the hook performed the best with &gt;93% probability that those 2 designs performed significantly better than 2 more commonly used designs with less weight but attached closer to the hook. These two best performing designs reduced seabird bycatch by <i>ca</i> 89% relative to the reference design. These relative efficacies and rankings, when combined with other performance criteria such as costs to commercial viability and crew safety, support robust evaluations of alternative bycatch management strategies.</p>","author":"Eric Gilman, \nMilani Chaloupka, \nIgor Debski, \nMi Ae Kim, \nEric Kingma, \nDaisuke Ochi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3de509ad0f312c77d6dd4d37070c89263edb7695bf1d0e15e1eb17cfd4455e34","entryHash":"d196606b582e9202c978a21695817989bc7673e95fbc44c556d9135af2c4d83b","category":"Environment"}
