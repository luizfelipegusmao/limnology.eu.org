The fossil record and subsequently our knowledge of this clade is heavily skewed by the wealth of material from Lower Cretaceous deposits in China. In contrast, specimens from Upper Cretaceous deposits are rare and typically fragmentary, yet critical for understanding the extinction of this clade across the K-Pg boundary. The most complete North American Late Cretaceous enantiornithine is <i>Mirarce eatoni</i>, a member of the diverse clade Avisauridae. Except for <i>Mirarce</i>, avisaurids are known only from isolated hindlimb elements from North and South America. Here we describe three new enantiornithines from the Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation, two of which represent new avisaurid taxa. These materials represent a substantial increase in the known diversity of Enantiornithes in the latest Cretaceous. Re-examination of material referred to Avisauridae through phylogenetic analysis provides strong support for a more exclusive Avisauridae consisting of six taxa. Exploration of the functional morphology of the avisaurid tarsometatarsus indicates potential strong constriction and raptorial attributes. The lower aspect ratio of the tarsometatarsus facilitates a more biomechanically efficient lever system which in extant birds of prey equates to lifting proportionally heavier prey items. In addition, the proportional size and distal position of the <i>m</i>. <i>tibialis cranialis</i> tubercle of the tarsometatarsus is similar to the morphology seen in extant birds of prey. Together with the deeply-grooved metatarsal trochlea facilitating robust and likely powerful pedal digits, morphologies of the hindlimb suggest avisaurids as Late Cretaceous birds of prey.","author":"Alexander D.
