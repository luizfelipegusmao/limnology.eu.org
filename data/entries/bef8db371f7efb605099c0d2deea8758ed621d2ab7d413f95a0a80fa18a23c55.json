Since the rice MCs do not form palisade or spongy tissue cells and are considered monotypic cells, the structural analysis of MCs in the middle part of the leaf tissue has been done, neglecting the various shapes of MCs can be observed on the cross-section of rice leaves. Moreover, the middle MC layer is sandwiched between the upper and lower layers and is more restricted in its demand for light and CO<sub>2</sub> entering from the outside. Therefore, the different layers of MCs may differ in their sensitivity to salt stress that causes structural changes in cells. This study aims to elucidate the intra- and extra-cellular structures of MC in different layers of leaf tissue and determine how salinity affects the MC structure in each layer. The mesophyll tissue was divided into adaxial, middle and abaxial layers, and eight MCs and chloroplast regions were selected from each layer and reconstructed into three-dimensional (3D) representations. The whole leaf anatomical and physiological parameters were measured to find the effects of salinity stress on the MC structures. As a result, the 3D analysis of rice leaf tissue revealed the different structures of MCs with greater diversity in the adaxial and abaxial layers than in the middle layer. Salinity stress reduced the size and height of the MCs and coverage of the chloroplast on the cytoplasm periphery of the adaxial and abaxial layers, as well as the chloroplast size of adaxial MCs. Overall, these results reveal the variation of rice MC in leaf tissue and suggest the higher sensitivity to salt stress in the adaxial mesophyll among the layers, which may partly account for the decrease in photosynthetic capacity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"bef8db371f7efb605099c0d2deea8758ed621d2ab7d413f95a0a80fa18a23c55","category":"Environment"}
