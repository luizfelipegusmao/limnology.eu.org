{"title":"Challenges and potential for detecting and quantifying titanium dioxide in food","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13356?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is banned in some countries but its use is still permitted in others. The global food supply chain is therefore challenged with the need to use rapid and reliable testing methods to either detect the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> or to quantify its concentration. The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of using color, texture profile analysis, Raman microscopy, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy to detect and quantify TiO<sub>2</sub> in fillings used in the pastry and confectionery industry. In this study, two types of fillings were investigated: vanilla based and chocolate based. All fillings were prepared in four different variations – without TiO<sub>2</sub> and with three concentrations as follows: 0.25 g*kg<sup>-1</sup>, 0.5 g*kg<sup>-1</sup>, or 0.75 g*kg<sup>-1</sup> TiO<sub>2</sub> per sample. The methods were selected for their ability to analyze the samples in a short period of time.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>All of the methods showed moderate to high potential for detecting TiO<sub>2</sub> in the samples. The results reveal how TiO<sub>2</sub> affects the food matrix color and texture. Use of Raman microscopy confirms its detectability, although concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> do not follow a pattern. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy showed the greatest potential as it can not only detect TiO<sub>2</sub> but can also quantify its concentration in the samples.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>The highest potential for quantifying the concentration of this food additive was achieved with XRF. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ilija Djekic, \nSteva Lević, \nNada Smigic, \nArthur Bouleau, \nKonstantin Ilijević, \nJovana Roganović, \nVesna Rakic","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6d6b553a29c8019a2c0553531b9337da0f9ff11d01a0c494d22743d5f12bd967","category":"Environment"}
