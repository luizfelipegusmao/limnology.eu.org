The state of dormancy protects the HSC pool from exhaustion throughout life; however, excessive dormancy may prevent an efficient response to hematological stresses. Despite the significance of dHSCs, the mechanisms maintaining their dormancy remain elusive. Here, we identify CD38 as a novel and broadly applicable surface marker for the enrichment of murine dHSCs. We demonstrate that cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR), the product of CD38 cyclase activity, regulates the expression of the transcription factor c-Fos by increasing the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequently, we uncover that c-Fos induces the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p57<sup>Kip2</sup> to drive HSC dormancy. Moreover, we found that CD38 ecto-enzymatic activity at the neighboring CD38-positive cells can promote human HSC quiescence. Together, CD38/cADPR/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/c-Fos/p57<sup>Kip2</sup> axis maintains HSC dormancy. Pharmacological manipulations of this pathway can provide new strategies to improve the success of stem cell transplantation and blood regeneration after injury or disease.","author":"Liliia Ibneeva","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"2849eb35b6e65b40d85a115a3c025e62a5d558f3224950f45fc4dad6c8fccc97","category":"Environment"}
