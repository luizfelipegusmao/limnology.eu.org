{"title":"Effect of Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Stimulation on Splenomegaly and IgE Levels in an DNCB-Induced Atopic Dermatitis Mouse Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1798/v1","date":1711704330000,"content":"Effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on immunological factors in a 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis (AD) model were investigated. Hairless mice were randomly assigned to control, acetone and olive oil solution-treated (AOO), PEMF 15 Hz, PEMF 75 Hz, and sham groups (n=5 each). AOO solution was used to dissolve DNCB. Both PEMF and sham groups were exposed to similar DNCB doses, causing similar AD symptoms. After AD induction for five weeks, only the PEMF group was exposed to PEMF stimulations (15 Hz, 75 Hz, and 15 mT) for two weeks inside the solenoid coil. In both groups, splenomegaly was observed, as AD was induced by hyperimmune reactions caused by DNCB sensitization. However, splenomegaly did not occur in the PEMF-exposed groups, and spleen weight decreased similarly to that of the control. Hence, the total splenocytes in the PEMF group were similar to those in the control group, whereas the sham group showed thrice the number of splenocytes compared to the PEMF group. The serum immunoglobulin E levels did not significantly change in the PEMF group; however, they increased more than fourfold in the sham group. These results demonstrate that PEMF stimulation ameliorates the abnormal symptoms caused by hyperimmune reactions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ae52c7ba8fd313c5e5f7e0f6674a0e94ff3ae7869dd86776043976c4c11e7ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
