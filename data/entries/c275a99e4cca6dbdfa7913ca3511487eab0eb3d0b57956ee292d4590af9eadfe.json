Giving birth at a health facility is crucial to prevent these complications. Hence, this study aimed to assess the pregnant women’s intentions to give birth at a health facility and associated factors in the Aleta-Wondo rural District, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 421 pregnant women. Data were collected by using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epidata 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to assess the presence and strength of association. A p-value ≤0.05 was applied to declare statistical significance. Generally, 61.3% (95% CI: 57.0, 66.3) of the respondents intended to give birth in a health facility. Receiving information from health professionals (AOR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.4), perceived threats (AOR = 4.5; 95% CI: 2.6, 7.6), perceived benefits (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.9), perceived barriers (AOR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.7) were factors significantly associated with pregnant women’s intention. Pregnant women’s intention to give birth in a healthcare setting is low in the study area. Strengthening information communication with healthcare professionals and reducing threats and barriers that affect pregnant women’s intentions is essential. Moreover, we recommend further research with mixed methods.","author":"Aregahegn Dona","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"c275a99e4cca6dbdfa7913ca3511487eab0eb3d0b57956ee292d4590af9eadfe","category":"Environment"}
