Besides cancer cells, oocytes are in the focus of those investigations. The study of oocytes is relevant for two areas: on the one hand, the quality of mammalian oocytes is important in artificial reproduction technology for a high fertilization yield. On the other hand, amphibian oocytes are well established to be used as host cells for the characterization of ion-channel kinetics for drug screening. For both areas, easy-to-perform and reliable characterization techniques are needed. This mini-review summarizes important developments of characterizing oocytes with microfluidic systems in combination with observer-independent noninvasive electrical sensing. Such miniaturized microfluidic systems can be improved to facilitate multiple oocyte characterizations simultaneously for higher throughput screening.</p>","author":"Uwe Schnakenberg, \nYuan Cao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"e2a1aa0eddb73f928f05dfdef61cf3c6c252a288310d655b189119456b2202ff","category":"Environment"}
