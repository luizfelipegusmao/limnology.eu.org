{"title":"Process of Object-Oriented Design of Gear Size Ranges. Part II: Synthesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1138/v1","date":1715912510000,"content":"Design process can be divided into stages of analysis and synthesis. This paper presents the application of the object-oriented technique to the synthesis as well as theoretical considerations concerning to design of gear size ranges. The synthesis consists in composition (aggregation) of single details into units – according to the rule: “from details up to general view”. The basics of the object-oriented synthesis were formulated. Furthermore, the consecutive stages of synthesis were formulated. The interactions between these stages were discussed. Some aspects were described in details e.g.: creation of interfaces for performance of the embodiment phase the designed artefact via CAD system drawing with specification (dimensions are still parametrically set). The final step of the procedure is creation of so called substantial (concrete) form of artifacts i.e. final assignment of dimensions which stored in the special data base. The final stage of the design process is issuing of technical documentation (technical drawings) created automatically via CAD system. The considerations are terminated by the list of advantages connected with the object-oriented approach to design (in comparison to the traditional way).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57365b5374a8300652a32421e614426c2672a0febda4cfb5e7e1e4c72b6251a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
