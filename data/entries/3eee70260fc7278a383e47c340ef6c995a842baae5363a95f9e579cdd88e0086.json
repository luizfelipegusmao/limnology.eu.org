Recent definitions emphasize the need of a broader perspective that encompasses cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFS) and lifestyle components which can be considered partial contributors to optimal brain health. In this study, we aimed to establish the association and risk detected by a Brain Health Index and the risk of possible vascular dementia (PVD) using data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) 2012–2015. The MHAS is a longitudinal study of adults aged ≥ 50 years. We analyzed the data obtained between 2012 and 2015. CVRFS included in the index were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction, depression, obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking history. A PVD diagnosis was established when scores in the Cross-Cultural Cognitive Examination were below reference norms and limitations in ≥1 instrumental activities of daily living and a history of stroke were present. A multinomial regression model was developed to determine the association between BHI scores and PVD. In 2015, 75 PVD cases were identified. Mean age was 67.1 ±13.2 years, 35.8% were female, and the mean educational level was 5.8 ±5.5 years. In cases with a higher score in the BHI, the model revealed a hazards ratio of 1.63 (95% CI: 1.63–1.64, p&lt; 0.001) for PVD. In this longitudinal study, with the use of a feasible multifactorial BHI in the Mexican population, a greater score was associated with a 1.63-fold risk of developing PVD during the 3-year follow-up, while the risk for stroke was 1.75. This index could potentially be used to predict the risk of PVD in adults with modifiable CVRFS.","author":"Sara G.
