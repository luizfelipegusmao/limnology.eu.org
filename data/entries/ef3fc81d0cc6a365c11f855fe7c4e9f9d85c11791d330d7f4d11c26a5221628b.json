{"title":"Comparative Studies of Bioactivities and Chemical Components in Fresh and Black Garlics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1563/v1","date":1711449238000,"content":"To investigate the bioactivities of fresh garlic and its processed product, black garlic, we conducted comparative analyses of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, innate immune activation and anti-cancer activities, in addition to chemical composition (sugar, amino acid, polyphenol contents) of these materials. Simultaneous assay using neutrophil-like cells showed that fresh garlic exhibited antioxidant and innate immunostimulatory activities, whereas black garlic displayed a potent anti-inflammatory effect. The antioxidant activity index was correlated with phenol and flavonoid contents, while the innate immunostimulatory activity was correlated with fructan content. Furthermore, some black garlics with low fructose content were found to inhibit the proliferation of UM-UC-3 cancer cells, while other black garlics rich in fructose increased UM-UC-3 cell proliferation. It was shown that the thermal processing steps of fresh garlic could change the composition of sugars, antioxidants, and amino acids, which have different effects on neutrophil-like cells and UM-UC-3 cells, as well as on bioactivities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef3fc81d0cc6a365c11f855fe7c4e9f9d85c11791d330d7f4d11c26a5221628b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
