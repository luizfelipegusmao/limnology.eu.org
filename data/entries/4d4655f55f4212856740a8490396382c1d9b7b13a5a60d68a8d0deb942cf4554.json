{"title":"A Note on Oppermann's Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1161/v1","date":1723770022000,"content":"A prime gap is the difference between consecutive prime numbers. The $n^{\\text{th}}$ prime gap, denoted $g_{n}$, is calculated by subtracting the $n^{\\text{th}}$ prime from the $(n+1)^{\\text{th}}$ prime: $g_{n}=p_{n+1}-p_{n}$. Oppermann's conjecture is a prominent unsolved problem in pure mathematics concerning prime gaps. Despite verification for numerous primes, a general proof remains elusive. If true, the conjecture implies that prime gaps grow at a rate bounded by $g_{n}&lt;{\\sqrt {p_{n}}}$. This note presents a proof of Oppermann's conjecture using the Euler-Maclaurin formula on harmonic numbers. This proof simultaneously establishes Andrica's, Legendre's, and Brocard's conjectures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d4655f55f4212856740a8490396382c1d9b7b13a5a60d68a8d0deb942cf4554","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
