{"title":"Real-World Outcomes of Atezolizumab With Bevacizumab Treatment in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients: Effectiveness, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Utilization and Bleeding Complications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0186/v1","date":1719892874000,"content":"The IMbrave150 trial established atezolizumab with bevacizumab (A+B) as standard care for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), recommending an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 6 months of treatment initiation to prevent bleeding from esophagogastric varices. The necessity of mandatory EGD for all patients remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 112 HCC patients treated with A+B at five Canadian cancer centers from July 1, 2020, to August 31, 2022. A+B was the first-line therapy for 90% of patients, with median overall survival at 20.3 months and progression-free survival at 9.6 months. There was no survival difference between patients with bleeding and those without. Before A+B, 71%(79) of patients underwent an EGD within 6 months, revealing varices in 41%(32) and requiring intervention in 19%(15). The overall bleeding rate was 15%(17), with GI-specific bleeding occurring in 83%(5) of the EGD group and 17%(1) of the non-EGD group (p=0.24). Non-GI bleeding was observed in 10%(11) of patients. Outcomes for HCC patients treated with A+B in Canada were comparable to IMbrave150. Our study showed twice the rate of varices detection and treatment compared to IMbrave150, reflecting real-world treatment of high-risk populations. There was no increased GI bleeding in patients without pre-treatment EGD, supporting a selective EGD approach.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a44057f6f39f709fe20e45f30feb3cccfc34c79b3a713da0ed9400cafa12de01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
