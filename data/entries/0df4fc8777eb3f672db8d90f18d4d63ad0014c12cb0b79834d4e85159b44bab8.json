{"title":"Enhancing Sustainability and Conservation of White Shrimp Penaeus schmitti in Northeast Brazil: Insights Into Life History, Reference Points, and Management Strategies for Beach Seining","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12744?af=R","date":1728128912000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Artisanal fishing significantly not only contributes to socioeconomic development of numerous countries but also exerts pressure on natural populations. The white shrimp (<i>Penaeus schmitti</i>) is a key species in Brazilian artisanal fisheries, yet it is currently classified as data-deficient. Conducting comprehensive studies on its population dynamics is essential to establish reference points that guarantee sustainable fishing. Therefore, we estimated population parameters to assess status of the white shrimp stock captured by beach seining in Northeast Brazil. Monthly samples of white shrimp were collected using a beach trawl. Based on population parameters, the white shrimp population in the study area, the sex ratio was 1 male to 1.29 females, with females larger and heavier than males. Weight–length relationships revealed positive allometric growth for males, females, and grouped sexes, with no significant difference between sexes. Asymptotic length, t_achor, and growth performance index also did not differ between sexes; however, the growth coefficient was higher for females. Beach trawling in northeastern Brazil predominantly targeted adult white shrimp, with carapace length at first capture (Lc<sub>50</sub>) averaging 2.12 cm for females and 2.19 cm for males. Mortality and exploitation rates were below maximum sustainable levels, so the stock was classified as underexploited. Overall, beach-seine fishing was less harmful to this stock (<i>F</i> = 1.42) than motorized fishing and can be considered a sustainable fishing activity for the white shrimp population.</p>","author":"Hildemário Castro‐Neto, \nCecília Craveiro, \nLucas Santos, \nEmanuell F. B.
