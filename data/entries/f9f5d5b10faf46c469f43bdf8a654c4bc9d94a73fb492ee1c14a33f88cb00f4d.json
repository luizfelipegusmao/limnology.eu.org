{"title":"Impact of traffic congestion on asthma-related hospital visits in major Texas cities","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311142","date":1727359200000,"content":"<p>by Mei Yang, Tiankai Wang</p>\r\n\r\nAsthma is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the United States and is particularly sensitive to environmental changes in urban areas. While it is known that traffic congestion contributes to increased vehicle emissions and poorer air quality, its direct association with asthma incidence has not been thoroughly explored. This study aimed to address this void by analyzing 148 city-level observations from 2016 to 2020 in Texas, using data from the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute and Definitive Healthcare. We investigated the association between traffic congestion, measured by the travel time index, and annual city-level asthma hospital discharges, while adjusting for refinery productivity, minority groups, and education levels through multivariate regression. Our findings revealed a significant positive correlation between the travel time index and asthma visits, indicating that higher traffic congestion is associated with increased hospital visits for asthma. This finding remains consistent across different models, regardless of whether control variables are included. For the control variables, we found that higher refinery productivity was linked to elevated risks of asthma-related hospitalizations, aligning with previous research findings. Although correlations with Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino populations, as well as those with less than a high school education, were not statistically significant, a positive trend was observed. These results emphasize the impact of traffic congestion on asthma prevalence and the necessity for targeted public health interventions and urban planning strategies.","author":"Mei Yang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f9f5d5b10faf46c469f43bdf8a654c4bc9d94a73fb492ee1c14a33f88cb00f4d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
