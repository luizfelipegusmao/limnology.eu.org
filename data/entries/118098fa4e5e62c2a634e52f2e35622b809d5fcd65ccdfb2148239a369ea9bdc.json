Ratner</p>\r\n\r\nEpithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has a low overall survival rate, largely due to frequent recurrence and acquiring resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. EOC with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency has increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy because platinum-induced DNA damage cannot be repaired. Mutations in genes involved in the HR pathway are thought to be strongly correlated with favorable response to treatment. Patients with these mutations have better prognosis and an improved survival rate. On the other hand, mutations in non-HR genes in EOC are associated with increased chemoresistance and poorer prognosis. For this reason, accurate predictions in response to treatment and overall survival remain challenging. Thus, analyses of 360 EOC cases on NCIâ€™s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program were conducted to identify novel gene mutation signatures that were strongly correlated with overall survival. We found that a considerable portion of EOC cases exhibited multiple and overlapping mutations in a panel of 31 genes. Using logistical regression modeling on mutational profiles and patient survival data from TCGA, we determined whether specific sets of deleterious gene mutations in EOC patients had impacts on patient survival. Our results showed that six genes that were strongly correlated with an increased survival time are BRCA1, NBN, BRIP1, RAD50, PTEN, and PMS2. In addition, our analysis shows that six genes that were strongly correlated with a decreased survival time are FANCE, FOXM1, KRAS, FANCD2, TTN, and CSMD3. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of 360 patients stratified by these positive and negative gene mutation signatures corroborated that our regression model outperformed the conventional HR genes-based classification and prediction of survival outcomes. Collectively, our findings suggest that EOC exhibits unique mutation signatures beyond HR gene mutations. Our approach can identify a novel panel of gene mutations that helps improve the prediction of treatment outcomes and overall survival for EOC patients.","author":"Mirielle C.
