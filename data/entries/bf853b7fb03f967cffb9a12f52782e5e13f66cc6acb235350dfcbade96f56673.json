{"title":"Modelling of the Fate of Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate in Agricultural Soil Columns during Inflow of Surfactant Pulses from Wastewaters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0276/v1","date":1717585048000,"content":"Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) anionic surfactants are widely used, present in wastewater, and can be discharged causing environmental damage. Without considering biodegradation, sorption and desorption reactions play an important role and depend on the characteristics of the aquifer medium such as the content of organic matter and clay. These processes are modelled with PHREEQC using laboratory-obtained data on columns with an input LAS pulse. LAS adsorption and desorption step experiments carried out in sand columns were also modelled with this software and distribution constants were similar to those obtained for pulse. The values of the starting distribution constant provided by batch tests with sand and agricultural soil mixtures establish the maximum value that must be obtained for column modelling. Distribution constants from column experiments obtained by Freundlich and linear isotherms provided very similar results, the latter with more consistent achievement. The modelling results showed longer elution times in the case of the heavier homologues and with a higher percentage of agricultural soil, which would translate into the great persistence of these compounds in the environment. In the case of soil contamination with wastewater-containing surfactants, these results would allow the development of mitigation strategies for these environmental impacts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf853b7fb03f967cffb9a12f52782e5e13f66cc6acb235350dfcbade96f56673","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
