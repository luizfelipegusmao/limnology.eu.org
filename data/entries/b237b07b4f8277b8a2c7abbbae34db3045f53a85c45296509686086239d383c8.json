{"title":"Temporal variation in vitamin B12 concentration and their impact on phytoplankton composition of surface waters of a coastal ocean off Japan (Ariake Sea)","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10872-023-00711-7","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Most phytoplankton, including harmful algal bloom (HAB)-forming species, have an absolute requirement for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin). However, the cycling of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in the ocean is still poorly understood. For example, in the Ariake Sea, where local fisheries have been affected by HABs, the impact of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> on phytoplankton dynamics has never been evaluated. This study reports the surface distribution of cyanocobalamin (CN-B<sub>12</sub>, a type of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) in the Ariake Sea and its adjacent areas. The field measurements were complemented with an additional onboard CN-B<sub>12</sub> incubation experiment to elucidate the importance of the coenzyme on the growth of natural phytoplankton communities. Dissolved CN-B<sub>12</sub> behaved dynamically and was often depleted in surface waters. Dominant phytoplankton in the Ariake Sea changed seasonally; all these taxa include vitamin B<sub>12</sub> auxotrophs. The distribution of CN-B<sub>12</sub> was controlled by dynamic production and consumption by natural phytoplankton and bacterial communities. We attempted to measure the concentration of particulate CN-B<sub>12</sub>; it was undetectable suggesting that CN-B<sub>12</sub> form of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is not dominant inside the cell. No clear relationship existed between CN-B<sub>12</sub> and any oceanographic parameters, suggesting that river discharge is unlikely a major source of CN-B<sub>12</sub> in this area. Bottle incubation experiments showed that CN-B<sub>12</sub> and nitrate additions promoted the growth of diatom <em>Chaetoceros</em> spp., implying that some phytoplankton groups are co-limited by them. These preliminary results suggest that vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may affect the composition of the phytoplankton community in the Ariake Sea.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"b237b07b4f8277b8a2c7abbbae34db3045f53a85c45296509686086239d383c8","category":"Environment"}
