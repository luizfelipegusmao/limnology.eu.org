{"title":"God&rsquo;s Certainty-Uncertainty Principle versus Heisenberg&rsquo;s Uncertainty Principle: A Possible Path to Unification of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0236/v2","date":1726708644000,"content":"Einstein was skeptical of part of quantum mechanics, and he believed that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle did not reflected the full depth of reality. He famously stated, ”God does not play dice with the universe.” However, since quantum mechanics has passed so many experimental tests, most physicists today assume that Einstein was wrong. Nevertheless, we will demonstrate that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle must be modified to unify gravity with quantum mechanics. This modification leads to the Certainty-Uncertainty principle where the certainty part is strongly linked to gravity. This means Einstein likely was right in his intuition also on this point. The key is to understand that the de Broglie wavelength is not the actual wavelength of matter but merely a derivative of the true matter wavelength, namely the Compton wavelength. Furthermore, one must understand that the gravitational constant, first introduced in 1873, is simply a composite constant needed to rectify the incomplete definition of kilogram mass introduced into Newtonian gravity in 1873.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51b4b5f6b4e30dd7f8df7c773e89077a76c827ed47f811d528c243dd9172bb14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
