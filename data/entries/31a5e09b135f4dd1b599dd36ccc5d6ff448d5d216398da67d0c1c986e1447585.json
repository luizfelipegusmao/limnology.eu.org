{"title":"Seasonal fluctuation and alternative host plants of vegetable crop-infesting tephritids in non-vegetable growing areas in South Sudanese zone of Burkina Faso","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae047/7664561?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study was carried out in 3 types of biotopes where vegetable crops are not grown to highlight their contribution to the dynamics of vegetable-infesting flies. To this end, a trapping system based on a sexual attractant, the Cuelure associated with an insecticide was set up in 18 biotopes (6 natural areas, 6 mango orchards, and 6 agroforestry parks) in the regions of Hauts Bassins and Cascades in the South-West of Burkina Faso. During the trapping monitoring, which was done every 2 wk to collect insects captured, fruits present in 3 types of biotopes were sampled and incubated for insect emergence. Ten <span>Dacus</span> (Fabricius) [Diptera: Tephritidae] species and <span>Zeugodacus cucurbitae</span> (Coquillett) [Diptera: Tephritidae] were trapped in the study area. The predominant species captured was <span>Z. cucurbitae</span> (52.93%) followed by <span>Dacus punctatifrons</span> (Karsch) [Diptera: Tephritidae] (29.89%) and <span>Dacus humeralis</span> (Bezzi) (12.71%). Six tephritid species were emerged from 6 wild fruit species belonging to Cucurbitaceae, Apocynaceae, and Passifloraceae families. Fruit flies were more abundant from Jul to Nov with peaks observed in Aug or Oct depending on the species. <span>Citrullus colocynthis</span> L. (Cucurbitaceae)<span>, Lagenaria</span> sp. (Cucurbitaceae), <span>Passiflora foetida</span> L. (Passifloraceae), and <span>Passiflora</span> sp. acted as reservoir host plants of <span>Dacus ciliatus</span> (Loew), <span>Dacus bivittatus</span> (Bigot), <span>Dacus vertebratus</span> (Bezzi) [Diptera: Tephritidae], <span>D. punctatifrons</span>, and <span>Z. cucurbitae</span>, the major vegetable insect pests in West Africa. The 3 types of biotopes acted as suitable refuge areas of vegetable crop-infesting fruit flies either for the favorable microclimate or for the alternative host plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"31a5e09b135f4dd1b599dd36ccc5d6ff448d5d216398da67d0c1c986e1447585","category":"Environment"}
