{"title":"K-means++ for Critical Component Identification: Power Grid Case Study Using Measurement-Based Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1383/v1","date":1718887517000,"content":"The inherent capabilities of the K-means++ algorithm to approximate system dynamics within complex systems are subjected by constructing a network structure that captures interconnections among identified components, extending its original purpose as a data clustering method and transforming it into a tool for systems analysis. Leveraging advanced measurement technologies and sophisticated data collection systems, the K-means++ algorithm unveils hidden relationships among components and identifies critical elements. \nThis study explored the algorithm's potential, facilitating the identification of critical components to enhance system operation, control, optimization, and decision-making and examining the practicality and resiliency of the method in real-world application with noisy and limited data. A case study conducted on power systems (IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems) exemplifies K-means++'s capacity to accurately identify critical components and approximate system dynamics, supported by performance metrics affirming its effectiveness and robustness in system analysis through measurements of bus similarity within clusters based on standard deviation and comparison of net tie-line flows in equivalent networks with the original network across scenarios. \nPerformance metrics, including the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Variation of Information (VI) score, further validated K-means++'s performance, yielding reliable and consistent results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af7b94e877c83a2fcef7d4e8066eeb511e2363cdbb17d12043c102867f7eedb5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
