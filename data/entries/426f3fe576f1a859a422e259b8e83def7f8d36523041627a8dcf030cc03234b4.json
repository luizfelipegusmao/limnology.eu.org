{"title":"FAIR as a Journey: Lessons Learned and Takeaways from Building the GoTriple Discovery Platform for SSH","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0748/v1","date":1715580298000,"content":"This report describes the experience in implementing the FAIR principles for the GoTriple Discovery Platform for the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). It shows how adherence to FAIR should be considered as a continuous process throughout the entire lifespan of any information management system, including GoTriple, rather than a static goal with decisions only made at design time. The report presents an introduction highlighting the importance of the FAIR principles, indicating how they can be assessed in data management systems. Then the GoTriple case is presented, with a general overview of this discovery platform before describing some of the implemented practices in support of FAIR. The Discussion section shows on the one hand some virtuous reuse of GoTriple data, together with one major pitfall in the platformâ€™s FAIR implementation. In this sense, this report serves as a case study that can offer insights and actionable advice for those implementing information systems aligned, from the very outset, with the FAIR principles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"426f3fe576f1a859a422e259b8e83def7f8d36523041627a8dcf030cc03234b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
