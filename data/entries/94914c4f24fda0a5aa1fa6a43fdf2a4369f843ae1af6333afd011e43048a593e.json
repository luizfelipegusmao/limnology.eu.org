The effects of warming on the top-down biological control of crop pests have been considerably less studied than bottom-up effects through crop physiological changes.\n\nWe studied the effect of a 2°C warming in the laboratory and in wheat fields on the predation and metabolism of <i>Harmonia axyridis</i> on wheat aphids using molecular gut content analysis. We also measured the effects of warming on the predation rate and functional response of <i>H. axyridis</i> on each aphid species in the laboratory, as well as on DNA degradation rate.\n\nField densities of <i>Sitobion avenae</i> and <i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i>, the two most abundant wheat aphid species, were increased by 2 and 2.5 times, respectively, under experimental warming, but densities of <i>H. axyridis</i> were not. Field predation rate of <i>H. axyridis</i> on these two aphid was found to be about 25% lower under elevated temperature. This could have been due to faster prey digestion, since degradation of the preferred aphid species, <i>Sitobion avenae</i>, was 1.5 times faster under elevated temperature. However, the functional response of <i>H. axyridis</i> larvae on these two species was 1.5 times higher under warming over the range of prey densities tested (50–250 over 24 h). The total predation rate of <i>H. axyridis</i> larvae on a mixture of <i>S. avenae</i>, <i>R. padi</i> and <i>Schizaphis graminum</i> aphid prey was also increased by 1.4 times, but consumption of <i>R. padi</i> aphids was increased while that of <i>S. graminum</i> was decreased under warming.\n\nOverall, our results show that global warming could strongly increase pest outbreaks and destabilize biological pest control, which would likely result in accrued yield losses.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/02/09/faster-population-growth-under-warming-increases-changes-of-pest-outbreaks-despite-increased-predation-by-ladybirds/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Yang Wang, \nColine C.
