{"title":"Cobot Kinematic Model for Industrial Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1628/v1","date":1724378513000,"content":"This paper deals with the formulation of a Cobot kinematic model by developing both the direct and inverse kinematics and choosing the noa transformation matrix for defining the end-effector position and orientation with respect to the base frame. These algorithms have been validated via software in Matlab environment and by means of suitable experimental tests, which have been carried out by using a UR5e Cobot. Moreover, a specific industrial application regarding the robotized assembling of a multi-cylinder IC engine, has been designed in terms of layout and corresponding automatic cycle that is intended as a sequence of the robot elementary actions. In particular, the proposed robotized cell is composed by the UR5e Cobot along with its controller and a suitable electropneumatic circuit that includes a PLC with its user interface, which are both governed by means of a specific electronic board and a switch control box. The IC engine in scale of 1:5 and specific parts of the end-effector, which takes the role of vacuum gripper and torque limiting screwdriver, have been designed and manufactured by using a 3D printer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb1f5af32b7e238b34e7f305130effde9276633bade304a0797da10e237d5ba9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
