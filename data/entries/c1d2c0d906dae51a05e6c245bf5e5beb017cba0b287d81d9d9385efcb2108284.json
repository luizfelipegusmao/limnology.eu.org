{"title":"Intimate partner violence among pregnant women attending a low-resource primary care facility in Ghana","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310169","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Stephen Tetteh Engmann, Roberta Lamptey, Henry Jeremy Lawson, Gerhard Ofori-Amankwah</p>\r\nBackground <p>Intimate partner violence in pregnancy is a significant public health issue that has several detrimental effects. Pregnant women subjected to intimate partner violence (IPV) have a higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p> Objective <p>The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence, patterns and factors associated with intimate partner violence among pregnant women attending a primary care antenatal clinic.</p> Methods <p>A quantitative cross-sectional study design was employed to study intimate partner violence among 269 pregnant women in Accra, Ghana between July and October 2021. Participants were selected by systematic sampling technique. The self-reported Composite Abuse Scale was used to assess and classify intimate partner violence. Socio-demographic, clinical (obstetric) and behavioural characteristics were obtained with a structured questionnaire. Associations were determined between independent and dependent variables using the chi-squared test, and logistic regression with adjusted odds ratio (AOR). The statistical significance level was set at a p-value ≤ 0.05.</p> Results <p>The prevalence of IPV was 11.2%. The prevalence of emotional/psychological abuse, harassment/controlling behaviour, physical abuse, sexual abuse and severe combined abuse were 12.3%, 13.0%, 8.2%, 3.3% and 8.9% respectively. Pregnant women who were employed had reduced odds of experiencing IPV [AOR = 0.16 (95%CI: 0.05–0.47), p = 0.001], however, the past experience of violence [AOR = 4.9 (95%CI: 1.06–22.96), p = 0.042], alcohol use by women [AOR = 7.8 (95%CI: 1.63–37.42), p = 0.01], and partners’ alcohol consumption [AOR = 10.0 (95%CI: 3.22–31.26), p&lt;0.001] were associated with increased odds of IPV.</p> Conclusions <p>There is a high prevalence of IPV among pregnant women in this study from a resource-limited setting. The factors found to be associated with IPV in pregnancy were the employment status of women, alcohol consumption by women or their partners and a previous history of violence. Healthcare providers in primary care need to recognize IPV as a medical condition that can occur in pregnancy and be ready to assist and manage the victims when it is detected.</p>","author":"Stephen Tetteh Engmann","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c1d2c0d906dae51a05e6c245bf5e5beb017cba0b287d81d9d9385efcb2108284","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
