{"title":"The OsEIL1–OsWOX11 transcription factor module controls rice crown root development in response to soil compaction","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2393/7630070?rss=1","date":1710460800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Optimizing the root architecture of crops is an effective strategy for improving crop yields. Soil compaction is a serious global problem that limits crop productivity by restricting root growth, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unclear. Here, we show that ethylene stimulates rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) crown root development in response to soil compaction. First, we demonstrate that compacted soil promotes ethylene production and the accumulation of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 1 (OsEIL1) in rice roots, stimulating crown root primordia initiation and development, thereby increasing crown root number in lower stem nodes. Through transcriptome profiling and molecular analyses, we reveal that OsEIL1 directly activates the expression of <span>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11</span> (<span>OsWOX11</span>), an activator of crown root emergence and growth, and that <span>OsWOX11</span> mutations delay crown root development, thus impairing the plant's response to ethylene and soil compaction. Genetic analysis demonstrates that <span>OsWOX11</span> functions downstream of <span>OsEIL1</span>. In summary, our results demonstrate that the OsEIL1–OsWOX11 module regulates ethylene action during crown root development in response to soil compaction, providing a strategy for the genetic modification of crop root architecture and grain agronomic traits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cfe294087dc3a7269a85e21d242743a994dae8bb4ff71e3be16c9e5eda7a9b06","category":"Environment"}
