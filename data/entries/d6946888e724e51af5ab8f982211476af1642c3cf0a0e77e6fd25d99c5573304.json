{"title":"Ajwa Date Seed Mediated Green Synthesis of Alginate-Silver Nanocomposite Beads and Films for Antibacterial and Catalytic Degradation Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0749/v1","date":1718143812000,"content":"Alginate-silver nanocomposites in the form of spherical beads and films were prepared using a green approach by using the aqueous extract of Ajwa dates seeds. The nanocomposites were fabricated by in situ reduction and gelation method by ionotropic crosslinking using calcium ions in solution. The rich phytochemicals of the dates seeds extract played a dual role as reducing and stabilizing agent in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The formation of silver nanoparticles was studied using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and a distinct surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 421 nm characteristic of silver nanoparticles confirmed the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The morphology of the nanocomposite beads and film was compact with even distribution of silver nanoclusters. The catalytic property of the nanocomposite beads was evaluated for the degradation of 2-nitrophenol in the presence of sodium borohydride. The degradation followed pseudo-first order kinetics with a rate constant of 1.40 ´ 10-3 s-1 at 23 °C with an activation energy of 18.45 kJ mol-1. The thermodynamic parameters such as changes in enthalpy and entropy were evaluated to be 15.22 kJ mol-1 and -197.50 J mol-1 K-1, respectively. The nanocomposite exhibited properties against three clinically important pathogens (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria)","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6946888e724e51af5ab8f982211476af1642c3cf0a0e77e6fd25d99c5573304","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
