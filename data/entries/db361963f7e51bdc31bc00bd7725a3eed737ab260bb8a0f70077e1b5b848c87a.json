{"title":"Study of lactobacillus plantarum coated with tremella polysaccharides to improve its intestinal adhesion","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13530?af=R","date":1713181467000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The adhesion of probiotics to the intestine is crucial to their probiotic function. Tremella polysaccharides (TPS) (with sodium casein) have shown the potential in previous studies to encapsulate probiotics and protect them in the simulated gastrointestinal tract. This paper further explored the effect of TPS (with sodium casein) on the adhesion of probiotics.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p><i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> was coated in different proportions in TPS and sodium casein and then freeze-drying. The rheological properties of the mixture of probiotics powder and mucin solution were determined by static and dynamic rheological analysis. Aqueous solutions of probiotics powder and mucin mixture exhibited pseudoplastic fluid rheological properties. The higher the proportion of TPS content, the higher the apparent viscosity and yield stress. The mixed bacterial powder and mucin fluid displayed certain thixotropy and obeyed the Herschel-Bulkley model. It indicated that TPS increased the bio-adhesive force of probiotics powder and mucin. When using TPS as the only carbon source, the adhesion of <i>L. plantarum</i> to Caco-2 cells increased by 228% compared to glucose <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, 12 proteins with adhesion function were detected in the whole-cell proteome of <i>L. plantarum</i>. Among them, 10 proteins with adhesion function were abundant when grown with TPS as a carbon source.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Therefore, TPS possess prebiotic properties and can promote the intestinal adhesion of <i>L. plantarum</i>.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
