{"title":"Sensor-based and Visual Behavioral Profiling of Dry Holstein Cows Presenting Distinct Median Core Body Temperature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1857/v1","date":1719395223000,"content":"The consequences of heat stress during the dry period can extend into the postpartum period, affecting health and productivity in the subsequent lactation. We hypothesized that cows with distinct core body temperatures (CBT) would exhibit disparate behaviors associated with different degrees of heat generation or dissipation. The primary objective was to investigate behavioral differences of dry Holstein cows (n=50) classified as high-temperature (HT) or low-temperature (LT) based on median CBT during the summer months using visual observations and accelerometer technology. A secondary objective was to investigate the transcriptome of white blood cells (WBC) collected from a subgroup of HT and LT cows (n=5; per group). Minor behavior differences were observed during the visual observations (performed for a total of 16h/cow). Based on the accelerometer data, HT cows displayed higher periods of high activity and lower periods of inactivity prepartum and diminished rumination time postpartum than LT cows. There were 16 differently expressed genes (DEG) in WBC of HT than LT cows. Despite the low number, several of the identified DEGs have been previously associated with heat stress. Results indicate that CBT and patterns of activity prepartum may serve as valuable predictors for identifying dairy cows with distinct tolerance to heat stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68aea4fe7f4826c575d90d257623daceb791707b6ca799a9ace2acd3a269dc89","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
