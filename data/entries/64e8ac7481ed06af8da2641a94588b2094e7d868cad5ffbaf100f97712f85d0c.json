{"title":"Vaginal Microbiome and Pregnancy Complications: A review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0233/v1","date":1717577087000,"content":"Abstract: Background/Objectives: There are indications that the microbial composition of the maternal mucosal surfaces is associated with adverse events during pregnancy. The aim of this review is to investigate the link between vaginal microbiome alterations and gestational com-plications risk. Methods: This comprehensive literature review was performed using Medline and Scopus databases. The following search algorithm was used \"Pregnancy Complications\"[Mesh] AND (Vagin*) and after literature screening 44 studies were included in the final review. Results: The studies that were included investigated the association between vaginal microbial composi-tion and preterm birth, miscarriage, preeclampsia, ectopic pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, chorioamnionitis and preterm premature rupture of membranes. In most of the studies, it was well established that increased microbial diversity is associated with these conditions. Also, the depletion of Lactobacillus species is linked to most of the gestational complication, while the increased relative abundance and especially L. crispatus may exerts a protective effect in favor of the pregnant woman. Several pathogenic taxa including Gardnerella, Prevotella, Sneathia, Bac-terial Vaginosis-Associated Bacteria-2, Atopobium and Megasphera seem to be correlated to higher maternal morbidity. Conclusions: Vaginal microbiome aberrations seem to have an as-sociation with pregnancy related adverse events, but more high-quality homogenous studies are necessary to reliably verify this link.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64e8ac7481ed06af8da2641a94588b2094e7d868cad5ffbaf100f97712f85d0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
