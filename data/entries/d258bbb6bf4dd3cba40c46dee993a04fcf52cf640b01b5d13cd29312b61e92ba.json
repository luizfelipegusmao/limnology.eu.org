{"title":"An Expanded Molecular and Systems Toolbox for Imaging, Mapping, and Controlling Local Translation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2413/v1","date":1722330232000,"content":"Localized protein translation occurs through trafficking of mRNAs and protein translation machineries to different compartments of the cell, leading to rapid on-site synthesis of proteins in response to signaling cues. The spatiotemporally precise nature of the local translation process necessitates continual developments of technologies reviewed herein to visualize and map biomolecular components and the translation process with better spatial and temporal resolution, and with fewer artifacts. We also discuss approaches to control local translation, which can serve as a design paradigm for subcellular genetic devices for eukaryotic synthetic biology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d258bbb6bf4dd3cba40c46dee993a04fcf52cf640b01b5d13cd29312b61e92ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
