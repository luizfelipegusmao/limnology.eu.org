{"title":"Diagnostic Performance of a Deep Learning-Powered Application for Aortic Dissection Triage Prioritization and Classification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0962/v1","date":1720694037000,"content":"This multi-center retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic performance of a deep learning (DL)-based application for detecting, classifying, and highlighting suspected aortic dissections (ADs) on chest and thoraco-abdominal CT angiography (CTA) scans. CTA scans from over 200 U.S. and European cities acquired on 52 scanner models from 6 manufacturers were retrospectively collected and processed by CINA-CHEST (AD) (Avicenna.AI, La Ciotat, France) device. The di-agnostic performance of the device was compared with the ground truth established by the majority agreement of three US board-certified radiologists. Furthermore, the DL-algorithm's time-to-notification was evaluated to demonstrate clinical effectiveness. The study included 1,303 CTAs (mean age 58.8 ± 16.4 years old, 46.7% male, 10.5% positive). The device demonstrated a sensitivity of 94.2% [95% CI: 88.8% – 97.5%] and a specificity of 97.3% [95% CI: 96.2% - 98.1%]. The application classified positive cases by AD types with an accuracy of 99.5% [95% CI: 98.9% – 99.8%] for type A and 97.5 [95% CI: 96.4% – 98.3%] for type B. The application did not miss any type A cases. The device flagged 32 cases incorrectly, primarily due to acquisition artefacts and aortic pathologies mimicking AD.  The mean time to process and notify of potential AD cases was 27.9 ± 8.7 seconds. This deep learning-based application demonstrated strong performance in detecting and classifying aortic dissection cases, potentially enabling faster triage of these urgent cases in clinical settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41f92695c31ed83d5d815d1f1b03e37d3c995c3bb6cc01d3b0acbaa09206de33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
