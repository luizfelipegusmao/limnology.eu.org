{"title":"Variability in Heating Demand Predictions: A Comparative Study of PHPP and Mc001-2022 in Existing Residential Buildings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1925/v1","date":1719473367000,"content":"The construction industry is a key driver of environmental change due to its extensive ‎use of resources and high levels of emissions, thus placing a significant burden on global ‎efforts towards sustainable development targets. A large portion of the environmental ‎footprint of buildings results from the energy required to sustain indoor comfort levels. ‎Therefore, enhancing the energy efficiency of existing buildings becomes critical in ‎reducing their environmental impact. This study examines the influence of increasing ‎thermal performance with the aim of reducing heating ‎demand. Thus, numerical modelling tools and different energy performance assessment meth-odologies have been used. ‎Specifically, it evaluates two existing residential buildings in Romania and compares ‎heating demand predictions using PHPP and Mc001-2022 methodologies across various ‎climatic data sets and case studies. The results reveal significant variability in heating ‎demand predictions, emphasizing the importance of methodological choice and climatic ‎data. The ‎study highlights that both PHPP and Mc001-2022 methodologies yield varying results ‎depending on the specific conditions and characteristics of each building. This variation in results underscores ‎the necessity for a nuanced and context-specific approach to energy performance ‎assessment, in-corporating multiple energy efficiency measures tailored to the unique ‎features of each building.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3a385897f75b6a7bbfb87f155574c8ca41653c147238069bd9d982b2db19f2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
