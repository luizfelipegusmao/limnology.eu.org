{"title":"Multi-Stimuli Operando Transmission Electron Microscopy for Two-Terminal Oxide-Based Devices","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/200/7634600?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The integration of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based chips for <span>in situ</span> transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has emerged as a highly promising technique in the study of nanoelectronic devices within their operational parameters. This innovative approach facilitates the comprehensive exploration of electrical properties resulting from the simultaneous exposure of these devices to a diverse range of stimuli. However, the control of each individual stimulus within the confined environment of an electron microscope is challenging. In this study, we present novel findings on the effect of a multi-stimuli application on the electrical performance of TEM <span>lamella</span> devices. To approximate the leakage current measurements of macroscale electronic devices in TEM <span>lamellae</span>, we have developed a postfocused ion beam (FIB) healing technique. This technique combines dedicated MEMS-based chips and <span>in situ</span> TEM gas cells, enabling biasing experiments under environmental conditions. Notably, our observations reveal a reoxidation process that leads to a decrease in leakage current for SrTiO<sub>3</sub>-based memristors and BaSrTiO<sub>3</sub>-based tunable capacitor devices following ion and electron bombardment in oxygen-rich environments. These findings represent a significant step toward the realization of multi-stimuli TEM experiments on metal–insulator–metal devices, offering the potential for further exploration and a deeper understanding of their intricate behavior.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1f9886286fbdc143e6d795f089c1b6afb0d22afb677140cb8599c72891069652","category":"Environment"}
