In the mold manufacturing and repair processes, one of the most notable challenges is guaranteeing and preserving the integrity of the component during the welding and joining processes because excessive heat input can generate fractures, cracks, wear, and corrosion. One of the most attractive advanced manufacturing technologies for repair is plasma transferred arc (PTA) welding due to its advantages in deposition time, wide range of material applicability, relatively low thermal input to the matrix, and high performance in the deposit concerning other techniques [<a href=\"#ozae044.305-B1\">1</a>]. Among the consulted scientific literature, it has been found that H13 steel components are reinforced using satellites and metal matrix composites with inclusions of Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, TiC, WC [<a href=\"#ozae044.305-B2\">2</a>], and novel alloys using laser powder bed technologies [<a href=\"#ozae044.305-B3\">3</a>], selective laser melting [<a href=\"#ozae044.305-B4\">4</a>], among other techniques. However, there are few studies of the nature of coatings manufactured using H13 steel by PTA technology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"46c58141e74da9f76ada8483af08b70682c5d277fbd03bdf76a3b2232c90d2de","category":"Environment"}
