The current NCANDA study examined depression symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. It evaluated the influence of stressors and social behavior (e.g., in-person and online socializing) with linear mixed effects models. A strong, positive association between COVID-19-related stressors and depression symptoms was observed. The frequency of in-person socializing did not account for the totality of the changes in depression observed during the early COVID-19 pandemic. It may be that pandemic-related stressors counteracted the benefits of in-person interactions during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies can continue to elucidate the interactions among psychosocial, genetic, and behavioral factors contributing to depression symptoms in the unprecedented context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","author":"Kevin M.
