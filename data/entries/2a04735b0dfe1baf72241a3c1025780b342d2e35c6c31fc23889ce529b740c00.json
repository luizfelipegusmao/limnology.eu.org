{"title":"Acute particulate hexavalent chromium exposure induces DNA double-strand breaks and activates homologous recombination repair in rat lung tissue","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/1/1/7691995?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is an established human lung carcinogen, but the carcinogenesis mechanism is poorly understood. Chromosome instability, a hallmark of lung cancer, is considered a major driver of Cr(VI)-induced lung cancer. Unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks are the underlying cause, and homologous recombination repair is the primary mechanism preventing Cr(VI)-induced DNA breaks from causing chromosome instability. Cell culture studies show acute Cr(VI) exposure causes DNA double-strand breaks and increases homologous recombination repair activity. However, the ability of Cr(VI)-induced DNA breaks and repair impact has only been reported in cell culture studies. Therefore, we investigated whether acute Cr(VI) exposure could induce breaks and homologous recombination repair in rat lungs. Male and female Wistar rats were acutely exposed to either zinc chromate particles in a saline solution or saline alone by oropharyngeal aspiration. This exposure route resulted in increased Cr levels in each lobe of the lung. We found Cr(VI) induced DNA double-strand breaks in a concentration-dependent manner, with females being more susceptible than males, and induced homologous recombination repair at similar levels in both sexes. Thus, these data show this driving mechanism discovered in cell culture indeed translates to lung tissue <span>in vivo</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"2a04735b0dfe1baf72241a3c1025780b342d2e35c6c31fc23889ce529b740c00","category":"Environment"}
