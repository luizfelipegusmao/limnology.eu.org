{"title":"The effects of dietary net energy on grow-finish performance and carcass characteristics of male market pigs managed with immunological castration (Improvest)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae027/7617289?rss=1","date":1709251200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to determine the effects of dietary net energy (<strong>NE</strong>) during the grow-finish period on live performance and carcass characteristics of intact male pigs managed with immunological castration (Improvest) compared with physically castrated (<strong>PC</strong>) male pigs. The 101-d study began when 1,008 pigs (504 intact male pigs and 504 PC male pigs; 10 wk old) were allocated by weight to 48 pens with 21 intact males or 21 PC males per pen. Three dietary NE treatments were fed to pigs using five dietary phases (dietary programs were formulated according to standardized ileal digestible lysine requirements of Improvest males or PC males) to provide an average of 2,212 kcal/kg (low NE), 2,337 kcal/kg (medium NE), or 2,462 kcal/kg (high NE). The experiment was designed and analyzed as a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of Improvest management and NE. For the overall study period, there were no significant interactions between Improvest management and NE (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.19) for average daily feed intake (<strong>ADFI</strong>), average daily gain (<strong>ADG</strong>), or gain:feed (<strong>G:F</strong>). There were also no significant interactions between Improvest management and NE (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.06) for carcass characteristics. Improvest males consumed less feed (5.3% lower ADFI; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), grew faster (5.1% greater ADG; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), and were more efficient (11.2% greater G:F; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) compared with PC males. Hot carcass weight (<strong>HCW</strong>) did not differ (<span>P</span> = 0.16) between Improvest males and PC males (attributed to 1.6 percentage unit lower dressing percentage for Improvest males; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01); however, Improvest males were leaner (0.9 mm less backfat and 0.65% greater predicted lean yield; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) compared with PC males. For the overall study period, pigs fed low NE and medium NE diets consumed 7.5% and 4.6% more feed (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) than pigs fed high NE diets, respectively, and pigs fed low NE diets grew 1.7% slower (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.02) than pigs fed medium NE and high NE diets. This resulted in pigs fed low NE diets having 4.4% lower G:F compared with pigs fed medium NE and 8.6% lower G:F compared with pigs fed high NE diets (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Pigs fed low NE had 3.0 kg lighter (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) HCW compared with medium NE, while high NE had intermediate HCW that did not differ from the other two treatments. Overall, typical Improvest response levels for live performance and carcass characteristics when compared with PC males were achieved for each of the NE treatments evaluated in this study.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"c6c6c19c5b9af89bce4293ffb551df93c1e1834add80c3ae7d68bb3490f5598c","category":"Environment"}
