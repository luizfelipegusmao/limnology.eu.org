{"title":"PSLBI-15 Effects of heat shock protein 70 on cell viability and protective capacity of serum against histone cytotoxicity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/641/7757857?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most significant health problem associated with newly received cattle in the beef industry. Serum concentrations of extracellular histones increase in a variety of diseases and histones are known to be cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Work in our lab indicated that failure to protect against cytotoxic effects of extracellular histones may be a component of severe cases of respiratory disease in cattle. The mechanisms or proteins that neutralize cytotoxic effects of extracellular histones are not fully elucidated, but C-reactive protein and complement activity have been associated with a reduced cytotoxic effect of extracellular histones. Work in the literature suggests that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) concentrations in the serum is increased in disease and may directly activate complement. Unpublished observations in our lab indicated that HSP70 potentially interacts with histones to exacerbate cytotoxicity leading to our hypothesis that increased concentrations of HSP70 will decrease the protective capacity against histone cytotoxicity. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to evaluate serum concentrations of HSP70 in weaned bulls entering the feedlot and the effects of increasing HSP70 concentrations on histone cytotoxicity in vitro. Weaned seedstock bulls (n = 130) composed of various breeds were fed using the GrowSafe System at the Tucumcari Bull Test for 122 d. At receiving, blood samples were obtained via coccygeal venipuncture, centrifuged, and serum immediately frozen on dry ice. Serum was analyzed for complement activity (CH50 assay) and protective capacity against extracellular histones using our novel histone toxicity assay. The ratio value of histone toxicity to CH50 was used to separate a subset of bulls as protective (n = 10) and non-protective (n = 10). Concentrations of HSP70 were quantified utilizing a commercially available ELISA kit. Data were analyzed using the GLM procedure of SAS. Serum concentrations of HSP70 were similar (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) for protective and non-protective bulls. To test the responses to increased concentrations of HSP70 to mimic disease, protective and non-protective serum was tested against histones alone and in combination with 0.5 or 40 ng/mL recombinant bovine HSP70. Complement activity from protective and non-protective bulls was not influenced (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) in the presence and absence of recombinant bovine HSP70. Exogenous HSP70 at 0.5 or 40 ng/mL did not influence protective capacity in non-protective animals (<span>P</span> = 0.95). However, HSP70 at 0.5 ng/mL did not (<span>P</span> = 0.18) reduce protective capacity and reduced protective capacity (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) at 40 ng/mL in serum from bulls that were assigned to the protective group. Results indicate that weaned bulls entering the feedlot display varied capacity to protect against histone toxicity and increased concentrations of HSP70 can reduce the protective capacity indicating that circulating HSP70 may play a role in bovine respiratory disease pathogenesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8a666683ba5f7ef28a205e68556a776e95315b8666885e5482f1e4018f601c69","category":"Environment"}
