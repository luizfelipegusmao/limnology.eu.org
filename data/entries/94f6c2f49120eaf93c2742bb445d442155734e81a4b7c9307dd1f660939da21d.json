{"title":"Optimization of Spatial Windshield Wiper Linkages by Using the Differential Evolution Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1845/v1","date":1721830701000,"content":"This study developed a three-dimensional kinematic and dynamic model of a center-driven linkage system (CDLS). Force analysis was conducted to determine the required driving torque to ensure that the input link of the CDLS rotates at a constant speed with a certain angular velocity, even in the presence of frictional resistance torque. The primary objective was to optimize the maximum angular acceleration of the output links to reduce wiper noise. This optimization can enhance the stability of the linkage system while maintaining its operational functionality. In the adopted methodology, the frames of the fixed links are assumed to remain unchanged, and the input link is considered to operate at a constant angular speed and have a constant length. To meet standard vehicle windshield wiper requirements, 10 constraints were imposed on the optimization problem, which was solved using the differential evolution method. The lengths of both output links were reduced by over 10% after optimization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94f6c2f49120eaf93c2742bb445d442155734e81a4b7c9307dd1f660939da21d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
