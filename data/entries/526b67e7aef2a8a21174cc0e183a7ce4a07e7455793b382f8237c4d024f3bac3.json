The microbiome’s impact on its host’s health and fitness is well known. However, most studies on mosquito microbiomes have been conducted in laboratory settings. We explored the mixed microbial communities within <i>Aedes spp</i>., utilizing the 16S rRNA gene for diversity analysis and shotgun metagenomics for functional genomics. Our samples, which included <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> and <i>Ae</i>. <i>albopictus</i>, spanned various developmental stages—eggs, larvae, and adults—gathered from five semiurban areas in Mexico. Our findings revealed a substantial diversity of 8,346 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), representing 967 bacterial genera and 126,366 annotated proteins. The host developmental stage was identified as the primary factor associated with variations in the microbiome composition. Subsequently, we searched for genes and species involved in mosquito biocontrol. <i>Wolbachia</i> accounted for 9.6% of the 16S gene sequences. We observed a high diversity (203 OTUs) of <i>Wolbachia</i> strains commonly associated with mosquitoes, such as <i>wAlb</i>, with a noticeable increase in abundance during the adult stages. Notably, we detected the presence of the <i>cifA</i> and <i>cifB</i> genes, which are associated with <i>Wolbachia</i>’s cytoplasmic incompatibility, a biocontrol mechanism. Additionally, we identified 221 OTUs related to <i>Bacillus</i>, including strains linked to <i>B</i>. <i>thuringiensis</i>. Furthermore, we discovered multiple genes encoding insecticidal toxins, such as Cry, Mcf, Vip, and Vpp. Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of mosquito microbiome biodiversity and metabolic capabilities, which are essential for developing effective biocontrol strategies against this disease vector.","author":"Apolinar M.
