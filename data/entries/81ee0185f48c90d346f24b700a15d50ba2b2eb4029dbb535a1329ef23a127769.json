{"title":"Dose-Dependent Effects of Turmeric (Curcuma aromatica S.) Starch on Colonic Fermentation in Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0655/v1","date":1725869013000,"content":"Turmeric starch (TS) has gained significant attention due to its potential health benefits, this study intended to investigate the dose-dependent effects of TS on colonic fermentation in rats. Four experimental diets containing different levels of TS (5%, 10%, and 20% w/w) were formulated and fed to male Fischer 344 rats for two weeks and compared with rats fed 0% TS diet (TS0). The results showed that increasing doses of TS resulted in reduced body weight gain and lower visceral tissue weights compared to the TS0 group. These effects may be attributed to the high content of resistant starch in TS, which contributed to lower caloric intake. Colonic fermentation analysis revealed that higher doses of TS resulted in increased short chain fatty acids (SCFA) production, specifically increased cecal acetate content and decreased cecal pH dose-dependently. Notably, beneficial bacteria from the family Oscillospiraceae, genus Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, and Ruminococcus spp. were enriched in the TS-fed groups, further supporting its beneficial effects on gut microbiota and SCFA production. Furthermore, these results suggest that TS may have beneficial effects on colonic fermentation in rats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81ee0185f48c90d346f24b700a15d50ba2b2eb4029dbb535a1329ef23a127769","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
