{"title":"391 The impact of trace mineral source on systemic immunological status associated with early embryonic loss in lactating dairy cattle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/288/7757336?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Milk production has doubled from 1970 to 2009 but has been associated with a decline in fertility. Around 25% of failed pregnancies in dairy cattle are due to embryonic loss. Mineral bioavailability may affect embryonic retention, so we hypothesized that Zn, Cu, and Mn sources will influence systemic immunological status, which affects early embryonic retention. Holstein cows (n = 58) were randomly assigned to one of two daily oral drench trace mineral (Zn, Cu, and Mn) treatments 30 d before breeding (d -30): 1) Inorganic (ITM) or 2) Metal Methionine Hydroxy Analog Chelate (MMHAC). Before treatments began, cows were assigned to a semen type, beef vs. Holstein, equally, across treatments. All cows underwent a double Ovsynch protocol and were artificially inseminated on d 0. Humoral immunological status was assessed in serum samples taken on d 0 and d 7. Immune activity was quantified via a D2Dx systemic immunity score, which assesses samples for the presence of IgG, IgM, cytokines, and complement proteins. Ultrasonography was utilized for pregnancy confirmation on d 35, classifying cows as pregnant (P) or open. Progesterone analysis from d 21 plasma was used to categorize open cows as either non-pregnant (NP) or early embryonic loss (EEL). Statistical analyses in R Studio were completed, in two models based on pregnancy (P vs EEL and NP vs EEL), to determine the effects of mineral treatment, pregnancy status, semen type, and all interactions on humoral immune status. In the P vs EEL model, there were no effects (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.30) of semen type, mineral treatment, pregnancy status, or any interactions on systemic immunity score on the day of breeding (d 0) or d 7. On d 0, cows provided MMHAC had a systemic immunity score of 0.073 ± 0.008 but were not different (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.34) from ITM cows (0.063 ± 0.006). This trend continued on d 7 with systemic immunity scores of MMHAC cows not differing (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.32) from ITM cows (0.055 ± 0.004 and 0.061 ± 0.003; respectively). There was a tendency (<span>P</span> = 0.10) for the three-way interaction of semen type x pregnancy x treatment to influence the immunity score change from d 0 to d 7. Pregnant cows on ITM treatment bred with beef semen had a positive change in immunity score (0.020 ± 0.0085). Whereas ITM cows bred with Holstein semen that underwent EEL had a negative change (-0.015 ± 0.0085); all other means were intermediate. In the NP vs EEL model, there were no effects (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.14) of semen type, treatment, pregnancy status, or any interactions on systemic immunity score on d 0, d 7, or the change between d 0 and d 7. In summary, trace mineral bioavailability tended to affect systemic immunological status in P vs EEL cows but not in NP vs EEL cows, which may allow for the elucidation of immunological status differences during pregnancy establishment.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"a935aa79ba39e6ed1464f05830be611ef4f7d06773715a6e8ec3da4522f65e39","category":"Environment"}
