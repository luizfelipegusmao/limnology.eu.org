{"title":"ACC SYNTHASE4 inhibits gibberellin biosynthesis and FLOWERING LOCUS T expression during citrus flowering","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/479/7560170?rss=1","date":1705363200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Flowering is an essential process in fruit trees. Flower number and timing have a substantial impact on the yield and maturity of fruit. Ethylene and gibberellin (GA) play vital roles in flowering, but the mechanism of coordinated regulation of flowering in woody plants by GA and ethylene is still unclear. In this study, a lemon (<span>Citrus limon</span> L. Burm) 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase gene (<span>CiACS4</span>) was overexpressed in <span>Nicotiana tabacum</span> and resulted in late flowering and increased flower number. Further transformation of citrus revealed that ethylene and starch content increased, and soluble sugar content decreased in <span>35S:CiACS4</span> lemon. Inhibition of <span>CiACS4</span> in lemon resulted in effects opposite to that of <span>35S:CiACS4</span> in transgenic plants. Overexpression of the CiACS4-interacting protein ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 (CiERF3) in <span>N. tabacum</span> resulted in delayed flowering and more flowers. Further experiments revealed that the CiACS4â€“CiERF3 complex can bind the promoters of <span>FLOWERING LOCUS T</span> (<span>CiFT</span>) and GOLDEN<sub>2</sub>-LIKE (<span>CiFE</span>) and suppress their expression. Moreover, overexpression of <span>CiFE</span> in <span>N. tabacum</span> led to early flowering and decreased flowers, and ethylene, starch, and soluble sugar contents were opposite to those in <span>35S:CiACS4</span> transgenic plants. Interestingly, CiFE also bound the promoter of <span>CiFT</span>. Additionally, GA<sub>3</sub> and 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC) treatments delayed flowering in adult citrus, and treatment with GA and ethylene inhibitors increased flower number. ACC treatment also inhibited the expression of <span>CiFT</span> and <span>CiFE</span>. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of ethylene to regulate flower number and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather on citrus yield due to delayed flowering.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"f1ce9fda13b7e156c6c6e95a3b34e814bd6439839271a05065929eddf4cbb6e5","category":"Environment"}
