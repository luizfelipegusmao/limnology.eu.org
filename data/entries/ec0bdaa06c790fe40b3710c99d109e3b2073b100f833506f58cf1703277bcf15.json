{"title":"Walkable Distances to School in Urban, Semi-Urban and Rural Areas: The PACO Y PACA Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2132/v1","date":1727363391000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Distance or urbanisation settings may affect active commuting to school (ACS). This study aimed to (i) detect home-school threshold distances of walking to school and (ii) predict walkable distances among adolescents in different urbanisation settings and both sexes, and (iii) to identify variables predicting adolescents’ ACS, in a central Spain region. Methods: The PACOyPACA (Spanish acronym for Pedal-and-Walk to School, Pedal-and-Walk Home) study evaluated adolescents attending urban, semi-urban and rural schools from Castilla-La Mancha region. The sample included 448 adolescents [48.9% females, mean age 14.80 (SD=0.60)] living closer than 5,100m from school. Distance was divided into deciles to detect which adolescents walked more. Most walkable distances within the whole sample, by sex and by urbanisation settings were predicted using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Variables affecting ACS were found with binary logistic regression. Significance was set at p≤0.05. Results: Most adolescents walked to school (73.1%). Commuting modes differed significantly by urbanisation settings (p=0.001), but not by sex. Most walked when living around 1,400m from school or closer within the whole sample, in both sexes and in urban and semi-urban settings, and adolescents within rural settings did it until 750-900m. Walkable distances were 1,350m for the whole sample and both sexes, and 1,450, 1,350 and 800 within urban, semi-urban and rural settings, respectively. Distance was the only predictor of ACS (p&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusions: Walkable home-school distances differed based on urbanisation settings, which may be due to the classification of urbanisation settings. This study addresses schools within scarcely populated areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec0bdaa06c790fe40b3710c99d109e3b2073b100f833506f58cf1703277bcf15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
