{"title":"Aircraft Electrification: Insights from a Cross-Sectional Thematic and Bibliometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0757/v1","date":1723459250000,"content":"Electrifying aircraft, a crucial advancement in the aviation industry, aims to cut pollutive emissions and boost energy efficiency. Traditional aircraft depend on fossil fuels, which contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution. Despite progress in electric propulsion and energy storage technologies, challenges such as low energy density and integration issues persist. This paper provides a comprehensive thematic and bibliometric analysis to map the research landscape in aircraft electrification, identifying key research themes, influential contributors, and emerging trends. The study applies natural language processing to unstructured bibliographic data and cross-sectional statistical methods to analyze publications, citations, and keyword distributions across various categories related to aircraft electrification. The findings reveal significant growth in research output, particularly in energy management and multidisciplinary design analysis. Collaborative networks highlight key international partnerships, with the United States and China being key research hubs, while citation metrics highlight the impact of leading researchers and institutions in these countries. This study provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders, guiding future research directions and collaborations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60b91906073f42e636240ef0fe58e0ca2ec52d915809b7c783769eae4cd29461","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
