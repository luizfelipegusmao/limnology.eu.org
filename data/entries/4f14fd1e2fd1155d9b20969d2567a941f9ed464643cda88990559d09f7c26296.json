First, an SEM model of urban residents’ green travel under the carbon inclusive mechanism was constructed (the 8 latent variables including Subjective Norms (SN), Attitude (ATT), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), Habits (HAB), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Continuous Intention of Carbon Inclusive Platform application (CI), Behavioral Intention (BI)). Then, based on the data analysis and path analysis results of 354 valid sample data obtained through online surveys, the interrelationships and corresponding parameters between latent variables and manifest variables were obtained. The results show that SN, ATT, PBC, HAB, PU, PEU and CI all have varying degrees of effects on BI. Among them, in the direct influence relationship, the influence path coefficients of CI, PBC and ATT on BI are 0.529, 0.299 and 0.146 respectively; The influence coefficient of HAB on BI is 0.152, but P&amp;gt;0.05, it fails the test, so the influence of HAB on BI is Not significant; in the indirect impact relationship, the coefficient of HAB indirectly affecting BI through ATT is 0.102, and the coefficient of PU indirectly affecting BI through CI and SN is 0.450. It can be seen that under the carbon inclusive mechanism, useful methods such as increasing the value of carbon points and the breadth of application, improving perceived behavioral control, increasing publicity and social awareness, and cultivating green travel attitudes can promote the willingness of urban residents’ green travel behavioral intention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f14fd1e2fd1155d9b20969d2567a941f9ed464643cda88990559d09f7c26296","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
