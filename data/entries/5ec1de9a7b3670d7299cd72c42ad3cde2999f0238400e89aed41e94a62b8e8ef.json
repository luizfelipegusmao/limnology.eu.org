Photo taken by Wolfgang Goymann. The authors behind this month's cover image investigated the early-life survival pathways shaping adult sex ratios (ASRs) using long-term field data and sex- and stage-specific demographic modelling of black coucals and white-browed coucalsâ€”two sympatric Centropus cuckoo species differing in mating system and the extent of sexual size dimorphism. They found no evidence that the strongly male-biased ASR of black coucals is driven by sex-specific survival during maturation, contrary to studies on shorebirds, in which sex-specific mortality of precocial young is related to ASR and mating dynamics. They suggest that factors other than early-life sex biases in survival are likely to be important in shaping ASRs and the associated mating dynamics and social behaviours in altricial coucals.\n</p>\n<br />","author":"","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"5ec1de9a7b3670d7299cd72c42ad3cde2999f0238400e89aed41e94a62b8e8ef","category":"Environment"}
