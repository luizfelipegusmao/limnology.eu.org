{"title":"Eight-Bar Elbow Joint Exoskeleton Mechanism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0305/v1","date":1722907601000,"content":"This paper deals with the design and kinematic analysis of a novel mechanism for the elbow joint of an upper-limb exoskeleton, with the aim of helping operators, in terms of effort and physical resistance, in carrying out heavy operations. In particular, the proposed eight-bar el-bow joint exoskeleton mechanism consists of a motorized Watt I six-bar linkage and a suitable RP dyad, which connects mechanically the external parts of the human arm with the corre-sponding forearm by hook and loop velcro and thus, helping their closing relative motion for lifting objects during repetitive and heavy operations. This relative motion is not a pure rotation and thus, the upper part of the exoskeleton is fastened to the arm, while the lower part is not rigidly connected to the forearm, but through a prismatic pair which allows both rotation and sliding along the forearm axis. Instead, the human arm is sketched by means of a crossed four-bar linkage, which coupler link is considered as attached to the glyph of the prismatic pair, that is fastened to the forearm. Therefore, the kinematic analysis of the whole ten-bar mecha-nism, which is obtained by joining the Watt I six-bar linkage and the RP dyad to the crossed four-bar linkage, is formulated to investigate the main kinematic performance and for design purposes. The proposed algorithm has given several numerical and graphical results. Finally, a double-parallelogram linkage, as particular case of the Watt I six-bar linkage, was considered in combination with the RP dyad and the crossed four-bar linkage, by giving a first mechanical de-sign and a 3D printed prototype.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50dac7654ddc0cd8fea8f2b5ff7a485bc9fc551a44ab1e64abe271f26f3a183f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
