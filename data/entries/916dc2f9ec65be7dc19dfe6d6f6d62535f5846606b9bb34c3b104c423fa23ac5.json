{"title":"Impact of AI-driven Data Visualization on User Experience in the Internet Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1176/v1","date":1723732661000,"content":"This article explores the specific impact of artificial intelligence (AI) -driven data visualisation technologies in the user experience of the Internet industry. Through the introduction of machine learning and data mining technologies, AI has significantly improved the intelligence and automation of data visualization tools, promoting innovation in visualization methods and improving the quality and efficiency of data cleaning, processing, and analysis. In addition, AI has also promoted the development of personalised data visualization, providing users with a richer and more intuitive way to present data. This paper analyses the applications of AI-driven data visualization in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. It demonstrates the positive effects of AI data visualization on user understanding and optimisation of models through practical feedback from Yellowbrick tools.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"916dc2f9ec65be7dc19dfe6d6f6d62535f5846606b9bb34c3b104c423fa23ac5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
