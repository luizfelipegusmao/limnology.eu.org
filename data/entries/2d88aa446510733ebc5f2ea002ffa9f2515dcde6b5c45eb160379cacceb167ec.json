{"title":"Evaluating Mentorship in the Aquatic Sciences in the Context of a Global Pandemic (COVID‐19)","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lob.10635?af=R","date":1723817825000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered human social systems. To better understand ramifications of the pandemic for aquatic scientists, we assessed perceptions of mentorship within the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, focusing on impacts felt during the pandemic. We also evaluated current preferences and practices (e.g., valued traits, network composition, communication tools) related to mentoring, as a way of gauging change within the community and informing ongoing or future resilience and recovery efforts. In surveying this group, we found the largest pandemic related professional development gaps to be lost opportunities for mentoring, the absence of in-person meetings, and missed collegial/collaborative interactions. We also assessed which mentorship characteristics were highly valued and found that, “communicative” was the most consistently valued characteristic. Finally, we assessed mentor network composition and code of conduct use. Findings show a limited range of disciplines within most mentees' networks, suggesting lack of access to mentors in outside fields or disciplines, and widespread valuation of codes of conduct but limited implementation. We advocate for mentoring practices that foster personal connections, expand networks, and develop clear plans for mentoring relationships, as a path toward general improvement and resilience within mentoring networks in the face of disruption.</p>","author":"Sierra E.
