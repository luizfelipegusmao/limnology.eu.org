{"title":"Spots with extremely high radiofrequency radiation after deployment of 5G base stations in Stockholm, Sweden","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1442/v1","date":1724150471000,"content":"During recent years there is an on-going deployment of 5G base stations for radiofrequency (RF) communication in Sweden as well in many other countries. This is made without investigations on risks to human health and the environment. Since 2016 we have made several measurements of environmental exposure to RF radiation in Stockholm, Sweden, including previous generations and now also 5G. In the current study, performed in October 2023, the broadband meter Narda-550 with the probe EF-1891 was used. It gives results in the root mean square (RMS) mode, thus not peak levels. Both the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) base their guidelines on RMS levels of RF radiation. Measurements were made in similar city areas as in our previous studies. Results show that the RF radiation has increased substantially. High maximum levels were found at e.g. the Central Railway Station (3 637 191 µW/m2), and popular walking streets such as Mäster Samuelsgatan (11 613 976 µW/m2), and Drottninggatan (5 271 555 µW/m2). The peak values would be much higher. These levels are in the same magnitude or even higher than those measured in homes of persons that rapidly developed symptoms of the microwave syndrome after installation of 5G, usually in combination with 4G+, in the neighborhood. They are also substantially higher than levels that have previously been linked to cancer and the microwave syndrome in studies of people living near base stations and masts from previous generations of telecommunications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb9455596b0153cbc42062e67858dc3e691b045d7f0b511fa9871f4ce91d9bce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
