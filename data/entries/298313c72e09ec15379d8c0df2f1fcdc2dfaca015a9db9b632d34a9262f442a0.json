{"title":"Perspectives on embryo maturation and seed quality in a global climate change scenario","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4394/7643466?rss=1","date":1712707200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Global climate change has already brought noticeable alterations to multiple regions of our planet, including increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and changes in temperature. Several important steps of plant growth and development, such as embryogenesis, can be affected by such environmental changes; for instance, they affect how stored nutrients are used during early stages of seed germination during the transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic metabolism—a critical period for the seedling’s survival. In this article, we briefly describe relevant processes that occur during embryo maturation and account for nutrient accumulation, which are sensitive to environmental change. Most of the nutrients stored in the seed during its development—including carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, depending on the species—accumulate during the seed maturation stage. It is also known that iron, a key micronutrient for various electron transfer processes in plant cells, accumulates during embryo maturation. The existing literature indicates that climate change can not only affect the quality of the seed, in terms of total nutritional content, but also affect seed production. We discuss the potential effects of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> increases from an embryo-autonomous point of view, in an attempt to separate the effects on the parent plant from those on the embryo.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"298313c72e09ec15379d8c0df2f1fcdc2dfaca015a9db9b632d34a9262f442a0","category":"Environment"}
