{"title":"Anthropometric and Biochemical Analysis and Dietary Habits in Elite Spanish Female Football Players","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1355/v1","date":1716275480000,"content":"There is a recent growth and development with regard to the female athlete. This trend has been reflected in a greater concern for aspects such as nutrition, body composition and the health of female athletes, given the repercussion of these factors on their sporting performance. The aim was to carry out an anthropometric and nutritional assessment of elite Spanish female football athletes based on different biochemical parameters. Ethical consent was obtained from a total of 21 players from a Spanish elite women's football team(20-33years). Anthropometric analysis was carried out using the International Society for the Advancement of Kineanthropometry(ISAK). Clinical analyses were performed by the club's medical staff at the beginning of the season through serum and fasting urine samples taken by the players. The athletes presented fat% of 19.1(SDÂ±2.89). 100% of the players had Mg values within the reference values. Values below reference values were observed for Hb (85.7%), vit.D (33.3%), ferritin (23.8%), serum iron (28.6%), transferrin (4.8%) and TSI (42.9%); and above for CK (42.9%), basal cortisol (38.1%), testosterone (19%) and creatinine, total cholesterol, iron, transferrin, TSI and serotonin (4.8%). Differences in Mg levels were only observed between playing positions (p&amp;lt;0.05). There were associations between age and vit.D levels (r=0.607), and weight with vit.D levels (-0.464) and blood cholesterol (-0.487) among others. Given the nutritional knowledge of Spanish elite female football players, as well as the prevalence of deficiencies in iron metabolism parameters and vit.D levels in athletes, the need to implement a correct nutritional assessment and education in this type of athletes is highlighted","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60f652cb847e9335ccbcbe99f5fbe63baf648090393d739ce87eaf2d5fdf548a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
