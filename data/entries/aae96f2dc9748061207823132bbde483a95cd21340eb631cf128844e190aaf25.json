{"title":"Mobile Colistin-Resistant Gene; mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3 Identified in Diarrheal Pathogens among Infants, Children, and Adults in Bangladesh: Implications for the Future","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1830/v1","date":1711716824000,"content":"Abstract: Colistin is a last-resort antimicrobial for treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Phe-notypic colistin resistance is highly associated with plasmid-mediated mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes. mcr-bearing Enterobacteriaceae have been detected in many countries, with the emergence of colistin-resistant pathogens a global concern. This study assessed the distribution of mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4, and mcr-5 genes with the phenotypic colistin resistance in isolates from diarrheal infants and children in Bangladesh. Bacteria were identified using the API-20E biochemical panel and 16s rDNA gene sequencing. Polymerase chain reac-tions detected mcr gene variants in the isolates. Their susceptibilities to colistin were determined by agar dilu-tion and E-test by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements. Over 30.0% (69/225) of isolates showed colistin resistance by agar dilution assessment (MIC&gt; 2.0 μg/mL). Overall, 15.5% of isolates carried mcr genes (7, mcr-1; 17, mcr-2; 13, mcr-3; and co-occurrence occurred in 2 isolates). Clinical breakout MIC val-ues (≥ 4 μg/mL) were associated with 91.3% of mcr-positive isolates. The mcr-positive pathogens include twenty Escherichia spp., five Shigella flexneri, five Citrobacter spp., two Klebsiella pneumoniae, and three Pseudo-monas parafulva. mcr-genes appeared to be significantly associated with phenotypic colistin resistance phe-nomena (p=0.000), with 100% colistin-resistant isolates showing MDR phenomena. Age and sex of patients showed no significant association with detected mcr variants. Overall, mcr-associated colistin-resistant bacte-ria have emerged in Bangladesh, which warrants further research to determine their spread and instigate ac-tivities to reduce resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aae96f2dc9748061207823132bbde483a95cd21340eb631cf128844e190aaf25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
