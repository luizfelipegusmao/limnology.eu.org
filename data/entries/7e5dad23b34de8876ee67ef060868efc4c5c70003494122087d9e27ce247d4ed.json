{"title":"The Biocultural Resilience Index (BRI): A New Tool for Assessing the Sustainability of Multifunctional Landscapes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1284/v1","date":1716202268000,"content":"Multifunctional landscapes are complex systems that integrate biophysical, cultural-historical and socio-economic components into unique territorial structures and regional ensembles. Facing increasing pressures generated by urbanization, climate change and overexploitation of natural resources, assessing the sustainability of these landscapes has become an urgent priority. The present research is based on the development and parametrization of a new tool for evaluating the sustainability of multifunctional landscapes that aims to measure the level of biocultural resilience of a landscape, integrating biological, cultural and socio-economic indicators in a single analytical framework. This index, called the biocultural resilience index (BRI), provides a holistic perspective on the dynamics of landscapes, allowing the identification of vulnerability areas and the development of conservation and sustainable management strategies. The evaluation of the of multifunctional landscapes sustainability requires a comprehensive approach that has to integrate both biological aspects, such as biodiversity and ecosystem health, as well as identity and cultural aspects, such as cultural value and the relationship of the local communities with the environment. In this context, this study highlights the fact that the development of appropriate tools and methods for assessing and monitoring the sustainability of multifunctional landscapes becomes essential for their sustainable management and for protecting the benefits they offer to society. Our findings show that the biocultural resilience index (BRI) can be used in a variety of contexts and fields, including spatial planning, biodiversity conservation, sustainable rural development and ecotourism. In the meanwhile, this index offers a robust and flexible analytical framework, adaptable to the needs and particularities of different regions and communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e5dad23b34de8876ee67ef060868efc4c5c70003494122087d9e27ce247d4ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
