{"title":"From yield stress to elastic instabilities: Tuning the extensional behavior of elastoviscoplastic fluids","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae227/7688418?rss=1","date":1717545600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In this study, we delve into the intricacies of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids, particularly focusing on how polymer additives influence their extensional behavior. Our findings reveal that polymer additives significantly alter the extensional properties of the EVP fluids, such as relaxation time and extensional stresses while having negligible impact on the shear rheology. Interestingly, the modified fluids exhibit a transition from yield stress-like behavior to viscoelastic-like behavior under high extensional rates, ultimately leading to destabilization under extreme deformation. This research enhances the fundamental understanding of EVP fluids and highlights potential advancements in applications, especially in precision-demanding fields like 3D printing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"d9fb8546fcce7de949896a1d470d9bdabceefe01280bc17bc4ad7b6ef4401ad9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
