{"title":"Energy of the Moving Particles in 3-Body Problem of Classical Electrodynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1493/v1","date":1724192224000,"content":"In previous papers we have derived equations of motion with radiation terms and proved the existence-uniqueness of periodic solution of the 3-body problem of classical electrodynamics. The number of equations of motion – 12 is more than the number of unknown functions – 9. It turns out that 9 equations are independent and the rest 3 ones are consequences of them. These three equations have a solution and they give the expressions for the energy of the moving particles. The main goal of the present paper is to estimate the energy of rounding about the nuclei particles and compare it with the values given by quantum mechanics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c39ecc7034b2ea6b2e03c51870baf8d14e846a8dfe66bf0f4bf07bc7400bb9b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
