According to the scheme of Fig. 1 zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) or lead (Pb) were studied when exposed to concentrations of: Zn (0.01; 0.1; 1 mg/L), Cu (0.001; 0.01; 0.1 mg/L), Pb (0.006; 0.06; 0.6 mg/L) for 144 h after fertilization (hpf) on the grass carp (<span>Ctenopharyngodon idella</span>), one of the important commercial fish species of Kazakhstan, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the expression of genes of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway involved in development. All metals significantly reduced survival, hatching rate, and changed biometric parameters and heart rate of cupid larvae. In addition, these metals (mainly Pb and Cu) inhibited superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and mRNA transcription of genes encoding genes of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These results showed that Pb, Cu and Zn not only affect the survival and development of fish at an early stage of life, but also cause oxidative stress and prevent fish detoxification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"cf6cd1cbca480e86f8c892c47d003ac2e041d1c27a059ca22aed888bbad41cdb","category":"Environment"}
