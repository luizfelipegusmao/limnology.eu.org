{"title":"Emergence of carbapenem‐resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex from agrifood system: detection of ST6326 co‐producing KPC‐2 and NDM‐1","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13555?af=R","date":1713875262000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p><i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> species complex (KpSC) is an important disseminator of carbapenemase-encoding genes, mainly <i>bla</i>\n<sub>KPC-2</sub> and <i>bla</i>\n<sub>NDM-1</sub>, from hospitals to the environment. Consequently, carbapenem-resistant strains can be spread through the agrifood system, raising concerns about food safety. Therefore, this study aimed to isolate carbapenem-resistant KpSC strains from agricultural and environmental sectors and characterize them by phenotypic, molecular, and genomic analyses.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p><i>K. pneumoniae</i> and <i>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</i> strains isolated from soils with lemon, guava, and fig cultivation, and surface waters displayed an extensive drug resistance profile and carried <i>bla</i>\n<sub>KPC-2</sub>, <i>bla</i>\n<sub>NDM-1</sub>, or both. In addition to carbapenemase-encoding genes, KpSC strains harbor a broad resistome (antimicrobial resistance and metal tolerance) and present putative hypervirulence. Soil-derived <i>K. pneumoniae</i> strains were assigned as high-risk clones (ST11 and ST307) and harbored the <i>bla</i>\n<sub>KPC-2</sub> gene associated with Tn<i>4401b</i> and Tn<i>3</i>-like elements on IncN-pST15 and IncX5 plasmids. In surface waters, the coexistence of <i>bla</i>\n<sub>KPC-2</sub> and <i>bla</i>\n<sub>NDM-1</sub> genes was identified in the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> ST6326, a new carbapenem-resistant regional Brazilian clone. In this case, <i>bla</i>\n<sub>KPC-2</sub> with Tn<i>4401a</i> isoform and <i>bla</i>\n<sub>NDM-1</sub> associated with a Tn<i>125</i>-like transposon were located on different plasmids. In addition, <i>K. quasipneumoniae</i> ST526 presented the <i>bla</i>\n<sub>NDM-1</sub> gene associated with a Tn<i>3000</i> transposon on an IncX3 plasmid.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>These findings alert for the transmission of carbapenemase-positive KpSC across the agricultural and environmental sectors, raising critical food safety and environmental issues.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
