{"title":"Net-Zero Considerations within the Delivery of Major AEC Projects in the UK: A Thematic Analysis of the Key Challenges for Project Managers and Clients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2454/v1","date":1722329786000,"content":"The growing emphasis on carbon considerations and the pursuit of net-zero emissions have brought about a paradigm shift in project management. To successfully facilitate the transition towards net-zero emissions, major projects must not only adapt existing systems but also embed carbon targets into their core strategies. While several studies have investigated carbon integration during the procurement phase, limited attention has been given to the construction project manager (PM) perspective. This study aims to bridge this research gap by exploring the challenges and barriers faced by construction PMs when integrating carbon targets and metrics into major Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) projects, as well as evaluating the readiness of project teams to deliver on these. The study deployed a qualitative exploratory research design, where semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 AEC project professionals actively engaged in the planning and execution of major projects in the UK. Thematic analysis of the data revealed a range of challenges and barriers faced by PM teams delivering these projects. The research findings contribute to the field of construction PM by enhancing the understanding of the challenges faced by project managers and project teams when integrating carbon requirements into the delivery of major projects. It uncovers a series of challenges and prevalent practices in major projects that have the potential to impede progress towards the net-zero transition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00fb1b2d80b007457e5bb8424193189664e0a7d9314f4342f39afc664ff3cb3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
