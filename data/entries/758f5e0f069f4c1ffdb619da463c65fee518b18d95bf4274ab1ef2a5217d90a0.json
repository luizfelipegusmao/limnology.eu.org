{"title":"Effect of Treatment Time of High-Voltage Pulsed Electric Fields on Quality of White Pan Bread","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2432/v1","date":1727764676000,"content":"This study investigated the optimal treatment conditions to improve the quality of white pan bread by applying high-voltage pulsed electric fields (PEF) technology with varying electric field treatment times to bread dough. The treatment was conducted at an electric field strength of 2 kV/cm, frequency of 10 Hz, and a pulse width of 100 µs, with varying treatment time of 10, 20, and 30 min. When PEF was applied for 10 min, the treatment dough’s fermentation expansion rate was significantly higher. Bread made with the 10 min treated dough also exhibited higher weight, volume, specific volume, and moisture content, along with lower oven spring and baking loss rate. During storage, the 10 min treated samples maintained higher moisture content, while the 20 and 30 min treated samples showed no significant difference. In terms of texture profile analysis, the treated samples had lower hardness and chewiness compared to the control, while springiness, cohesiveness, and resilience tended to be slightly higher. In terms of texture, the treated samples had lower hardness and chewiness, but higher springiness, cohesiveness, and resilience compared to the control group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"758f5e0f069f4c1ffdb619da463c65fee518b18d95bf4274ab1ef2a5217d90a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
