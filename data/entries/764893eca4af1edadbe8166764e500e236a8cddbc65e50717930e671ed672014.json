{"title":"Understanding Interface Transitions in Polycrystalline Diamond/Dielectric Interlayer/Si Heterostructures Using STEM-EELS","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.560/7719727?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Polycrystalline (PC) diamond films grown on semiconductor devices that are prone to premature failure due to self-heating have recently shown great improvement in channel/junction temperature reduction without compromising the device electrical performance [<a href=\"#ozae044.560-B1\">1</a>]. The enhanced heat transfer coefficient to the heat sink is attributed to the exceptionally low thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of the interface and the very high thermal conductivity (TC) of PC diamond [<a href=\"#ozae044.560-B2\">2-4</a>]. In this study, we have characterized diamond nucleation and growth on Si with several different dielectric interlayers, with the goal of maximizing the phonon transport by improving the quality and adhesion of the as-grown diamond layers [<a href=\"#ozae044.560-B2\">2</a>]. Samples for cross-sectional TEM study were prepared using a Thermo Fisher Helios 5UX Dualbeam system, often followed by a final argon-ion-milling with a Gatan PIPS-II. The cross-sectional geometry and interface abruptness of these heterostructures were analyzed with an FEI-Philips CM 200 at 200 kV and a Talos L120C at 120 kV, and chemical composition was measured using scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with a JEOL ARM200F operated at 200kV. Phase-contrast imaging was used to provide information about the preferred growth directions of the PC-diamond grains, while STEM-EELS was employed to assess the interfacial chemical non-abruptness.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"764893eca4af1edadbe8166764e500e236a8cddbc65e50717930e671ed672014","category":"Environment"}
