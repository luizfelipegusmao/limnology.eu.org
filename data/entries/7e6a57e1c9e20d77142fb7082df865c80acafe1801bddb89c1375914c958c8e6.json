The ternary lithium alumino-borate glass exhibits the highest  and lowest Tg among all the compositions of the glass series, 30Li2O•3Al2O3• (67-x) B2O3•xSiO2. However, as B2O3 is replaced by SiO2, a shallow minimum in  as well as a shallow maximum in Tg are observed near x = 27, where the Raman spectra indicate isolated diborate/tetraborate/orthoborate groups are being progressively replaced by danburite/reedmergnerite-like borosilicate network units. Overall, as the glasses become silica-rich,  is minimized, while Tg is maximized. In general, these findings show correlations among Tg, (sensitive to network polymerization),  (proportional to ionic mobility), and the different borate and silicate glass structural units as determined by Raman spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrate the absence of appreciable crystallinity in the glasses investigated. However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of HF-etched samples showed that glasses, and especially the borate-rich compositions comprise two distinct glassy phases. The isolated phase is 25-100 nm in diameter, dispersed evenly in a glassy matrix.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e6a57e1c9e20d77142fb7082df865c80acafe1801bddb89c1375914c958c8e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
