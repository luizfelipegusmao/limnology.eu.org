{"title":"Incidence and influencing factors related to social isolation among HIV/AIDS patients: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307656","date":1721916000000,"content":"<p>by Qiao Wu, Jiarong Tan, Shu Chen, Jiayi Wang, Xiaogang Liao, Lingling Jiang</p>\r\nBackground <p>People living with HIV (PLWH) are susceptible to social isolation as a result of stigma and discrimination, which not only diminishes adherence to antiretroviral therapy but also heightens the risks of hospital readmission, depression, and mortality. However, there is currently no systematic review addressing the occurrence and impact of social isolation in individuals with HIV. Therefore, this study undertook a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature to examine the prevalence and influencing factors associated with social isolation among PLWH.</p> Methods and analysis <p>PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, China Science and Technology Journal Database, The China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data and Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database will be searched from the establishment of the database to the latest search date. Literature screening, data extraction and literature quality assessment will be done independently by two researchers and results will be cross-referenced. Data analysis will be performed using stata15.1 software. Risk of publication bias will be assessed using Begg’s and Egger’s methods. Heterogeneity between studies will then be assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> index and its 95% CI and Q statistics. Sources of heterogeneity will be accounted for by subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</p> Results <p>The results may reveal the prevalence of social isolation among PLWH and provide data support for understanding its etiology and prevention.</p> Conclusion <p>By systematically reviewing the existing literature on social isolation among PLWH, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of social isolation within this population, elucidate the detrimental effects it poses for people affected by HIV, and effectively inform targeted interventions for high-risk groups. Furthermore, these findings offer valuable insights to support evidence-based decision-making in public health policy.</p> Systematic review registration <p>PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024499044</p>","author":"Qiao Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4a4f9941f099e79eb04f0785c64a24d790f015a0c41457eddc8d6a6005cb7c00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
