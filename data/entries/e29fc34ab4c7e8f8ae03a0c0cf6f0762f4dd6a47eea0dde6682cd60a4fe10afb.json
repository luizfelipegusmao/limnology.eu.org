{"title":"Dicer-Like Protein 4 and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 6 Are Involved in Tomato Torrado Virus Pathogenesis in Nicotiana benthamiana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/3/447/7510585?rss=1","date":1704326400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Tomato torrado virus (ToTV) is a type member of the <span>Torradovirus</span> genus in the <span>Secoviridae</span> family known to cause severe necrosis in susceptible tomato varieties. ToTV also infects other <span>Solanaceae</span> plants, including <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span>, where it induces distinctive disease symptoms: plant growth drop with the emergence of spoon-like malformed systemic leaves. Virus-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is significant among plant defense mechanisms activated upon virus invasion. The PTGS, however, can be counteracted by suppressors of RNA silencing commonly found in viruses, which efficiently disrupt the antiviral defense of their host. Here, we addressed the question of PTGS antiviral activity and its suppression in <span>N. benthamiana</span> during ToTV infection—a phenomenon not described for any representative from the <span>Torradovirus</span> genus so far. First, we showed that neither the Vp26—a necrosis-inducing pathogenicity determinant of ToTV—nor other structural viral proteins limited the locally induced PTGS similar to p19, a well-characterized potent suppressor of RNA silencing of tombusviruses. Moreover, by employing wild-type and transgenic lines of <span>N. benthamiana</span> with suppressed Dicer-like 2 (DCL2), Dicer-like 4 (DCL4), Argonaute 2 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) proteins, we proved their involvement in anti-ToTV defense. Additionally, we identified DCL4 as the major processor of ToTV-derived siRNA. More importantly, our results indicate the essential role of the Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3 (SGS3)/RDR6 pathway in anti-ToTV defense. Finally, we conclude that ToTV might not require a potent RNA silencing suppressor during infection of the model plant <span>N. benthamiana</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"e29fc34ab4c7e8f8ae03a0c0cf6f0762f4dd6a47eea0dde6682cd60a4fe10afb","category":"Environment"}
