{"title":"Employing Siamese Networks as Quantitative Biomarker for Assessing the effect of Dolphin-Assisted Therapy on Pediatric Cerebral Palsy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0312/v1","date":1717592406000,"content":"This study explores the potential of using a Siamese Network as a biomarker for assessing the effectiveness of Dolphin-Assisted Therapy (DAT) in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). The problem statement revolves around the need for objective measures to evaluate the impact of DAT on patients with CP, considering the subjective nature of traditional assessment methods. The methodology involves training a Siamese network, a type of neural network designed to compare similarities between inputs, using data collected from CP patients undergoing DAT sessions. The network is trained to learn patterns and similarities between pre- and post-therapy evaluations, in order to identify biomarkers indicative of therapy effectiveness. Notably, the Siamese Networkâ€™s architecture ensures that comparisons are made within the same feature space, allowing for more accurate assessments. The results of the study demonstrate promising findings, indicating different patterns in the output of the Siamese Network that correlate with improvements in symptoms of CP post-DAT. These findings suggest the potential utility of the Siamese Network as a biomarker to monitor therapy outcomes in children with CP who undergo DAT, offering a more objective and quantifiable approach to assessing therapeutic interventions. Significant disparities in neuronal voltage perturbations, with a mean of 7.9825 dB in specific samples compared to 6.2838 dB in the data set, indicate a marked difference from resting activity. This suggests that dolphin-assisted therapy selectively activates specific brain regions uniquely during the intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b871fa5ada0f5e58cdb49b2c71565b0ffcfa47ec5ba0b3a9e5f752361bcc7c7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
