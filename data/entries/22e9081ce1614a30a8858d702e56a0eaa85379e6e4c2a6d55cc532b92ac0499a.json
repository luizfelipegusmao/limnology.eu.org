{"title":"Evolving Biomarkers in Kidney Transplantation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1113/v1","date":1713345534000,"content":"Abstract Precision medicine is essentially based on reliable and non-invasive biomarkers. Aim of this review has been to describe the newest biomarkers in the field of kidney transplantation and the kidney rejection, one of the commonest and severe complications. Standard of care tools to identify acute rejection are largely full of errors and of drawbacks. In recent years new and reliable biomarkers have been found. They are avoid of risks, non-invasive and able to detect rejection even in those frequent cases in which acute rejection are clinically asymptomatic and not otherwise identifiable. In recent years several biomarkers have been identified. Very recently have been found new relevant biomarkers able to diagnose rejection with high positive predictive value and low negative predictive value. These are the donor derived cell free DNA found in the recipient, the gene expression profile of the donor found in the recipient and the urinary cytokines that express modification in the graft tissue. The aim of this study has been to find the most recent findings in the literature on this topic and to describe the utility and possible limitation of such new biomarkers on kidney rejection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22e9081ce1614a30a8858d702e56a0eaa85379e6e4c2a6d55cc532b92ac0499a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
