{"title":"Precision Immuno-Chemical Biology: Toward Decoding Spatiotemporal Signaling Activities of Reactive Immunometabolites","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1722/v1","date":1711612157000,"content":"Immune-cell reprogramming driven by mitochondria-derived reactive electrophilic immunometabolites (mt-REMs—e.g., fumarate, itaconate) is an emerging phenomenon of major biomedical importance. Despite their localized production, mt-REMs elicit significantly-large local and global footprints within and across cells, through mechanisms involving electrophile signaling. Burgeoning efforts are being put into profiling mt-REMs’ potential protein-targets and phenotypic mapping of their multifaceted inflammatory behaviors. Yet, precision indexing of mt-REMs’ first-responders with spatiotemporal intelligence and locale-specific function assignments remains elusive. Highlighting the latest advances and overarching challenges, this perspective aims to stimulate thoughts and spur interdisciplinary innovations to address these unmet chemical-biotechnological needs at therapeutic immuno-signaling frontiers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"199c69f2b7c77ae3155e4704b7681f9bb61860acedd4c18d4f9ca4a976278d8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
