{"title":"Symphony in the Brain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1254/v1","date":1713506196000,"content":"Despite impressive progress in quantum biology, many questions about perception, cognition, memory, and their relation to processing of information remain unanswered. Here is an attempt to draw a unified picture starting with the basic quantum-mechanical phenomenon of nano-superconductivity in the microtubules and extending it to quantum processing of information, and generation of coherent Josephson radiation. A model for the generation in the axons of neurons is suggested. Like in a symphony, but on frequencies ten orders of magnitude higher, the radiation forms resonant standing electromagnetic waves, which are defined by the anatomy, synchronize all the functions in organism, and are behind the memory, perception, and cognition of a living being. It is true that we are made of atoms, but we are coherent electromagnetic waves.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63de9d6ce41bfe29a76d5ed459f9e5ba4b0e8a913eff605a4f3eabb29a67e7b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
