{"title":"Deciphering the prognostic landscape of osteosarcoma: Integrating the roles of hippo pathway genes, programmed cell death, and the tumor immune microenvironment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24280?af=R","date":1713243001000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Osteosarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer prevalent among adolescents and young adults, notorious for its tendency to metastasize to the lungs. This research delves into the molecular foundations of osteosarcoma by examining the role of the Hippo signaling pathway and its interaction with the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Through analysis of transcriptomic data from the TARGET-OS dataset and control samples from GTEx, we identified a set of 131 genes that link high expression profiles in osteosarcoma with the Hippo pathway. A focused examination through univariate Cox regression analysis revealed eight key genes (DLG5, WNT11, TGFB2, DLG4, WNT16, ID2, WNT10B, and WNT10A) with a significant correlation to patient outcomes. Hierarchical clustering of these genes delineated two distinct patient groups with significantly different survival rates, a finding supported by Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis. Further investigation into immune cell infiltration and expression profiles of immunoregulatory factors uncovered a notable pattern of immune evasion in the group with poorer prognosis, marked by reduced effector immune cell activity and lower levels of immunostimulatory factors. Single-cell sequencing highlighted the cellular diversity within osteosarcoma samples and identified markers differentiating malignant from nonmalignant cells, correlating these markers with prognostic risk scores. Our results emphasize the critical prognostic value of Hippo pathway genes and the TME in osteosarcoma, shedding light on new avenues for therapeutic intervention and patient-specific treatment strategies.</p>","author":"Huayan Ma, \nYuxian Zhang, \nJing Li, \nTiantian Xie, \nZhi Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"8cc5648a1cabcc6adc980a26187993f6fd1567ef1bba2e65e03f7d274981dd74","category":"Environment"}
