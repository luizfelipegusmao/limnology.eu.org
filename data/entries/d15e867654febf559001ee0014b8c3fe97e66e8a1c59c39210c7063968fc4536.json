{"title":"Chitosan Nanoparticle-mediated Targeted Delivery of Curcumin Selectively Suppresses Tumor Growth in Breast Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1965/v1","date":1721835783000,"content":"Curcumin is a nutraceutical known to have numerous medicinal effects including anticancer activity. However, due to its poor water solubility and bioavailability, the therapeutic impact of curcumin against cancer, especially breast cancer, has been constrained. Encapsulating curcumin into chitosan nanoparticles (CHNPs) is an effective method to increase its bioavailability as well as antitumorigenic activity. In the present study, the effect of curcumin encapsulated CHNPs (Cur-CHNPs) on cell migration, targeted homing and tumour growth was examined using in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Cur-CHNPs possessed monodispersed nature with long term colloidal stability, and demonstrated significant inhibition of cell viability in vitro, which was potentiated by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Outcomes of the in vivo imaging studies confirmed effective tumour targeting and retention ability of Cur-CHNPs, thereby suppressing breast tumour growth in mice models. Overall, the results demonstrated that Cur-CHNPs, could be an effective candidate drug formulation for management of breast cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d15e867654febf559001ee0014b8c3fe97e66e8a1c59c39210c7063968fc4536","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
