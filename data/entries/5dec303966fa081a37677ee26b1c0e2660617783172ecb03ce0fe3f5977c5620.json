{"title":"Using Light as a Medium to Convey Its Dark Side&mdash;A Light Festival Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1536/v1","date":1721316562000,"content":"An online survey assessed the awareness of Nelson region’s residents, comparing responses between those who experienced the installation and those who did not. Findings indicated that eco-art installations can significantly enhance public understanding of ALAN's environmental and health impacts. The installation successfully increased specific knowledge about ALAN, with 92% of visitors reporting learning something new, however overarching knowledge and levels of concern were largely similar between the groups. Emotional engagement was high, with 62% of viewers stating that the installation invoked an emotional response. While the study did not measure behavioural changes, 94% of festival participants found it at least ‘somewhat appropriate’ and 64% ‘very’ or ‘entirely appropriate’ to raise awareness of these issues at such events, suggesting a potential foundation for future action. This research underscores the promise of art-science collaborations in environmental education and public engagement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5dec303966fa081a37677ee26b1c0e2660617783172ecb03ce0fe3f5977c5620","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
