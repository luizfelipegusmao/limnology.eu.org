{"title":"Mechanical factors influence β-catenin localization and barrier properties","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/doi/10.1093/intbio/zyae013/7702352?rss=1","date":1719878400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mechanical forces are of major importance in regulating vascular homeostasis by influencing endothelial cell behavior and functions. Adherens junctions are critical sites for mechanotransduction in endothelial cells. β-catenin, a component of adherens junctions and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, plays a role in mechanoactivation. Evidence suggests that β-catenin is involved in flow sensing and responds to tensional forces, impacting junction dynamics. The mechanoregulation of β-catenin signaling is context-dependent, influenced by the type and duration of mechanical loads. In endothelial cells, β-catenin’s nuclear translocation and signaling are influenced by shear stress and strain, affecting endothelial permeability. The study investigates how shear stress, strain, and surface topography impact adherens junction dynamics, regulate β-catenin localization, and influence endothelial barrier properties.<div><strong>Insight box</strong> Mechanical loads are potent regulators of endothelial functions through not completely elucidated mechanisms. Surface topography, wall shear stress and cyclic wall deformation contribute overlapping mechanical stimuli to which endothelial monolayer respond to adapt and maintain barrier functions. The use of custom developed flow chamber and bioreactor allows quantifying the response of mature human endothelial to well-defined wall shear stress and gradients of strain. Here, the mechanoregulation of β-catenin by substrate topography, wall shear stress, and cyclic stretch is analyzed and linked to the monolayer control of endothelial permeability.</div></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"08ec31a93e0a3f830088f3051f0870206dac7048d685312e4717ea0a4882ca75","entryHash":"34f28b3dae13612051f645dcc8ca0ea1d92723edff3fc587efc75d1309adc43a","category":"Environment"}
