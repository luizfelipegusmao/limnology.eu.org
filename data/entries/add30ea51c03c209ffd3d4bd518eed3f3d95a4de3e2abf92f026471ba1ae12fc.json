{"title":"Deriving Profiles of Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association Players Using the Latent Profile Analysis Technique: Focusing on the Impact of the Menstrual Cycle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2230/v1","date":1727580807000,"content":"Menstruation is a significant periodical factor in women's lives, affecting them from menarche to menopause. This study investigates the menstrual status and its impact on the performance of Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association (KLPGA) 1st Tour players using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). The study involved 119 female KLPGA tour license professionals who participated in over 30 tournaments annually, requiring them to manage their menstrual cycles during competitions. A questionnaire collected data on demographics, menstrual cycle characteristics, and training hours. Four distinct player profiles were identified based on self-esteem, anxiety, and perceived performance. Profile 4 exhibited the highest self-esteem and perceived performance with the lowest anxiety levels, while Profile 1 showed the highest anxiety levels and lowest self-esteem. Cross-tabulation and ANOVA analyses highlighted significant differences in practice hours and athletic experience across profiles. The findings suggest that regular menstrual cycles and athletic experience are crucial in defining player profiles. These insights are valuable for coaches and professionals to develop tailored training and management strategies to enhance performance. Future research should expand the sample size and employ longitudinal methods to validate these results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"add30ea51c03c209ffd3d4bd518eed3f3d95a4de3e2abf92f026471ba1ae12fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
