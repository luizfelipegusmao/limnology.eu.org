{"title":"Natural History and Risk Factors of Hymenoptera Venom Allergy in Dogs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1096/v1","date":1728969914000,"content":"Hymenoptera, which includes honeybees, wasps, bumblebees, and hornets, is an order of the class Insecta whose venom can induce anaphylactic reactions in dogs. While several studies have investigated the natural histories and risk factors of Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) in humans, only limited information is available on canine patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify risk factors leading to severe systemic reactions (SSR) and to explore the natural history of these patients. This was achieved with an inquiry into the case histories of 178 dogs that were stung by Hymenoptera between 2018 and 2022. Dogs under two years old, dogs that weighed under 10kg, purebred dogs and dogs that were stung in the oral cavity were at a greater risk of developing SSR. Almost two thirds of patients with SSR experienced the same or worse symptoms after subsequent stings and &amp;gt; 40% of patients with local reactions developed SSR when stung again. Next to providing valuable clinical information of HVA in dogs, these findings strongly support the recommendation of venom immunotherapy (VIT) for patients with HVA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2444dc625d8bf71ad9a18d5a7d21dff9f459ff66b5f5714de931228473c25f02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
