{"title":"Totally Endoscopic Replacement of the Ascending Aorta and the Aortic Root including the Aortic Valve via Right Mini-Thoracotomy: A Multicenter Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0899/v1","date":1713164407000,"content":"Background: Recently, minimally invasive access via right-anterolateral mini-thoracotomy (RAMT) has been gaining popularity in cardiac surgery. This approach is also an option for sur-geons performing aortic surgery. Aim of the study is to present our surgical method highlighting the total endoscopic minimally invasive approach via RAMT for replacement of the ascending aorta (AAR) with or without involvement of the aortic root and the aortic valve. Methods: Clini-cal data of 44 patients from three participating institutions with AAR with or without involving the aortic valve or aortic root via RAMT between April 2017 and February 2024 were retrospec-tively analyzed. According to surgical procedure patients were divided in group A with only AAR and group B with concomitant valve or root replacement. Operative time, length of ventila-tion, perioperative outcome, length of intensive care unit (ICU) as well as postoperative hospital stay, and mid- and long-term results were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Mean age was 61.4 ± 10.7 years old with a frequency of male gender (63.6%). Mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) time and aortic cross-clamping time was 94.9 ± 32.5 min. and 63.8 ± 25.9 min., respectively. CPB and aortic clamp time were significantly lower in group A. In the first 24 hours the mean drain-age volume was 790.3 ± 423.6 ml. Re-thoracotomy due to bleeding was zero. Sternotomy could be avoided in all patients. Patients stayed 35.9 ± 23.5 hrs at ICU and were discharged 7.8 ± 3.0 days following surgery from hospital. Mean ventilation time was 5.8 ± 7.6 hrs. All patients survived and 30-day mortality was 0.0%. At a median follow-up time of 18.2 months, all patients were alive. The results were similar in both groups. Conclusions: The full endoscopic RAMT approach with 3D visualization is a safe and feasible technique which can be transferred in the field of aor-tic surgery without compromising surgical quality, postoperative outcomes, or patient safety when performed by an experienced team in a high-volume center.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f536fc4825b9ec5954a7993fa8e16daf1b964b343a957f5131ab6930280af9f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
