{"title":"On the Use of New 3D Modelization, Reconstruction and Printing Techniques to Improve the Metatarsophalangeal Cancerous Lesion Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0047/v1","date":1711967776000,"content":"Background: The main objective of this study is to develop a customized metatarsophalangeal implant for the treatment of various conditions affecting this specific joint. This approach involves replacing the joint with a custom implant designed specifically to fit each patient's unique anatomical structure. The need for custom implants stems from the obvious lack of size variety available, which presents a major challenge when, the search for the ideal size implant can be a hard task, also when considering the possibility of extensive modification of the bone to adapt it to the available implant. This adaptation, often synonymous with bone reduction, can cause significant post-operative pain for the patient and impact healing time. Methods: A comparative study of modeling software was carried out to select the perfect software, by defining and comparing the relevant criteria. Similarly, the different biomaterial options were examined and compared to select the one best suited to this project, mentioning the imaging modality used to determine the types of images used for our approach. Finally, the 3D printers used in this work were represented, highlighting their technical characteristics. Findings: A resin metatarsophalangeal implant prototype was created using 3D modeling and reconstruction software and tools. Interpretation: Reconstruction and 3D modeling techniques are revolutionizing implant creation, offering customized solutions for patients suffering from metatarsophalangeal joint disorders caused by a wide range of diseases. These results have significant implications for disability management and rehabilitation, encouraging further exploration and progress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70cc422751c393b0a2f5409be30cc917de96b0eadc2db42d7a0d3ef77c25983c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
