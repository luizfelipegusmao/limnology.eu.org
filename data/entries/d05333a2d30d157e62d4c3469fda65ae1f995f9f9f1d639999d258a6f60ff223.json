{"title":"Anti-calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Monoclonal Antibody Is Effective for Preventing Migraine Aura without Headache","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1086/v1","date":1726221099000,"content":"Background: anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (CGRP mAbs) are clinically effective in preventing migraine attacks, photophobia, and migraine aura associated with headaches. However, no study has yet investigated the effectiveness of CGRP mAbs in preventing migraine aura without headache. Case report: A female patient of 49 years old has a long history (since age 10) of photosensitivity and typical migraine aura without headache. The symptoms slightly responded to oral medication but did not completely resolve. Just one day after the administration of galcanezumab, her photo-hypersensitivity and migraine aura had completely resolved. Consequently, the administration of the oral migraine preventive medication was discontinued. Monthly galcanezumab at the dose of 120 mg has been continuously given and she did not experience any aura or headache so far. Conclusions: CGRP mAbs is considered an effective treatment method in preventing migraine aura without headache. Although CGRP mAbs do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, trigeminal nerve stabilization with CGRP mAb can prevent cortical spreading depression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d05333a2d30d157e62d4c3469fda65ae1f995f9f9f1d639999d258a6f60ff223","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
