{"title":"MiR-27a inhibits the growth and metastasis of multiple myeloma through regulating Th17/Treg balance","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311419","date":1729087200000,"content":"<p>by Weiguo Lu, Hui Huang, Zhanjie Xu, Shumin Xu, Kewei Zhao, Mingfeng Xiao</p>\r\nBackground <p>The imbalance between T helper 17 (Th17) and T regulatory (Treg) cells plays a key role in the progression of multiple myeloma (MM).</p> Methods <p>The gene expression profiles of MM were acquired and examined from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE72213). Our research involved experimental investigations conducted using the MOPC-MM mouse model. Dysregulation of Treg and Th17 cells was evaluated through flow cytometry, while the levels of inflammatory factors were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell proliferation was gauged using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and cell apoptosis was quantified via flow cytometry. Cell metastasis capabilities were determined by conducting transwell assays. To confirm the relationship between miR-27a and PI3K, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was employed. Finally, proteins associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were assessed using western blotting.</p> Results <p>MiR-27a exhibited reduced expression levels in MM. Moreover, it exerted control over the equilibrium of Th17 and Treg cells while reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators such as TGF-Î²1 and IL-10 in an <i>in vivo</i> setting. Elevated miR-27a levels led to the inhibition of cell viability, colony formation capacity, migratory and invasive traits in an <i>in vitro</i> context. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was identified as a direct target of miR-27a and could reverse the effects induced by miR-27a in MM cells. Notably, PI3K was directly targeted by miR-27a.</p> Conclusions <p>Our study revealed that miR-27a inhibited MM evolution by regulating the Th17/Treg balance. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by miR-27a may play a potential mechanistic role.</p>","author":"Weiguo Lu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1a583fdb1505bde02dbb09f7235ceb033e3c1e8c72ad8c56732d0f13a8133e9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
