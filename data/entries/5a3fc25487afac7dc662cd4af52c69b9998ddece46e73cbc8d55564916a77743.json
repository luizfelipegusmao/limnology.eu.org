{"title":"Comparative Analysis of the Health Status of Heart Transplant Patients with Different Levels of Physical Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1144/v1","date":1723770595000,"content":"The studyÂ´s goals were to determine the health status of a group of heart transplant recipients (HTR) and their level of physical activity and to compare the health status among them and with a group of healthy sedentary individuals. Fifty-four HTR and eighteen S were assigned to four groups, according to their level of physical activity (determined with The International Physical Activity Questionnaire); patients with a low, a moderate and a high level of physical activity (HTRL, HTRM and HTRH, respectively) and sedentary individuals (S). Participants underwent a basic blood analysis and several tests to assess their cardiovascular, neuromuscular, functional mobility condition and their quality of life. The S and HTRH were very similar in terms of BP, HR and blood analysis while HTRM and HTRL differed from both S and HTRH in these parameters. Regarding the cardiovascular, neuromuscular, functional mobility, and quality of life variables assessed in this study, HTRH showed the best results across all of them, followed by S, HTRM, and HTRL. It is suggested that the weekly level of physical activity of HTR should be high, what might help them to enhance their health and quality of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a3fc25487afac7dc662cd4af52c69b9998ddece46e73cbc8d55564916a77743","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
