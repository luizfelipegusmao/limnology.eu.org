{"title":"The Institutionalization of People with Intellectual Disabilities: A Never-Ending Story","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0453/v1","date":1715157258000,"content":"The institutionalization of people with intellectual disabilities has been a common international response across cultures and generations that persists to this day.  This chapter recounts its inheritance and manifestation in modern service provision. An institutional mind-set persists among clinicians and managers despite policies that emphasise the rights of persons with intellectual disability and anti-discriminatory practice.  Alternative provision is rooted in person-centred practice; with a growing body of evidence for the improved quality of life that results from it.  A reflective activity encourages readers to examine a recent case when they were associated with an institutional placement and what alternatives might have been sought.   Yet alliances with other professionals, self-advocates and family carers will be needed to effect real and lasting changes in our service cultures and even then, the long shadows of institutional care may still persist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87c3743b9e4aed509144385cec362752adad7c3968e8e10b4575383d050282c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
