{"title":"miRNA Dysregulation in Keratinocyte Carcinomas: Clinical Evidence, Experimental Validation, and Future Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1323/v1","date":1721164491000,"content":"The keratinocyte carcinomas, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), are the most common cancers in humans. Recently, an increasing body of literature has investigated the role of miRNAs in keratinocyte carcinoma pathogenesis, progression and their use as therapeutic agents and targets, or biomarkers. However, there is very little consistency in the literature regarding the identity of and/or role of individual miRNAs in cSCC (and to a lesser extent BCC) biology. miRNA analyses that combine clinical evidence with experimental elucidation of targets and functional impact provide far more compelling evidence than studies purely based on clinical findings or bioinformatic analyses. In this study, we review the clinical evidence associated with miRNA dysregulation in KCs assessing the quality of validation evidence provided, identify gaps, and provide recommendations for future studies based on relevant studies that investigated miRNA levels in human cSCC and BCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate how miRNAs contribute to the regulation of a diverse network of cellular functions, and that large-scale changes in tumor cell biology can be attributed to miRNA dysregulation. We highlight the need for further studies investigating the role of miRNAs as communicators between different cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we explore the clinical benefits of miRNAs as biomarkers of keratinocyte carcinoma prognosis and treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40ccee9c191728572c1a1bb0c9a603d4653105b03050da939478c8ff602464ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
