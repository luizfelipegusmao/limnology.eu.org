{"title":"Downstream decreases in water availability, tree height, canopy volume and growth rate in cottonwood forests along the Green River, southwestern USA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2693?af=R","date":1723089534000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Hydrologic stress is increasing in Fremont cottonwood (<i>Populus fremontii</i>) forests across the southwestern United States because of increased temperature and streamflow diversion. The spatial variability of this stress is large yet poorly understood. Along the Yampa and Green Rivers in Colorado and Utah, vapour pressure deficit and flow diversions increase downstream. To investigate effects of this gradient on cottonwoods, we measured the percent live canopy and height of randomly selected trees at three sites: Deerlodge Park on the Yampa River (DLP), Island Park on the upper Green (ILP) and Canyonlands National Park on the lower Green (CAN). From these same trees, we took increment cores to understand differences in tree growth in each forest over time. We then related tree metrics to local water availability, streamflow and climatic data. Cottonwoods at CAN were shorter and had lower percent live canopy and growth rate than similarly aged trees upstream. CAN trees that grew higher above the water surface also tended to have lower tree growth, height and live canopy percentage. Furthermore, the correlation between tree growth and maximum vapour pressure deficit showed a much stronger negative shift since 1990 at CAN than at the other sites. All of these differences suggest higher hydrologic stress at CAN, which we attribute to the combined effects of peak flow declines from Flaming Gorge Reservoir, flow diversion and the higher and increasing vapour pressure deficit at CAN. Further research on the variability of hydrologic stress on cottonwoods could help managers anticipate and mitigate the effects of drought stress in these iconic forests.</p>","author":"Richard Thaxton, \nMichael L.
