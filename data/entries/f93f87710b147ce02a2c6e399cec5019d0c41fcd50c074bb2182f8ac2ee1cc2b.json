Employing holographic vitrification, we unravel the dynamics of domain wall formation in gauge theories featur- ing periodic vacuum structures. Our model, incorporating a QCD-like axion term and a stabilizing dilaton, undergoes scrutiny for conductivity variations under weak disorder. The investigation reveals the model’s resilience, manifesting near-perfect conductivity under mild disorder conditions. However, the rigorous mathematical motivation for the holographic setup demands further elucidation. The scattered nature of our results prompts the neces- sity for a more systematic interpretation of QCD phenomena and conductivity transitions. This study contributes to the mathematical understanding of the axion-dilaton model’s be- havior, highlighting the imperative for a refined holographic framework and a more coherent interpretation of observed phenomena.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f93f87710b147ce02a2c6e399cec5019d0c41fcd50c074bb2182f8ac2ee1cc2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
