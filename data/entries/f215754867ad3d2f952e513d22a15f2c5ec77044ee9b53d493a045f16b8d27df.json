In most cases, PAC is dosed into water directly, then precipitated as sludge, and landfilled. In this study, PAC was mixed with a polymer and dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent to form a PAC-loaded membrane, which was then tested for chloroform removal. The chloroform adsorption capacity of the PAC membrane increased with increasing membrane thickness because of higher carbon loading. However, regardless of membrane thickness, the flux of the PAC membranes was similar since flux resistance predominantly occurred at the top dense polymer surface. This dense surface can be removed by sandpaper polishing, where the adsorption capacity of the polished PAC membranes was 20% higher than the unpolished membranes because of more even distribution of feed water on the polished surface. Removal of the dense surface via polishing increased the flux by 97% to 130%, exceeding the flux of typical household carbon block filters. Using DMF to regenerate the membrane recovered 48% to 66% of the initial adsorption capacity. Thermal regeneration of the exhausted PAC membrane at 250°C was more effective than DMF regeneration (both in terms of cost and performance), with 83% to 94% PAC membrane regeneration efficiency over four regeneration recycles. After four thermal regeneration cycles, flux increased by 300% and the membrane became brittle because of thermal aging of the polymer, indicating that a total of 6 h of regeneration time (equivalent to three cycles in this study) was the limit for effective PAC membrane performance.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nPowdered activated carbon was immobilized on a membrane to remove chloroform from water.\nThicker membranes increased adsorption capacity but did not impact flux.\nFlux and capacity increased using polishing to remove the dense polymer surface and more evenly distribute flow across the membrane.\nThermal regeneration of the membrane at 250°C was effective for up to three cycles and outperformed solvent-based regeneration.\nPAC-loaded filters are relevant for applications such as household carbon block filtration.\n</p>","author":"Yizhi Hou, \nBrooke K.
