{"title":"Woolly mutation with the Get02 locus overcomes the polygenic nature of trichome-based pest resistance in tomato","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/911/7625223?rss=1","date":1710115200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Type-IV glandular trichomes, which only occur in the juvenile developmental phase of the cultivated tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>), produce acylsugars that broadly protect against arthropod herbivory. Previously, we introgressed the capacity to retain type-IV trichomes in the adult phase from the wild tomato, <span>Solanum galapagense</span>, into the cultivated species cv. Micro-Tom (MT). The resulting MT-<span>Galapagos enhanced trichome</span> (MT-<span>Get</span>) introgression line contained 5 loci associated with enhancing the density of type-IV trichomes in adult plants. We genetically dissected MT-<span>Get</span> and obtained a subline containing only the locus on Chromosome 2 (MT-<span>Get02</span>). This genotype displayed about half the density of type-IV trichomes compared to the wild progenitor. However, when we stacked the gain-of-function allele of <span>WOOLLY</span>, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper IV transcription factor, <span>Get02/Wo</span> exhibited double the number of type-IV trichomes compared to <span>S. galapagense</span>. This discovery corroborates previous reports positioning <span>WOOLLY</span> as a master regulator of trichome development. Acylsugar levels in <span>Get02/Wo</span> were comparable to the wild progenitor, although the composition of acylsugar types differed, especially regarding fewer types with medium-length acyl chains. Agronomical parameters of <span>Get02/Wo</span>, including yield, were comparable to MT. Pest resistance assays showed enhanced protection against silverleaf whitefly (<span>Bemisia tabaci</span>), tobacco hornworm (<span>Manduca sexta</span>), and the fungus <span>Septoria lycopersici</span>. However, resistance levels did not reach those of the wild progenitor, suggesting the specificity of acylsugar types in the pest resistance mechanism. Our findings in trichome-mediated resistance advance the development of robust, naturally resistant tomato varieties, harnessing the potential of natural genetic variation. Moreover, by manipulating only 2 loci, we achieved exceptional results for a highly complex, polygenic trait, such as herbivory resistance in tomato.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0e95d341fe1dc9d5f7ccfe80cab560f97709b872a1c8f4d0f8def3354c503f82","category":"Environment"}
