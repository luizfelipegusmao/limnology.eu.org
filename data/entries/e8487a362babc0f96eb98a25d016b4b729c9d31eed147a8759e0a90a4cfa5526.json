{"title":"The Role of Echocardiography in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Pulmonary Hypertension","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1194/v1","date":1710926700000,"content":"The right heart catheterisation constitutes the gold standard for pulmonary hypertension (PH) diagnosis. However, echocardiography remains a reliable, non-invasive, inexpensive, convenient, and easily reproducible modality not only for the preliminary screening of PH but also for PH prognosis. The aim of this review is to describe a cluster of echocardiographic parameters for the detection and prognosis of PH and analyse the challenges of echocardiography implementation in patients with suspected or established PH. The most important echocardiographic index is the calculation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) through the tricuspid regurgitation (TR). It has shown high correlation with invasive measurement of pulmonary pressure, but several drawbacks have questioned its accuracy. Besides this, the right ventricular outflow track acceleration time (RVOT-AT) has been proposed for PH diagnosis. A plethora of echocardiographic indices: right atrial area, pericardial effusion, the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), the TAPSE/PASP ratio, tricuspid annular systolic velocity (sâ€²) and recently, can reflect the severity and prognosis of PH. Recent advances in echocardiography with 3-dimensional right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction, RV free wall strain and right atrial strain may further assist the prognostication of PH.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8487a362babc0f96eb98a25d016b4b729c9d31eed147a8759e0a90a4cfa5526","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
