{"title":"Ontogenetic variability in the diel activity pattern of the marine gastropod Cassis cornuta (Mollusca: Cassidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyad024/7589560?rss=1","date":1706140800000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>Examining activity patterns is essential in understanding gastropod feeding and movement ecology. However, the diel activity patterns of large-bodied gastropods, such as <span>Cassis cornuta</span>, remain poorly studied. Here, we conducted outdoor hatchery-based experiments to examine the diel activity patterns of <span>C. cornuta</span> adults and juveniles under natural sunlight and photoperiod. Activities of <span>C. cornuta</span>, such as crawling, hunting, feeding, burrowing and resting on the substratum, were examined every hour for 3 days. Although most individuals were inactive for a greater part of the observation period, active behaviours were recorded for some individuals during both daytime and nighttime, suggesting that <span>C. cornuta</span> is cathemeral, as supported by a nonsignificant result from a Rayleigh's test of uniformity. A higher proportion of adult and juvenile <span>C. cornuta</span> were inactive, either burrowed or resting on the substratum, during the 24-h period. Peak activity time for juveniles started at 20:00, with up to 50% of individuals active, while peak activity time for adults started at 21:00, with up to 20% of active individuals. Adults spent more time resting aboveground, whereas juveniles spent more time burrowed under the sand when not feeding. Juveniles hunted more frequently and spent more time feeding compared to adults. Additionally, juveniles crawled faster and were more successful in capturing sea urchins than adults. The information on variability in the diel activity patterns and movement rates between adult and juvenile <span>C. cornuta</span> would allow further demographic studies, and provide insights into possible conservation strategies for this species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"7705aca26ac71a6072e1b8e51245cf22dc90503898eba5e432ea1111e92c3138","category":"Environment"}
