{"title":"The Cultural Impact of Recent Urban-Rural Migration on Depopulated Rural Areas in Southern Transylvania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2302/v1","date":1722290944000,"content":"There has recently been discussion regarding how heritage rural areas are culturally affected by recent urban â€“ rural migration. However, little research has been done into the form this process takes in post-communist contexts. Taking a geography approach to some Romanian heritage sites, this study foregrounds narratives based on interviews with local people in two villages in southern Transylvania that were formerly inhabited by different ethnicities. The results point to quite different perceptions of cultural landscape change in the two villages. Although both communities consciously seek to preserve and maintain a sense of place that is rooted in history, those who migrate from urban areas to these rural heritage places represent a catalyst for community resilience and development in areas such as acquisition of buildings, development of facilities, modern social services, and seeking new funding for landscape transformation. As NGOs function as a link between government, local people, newcomers to the community, and investors, we contend that more attention could be paid to channelling their funds towards investment in rural heritage. The greatest challenges to heritage are those posed by tourism, while NGOs and small investors are the driving force that helps to preserve and save cultural heritage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad167049300b04c0062f263009ff365393329588843fc1ccc210d7a1ce512ad2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
