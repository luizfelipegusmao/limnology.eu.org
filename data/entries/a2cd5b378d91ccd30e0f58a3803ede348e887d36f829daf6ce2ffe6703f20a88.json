{"title":"Photoprotective Effect of Ultrasonic-Assisted Ethanol Extract from Sargassum horneri on UVB-Exposed HaCaT Keratinocytes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0959/v1","date":1728712347000,"content":"The present study investigated the photoprotective effect of the ultrasonic-assisted ethanol extract (USHE) from Sargassum horneri, a brown seaweed containing fucosterol (6.22 Â± 0.06 mg/g) and sulfoquinovosyl glycerolipids (C23H43O11S, C25H45O11S, C25H47O11S, C27H49O11S), against oxidative damage in ultraviolet B (UVB)-exposed HaCaT keratinocytes. USHE indicated the antioxidant activity with increasing ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging. Moreover, USHE increased cell viability by markedly reducing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in UVB-exposed HaCaT keratinocytes. Additionally, USHE reduced the apoptosis, and sub-G1 cell population, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, USHE modulated the protein expression levels of anti-apoptotic molecules (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and PARP), and pro-apoptotic molecules (Bax, cleaved caspase-3, p53, cleaved PARP, and cytochrome C). This modulation accorded with the upregulation of cytosolic heme oxygenase (HO)-1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1), and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), collectively known as components of the antioxidant system. These findings suggest that USHE has a photoprotective effect in UVB-exposed HaCaT keratinocytes and can be utilized to develop cosmeceuticals for UVB protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2cd5b378d91ccd30e0f58a3803ede348e887d36f829daf6ce2ffe6703f20a88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
