{"title":"Analysis of a new negevirus-like sequence from <i>Bemisia tabaci</i> unveils a potential new taxon linking nelorpi- and centiviruses","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303838","date":1715868000000,"content":"<p>by Diego F.

Flores</p>\r\n\r\nThis study presents the complete genome sequence of a novel nege-like virus identified in whiteflies (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i> MEAM1), provisionally designated as whitefly negevirus 1 (WfNgV1). The virus possesses a single-stranded RNA genome comprising 11,848 nucleotides, organized into four open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs encode the putative RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp, ORF 1), a glycoprotein (ORF 2), a structural protein with homology to those in the SP24 family, (ORF 3), and a protein of unknown function (ORF 4). Phylogenetic analysis focusing on RdRp and SP24 amino acid sequences revealed a close relationship between WfNgV1 and Bemisia tabaci negevirus 1, a negevirus sequence recently discovered in whiteflies from Israel. Both viruses form a clade sharing a most recent common ancestor with the proposed nelorpivirus and centivirus taxa. The putative glycoprotein from ORF 2 and SP24 (ORF 3) of WfNgV1 exhibit the characteristic topologies previously reported for negevirus counterparts. This marks the first reported negevirus-like sequence from whiteflies in the Americas.","author":"Diego F.
