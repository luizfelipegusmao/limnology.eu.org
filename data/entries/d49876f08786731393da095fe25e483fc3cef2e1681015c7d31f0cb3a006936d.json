{"title":"A Novel Method of Secured Data Distribution Using Sharding Zkp and Zero Trust Architecture in Blockchain Multi Cloud Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2555/v1","date":1722426799000,"content":"In the era of cloud computing, guaranteeing the safety and effectiveness of data management is of utmost importance. This investigation presents a novel approach that amalgamates sharding concept, encryption, zero-knowledge proofs (zkp), and blockchain technology for secure data retrieval and data access control to improve data security, efficiency in cloud storage and migration. Further we utilize user-specific digital wallets for secure encryption keys in order to encrypt the file before storing into the cloud. As Large files ( greater than 50 MB) or Big data file ( grater than 1 TB) computational complexity is more we leverage on sharding concept to enhance both space and time complexity in cloud storage, hence the large files are divided into shards and stored in different database servers. We also employed blockchain smart contract to enhance secure retrieval of the file and also a secure access method which ensures the privacy of the user. The zk-snark protocol is utilized to ensure the safe transfer of data between different cloud services. By utilizing this approach, data privacy is preserved, as only the proof of the dataâ€™s authenticity is shared with the verifier at the destination cloud, rather than the actual data itself. The suggested method tackles important concerns related to data protection, privacy, and efficient resource utilization in cloud computing settings by ensuring it meets all the cloud policies require to store data. As the environment maintains privacy of the user data and by not storing the raw data of the user anywhere, the entire environment is setup as a Zero trust model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d49876f08786731393da095fe25e483fc3cef2e1681015c7d31f0cb3a006936d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
