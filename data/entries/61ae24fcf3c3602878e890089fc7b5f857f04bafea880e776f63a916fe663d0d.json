{"title":"Rice Husk as a Sustainable Amendment for Heavy Metal Immobilization in Contaminated Soils: A Pathway to Environmental Remediation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1173/v1","date":1728981102000,"content":"Rice husk is a waste by-product of rice production. This material has a moderate cost and is readily available, representing 20-22% of the biomass produced by rice cultivation. This study focused on the properties of rice husk in remediation of soils contaminated by heavy metals. The effect of particle size, pH, and the presence of organic ligands on sorption efficiency was evaluated for cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn). The continuous flow method was used to select suitable operative conditions and maximize the retention of heavy metals. Subsequently, pot experiments were carried out by growing two broadleaf plants, Lactuca sativa, and Spinacia oleracea, in aliquots of soil collected in a Piedmont (Northwest Italy) site heavily contaminated by Cu, chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni). Rice husk was added to the contaminated soil to evaluate its effectiveness in immobilizing heavy metals. The availability of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in soil was studied using Tessier's sequential extraction protocol. The content of the elements was also analyzed in plants and the uptake of heavy metals was evaluated in relation to the addition of rice husk. The growth of both plants resulted more efficient in the presence of rice husk due to its ability to reduce the mobility of heavy metals in the soil. The simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of its employment make the use of rice husk suitable for practical applications in soil remediation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61ae24fcf3c3602878e890089fc7b5f857f04bafea880e776f63a916fe663d0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
