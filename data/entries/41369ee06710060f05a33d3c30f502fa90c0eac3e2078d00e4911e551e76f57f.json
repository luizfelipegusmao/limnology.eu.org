{"title":"Comparative Study of the Development of EFs in Children: Transition from the First Cycle to the Second Cycle of Early Childhood Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1383/v1","date":1726653426000,"content":"Antecedents. EFs (EFs) are the basis for establishing a goal and working towards that goal by coordinating thoughts and actions. EFs are fundamental to several aspects of daily life, specifically for academic performance. Aim. To analyze and compare the development of EFs in the transition period between the first and second cycles of Early Childhood Education. Methodology. Non-experimental methodology, ex post facto design, descriptive, cross-sectional evolution study. Participants. Preschoolers of different educational levels (first and second cycle of Infant Education). In this study the participants have been evaluated by different informants: 54.42% by parents and 45.58% by teachers. In relation to gender, 52.65% were male and 47.35% were female. In relation to age, 37.54% had a range of 2-3 years and 62.46% had a range of 4-5 years. Measurement. Instrument development of EFs were evaluated using BRIEF-P by key informants. Results. Preschoolers in the first cycle show significantly higher scores than preschoolers in the second cycle in BRIEP-P. Conclusions. The development of EF is key in these first key moments, having a special impact on later development and academic performance. It is necessary to work on EFs from the first cycle of Early Childhood Education, considering the evolutionary development of EFs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"41369ee06710060f05a33d3c30f502fa90c0eac3e2078d00e4911e551e76f57f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
