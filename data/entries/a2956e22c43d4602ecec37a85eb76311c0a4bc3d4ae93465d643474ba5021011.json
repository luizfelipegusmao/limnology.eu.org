We hypothesized that changes in brain connectivity could predict changes in neurocognitive functioning, demonstrating the potential for brain connectivity aware surgical planning to provide enhanced outcomes for patients. \n\nMethods: Patients underwent functional and diffusion MR scanning and neuropsychological testing before tumor resection and two weeks post-resection. Using this functional and diffusion imaging, we measured changes in the topology of the functional and structural graph networks, respectively. From the neuropsychological testing scores, we derived a composite score that describes a patientâ€™s overall level of neurocognitive functioning. We then used a multiple linear regression model to test if structural and functional connectivity measures could predict changes in composite scores. \n\nResults: Twenty-one subjects completed imaging and neuropsychological evaluation both before and after surgery. The multiple linear regression model showed that changes in functional local efficiency were inversely correlated with changes in composite score (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a2956e22c43d4602ecec37a85eb76311c0a4bc3d4ae93465d643474ba5021011","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
