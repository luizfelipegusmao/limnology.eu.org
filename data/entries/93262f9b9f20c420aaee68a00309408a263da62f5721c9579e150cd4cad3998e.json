{"title":"Design and On-Orbit Performance of Ku-Band Phase-Array SAR Payload System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2092/v1","date":1724908462000,"content":"The current emphasis in the advancement of space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is on lightweight payloads under 100kg with resolutions surpassing 1m. This focus is directed towards meeting the launch criteria for multiple satellites on a single rocket and cutting costs. This article discusses the creation and progress of a Ku-band SAR payload for the Taijing-4(03) Satellite, launched on January 23, 2024 accompanied by four other satellites. The SAR payload design was customized to meet the demands of a micro-nano satellite platform, resulting in a lightweight, flat design weighing less than 80kg, seamlessly integrated with the plate-shaped satellite platform. The article also introduces a beam optimization strategy for the phased array SAR antenna, significantly boosting the SAR systemâ€™s performance. The SAR payload provides various operating modes like slide-spot, strip, scan 1, scan 2, and others, with a maximum achievable resolution exceeding 1m. Extensive in-orbit testing of the payload produced numerous high-quality SAR images with potential uses in emergency disaster mitigation, safeguarding ecosystems, monitoring forests, managing crops, tracking sea ice, and more.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"93262f9b9f20c420aaee68a00309408a263da62f5721c9579e150cd4cad3998e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
