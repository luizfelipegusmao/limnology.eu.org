{"title":"Dust Monitoring and Three-Dimensional Transport Characteristics of Dust Aerosol in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0913/v1","date":1726061136000,"content":"Global dust events have become more frequent due to climate change and increased human activity, significantly impacting air quality and human health. Previous studies have often focused on simulating cross-regional dust transport based on atmospheric parameters; however, comprehensive monitoring of dust events remains challenging. Therefore, this study utilized Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) imagery, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar, and other auxiliary data to conduct three-dimensional spatiotemporal monitoring and cross-regional transport analysis of two typical dust events in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region of China using four dust intensity indices (Icsd, Dust Detection Index (DDI), Dust value (DV), and Dust Strength Index (DSI)) and the HYSPLIT model. We found that among the four indices, DDI was the most suitable for studying dust in the BTH region, with a detection accuracy (POCD) of &gt; 88% at all times and reaching a maximum of 96.14%. Both the 2021 and 2023 dust events originated from large-scale deforestation in southern Mongolia and the border area of Inner Mongolia, with dust plumes distributed between 2 and 12 km being transported across regions to the BTH area. Further, when dust aerosols are primarily concentrated below 4 km and PM10 concentrations consistently exceed 600 µg/m³, large dust storms are more likely to occur in the BTH region. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the sources, transport pathways, and environmental impacts of dust aerosols.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"305710e6406eb59fdc8533db357e6f4919f609af44c3d6f0e127d7ad41dae6b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
