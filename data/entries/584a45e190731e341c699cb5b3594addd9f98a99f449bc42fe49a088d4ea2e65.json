{"title":"Reproductive cycle, fecundity and growth of the freshwater mussel Unio tumidus (Bivalvia: Unionidae) from Lake Viinijärvi, Finland","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyae024/7710424?rss=1","date":1720569600000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>Freshwater mussels have a substantial role in aquatic ecosystem function and provide valuable ecosystem services, including water filtration, nutrient cycling, habitat creation and sediment stabilization. While they face population declines globally that can negatively affect an ecosystem's health, such as reducing the water quality and increasing the turbidity, lack of information about the basic reproductive biology for most species makes their conservation much more difficult. Here, we monitored a population of <span>Unio tumidus</span> for a year to study its reproductive biology, gonad-dwelling parasites and growth rate in Lake Viinijärvi, Finland. Our data revealed that this species was dioecious with no evidence of hermaphroditism and was non-significantly female-biased (a male to female ratio of 1:1.3). Both sexes of <span>U. tumidus</span> had continuous gametogenesis during the study period with two peaks in the gonadosomatic index (GSI%) during November and May, followed by two clear declines in December and June. Gravidity period (brooding) of embryos or glochidia in the female's outer gills lasted from June to July. Therefore, this population of <span>U. tumidus</span> can be classified as a short-term breeder (tachytictic). The clear decline of GSI% in December might be a strategy that individuals of <span>U. tumidus</span> use to resorb resources back from the gonad for somatic maintenance during winter. Mean length of glochidia was 391 ± 0.049 µm, being among the largest known glochidia for Unionidae. No gonad-dwelling trematode parasites were detected and the population exhibited high fecundity (numbers of oocytes per female), with an average oocyte production of 242,000 ± 18,000. The studied population had a moderate growth rate with a maximum predicted age of 13 years and asymptotic length (the length at which growth slows down while the mussel continues to age, <span>L</span><sub>∞</sub>) of 114 mm. Our study provides the first quantitative data and histological analysis of the reproductive biology of <span>U. tumidus</span>, serving as a basis for future research and conservation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"584a45e190731e341c699cb5b3594addd9f98a99f449bc42fe49a088d4ea2e65","category":"Environment"}
