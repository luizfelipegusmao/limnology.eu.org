{"title":"Genomic Approaches for Drug Repurposing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1075/v1","date":1713346702000,"content":"Functional genomics, a multidisciplinary subject, investigates the functions of genes and their products in biological systems to better understand diseases and find new drugs. Drug repurposing is an economically efficient approach that entails discovering novel therapeutic applications for already-available medications. Genomics enables the identification of illness and therapeutic molecular characteristics and interactions, which in turn facilitates the process of drug repurposing. Techniques like gene expression profiling and Mendelian randomization are helpful in identifying possible medication candidates. Progress in computer science allows for the investigation and modelling of gene expression networks that involve large amounts of data. The integration of data from DNA, RNA, and protein activities has resemblance to pharmacogenomics, which is of utmost importance in the development of cancer drugs. Functional genomics in drug discovery, particularly for cancer, is still not thoroughly investigated, despite the existence of a significant amount of literature on the subject. Next-generation sequencing and proteomics present highly intriguing opportunities. Publicly available databases and mining techniques facilitate the development of cancer treatments based on functional genomics. Expanding the study and application of functional genomics has great promise to advance the process of discovering and repurposing drugs, especially in the field of oncology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b32ba1b60d81bcdd2c011d779874a2048c712125c517c0eb33de155498a84ee9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
