{"title":"Suboptimal Hepatitis B Vaccine Response in IBD Patients: Prednisolone and Esomeprazole as Contributing Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1894/v1","date":1724765956000,"content":"Background: Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) is one of the worldwide health issues with increasing incidence. Recent data point out that those patients can have a defective immune system, rendering response to vaccinations suboptimal. Since 1990, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) vaccination has been introduced among the compulsory childhood vaccinations in Oman. Given the questionable immunogenicity of vaccinations in IBD patients, we designed this study to quantify the immune response to scheduled HBV vaccine in IBD patients and compare it with that in a matching control cohort of healthy blood donors at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH). Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study that was conducted between the 1st of July 2023 and the 31st of May 2024 at SQUH. Using the hospital information System (HIS), a total of 252 participants were enrolled in our study and divided into two groups. Group (1) included 126 IBD patients and group (2) included 126 healthy controls. Baseline demographics, medical comorbidities and viral serologies before and after vaccination were collected. The primary outcome of the study was to compare the long term immune response to HBV vaccine between the two groups. The secondary outcomes included identifying possible risk factors for suboptimal vaccine response. Results: One hundred and twenty-six participants were included in each group. Durable protective immune response to HBV vaccine was attained in 29 patients (23%) of the IBD group compared to 109 participants (86.5%) of the control group. There was a statistically significant association (p = 0.0156) between prednisolone treatment and low immune response to HBV vaccine. Moreover, esomeprazole usage exhibited a statistically significant association (p &lt; 0.0001) with suboptimal response to HBV vaccine. Meanwhile, there was no statistically significant correlation between low immunogenicity to HBV vaccine and age, sex, type of IBD, comorbidities, and BMI. Conclusions: IBD patients are less immunogenic to HBV vaccination compared to healthy controls. Factors like esomeprazole and/or corticosteroid therapy might be associated with poor immune response. These findings highlight the importance of reassessing the immunogenicity of HBV vaccination and probably other protective vaccinations in all IBD patients as part of their standard of care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5146319b9706bd08df1d7b631f347ab763f40773667adb1bda8520891a08a92a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
