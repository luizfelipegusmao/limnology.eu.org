{"title":"An apple a day: MdBPC2 transcription factor keeps the auxin away and causes dwarfing in Malus domestica","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/493/7469949?rss=1","date":1702339200000,"content":"<span>Managing plant height is imperative to the success of agriculture. Plant height is particularly important for tree crops such as pome fruits (e.g. apples, pears), where harvesting is challenging if the plants are too tall. Farmers manage fruit tree height in part by grafting shoots to dwarf rootstock. While horticultural research has focused on the productivity of trees grafted to dwarf rootstock (<a href=\"#koad309-B2\">Kosina 2010</a>), understanding the molecular underpinning of dwarfing in apples remains understudied. Myriad genes control plant size and development in <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, including those encoding the BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BPC) class of transcription factors (<a href=\"#koad309-B3\">Monfared et al. 2011</a>). However, whether BPCs regulate development in woody plants is an open question. In this issue, <strong>Haiyan Zhao and colleagues</strong> (<a href=\"#koad309-B5\">Zhao et al. 2024</a>) reveal some details of the genetic regulation of dwarfism in apple (<span>Malus domestica</span>) trees. Through genetics, bioinformatics, and biochemical assays, Zhao and colleagues elucidated a key molecular mechanism for plant dwarfism (see <a href=\"#koad309-F1\">Figure</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"beac34b745775364d06363d6a1f5456701bcf5adc58a9117833a667be8276b5f","category":"Environment"}
