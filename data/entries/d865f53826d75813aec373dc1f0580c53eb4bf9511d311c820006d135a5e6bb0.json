{"title":"Assessment of Physicochemical and Sensory Characteristics of Commercial Sparkling Wines Obtained through Ancestral and Traditional Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0486/v1","date":1720162206000,"content":"Sparkling wines elaborated by means Ancestral method, also called PÃ©t-Nats, are nowadays gaining an increasing share of the market. However, the scientific information about these wines is very scarce. For that reason, the aim of this research was to compare the physicochemical composition and sensory attributes of a representative sampling of commercial sparkling wines elaborated by Ancestral and Traditional methods. Ancestral sparkling wines were more heterogenous than Traditional sparkling wines because some of them showed lower internal pressure, higher turbidity, higher colour intensity and less foamability. These differences would be probably because the ancestral elaboration protocol is not so well defined as in the case of Traditional sparkling wines. However, Ancestral method has the advantage of being able to work with riper grapes and with lower doses of sulphur dioxide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d865f53826d75813aec373dc1f0580c53eb4bf9511d311c820006d135a5e6bb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
