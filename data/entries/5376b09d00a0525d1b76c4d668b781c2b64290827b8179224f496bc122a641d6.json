In this paper, we discuss some straightforward steps to simplify the delivery of these principles at the idea stage and adapt some of these examples for conducting fish trials related to health and welfare. Although some of the approaches are well established in other animal science arenas, we believe there can be a timely recap of their key facets. We discuss a number of simple strategies to emphasize how a reduction in fish numbers can be achieved from initial project conception to implementation, highlighting not only their advantages but also their limitations. We also highlight the role that funding agencies can play in the implementation of the 3R principles in aquaculture research. These simple points can be used in frameworks to initiate a broader and dynamic intersectoral dialogue among stakeholders of aquaculture research on how to promote ethics and embrace opportunities for this within the tenets of the 3Rs.</p>","author":"Carlo C.
