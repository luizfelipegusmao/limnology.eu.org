{"title":"Aeromonas Infections in Humans. Antibiotic Resistance and Treatment Options","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0809/v1","date":1720599124000,"content":"The genus Aeromonas is widely distributed in aquatic environments. It is frequent as a fish pathogen, but has also been described associated to human infections. Most human cases are caused by A. caviae, A. veronii biovar sobria, and A. hydrophila, though A. dhakensis is becoming increasingly important. Transmission happens primarily by ingestion or contact with aquatic collections, or by consumption of contaminated food, especially of aquatic origin. Increasing resistance has been described in Aeromonas to penicillins, including their combinations with classical b-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins and carbapenems. Among the b-lactam antibiotics, only the 4th generation cephalosporins remain almost uniformly active. In addition, the simultaneous presence of resistance genes to 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems in the same isolates is increasing. Recently, the presence of mobile genes linked to colistin resistance has also been described, in some cases with resistance percentages higher than 30%. Most likely, this evolution of colistin resistance is linked to its use in aquaculture, and, together with the evolution of b-lactam resistance, may be turning this genus into a reservoir of resistance genes that may affect other species much more frequently linked to human infections, such as Enterobacterales.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f7e7ee16b5a5ef39b92a457ce2231e0f4218d25832816d89048bdc5e045b9b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
