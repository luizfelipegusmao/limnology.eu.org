From a sample of producers from an irrigation survey in Arkansas, a bivariate sample selection model accounts for how peer use of numerous irrigation practices affects the use and the share of irrigation that comes from a water source. The bivariate sample selection model controls for the bias in the statistical estimates that occur because producers who volunteer for an irrigation survey are likely to know about and use irrigation more than the population. We find that peer influence operates through multiple irrigation practices, and peer influence through an irrigation practice depends on an irrigator's location and current farm practices. For example, peer use of a tail-water recovery system and peer use of alternate wetting and drying both increase the probability of surface water use alone.</p>","author":"Kent Kovacs, \nChristopher Henry, \nQiuqiong Huang, \nLarry Jason Krutz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Contemporary Water Research & Education: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b3db72dc581bb02a697df2c99e39cca4549085da8786047d814851ca018c4f9a","entryHash":"e77161134eca7d375eac13665dc6a6fd65dae570de22f6ac83d6f5f885272973","category":"Environment"}
