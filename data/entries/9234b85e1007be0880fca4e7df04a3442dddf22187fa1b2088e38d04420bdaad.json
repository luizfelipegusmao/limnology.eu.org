{"title":"The Use of Faculty Inventor Social Capital to Facilitate University Technology Transfer: A Multiple Case Study Inquiry Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1759/v1","date":1727089352000,"content":"The current practices of the technology transfer profession seem to reflect the belief that the chances for success are greatly improved when faculty inventors employ their social capital to facilitate the process. However, there is a gap in the university technology transfer literature regarding our understanding of faculty inventor social capital in the technology transfer process. The aim of this study was to understand whether the use of faculty inventor social capital is a causal condition for successful university technology transfer. This question was examined using a multiple case study approach and the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method. The results of the study suggest that the use of faculty inventor social capital is not a necessary, sufficient, or INUS condition for the occurrence of university technology transfer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9234b85e1007be0880fca4e7df04a3442dddf22187fa1b2088e38d04420bdaad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
