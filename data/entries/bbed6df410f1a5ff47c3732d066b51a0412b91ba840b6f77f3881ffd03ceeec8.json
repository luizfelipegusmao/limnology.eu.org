{"title":"Optimization of Bending Strength in Hybrid Polyester-Wood Powder (Eusideroxylon zwageri) Composite with Variations in Volume Fraction and Fiber Orientation of Wire Mesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1851/v1","date":1721830258000,"content":"A composite is a material formed from the combination of two or more constituent materials through a non-homogeneous mixture. This research aims to determine the effect of volume fraction and fiber orientation angle of the hybrid polyester-ulin wood powder (Eusideroxylon zwageri)-wire mesh composite on bending strength. The bending test was conducted using ASTM D-790 standard with a three-point bending test method. The composite was made using the hand lay-up method with various compositions of particles and polyester. The results showed that the composition with less ulin wood powder and finer mesh size with a 45Â° wire mesh angle orientation had the highest bending strength and high deformation capability. The addition of wire mesh did not significantly increase the bending strength but could reduce the effect of decreased deformation capability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbed6df410f1a5ff47c3732d066b51a0412b91ba840b6f77f3881ffd03ceeec8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
