{"title":"The Future of Kawasaki Disease Diagnosis: Liquid Biopsy May Hold the Key","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0945/v1","date":1718326068000,"content":"Kawasaki disease is a febrile illness characterised by systemic inflammation of small- and medium-sized blood vessels which commonly occurs in young children. Although self-limiting, there is a risk of developing coronary artery lesions as disease progresses with delay in diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of KD continues to remain a clinical dilemma. Thus, this article not only summarises the key research gaps associated to KD, but also evaluates the possibility of using circulating endothelial injury biomarkers such as, circulating endothelial cells, endothelial microparticles and vascular endothelial cell-free DNA, as diagnostic and prognostic tool of KD: a “liquid biopsy” approach. The challenges of translating liquid biopsies to use in KD, and the opportunities for improvement in its diagnosis and management that such translation may provide are discussed. The use of endothelial damage markers, which are easily obtained via blood collection, as diagnostics is promising and we hope this will be translated to clinical applications in the near future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"917aa1ba23fcae59cd66debd9e9627ba21a5cde81c8a2893a8614a24cbed8459","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
