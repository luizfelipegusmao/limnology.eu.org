{"title":"Before and after closed season for beach seine fishing in Ghana: Impact on benthic macroinvertebrates species diversity indices","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12784?af=R","date":1708274735000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Beach seine fishery provides a means of livelihood to many households in Africa and it is widely practiced in the coastal communities of Ghana due to the relatively cheaper operational cost. However, the small mesh sizes of beach seine nets and fishing activities that involve dragging a net through the nearshore seabed tend to destroy fish breeding grounds and capture juvenile fish and non-target benthic macroinvertebrates, which get discarded. This study investigated the impact that before and after closed season for beach seine fishing had on macroinvertebrates species diversity indices at two Ghanaian beaches with different fishing pressures. The study was carried out at OLA and Sisimbo Beaches located in the Central Region of Ghana, taking advantage of the statutory 1-month national fishing closed season in July 2022. Six (6) replicate sediment samples were taken at each beach after landing by beach seine fishers every month for 6 months, from April to June, and August to October, representing before and after closed season, respectively. Benthic macroinvertebrates were retrieved from the samples using appropriate protocols and subjected to indirect (Shannon, Simpson, Rényi) and direct (species abundance models, species accumulation models, multivariate statistics) measures of species diversity analyses. The indirect species diversity indices increased monotonically the following 2 months after closed season but reduced in the third month after closed season at both beaches. Conversely, the direct measures of diversity indices revealed that closed season for beach seine fishing improved species numbers and richness at both study beaches. This is the first report on the impact of a closed season on macroinvertebrates in any African country.</p>","author":"Margaret Fafa Awushie Akwetey, \nPaul Kojo Mensah, \nGertrude Tibu, \nNaomi Aku Agboli, \nGifty Wiredu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"7ebfde9d5a58f6e4ef7c801d4f71c754d49f61ce457af16d356fec9f485d2865","category":"Environment"}
