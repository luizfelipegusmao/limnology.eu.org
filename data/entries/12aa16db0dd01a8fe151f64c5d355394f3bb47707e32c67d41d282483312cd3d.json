{"title":"Evaluation of Ocean Color Algorithms to Retrieve Chlorophyll-A Concentration in the Mexican Pacific Ocean off the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1809/v1","date":1711702868000,"content":"Mathematical algorithms relate satellite data of ocean color with the surface Chlorophyll–a con-centration (Chl-a), a proxy of phytoplankton biomass. These mathematical tools work best when they are adapted to the unique bio-optical properties of a particular oceanic province. Ocean color algorithms should also consider that there are significant differences between datasets derived from different sensors. Common solutions are to provide different parameters for each sensor or use merged satellite data. In this paper we use satellite data from the Copernicus merged product suite and in situ data from the southernmost part of the California Current System to test two widely used global algorithms, OCx and CI, and a regional algorithm, CalCOFI2. The OCx al-gorithm gave the best result, therefore, it was regionalized and, again, tested. The database was then separated according to (a) dynamic boundaries in the area, (b) bio-optical properties and (c) climatic condition (El Niño/La Niña). Regional algorithms were obtained and tested for each partition. The Chl-a retrievals for each model were tested and compared. The best fit for the data was for the regional algorithms that considered the climatic conditions (El Niño/La Niña). These results will allow the construction of consistent regionally adapted time-series and, therefore, demonstrates the importance of El Niño/La Niña events on the bio-optical properties of the area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12aa16db0dd01a8fe151f64c5d355394f3bb47707e32c67d41d282483312cd3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
