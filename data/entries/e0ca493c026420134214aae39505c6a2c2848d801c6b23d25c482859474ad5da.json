{"title":"Lake Wellington and West Walker River in Great Basin of western United States: History and genesis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3626?af=R","date":1723011794000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Closed basins within the Great Basin of the western United States were home to numerous lakes during the Pleistocene. One of these paleolakes along the western edge of the Great Basin, Lake Wellington, once filled a 10 × 25-km expanse of Smith Valley to depths approaching 90 m. This and other lakes that existed during the Pleistocene are generally considered to be <i>pluvial</i>, indicating contemporaneity with either or all a period of cooler climate, increased rainfall and snowmelt, and relatively reduced rates of evaporation as compared to today. Here we combine the results of <sup>36</sup>Cl terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating with soils and geomorphic observations to suggest Lake Wellington was not a pluvial lake but instead the result of a large landslide prior to ~43 ± 15 ka along the West Walker River where it exited Smith Valley. The observations collected also reveal an ancestral course of the West Walker River ~85 m above the current river grade. Attributing the elevation difference to incision caused by active 0.05 ± 0.01 mm a<sup>−1</sup> uplift of the underlying Singatse and assuming the ancestral course followed the same path as today places the age of the paleoriver course at ~1.7 Ma.</p>","author":"STEVEN G.
