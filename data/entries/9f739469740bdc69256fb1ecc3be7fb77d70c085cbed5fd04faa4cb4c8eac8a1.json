{"title":"Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Validation of a Surgical Neonatal Nursing Workload Tool to the Italian Context: The Italian Winnipeg Surgical Complex Assessment of Neonatal Nursing Needs Tool","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1964/v1","date":1727260761000,"content":"Complexity of care, adequate staffing levels, and workflow are key factors affecting nurses’ workloads. Clinical complexity classification and related staffing adjustment remain notable gaps in the current evidence limiting the capacity for optimal staffing practices. This study aimed to adapt and validate the WANNNT-SC to the Italian context to allow the assessment of newborns admitted to the NICUs. To evaluate the reliability of the tool among different profes-sionals, a correlation test was performed using Pearson’s correlation, which resulted in a strong correlation (r = 0.967, p = 0.01). In the test-retest phase, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.910 and p = 0.01). Using an analysis of variance, we found that the higher the I-WANNNT-SC score, the higher the predicted death rate (F = 13.05 and p &lt; 0.001). The Italian Winnipeg Surgical Complex Assessment of Neonatal Nursing Needs Tool represents the first tool available for the Italian context that aims to measure the nursing workload in neonatal intensive care. It could allow adjustments in nursing staffing based on NICU activities and patient needs. This study was prospectively approved by the local Ethics Committee “Palermo 1” (Protocol CI-NICU-00).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f739469740bdc69256fb1ecc3be7fb77d70c085cbed5fd04faa4cb4c8eac8a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
