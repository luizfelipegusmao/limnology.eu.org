{"title":"Tuberculosis (TB) Tsunami  in Pakistan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0222/v1","date":1717565627000,"content":"Objective: To analyze prevalence of tuberculosis among the people who presented PIMS with complaints of fever, cough, difficulty in breathing during COVID pandemic.Study Design: Retrospective/ Cross-sectional study.Place and Duration: Department of Radiology, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad. 2020-2023. Methods: Total 17121 patients who presented PIMS during COVID pandemic with complaints of high grade fever, cough, difficulty in breathing ,were included in this study. Following the acquisition, the HRCT scans were conducted by a skilled and experienced technician and researcher, utilizing GE Healthcare equipment for HRCT Chest procedures. The scans covered the lung apices to the bases and were executed with maximal inspiration, employing a CT scanner from Toshiba Aquilion. Frequency of TB among all cases was recorded. SPSS 21.0 was used to analyze all data.Results: This study incorporated a total of 17,121 patients, comprising 9,961 (58.1%) males and 7,160 (41.8%) females. The mean age of the enrolled cases was 49.11Â±7.67 years, demonstrating consistency with the findings of a prior study [33].  This study also examined the prevalence of Tuberculosis in different years based on imaging findings of HRCT chest as follows: in 2020, 582 cases out of 2,450, equivalent to 23.7%; in 2021, 2,377 cases out of 9,584, equivalent to 24.8%; in 2022, 1,099 cases out of 3,913, equivalent to 28.1% and in 2023, 295 cases out of 1,174, equivalent to 25.1%. The average prevalence of TB cases from 2020 to 2023 was determined to be 4,353 cases out of 17,121, which is equal to 25.42%.Conclusion: As per the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) in Pakistan, the prevalence rate of tuberculosis stands at 340 cases per 100,000 population, equivalent to 0.34%. However, our study reveals an exceptionally high frequency of TB cases. Specifically, the prevalence of Tuberculosis in 2020 was 23.7% (582 out of 2,450), in 2021 it was 24.8% (2,377 out of 9,584), in 2022 it surged to 28.1% (1,099 out of 3,913), and in 2023 it was 25.1% (295 out of 1,174). The average prevalence of TB cases over the period from 2020 to 2023 was calculated at 25.4% (4,353 out of 17,121). Consequently, our findings suggest the presence of a substantial tuberculosis burden in Pakistan, equating to a TB Tsunami in Pakistan.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcc87d5cffdead1321ee5af353691871d5b1f0fa6f32d823f50724fe714d1fc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
