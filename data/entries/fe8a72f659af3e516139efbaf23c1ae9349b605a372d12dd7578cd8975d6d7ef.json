{"title":"Comparison of the HBSC Results of the Visegrad Countries with the Health Behavior of Young People with Disabilities Living in Hungary: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0958/v1","date":1710749406000,"content":"The health status of Hungary's population is unfavorable, with significant differences in health indicators not only compared to the EU15 but also to the Visegrad countries. Unfavorable health indicators can be disproportionate and particularly affect vulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities. The aim of the present study is to compare the health behaviour and indicators of adolescents with disabilities in Hungary with those of the HBSC survey in the Visegrad countries, and to compare the results of the Hungarian special needs adolescent population with those of the Visegrad countries. Eating habits are unfavourable for both the Visegrad countries and the young people we studied. Children with disabilities have significantly higher rates of schoolwork stress compared to other countries. Significantly higher prevalence of somatic complaints and worse mental well-being parameters higher in Hungary than in the other Visegrad countries. The results suggest that further interventions are needed in Hungary and that differentiated, professionalised health promotion is needed for young people with disabilities. The researchers propose to extend the research to adolescents with disabilities living in the Visegrad countries, on the basis of which a methodology for injury-specific health promotion could be developed, including through interna-tional interprofessional cooperation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe8a72f659af3e516139efbaf23c1ae9349b605a372d12dd7578cd8975d6d7ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
