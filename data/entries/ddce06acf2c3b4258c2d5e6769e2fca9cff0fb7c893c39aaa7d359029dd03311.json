The real-world implementation of such solutions would ideally be evidence-based, allowing decision makers to evaluate their ecological consequences before implementation. Mechanistic and process-based ecological models enable predictions of emergent biodiversity responses to novel environments, but current approaches are designed for specific scales. Cross-scale ecological models, that predict emergent co-occurring biodiversity patterns at interacting scales, are a critical next step. A way forward is to capitalise on existing scale-specific models to reveal mechanism to process transitions across scales, uniting disparate fields of ecology in the future.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Restoring biodiversity-based resilience and ecosystem multi-functionality needs to be informed by more accurate predictions of animal biodiversity responses to environmental change. Ecological models make a substantial contribution to this understanding, especially when they encode the biological mechanisms and processes that give rise to emergent patterns (population, community, ecosystem properties and dynamics). Here, a distinction between ‘mechanistic’ and ‘process-based’ ecological models is established to review existing approaches. Mechanistic and process-based ecological models have made key advances to understanding the structure, function and dynamics of animal biodiversity, but are typically designed to account for specific levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales. Cross-scale ecological models, which predict emergent co-occurring biodiversity patterns at interacting scales of space, time and biological organisation, is a critical next step in predictive ecology. A way forward is to first capitalise on existing models to systematically evaluate the ability of scale-explicit mechanisms and processes to predict emergent patterns at alternative scales. Such model intercomparisons will reveal mechanism to process transitions across fine to broad scales, overcome approach-specific barriers to model realism or tractability and identify gaps which necessitate the development of new fundamental principles. Key challenges surrounding model complexity and uncertainty would need to be addressed, and while opportunities from big data can streamline the integration of multiple scale-explicit biodiversity patterns, ambitious cross-scale field studies are also needed. Crucially, overcoming cross-scale ecological modelling challenges would unite disparate fields of ecology with the common goal of improving the evidence-base to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems under novel environmental change.</p>","author":"Alice S.
