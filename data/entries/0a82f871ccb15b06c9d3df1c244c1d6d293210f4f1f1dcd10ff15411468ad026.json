{"title":"Keep it cool: Unveiling the involvement of maize HEAT SHOCK FACTORS and CELLULOSE SYNTHASES in heat stress regulation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2463/7649225?rss=1","date":1713312000000,"content":"<span>With increasing threats of global warming, it is important to understand how heat is perceived and signalled inside the cells to activate mechanisms that protect plants from heat stress. It is known that a transcriptional cascade exists involving Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) to regulate the transcription of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes, which in turn regulate heat stress responses. In this issue, <strong>Ze Li, Zerui Li, Yulong Ji, and colleagues (<a href=\"#koae122-B1\">Li et al. 2024</a>)</strong> provide a thorough analysis of how HSFs regulate heat stress responses in maize.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"0a82f871ccb15b06c9d3df1c244c1d6d293210f4f1f1dcd10ff15411468ad026","category":"Environment"}
