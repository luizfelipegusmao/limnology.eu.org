{"title":"Morel&ndash;Lavall&eacute;e Lesion Treated with Single-Use Portable Negative Pressure Wound Therapy: A Case Report and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1243/v1","date":1718702382000,"content":"Background: A Morel–Lavallée lesion (MLL) is a traumatic, internal closed degloving injury that results from shearing of subcutaneous tissue away from underlying fascia, usually associated with high-velocity trauma. Case presentation: A 52-year-old man was transported to hospital for further follow-up of a superficial femoral artery injury. Examination on admission showed bruising seen around the left thigh. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the left thigh revealed hematoma with extravasation from a branch of the left superficial femoral artery, but no apparent aneurysms or femoral fractures. The patient was treated with compression bandages and discharged on hospital day 6. He left hospital able to walk unaided. He subsequently complained of left thigh pain with swelling and visited the hospital several times. He was treated at another outpatient clinic and was diagnosed with MLL. Single-use disposable portable negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was applied for about 2 months, achieving a stable wound site. Conclusion: We encountered a case of MLL successfully treated with single-use portable NPWT. This report presents the case of a patient with isolated MLL without fracture in the left thigh, in which the diagnosis was missed on initial admission. Finally, the patient received minor interventions including drainage along with tissue debridement and portable NPWT. We reviewed the relevant literature and summarize the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment strategies for MLL. Emergency physicians require an increased understanding of MLL to avoid misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5bf5f300fdf433a94a7fb78b1c78070480dab3da705f1d601b81f23e7f303aed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
