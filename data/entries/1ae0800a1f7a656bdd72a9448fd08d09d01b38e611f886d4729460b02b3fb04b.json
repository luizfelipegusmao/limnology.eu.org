{"title":"Multiomic analyses reveal key sectors of jasmonate-mediated defense responses in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3362/7683255?rss=1","date":1716768000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The phytohormone jasmonate (JA) plays a central role in plant defenses against biotic stressors. However, our knowledge of the JA signaling pathway in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) remains incomplete. Here, we integrated multiomic data from three tissues to characterize the functional modules involved in organizing JA-responsive genes. In the core regulatory sector, MYC2 transcription factor transcriptional cascades are conserved in different species but with distinct regulators (e.g. bHLH6 in rice), in which genes are early expressed across all tissues. In the feedback sector, MYC2 also regulates the expression of JA repressor and catabolic genes, providing negative feedback that truncates the duration of JA responses. For example, the MYC2-regulated NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factor genes <span>NAC1</span>, <span>NAC3</span>, and <span>NAC4</span> encode proteins that repress JA signaling and herbivore resistance. In the tissue-specific sector, many late-expressed genes are associated with the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites that mediate particular defensive functions. For example, the terpene synthase gene <span>TPS35</span> is specifically induced in the leaf sheath and TPS35 functions in defense against oviposition by brown planthoppers and the attraction of this herbivore's natural enemies. Thus, by characterizing core, tissue-specific, and feedback sectors of JA-elicited defense responses, this work provides a valuable resource for future discoveries of key JA components in this important crop.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"1ae0800a1f7a656bdd72a9448fd08d09d01b38e611f886d4729460b02b3fb04b","category":"Environment"}
