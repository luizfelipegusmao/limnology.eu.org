Numerous alloys have been developed, each with specific thermal treatment protocols [<a href=\"#ozae044.615-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.615-B4\">4</a>]. Among these alloys, AA2024 stands out for its extensive use across various industries, such as automotive and aerospace, attributed to its exceptional resistance to stress-corrosion cracking [<a href=\"#ozae044.615-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.615-B6\">6</a>]. Precipitation-hardened alloys, including those in the 2xxx, 6xxx, and 7xxx series, require precise control over the precipitation process to ensure the creation of high-performance alloys [<a href=\"#ozae044.615-B7\">7</a>]. The strengthening primary precipitate in the 2xxx series is θ´ (Al<sub>2</sub>Cu) phase. At elevated temperatures, this precipitate undergoes coarsening, which is swiftly succeeded by a phase transformation to the stable θ phase. This transformation leads to a reduction in strength due to the coarsening of the newly formed phase. This process occurs rapidly at temperatures exceeding 250°C [<a href=\"#ozae044.615-B8\">8</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2434b985bf4eed9ef07cdfd37dde68bc0ac18f3a2f242b95c974d1ba11b28fd1","category":"Environment"}
