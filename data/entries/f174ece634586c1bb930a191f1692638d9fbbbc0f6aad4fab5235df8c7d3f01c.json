{"title":"Multi‐Biomarkers' Responses in Gills of Oreochromis niloticus Exposed to Glyphosate and Polyethylene Microplastic, Isolated and in Mixture","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24386?af=R","date":1721910600000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Microplastics (MPs) and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are among the most common contaminants in aquatic environments. In Brazilian rivers, both contaminants were found in elevated levels, leading to a high probability of their association, which can alter their individual effects and potentially intensify their toxicity. This study evaluated the isolated and combined effects of polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) and GBH on <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> using multi-biomarkers of toxicity. The fish were subjected to a 96-h exposure period, with concentrations set based either isolated, PE-MPs group (5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>), GBH group (5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>), or in a group of associated contaminants (GAC), PE-MP + GBH (5 mg L<sup>−1</sup> + 5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>). Toxicity effects were evaluated using biochemical, cytogenetic, hematological, and histopathological biomarkers. We observed change in erythrocyte parameters leading to macrocytic normochromic anemia in GAC. Leukocyte parameters indicate a nonspecific immunosuppression caused by the exposure of associated contaminants, besides the attempts to repair damage caused by PE-MPs. Histopathological markers indicate damage to tissues exposed to contaminants. Besides, there were morphophysiological adjustments on gills, with proliferation and hypertrophy of mitochondria-rich cells on GBH and GAC, besides epithelium ruptures, which were mostly present in the exposed groups. Therefore, this study indicates that PE-MPs and GBHs present toxic effects in <i>O. niloticus</i> with the used concentrations, intensified by the association of contaminants. Thus, multi-biomarkers were useful key to verify toxicity, providing data to the investigation of high levels of contaminant's mixture toxicity present in aquatic environments.</p>","author":"Marco Aurélio Miranda Soares, \nEricsson Rubens Rodrigues Ferreira, \nDriele Tavares, \nSandro Estevan Moron, \nMarisa Narciso Fernandes, \nWagner dos Santos Mariano, \nMarcelo Gustavo Paulino","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"f174ece634586c1bb930a191f1692638d9fbbbc0f6aad4fab5235df8c7d3f01c","category":"Environment"}
