{"title":"Evolution of Dew and Rain Water Resources in Gujarat (India) between 2005 and 2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1593/v1","date":1719221793000,"content":"Global warming leads in general to a reduction in precipitations and non-rainfall water contributions such as dew. The present study, carried out in Gujarat (India) for 17 years between 2005 and 2021, shows however a rare increase of the rain falls and dew condensation, the latter related to an increase in relative humidity and a decrease in wind amplitudes. Rain was obtained from meteo stations. Dew was calculated from an energy model and meteo data from 15 meteo stations (14 in India and 1 in Pakistan) and compared to early and dedicated measurements in 13 sites. Maps of dew, rain and their relative contributions during the period are provided. They show that, while rain mainly occurs during the monsoon (June to September), dew forms during the dry season (October to April). This water resource was mapped over the Gujarat state of India by using a kriging process. According to the site, the dew/rain ratios can represent between 4.6% (Ahmedabad) to 37.2% (Jamnagar) on the whole period of 17 years. This positive evolution, which is observed since 2015-2017, is likely to continue in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d62cfbe8f629cdc8dffe2ee900608acef1fdfb395bae0411c4af0b39756ac2d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
