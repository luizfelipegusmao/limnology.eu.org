{"title":"Structural Analysis and Experimental Tests of a Morphing Flap Scaled Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0256/v1","date":1722848986000,"content":"The implementation of morphing wing mechanisms holds promise in enhancing aircraft perfor-mance, as indicated in current literature. The Clean Sky 2 AirGreen 2 European project is currently conducting ground and wind tunnel tests to validate innovative studies on morphing wing structures. The project aims to showcase the effectiveness of these morphing architectures on a potentially flying demonstrator at true scale. This article describes design methodology and struc-tural testing of a scaled morphing flap structure capable of 3 different morphing modes required for low-speed (take-off/landing) and high-speed (cruise) conditions. A significant scale factor of 1:3 was selected to enhance the importance and relevance of the wind tunnel test campaign. Geometrical scaling to the real flap prototype was deemed impractical due to limitations associated with scaling the embedded mechanisms and actuators responsible for shape changing. Static analyses were performed using the finite element method to address the most critical loads determined through three-dimensional CFD analysis. The Finite Element (FE) analysis results were briefly outlined, and comparisons were drawn between the obtained results and the empirical data collected during the structural test. Good correlations were observed between the results and numerical predictions, encompassing static deflections under applied loads and elastic deformations. Consequently, the modeling approaches utilized during the design and testing phases were considered highly suc-cessful. Therefore, based on the results extrapolated from simulations under ultimate load condi-tions relevant to the wind tunnel test campaign, the scaled flap prototype was deemed suitable for testing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d840bdb8f365b05956437007aff761641de993bdac06cb38d1146ae7e6b18632","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
