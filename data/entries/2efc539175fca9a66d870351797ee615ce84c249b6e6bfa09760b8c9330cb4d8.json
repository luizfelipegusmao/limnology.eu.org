{"title":"Study on the Air Conditioning Comfort Virtual Calibration Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1084/v1","date":1715872496000,"content":"In the early stage of new vehicle development, the requirements of maximum performance of the air conditioning (AC) system are obtained through Amesim software simulation, but the calibration control of the AC system is usually carried out in the prototype-build vehicle test stage, and the test time is spanned up to 10 months after spring (autumn), summer and winter, of which up to 2 months are for environment chamber tests. Due to the long calibration cycle of AC control in the road test, which seriously affects the vehicle launch time, virtual calibration technology of air conditioning system is developed to shorten the calibration cycle of AC systems and ensure the quality of vehicles.  In the project development stage, the calibration control of the vehicle AC system can be realized to carry out the functional test of the AC system in advance. In that, the grade of maturity for the AC system control can be improved, the on-road calibration test cycle can be shortened, and the development cost can be saved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2efc539175fca9a66d870351797ee615ce84c249b6e6bfa09760b8c9330cb4d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
