{"title":"Automatic Double Check Monitoring of Continuous Fluid Excretion and Urine Output","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0618/v1","date":1715340230000,"content":"Background: \nNowadays vital signs in clinics are electronically monitored excepted for urine output which still requires, manual recording, which is subject to human errors. We, in-vitro, assessed in this study the ability a novel electronic device to measure by a combination of two different methods, the real time flow-output, like urine output.\nMethods:\nFlow or urine output was measured by a combination technique of gravimetry using a dynamometer and capacitive sensing to improve precision. Data were obtained in 3 different situations, low, medium, and high flow.\nResults:\nThree different situations were tested: full or empty dead space and Pasteurâ€™s chamber. The differences between the injected and measured volume varies from 0 to 5 ml representing a maximal error of 3 % regardless of the volume injected and the flow in ml/hour. The capacitive sensors behave as expected with a parallel curve of the expected and measured flow.\nConclusion:\nWe have shown in this in-vitro study that the combination of gravimetry and capacitive sensors analysis allow accurate measurement of volume and flow-output. Clinical trials should be conducted to confirm its usefulness in urine output measurement in the real life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8bcbde4b4688451ea2f3629a711325cca927ce2a031d0c5f5ceda2dda1586ebf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
