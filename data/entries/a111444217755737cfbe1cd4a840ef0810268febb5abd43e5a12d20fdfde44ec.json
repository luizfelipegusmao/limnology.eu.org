{"title":"The Integration of Bio-Active Elements into Building Facades as a Sustainable Concept","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1448/v1","date":1724150304000,"content":"Global warming and climate change have been the major concern for multiple disciplines. Population growth, urbanization, and industrialization are major contributing factors to such a problem by escalating the use of fossil fuels to meet their energy demands. The building sector has the largest share in using the total globally produced energy and emitting tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Emerging eco-friendly technologies such as solar and wind energy harvesting are being extensively explored but still, they are insufficient. Nature-inspired technologies can be the solution to our problem. For instance, algae are microorganisms that use water, light, and CO2 to produce energy and sustain life. Exploiting such characteristics in the built environment is termed algae building technology, a very efficient and green application for a sustainable future. Algae-integrated fa√ßades show great versatility through biomass and energy production, wastewater treatment, shading, and thermal and acoustic insulation. In this paper, algae will be introduced as a robust tool toward a greener and more sustainable future, The algae-building technology and its implementation will be demonstrated. Steps for applying this sustainable approach in Egypt will be discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a111444217755737cfbe1cd4a840ef0810268febb5abd43e5a12d20fdfde44ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
