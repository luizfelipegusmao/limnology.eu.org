{"title":"Impact of Copolymer Architecture on Demicellization and Cargo Release via Head-to-Tail Depolymerization of Hydrophobic Moieties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1191/v1","date":1710933494000,"content":"Motivated by experimental success in designing linear amphiphilic copolymers with selective demicellization capabilities through head-to-tail depolymerization triggered by specific stimuli, we advanced the design paradigm by increasing the number of triggering groups on the copolymer chain through architectural modifications. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we explored the demicellization and cargo release dynamics of linear and miktoarm copolymers, featuring one, two and three hydrophobic block or branches, each capable for head-to-tail depolymerization. Our findings revealed that, under stoichiometric trigger molecule concentrations, miktoarms with three branches exhibited consistently faster depolymerization rates than those with two branches and linear copolymers. Conversely, at constant trigger molecule concentrations, the depolymerization rates of copolymers exhibited more complex behavior influenced by two opposing factors: the excess of trigger molecules, which increased with a decrease in the number of hydrophobic branches or blocks, and simultaneous head-to-tail depolymerization, which intensified with an increasing number of branches. Our study elucidates the intricate interplay between copolymer architecture, trigger molecule concentrations, and depolymerization dynamics, providing valuable insights for the rational design of amphiphilic copolymers with tunable demicellization and cargo release properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7317072846f0d10de4af172a9bf770855459260b42a18ab0065d401555c9214","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
