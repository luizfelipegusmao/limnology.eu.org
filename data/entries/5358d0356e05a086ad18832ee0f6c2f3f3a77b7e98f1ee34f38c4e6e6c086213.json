{"title":"Proteasome inhibition triggers tissue-specific immune responses against different pathogens in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002543","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Manish Grover, Spencer S. Gang, Emily R. Troemel, Michalis Barkoulas</p>\r\n\r\nProtein quality control pathways play important roles in resistance against pathogen infection. For example, the conserved transcription factor SKN-1/NRF up-regulates proteostasis capacity after blockade of the proteasome and also promotes resistance against bacterial infection in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. SKN-1/NRF has 3 isoforms, and the SKN-1A/NRF1 isoform, in particular, regulates proteasomal gene expression upon proteasome dysfunction as part of a conserved bounce-back response. We report here that, in contrast to the previously reported role of SKN-1 in promoting resistance against bacterial infection, loss-of-function mutants in <i>skn-1a</i> and its activating enzymes <i>ddi-1</i> and <i>png-1</i> show constitutive expression of immune response programs against natural eukaryotic pathogens of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. These programs are the oomycete recognition response (ORR), which promotes resistance against oomycetes that infect through the epidermis, and the intracellular pathogen response (IPR), which promotes resistance against intestine-infecting microsporidia. Consequently, <i>skn-1a</i> mutants show increased resistance to both oomycete and microsporidia infections. We also report that almost all ORR/IPR genes induced in common between these programs are regulated by the proteasome and interestingly, specific ORR/IPR genes can be induced in distinct tissues depending on the exact trigger. Furthermore, we show that increasing proteasome function significantly reduces oomycete-mediated induction of multiple ORR markers. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that proteasome regulation keeps innate immune responses in check in a tissue-specific manner against natural eukaryotic pathogens of the <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> epidermis and intestine.","author":"Manish Grover","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"5358d0356e05a086ad18832ee0f6c2f3f3a77b7e98f1ee34f38c4e6e6c086213","category":"Environment"}
