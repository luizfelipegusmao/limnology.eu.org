{"title":"Monitoring Earthquake Risks in Nador, Northeast Morocco","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1121/v1","date":1718606368000,"content":"Earthquake events present a high risk in urban areas. Nador City is a Mediterranean city located in a dynamic zone with seismologic movement and a frequency of earthquake events per year. This worrying rate shows that earthquake risks can hinder the urban area and damage citizens and goods if urban risk management is not taken. This study defines the areas most threatened by seismic events to protect them as a priority. Using Geographic Information System, Corine Land Cover, seismic intensity, and socioeconomic vulnerability index, we mapped the urban vulnerability index. The adopted model determines urban vulnerability levels from urban land cover, topography, geologic factors, and geomorphologic factors. These approaches reveal that $70\\%$ of Nador is under the damage of a seismic disaster. In addition, the main objective is to apply a new set of guidelines to map the intensity of risks and explain the distinct risk exposure level in Nadorâ€™s urban context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a527049f599414a89a894361a2d7d8ae4982891eea7c98fea0da66bdfc18c130","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
