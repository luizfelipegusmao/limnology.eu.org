{"title":"Comparison of Ultra-High Pressure Cold Brew Coffee with Conventional Cold Brew Coffee at Different Roasting Degrees: Physicochemical Characteristics, Non-Volatile Compositions and Volatile Compositions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0851/v1","date":1726043274000,"content":"Previous research has indicated that ultra-high pressure (UHP) technology is useful in speeding up the extraction process of cold brew (CB) coffee. However, the impact of different degrees of roasting on UHP CB coffee is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of three different degrees of roasting (light, medium, and dark) on the physicochemical and flavor characteristics of UHP CB coffee. The results of this study showed that most physicochemical characteristics of UHP coffee were similar to those of conventional CB coffee, regardless of the degree of roasting. However, the majority of physicochemical characteristics, non-volatile components, and sensory evaluation significantly increased with an increase in roasting degree. The HS-SPME-GC/MS analysis showed that most volatile components, such as pyrazines, furans (except furfural), esters, pyrrole, pyridine, and most aldehydes, increased from light to dark roasting, and this was significantly evident in CB coffee compared with UHP. The content of volatile components in UHP coffee was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than that in CB coffee at the same degree of roasting, especially with dark roasting. The combination of orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the distance between coffee samples at different degrees of roasting under CB coffee was greater than that under UHP coffee. However, the distance between these two extraction methods at medium roasting was evidently closer than that at light and dark roasting. Moreover, 15 representative differential compounds, such as were Hazelnut pyrazine, linalool, butane-2,3-dione, 3- methylbutanal found by the calculation of odor-active values (OAVs) indicating the main contributing compounds to odor. Overall, the effect of roasting degrees on UHP coffee was less than that on CB coffee, which was consistent with the results of physicochemical characteristics, volatile components, and sensory evaluation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9f9c5e4dde390266564104f637383b14a28b64b090f0a98a02b1bfd7fb832c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
