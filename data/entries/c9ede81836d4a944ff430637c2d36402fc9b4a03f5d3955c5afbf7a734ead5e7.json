{"title":"A Math Digital Game and Multiple-Try Use in Primary Students: A Gender Analysis on Motivation and Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1186/v1","date":1713440646000,"content":"Gender has been a rarely addressed aspect in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Likewise, mixed results have been presented regarding the effects according to gender and the conditions that generate these effects. The present work studies the effects of a drill-and-practice mathe-matical game on primary students. The study focused on an analysis by gender, measuring learning performance, and motivation in the practice activity. Also, two instructional mechanics were considered regarding the question answering, a multiple-try (MTF) and a single-try (STF) condition, to search for possible differences. A total of 81 students from 4 courses and 2 schools participated in the experiment. The study's main findings were that: (a) the girls outperformed boys in terms of students' learning gains, (b) girls presented lower levels of competence and autonomy than boys, (c) in the MTF, girls presented lower levels of autonomy but no differences in competence contrasted to boys, (d) in the STF, girls presented lower levels of competence but no differences in autonomy against boys, and (e) no differences existed in interest, effort and value among gender overall o per instructional condition. This study enhances the knowledge of gender differences under diverse instructional settings, in particular providing insights into possible differences by gender when varying the number of attempts provided to students.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c9ede81836d4a944ff430637c2d36402fc9b4a03f5d3955c5afbf7a734ead5e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
