{"title":"Cyber Edge: Current State of Cyber Security in Aotearoa-New Zealand, Opportunities, and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2174/v1","date":1727414018000,"content":"As Aotearoa-New Zealand faces increasing cyber threats, this paper comprehensively analyses the nation’s current cybersecurity landscape, revealing novel opportunities and challenges. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the study integrates social, cultural, and technological dimensions—providing a fresh perspective that has been underexplored in previous research. A key focus is integrating cultural values, particularly those of the indigenous Māori, into cybersecurity practices. This not only strengthens the effectiveness and trustworthiness of security measures but also fosters a more inclusive and resilient digital environment, demonstrating our deep respect for the unique contributions of Māori culture. Additionally, this paper introduces critical insights into the country's cybersecurity talent gap, with a special focus on the challenges of developing and retaining cybersecurity expertise in remote regions. Our study also uncovers underexplored opportunities for cross-sector collaboration between private enterprises, government agencies, and indigenous communities, promoting an inclusive and resilient approach to cybersecurity. By positioning Aotearoa-New Zealand as a potential leader in regional cybersecurity innovation, we provide forward-looking recommendations that leverage its distinctive cultural and technological strengths. This research contributes fresh insights to the global discourse on cybersecurity, offering practical strategies tailored to the specific needs of smaller nations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e99989c8172e9a0f3be61464009904170370bdb66a1ed722993946dd76578c3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
