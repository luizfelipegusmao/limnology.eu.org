{"title":"Herbicide Uptake (Flashback) in Non-target Hardwood Species Within South Carolina Floodplains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0372/v1","date":1717745033000,"content":"Abstract: Herbicide flashback is an undesirable response that results in damage or mortality of non-target plants near chemically treated plants. In severe instances, crop trees can be injured resulting in financial loss or inability to capture management objectives. Land managers need to know the potential limitations of using triclopyr acid (50% solution in water) and what quantity can cause damage to non-target trees (trees not aimed to control via herbicide). Three naturally regenerated (previous clearcut) bottomland hardwood sites, ranging from 14–20 years of age, received partial overstory deadening using Trycera® herbicide. Residual “leave” trees experienced indirect herbicide uptake resulting in some trees either experiencing mortality or partial mortality with top die-back/epicormic branching. An increased probability of damage occurred as tree diameter decreased and the number of treated stems around non-target stems increased. American sycamore, green ash, and sweetgum were most susceptible to flashback. This study examines the unanticipated chemical effect of deadening adjacent stems surrounding residual leave trees in poorly drained soils.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75c51b307c9606ad6aa6cfce4dc1f2635cb6c2763284a14ee7cbef2b0a05f9ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
