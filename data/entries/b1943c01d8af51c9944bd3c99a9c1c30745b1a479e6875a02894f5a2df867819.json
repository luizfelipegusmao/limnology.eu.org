{"title":"Role of Bioceramics for Bone Regeneration; History, Mechanisms and Future Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0387/v1","date":1712238462000,"content":"Osteoporosis is a bone condition where bones become weaker, leading to fractures, especially in older adults and postmenopausal women. Bioceramics for bone regeneration have indeed emerged as a promising solution for conditions like osteoporosis. Choosing the right bioceramic depends on how quickly it dissolves, how strong it is, and whether the body will react to it. Studies show that bioceramics can help bones grow back by activating (bone morphogenetic protein) BMP, (mitogen-activated protein kinase) MAPK, and Wingless/integrated (Wnt)/Î²-catenin pathways in the body when combined with stem cells, drugs, and supports. However, bioceramics have some problems like not being flexible enough and being prone to breaking, as well as difficulties in growing stem cells and finding the right supports for different bone types. While there has been progress in improving bioceramics for bone healing, we need to keep looking for new ideas from other areas of medicine to keep improving them. This review aims to add to the expanding field of scientific research by offering a detailed look at how bioceramics and growth factors contribute to bone regeneration. Ultimately, this knowledge will help in creating new types of bioceramics that can improve bone regrowth, providing new treatment options for people with bone diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1943c01d8af51c9944bd3c99a9c1c30745b1a479e6875a02894f5a2df867819","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
