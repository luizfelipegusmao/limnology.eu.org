{"title":"Wearable Light Loggers in Field Conditions: Corneal Light Characteristics, User Compliance and Acceptance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1285/v1","date":1726627354000,"content":"Understanding user challenges with light dosimeters is crucial for designing more acceptable devices and advancing light exposure research. We systematically evaluated the usability and acceptability of the lido (light dosimeter) by 29 participants who wore the dosimeter near the corneal plane of the eye for 5 days. Common reasons for not wearing the dosimeter included exercise, recharging, wet environments, public settings, and discomfort. Despite these issues, participants adhered to using the dosimeter, with high compliance (89% of recording time). Our findings reveal a significant discrepancy between mean melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance (300 lxmEDI) and median values (51 lxmEDI). This discrepancy indicates that, for most of the time, participants experienced significantly lower light levels. Specifically, participants were exposed to light levels above 250 lxmEDI for only 14% of their wearing time. This highlights the need for increased exposure to recommended light levels. In the evening, participants' light exposure was below the recommended 10 lxmEDI for 58% of the wear time, which is in line with the guidelines for reducing light exposure before sleep. This study highlights the critical need for strategies to enhance daily light exposure, aligning better with circadian health recommendations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2be20f35042f423066a53bef82cc834d24f303ddfc4c2544d4a1dcc023a7d16e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
