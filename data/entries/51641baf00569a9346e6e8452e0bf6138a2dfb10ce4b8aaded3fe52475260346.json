{"title":"General Dynamics and Generation Mapping for Collatz-type Sequences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2050/v3","date":1725038529000,"content":"Let an odd integer $\\mathcal{X}$ be expressed as $\\sum \\limits_{M &gt; m} 2^M + 2^m - 1$, where $2^m - 1$ is called the Governor. The general dynamics of the Collatz-type functions is such that a high index Governor is converted to $2^1 - 1$. For the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, the Governor occurring in the trivial cycle is $2^1 - 1$, while for the $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, the Trivial Governors are $2^2 - 1$ and $2^1 - 1$. Therefore, for the specific cases of $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ and $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequences, it can be said that the Collatz function reduces $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\sum \\limits_{N &gt; \\mathcal{T}} 2^N + 2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1$, where $2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1$ is referred to as the Trivial Governor. Further, once the Trivial Governor is reached, it can again evolve to a higher index Governor by interacting with other terms. This feature allows the $\\mathcal{X}$ to reappear in a Collatz-type sequence if its original Governor is expressible as a sum of series including the Trivial Governor, that is, $2^m - 1 = \\cdots + 2^{\\mathcal{T} + 1} + 2^{\\mathcal{T}} + 2^{\\mathcal{T}} - 1$. Therefore, if $\\mathcal{X}$ reappears in the sequence, at least one odd ancestor of $\\mathcal{X}$ in the sum of series format must have the Governor $2^m - 1$. Ancestor mapping shows that all the odd ancestors of $\\mathcal{X}$ have the Trivial Governor of the respective Collatz sequence implying that $\\mathcal{X}$ can repeat only if its original Governor is the Trivial Governor. Specifically for the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence, the odd ancestors are separated by two even integers. Successor mapping for the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ further indicates that there are no auxiliary cycles, as the Trivial Governor is transformed to a different index Governor. Similarly, successor mapping for the $5\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence reveals that the smallest odd integers that form an auxiliary cycle are smaller than $2^5$.  Finally, attempts to construct integers that diverge for the $3\\mathcal{Z} + 1$ sequence suggest that no such integers exist.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51641baf00569a9346e6e8452e0bf6138a2dfb10ce4b8aaded3fe52475260346","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
