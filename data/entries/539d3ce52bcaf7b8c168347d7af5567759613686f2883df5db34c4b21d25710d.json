{"title":"Effective attenuation of Paraquat induced oxidative stress and Genotoxicity in testicular germ cells by vitamin E in Caprines","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae153/7769727?rss=1","date":1727136000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Toxicological empirical research suggests that excessive utilization of paraquat, an herbicide, shows detrimental consequences on mammalian reproductive toxicity. The current study aims to study it as a reproductive toxin on the caprine testicular cells at 4- and 6-hour exposure duration. Paraquat treatment decreased the cell viability percentage and induced histological architectural alterations such as disruption of germinal epithelium, vacuolization, and pyknotic nuclei in the testis. The differential EB/AO staining also revealed an increased incidence of apoptosis after paraquat treatment at both dosages, i.e. 10 mM and 100 mM. Paraquat also induces oxidative stress, as evident via increased Malondialdehyde levels (a byproduct of lipid peroxidation) and a decline in the antioxidant capacity (FRAP). However, co-administration of Vitamin E significantly reduced the paraquat-mediated decline in cell viability percentage, histological alterations, and apoptosis incidences and generated oxidative stress, indicating its antioxidative properties against paraquat exposure. This research concludes that Vitamin E co-administration considerably reduced the toxicity of paraquat elicited in testicles, suggesting that Vitamin E may have advantageous potential in preventing the male gonadotoxicity caused by paraquat use in agriculture.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"539d3ce52bcaf7b8c168347d7af5567759613686f2883df5db34c4b21d25710d","category":"Environment"}
