Questionnaire surveys were circulated and demographic characteristics were collected, including participants’ fall experience and health status data over the past year, in order to assess the incidence of falls among the elderly population. This design allows for the collection of data at a single point in time, aiming to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of falls among the target population.\nResults: A total of 189 participants were recruited to the study, and the data indicated that the prevalence of falls among those aged 65 years and older in the past year was 41.5%. We found that 73% of the participants had experienced falls and post-fall injuries within the past 12 months. There were minimal differences in terms of physical handicapped cases found between those with and without a fall history. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant link between fall experience and maximum bite force. \nConclusion: There is a high prevalence of falls in the elderly population in the Madinah region. Our study reveals that 50.79% of our elderly participants had experienced more than one fall during the preceding year. Some preventable risk factors were identified in an analysis of their daily routines. The impacts of these risk factors have potential consequences for their healthy lives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63b0e12b3f2b1db6335d5cc1419be9994044985b34a8455a5f8931b4b9ceb1a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
