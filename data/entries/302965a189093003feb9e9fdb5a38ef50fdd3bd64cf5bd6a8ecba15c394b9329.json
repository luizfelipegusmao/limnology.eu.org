As a result, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with MASLD is also on the rise. Notably, hepatocellular carcinoma in this group does not always develop alongside liver cirrhosis, often leading to a more advanced stage at diagnosis. The challenge lies in accurately identifying patients who are at a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma to tailor screening processes effectively.
