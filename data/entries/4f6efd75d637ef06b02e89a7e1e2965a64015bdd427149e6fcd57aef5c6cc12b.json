{"title":"Enhancing Ice Nucleation: The Role of Surface Roughness in Electrofreezing Using Laser Shock Processed Al6061 T6 Electrodes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1707/v1","date":1724394359000,"content":"The present study investigates the impact of electrode surface roughness on the electrofreezing of water. This research focuses on how the electrode roughness induced by a laser treatment affects the nucleation and growth of ice crystals under controlled electric fields. To achieve this, a series of experiments were conducted using deionized water samples  placed between electrodes with varying surface roughness. The electrodes, fabricated with the Al6061 T6 alloy were structured via the Laser Shock Processing (LSP) method. For this purpose, the pulsed densities during the LSP process were varied from 900 to 2500 pulses/cm2. The increase of the pulse density was correlated to the surface structuring and to the microstructural features and average roughness of the LSP-treated Al6061 alloy. A wavy-like microstructure was induced upon the LSP treatment with average roughnesses between ~ 3.5 and 6 Âµm at the selected pulse densities. The results indicate that electrode roughness significantly influences the electrofreezing process. Rougher electrodes were found to lower the nucleation temperature compared to smoother ones, suggesting enhanced ice nucleation activity. The findings are attributed to the increased electric field concentration at the asperities of the rough surfaces, which may facilitate the alignment of water molecules and the formation of critical ice nuclei.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f6efd75d637ef06b02e89a7e1e2965a64015bdd427149e6fcd57aef5c6cc12b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
