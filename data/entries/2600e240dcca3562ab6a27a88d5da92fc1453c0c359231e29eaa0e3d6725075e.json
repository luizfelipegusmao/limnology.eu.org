{"title":"Evaluation of Solid-State Fermentation Conditions from Pineapple Peel Wastes to Release of Bioactive Compounds by Aspergillus niger spp.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1008/v1","date":1710754080000,"content":"Currently, agro-industrial residues have been used to obtain bioactive compounds. The fermentation process is an alternative for the use of these residues and to be able to accumulate metabolites that may be of interest to different industrial sectors. The aim of this study was to evaluate solid-state fermentation conditions using pineapple waste as substrate with Aspergillus niger spp., to release polyphenolic compounds using a Plackett-Burman exploratory design. Temperature, humidity, inoculum, NaNO3, MgSO4, KCl and KH2PO4 conditions in the fermentation process were evaluated. The results revealed that the Aspergillus niger HT3 strain reached a hydrolyzable tannins accumulation of 10.00 mg/g, while Aspergillus niger Aa20 reached a condensed tannins release of 82.59 mg/g. The KH2PO4 affect the release of condensed tannins with A. niger Aa20 and MgSO4 affect the release of hydrolyzable tannins with A. niger HT3. In addition, a positive antioxidant activity was demonstrated for the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP technique. The HPLC analysis was able to identify compounds in the fermented pineapple peel such as 3-feruloylquinic acid, caffeic acid, lariciresinol and 3-hydroxyphloretin 2'-O-xylosyl-glucoside, among others. The solid-state fermentation process is a biotechnological alternative for the release of bioactive compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2600e240dcca3562ab6a27a88d5da92fc1453c0c359231e29eaa0e3d6725075e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
