{"title":"A Positioning Alarm System for Explosive Impact Debris Protective Suit Based on Accelerometer Array","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0345/v1","date":1717642650000,"content":"Protection suit is vital for firemanâ€™ safety. Traditional protection suit just physically protects fireman from empyrosis, but can not locate the body injury position from the impact debris. Herein, we present a wearable impact debris positioning system for fireman protection suit alarming based on accelerometer array. The wearable piezoelectric accelerometers with distribute regularly on the suit to detect the vibration on different body parts, which is conducive to positioning injured body parts. In addition, the injured parts can be displayed on the dummy body model on the upper computer with a higher localization accuracy of 4 cm. The positioning alarm system has a rapid response time of 0.11ms attributing to smart signal processing method. This work provides a reliable and smart method for locating and assessing the body injury position from the impact debris, which is significant for fire disaster commander to rescue injured fireman in time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3527a895f8522f54f937a35de675a329757cadfe6b1f96acbc16152b6233ba61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
