{"title":"Hypoxia as a Target for Combination with Transarterial Chemoembolization in Hepatocellular Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1829/v1","date":1719384855000,"content":"Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hypoxia has proved to be involved in multiple tumor biological processes and associated with malignant progression and resistance to therapy. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a well-established locoregional therapy for patients with unresectable HCC. However, TACE-induced hypoxia regulates tumor angiogenesis, energy metabolism, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune processes through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which may have adverse effects on the therapeutic efficacy of TACE. Hypoxia has emerged as a promising target for combination with TACE in treatment of HCC. This review summarizes impact of hypoxia on HCC tumor biology, adverse effects of TACE-induced hypoxia on its therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the therapeutic potential of hypoxia-targeted therapy in combination with TACE for HCC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f1717b0c93386addfa72d02029d1076dd1080c459c98bb51ad605dd8ba8c5ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
