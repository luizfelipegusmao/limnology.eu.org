Manual summarization is both expensive and time-consuming, making it impractical for humans to handle vast amounts of data. Consequently, the need for ATS systems has become evident. These systems encounter challenges such as ensuring comprehensive content coverage, determining the appropriate length of the summary, addressing redundancy, and maintaining coherence in the generated summary. Researchers are actively addressing these challenges by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. While traditional methods exist for generating summaries, they often fall short of addressing multiple aspects simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, recent advancements have introduced multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for ATS. This study proposes an enhancement to the performance of ATS through the utilization of an improved version of the Binary Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (BMOGWO), incorporating mutation. The performance of this enhanced algorithm is assessed by comparing it with state-of-the-art algorithms using the DUC2002 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the compared approaches.","author":"Muhammad Ayyaz Sheikh","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"67a4ae44f576945f5ca83a2c6e910da8f9a808e0021eec43a7d6751d8f967c8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
