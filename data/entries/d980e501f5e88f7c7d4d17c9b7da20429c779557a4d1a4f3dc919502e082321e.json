{"title":"Absolute monocyte counts could predict disease activity and secondary loss of response of patients with Crohn’s disease treated with anti-TNF-α drug","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301797","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Jia Hu, Yin Huang, Ruonan Jia, Xuehong Wang, Yongjun Wang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Assessing Crohn’s disease (CD) activity is critical for monitoring disease progression. In CD, monocytes could release TNF-α. Thus, it is extremely important to study its role in the disease activity and loss of response to anti-TNF-α biologics.</p> Methods <p>In this study, we collected CD patients treated with biologics from January 2017 to May 2022. Indicators associated with disease activity were evaluated by Spearman correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney U test. Specifically, logistic analyses were used to explore the predictors of primary nonresponse (PNR) and secondary loss of response (SLOR) within 1 year of anti-TNF-α agents. In addition, a nomogram was developed for therapeutic effect prediction.</p> Results <p>283 patients with CD were identified. Disease activity group, defined as CDAI equal to or greater than 150, had significant elevated absolute monocyte counts than disease remission group based on CDAI score (p = 0.019, Z = -2.354). Logistic analyses showed that absolute monocyte counts could be an independent predictor of 1-year SLOR of anti-TNF-α agents in CD patients (p = 0.013). A nomogram established based on gender, absolute monocyte counts, and hemoglobin could predict SLOR within 1 year of anti-TNF-α agents reliably.</p> Conclusion <p>The results of this study support the utility of absolute monocyte counts detecting disease activity and anti-TNF-α therapy effect in patients with CD.</p>","author":"Jia Hu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d980e501f5e88f7c7d4d17c9b7da20429c779557a4d1a4f3dc919502e082321e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
