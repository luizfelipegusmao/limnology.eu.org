{"title":"Mechanisms Underlying the Rarity of Skeletal Muscle Cancers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0608/v1","date":1715567099000,"content":"Skeletal muscle (SKM), despite comprising ~40% of body mass, is rare. This review explores the mechanisms that help to explain this rarity, including unique SKM architecture and function, which prohibits development of new cancer as well as negates potential metastasis to SKM. SKM also presents a unique immune environment that may magnify the anti-tumorigenic effect. Moreover, the SKM microenvironment manifests characteristics such as decreased extracellular matrix stiffness and altered lactic acid, pH, and oxygen levels that may interfere with tumor development. SKM also secretes anti-tumorigenic myokines and other molecules. Collectively, these mechanisms help account for the rarity of SKM cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a73d5eb4e7c7f0c73a3eabc5c96ee33bf8c4d544d439d7a42868d5a7a63217a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
