Nonetheless, the combined toxicological impacts and potential molecular mechanisms of PS-NaP and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs in the hepatic system have not been revealed. Thus, we conducted experiments on C57BL/6 mice exposed to PS-NaP or/and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs for 4 weeks. The findings suggested that PS-NaP and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs co-exposed significantly altered the hepatic function parameters, levels of antioxidant-related enzymes and genes expression of <i>Keap-1/Nrf2/ARE</i> signaling pathway, as well as significantly increased the hepatic Ti contents, aggravated hepatic pathological and oxidative stress (OS) damage compared with individual exposure to PS-NaP or TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. Using N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an OS inhibitor, we further demonstrated that OS played a pivotal role in coexposure-induced liver injury. NAC reduced the levels of OS in mice, which mitigated co-exposure-induced liver injury. Taken together, we proposed that PS-NaP and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs co-exposed activated the <i>Keap-1</i>, then inhibited the recognition of <i>Nrf2</i> and <i>ARE</i>, consequently exacerbated liver injury. These findings shed light on the co-toxicity and potential mechanism of nanoplastics and nanoparticles, which informed the risk assessment of human exposure to environmental pollutants.</p>","author":"Tiantian Jia, \nPenghui Nie, \nHengyi Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"442dc6fdf2843655040007ad4bebef930aed0705356c1995e23860ff809c6974","category":"Environment"}
