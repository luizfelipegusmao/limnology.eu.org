Human conflict and food security have emerged as critical issues for humanity with potentially profound implications for biodiversity conservation. These interconnected challenges not only threaten human well-being and socio-economic stability but also have significant impacts on biodiversity, including biodiversity of conservation concern. The importance of wildlife for bushfood, particularly in regions affected by conflict, adds another layer of complexity. In such areas, reliance on wildlife for sustenance often increases, leading to overexploitation. Bushmeat serves as a crucial source of protein and livelihoods in many parts of the world particularly Africa, highlighting its significant role in local economies and food security. This dynamic not only threatens biodiversity but also exacerbates the challenges of food security and human conflict. Understanding the interplay between human conflict, food security and biodiversity conservation is essential for developing sustainable solutions that address these complex issues holistically. Modelling of wildlife exploitation has historically focussed on spatially explicit pressure maps showing how vulnerable species are to exploitation. New modelling is emerging to help better understand the specific impacts on species populations so that policymakers can help create better informed policies and strategies that balance human needs with conservation efforts.</p>","author":"Hedley S.
