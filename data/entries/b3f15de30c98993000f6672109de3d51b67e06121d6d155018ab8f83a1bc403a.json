{"title":"Sneaky DCIS-Looking Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast in the Background of Extensive DCIS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0559/v1","date":1715233335000,"content":"In the most cases, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast is identifiable when they present with classic infiltrative growth pattern. However, subset of IDC can occur in a very sneaky way, significantly mimicking the appearance of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In this condition, it’s much easier to miss the invasive component without pulling ancillary staining when morphologic findings are extremely compatible with DCIS, especially the diagnosis of DCIS was made on the previous biopsy. Here, we reported a 55 year-old female who was noted to have microcalcification at the 11:00 o’clock of the right posterior breast on routine mammographic examination in 09/2023. Biopsy of the calcification area in 10/2023 reported high grade DCIS (ER+ PR-). Histologic examination of subsequent mastectomy specimen showed two separate DCIS-looking areas (Figure 1A-D and Figure 2). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed that myoepithelial markers, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), p63, CK5/6 and S100, were retained at the periphery of all the expanded acini in one area (Figure 1E-H). Unexpectedly and surprisingly, myoepithelial markers were completely lost at the periphery of part of the DCIS-looking acini in another area (Figure 3A-H), immunohistochemically compatible with the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma admixed with DCIS. Knowing that invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast can present as DCIS-looking morphology, especially given the condition that the diagnosis of DCIS was rendered on the previous biopsy, will enhance awareness of pathologists to recognize DCIS-looking invasive ductal carcinoma. In turn, this will prevent misdiagnosis and under-treatment of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3f15de30c98993000f6672109de3d51b67e06121d6d155018ab8f83a1bc403a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
