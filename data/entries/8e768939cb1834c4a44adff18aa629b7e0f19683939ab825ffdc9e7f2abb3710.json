{"title":"Questioning the Lorentz Factor in Special Relativity: Introducing the Yuyunrui Factor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2137/v1","date":1721966055000,"content":"Newton's kinetic energy equation delineates the laws of motion for objects travelling at speeds much less than the speed of light, an equation extensively validated at these lower velocities. Any new, more complete formulation of kinetic energy must approximate Newton's kinetic energy equation under these conditions. Einstein's special relativity, utilizing the Lorentz factor, introduces a new perspective on spacetime, adhering to the requirement that the Newtonian kinetic energy equation serves as an approximation at low velocities. In this paper, we identify all factor expressions satisfying the condition that their approximate solutions at low velocities align with Newton's kinetic energy equation. We introduce the Yuyunrui factor, incorporating two real number hyperparameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, encompassing all potentially correct factors, with the Lorentz factor as a specific instance where $(\\alpha=0$, $\\beta=1)$. We classify all potentially correct $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ combinations into six categories based on their distinct scaling effects and present the corresponding scaling effects. The combinations of $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ values applicable in the real world are necessarily included within these candidates, with the precise values requiring rigorous experimental validation. This work aims to refine our understanding of special relativity beyond the Lorentz factor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e768939cb1834c4a44adff18aa629b7e0f19683939ab825ffdc9e7f2abb3710","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
