Data from the Taiwan Social Change Survey for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were used to examine the relationship between the number and level of familiarity with daily social contacts with the probable CMDs (determined by score of ≥ 3 on a 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire). Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association. Among the 7,841 respondents, the prevalence of probable CMDs increased from 18.28% in 2000 to 21.29% in 2015. Multivariable analysis showed that respondents with more daily social contacts were less likely to have probable CMDs in the four observed years adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and physical health limitations on daily activities in the past two weeks. A negative relationship between probable CMDs and level of familiarity with daily contacts was found in 2000 (OR = 0.67, 95% CI-0.48–0.94) and 2005 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI-0.53–0.93). Findings from our study suggest the development of culturally tailored programs/interventions through features of daily social contacts may reduce the prevalence of CMDs in Taiwan.","author":"Meng-Han Tsai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5bc17672d7802e21b56f26b36b369c247eccce7cefa8d92ad8cb794b5a9417de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
