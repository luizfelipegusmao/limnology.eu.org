{"title":"A Survey on Reputation Systems for UAV Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0075/v1","date":1714549020000,"content":"The proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks is increasing, driven by their capacity to deliver automated services tailored to the varied demands of numerous smart city applications. Trust, security, and privacy remain paramount in the public domain. Traditional centralized network designs fall short of ensuring device authentication, data integrity, and privacy within UAV networksâ€™ highly dynamic and adaptable environments. Decentralized reputation systems emerge as a promising solution to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of data and communications within these networks while safeguarding UAV security. This paper presents an exhaustive survey of trust and reputation systems, exploring existing frameworks and proposed innovations alongside their inherent challenges. It highlights the crucial role of reputation systems in strengthening trust, security, and privacy throughout these networks and discusses various strategies to mitigate existing vulnerabilities. As a useful resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance the state of the art in UAV network security, we hope this survey will spark further community discussion and stimulate innovative ideas in this burgeoning field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17907e754320bff969ca5cade3e5666dd3a47c474f74830b99d61254f7b27166","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
