{"title":"Impact and Mechanism of High Standard Farmland Construction on Farmland Abandonment: A Moderated Mediating Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1605/v1","date":1713939921000,"content":"At present, farmland abandonment（FA）is a severe phenomenon in China, imposing a serious restriction on agricultural production. In this context, it is of great significance to explore the logical relationship between high-standard farmland construction (HSFC) and FA to optimize land resource allocation and guarantee national food security. Based on 838 samples of farmers in the main rice production area of the Yangtze River Basin in China, this paper employs the Tobit model, the mediating effect model, and the moderated mediating effect model to analyze the impact of HSFC on FA at the micro level. The results show that (1) HSFC inhibits FA, and FA proportion decreases by 1.14% for every 1% increase in HSFC proportion, and the robustness test and endogeneity treatment also yield consistent conclusions. (2) Agricultural socialization services (ASS) play a positive mediating role in the influence path. HSFC promotes farmers' purchase of ASS, which in turn inhibits FA. (3) The agricultural labor transfer distance (ALTD) plays a positive moderating role in the relationship between HSFC and FA. The farther the distance, the more likely HSFC can promote farmers' purchase of ASS and inhibit FA. The results provide enlightenment on how to precisely implement HSFC policy, that is, to inhibit FA by improving the construction of high-standard farmland and the post-construction management as well as protection system. Moreover, this study helps guiding the development of ASS and optimizing the institutional environment for agricultural labor transfer, creating conditions for agricultural scale management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea7424e82b684d6b42f3f59e0f0a2bceb40be90a93ad10b101e0813f8de3bd71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
