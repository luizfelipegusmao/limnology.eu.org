{"title":"Inflammation and Iron Profile in Children with Sickle Cell Disease in Cameroon: Frequency and Associated Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1721/v1","date":1711595725000,"content":"Background and objectives: sickle cell disease is the most common hemoglobinopathy in the world. It is considered to be a real public health problem. Sickle cell patients are subjected to several factors causing inflammation such as iron metabolism. The study aimed to look for inflammation in children with sickle cell disease in Cameroon, identify the factors associated with inflammation, and raise the consequences for the patient including the iron profile and the profile of the hemogram. Materials and methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study for 03 months. The sickle cell disease patients coming and/or followed at the Hematology Department of the Regional Hospital of Bafoussam and the Central Hospital of Yaound√© have been recruited. The exploration of inflammation was made by determining CRP, IL6, and ferritin concentrations. The hematological parameters and iron profile were evaluated using standard methods. Statistical analysis of the data was performed; Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses allowed to identification of factors associated with inflammation in patients, using the statistical tool R version 4.1.1.. The proportions were compared with the chi-square test when the expected numbers were greater than 5 and the Fisher test when not. Results: The frequency of inflammation in the population was 42.3%. Hyperferritinemia was significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) in patients with inflammation compared to the non-inflammatory patients (96.8% and 76.7% respectively). Patients with inflammation showed a significant elevation of iron parameters (p&lt;0.05). In addition, ferritin and IL6 elevation were associated with inflammation during sickle cell disease respectively (Or = 4.96; 95% CI [1.15-36.42]; p=0.056) and (Or =6.23; 95% CI [1.43-45.96]; p=0.030). Conclusions: The elevated iron in plasma is an effect of inflammation in sickle cell patients. Hence the need of controlling inflammation and iron in the latter is necessary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9a7b8fde5e05eeb838565e1d8529870398ee8a8e0f746219b2698454e6e7178","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
