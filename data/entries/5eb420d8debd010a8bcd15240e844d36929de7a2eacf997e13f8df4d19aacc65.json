{"title":"Reproductive biology, elemental composition and diel vertical migration of the cosmopolitan warm-temperate pelagic tunicate Soestia zonaria","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/1/72/7505235?rss=1","date":1704240000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pelagic tunicates (appendicularians, doliolids, pyrosomes, salps) are cosmopolitan members of open-ocean food webs that serve as a link to the microbial loop and play a disproportional role in vertical carbon flux. <span>Soestia zonaria</span> is an oceanic salp species studied for more than a century, but little information exists on its ecology. Specimens of <span>Soestia</span> collected between 2008 and 2021 during four research expeditions (three to the Chatham Rise, New Zealand, and one to the Northeast Atlantic) using MOCNESS-1 net and large midwater trawl were analyzed for reproductive biology, stoichiometry and vertical distribution. Populations at the Chatham Rise sampled in early winter were more developed than in spring/early summer and dominated by small and medium-sized sexually reproducing blastozooids. Whole <span>Soestia</span> specimens had high organic content (mean ± SD = 32.8 ± 7.5%) and carbon-to-nitrogen values (6.8 ± 0.9) compared with other salp species, indicating a stronger dependency on carbon to meet its nutritional needs. Depth-stratified sampling showed that <span>Soestia</span> is primarily a low-amplitude diel vertical migrator occurring in the top 150 m of the water column, but also found at depths exceeding 500 m. <span>Soestia</span> is primarily an epipelagic salp species adapted to living in warm-temperate nutrient-depleted and more productive ocean regions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"5eb420d8debd010a8bcd15240e844d36929de7a2eacf997e13f8df4d19aacc65","category":"Environment"}
