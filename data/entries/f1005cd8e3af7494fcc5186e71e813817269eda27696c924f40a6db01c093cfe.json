{"title":"Exploring the Role of Genetic and Environmental Features in Colorectal Cancer Development: An Agent-Based Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2259/v1","date":1727582326000,"content":"Complexity of issues in cancer research has led to the introduction of powerful computational tools for helping experimental in vivo and in vitro methods. These tools, typically focused on studying cell behavior and dynamic cell populations, range from systems of differential equations solved numerically, to lattice models and agent-based simulations. In particular, agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly used for they capability to incorporate multi-scale features ranging from the individual up to the population level, thus combining statistically aggregated assumptions with individual heterogeneity. In this work, we present an ABM that simulates tumor progression in a colonic crypt, with the aim of providing an experimental in silico environment for testing results achieved in traditional laboratory research and developing alternative scenarios of tumor development. The model also allows some speculations about causal relationships in biologically inspired systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1005cd8e3af7494fcc5186e71e813817269eda27696c924f40a6db01c093cfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
