{"title":"The Role and Criteria of Advanced Street Lighting to Enhance Urban Safety in South Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1130/v1","date":1718610555000,"content":"Safety and the apprehension of crime persist as significant concerns in both urban and rural locales. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) guidelines, an architectural approach to crime deterrence, mitigate the likelihood of criminal activity by implementing strategic defensive design plans, particularly through effective lighting schemes within urban settings, thereby alleviating fear of crime. This comprehensive set of principles serves to enhance overall quality of life. Additionally, within the realm of environmental crime prevention, enhanced street lighting has been identified as a crucial factor in diminishing both actual crime rates and the perceived risk of criminal activity in built environments. While current recommendations advocate for the installation of lighting in poorly lit areas for safety reasons, evaluating visibility solely based on the presence of existing streetlights proves insufficient for analyzing road surface luminance comprehensively. Thus, this study proposes establishing standardized illumination levels specifically tailored for facial recognition of potential criminal offenders. Furthermore, we advocate for defining specific thresholds for color temperature and colorimetric criteria to aid in distinguishing characteristics of individuals' attire. To analyze photometric safety and crime frequency in Seoul, Korea, new primary evaluation indicators were developed, including the Brightness index, Informatization index, and Safety index. By incorporating quantitative data into lighting design strategies, particularly within the framework of CPTED, there exists the potential to mitigate fear of crime during nighttime hours. These strategies facilitate the creation of well-lit environments conducive to the swift recognition and identification of potential perpetrators, thereby presenting a proactive approach to crime prevention. Consequently, this study introduces quantitative lighting standards to augment the efficacy of CPTED guidelines, ultimately contributing to the reduction of crime incidence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"951c298690f4ce8a944b05ef8d23c95c84bbc5941873c7ce61f478acb425685d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
