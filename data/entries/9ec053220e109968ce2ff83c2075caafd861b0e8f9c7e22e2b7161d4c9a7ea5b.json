{"title":"Comparative Analysis of the Evolution of Green Leaf Volatiles and Aroma in Six Vitis vinifera L. Cultivars during Berry Maturation in the Chinese Loess Plateau Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1217/v1","date":1710983567000,"content":"Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are important in giving grape a fresh and green aroma. But the changes in GLVs during the phenological development of grapevines are not well known. This study analysed the GLVs and transcription levels of associated biosynthetic genes in six grape species from the Loess Plateau region at five stages of maturation. Thirteen GLVs were detected, showing unique patterns for each grape type at various growth phases. The primary components in six grapes were (E)-2-Hexenal, (E)-2-Hexen-1-ol, and Hexanal. With the exception of Cabernet Franc in 2019, the overall GLV contents of the six types generally increased during growth and development, peaking or stabilizing at harvest. And Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Gernischt, and Cabernet Sauvignon exhibited higher total contents among the varieties. Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the levels of Hexanal, 1-Hexanol, (E)-2-Hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate, Nonanal, and (E, E)-2,6-Nonadienal and the expression of VvHPL and VvAAT genes in the LOX-HPL pathway. Specifically, VvHPL emerges as a potential candidate gene responsible for species-specific differences in GLV compounds. Comprehending the changing patterns in the biosynthesis and accumulation of GLVs offers viticulturists and enologists the opportunity to devise targeted strategies for improving the aromatic profile of grapes and wines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ec053220e109968ce2ff83c2075caafd861b0e8f9c7e22e2b7161d4c9a7ea5b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
