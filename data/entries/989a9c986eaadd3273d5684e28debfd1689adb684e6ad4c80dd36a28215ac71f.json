Here, we explore the potential of large language models as a tool to fact-check fake news and sensationalized content about animals. We queried the most popular large language models (ChatGPT 3.5 and 4, and Microsoft Bing), asking them to quantify the likelihood of 14 wildlife groups, often portrayed as dangerous or sensationalized, killing humans or livestock. We then compared these scores with the “real” risk obtained from relevant literature and/or expert opinion. We found a positive relationship between the likelihood risk score obtained from large language models and the “real” risk. This indicates the promising potential of large language models in fact-checking information about commonly misrepresented and widely feared animals, including jellyfish, wasps, spiders, vultures, and various large carnivores. Our analysis underscores the crucial role of large language models in dispelling wildlife myths, helping to mitigate human–wildlife conflicts, shaping a more just and harmonious coexistence, and ultimately aiding biological conservation.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>在当前网络信息快速增长的时代，区分事实与耸人听闻或虚假的内容是一项重大挑战。本文探讨了大型语言模型作为一种工具在检查关于动物的假新闻和耸人听闻的内容上的潜力。我们对最流行的大型语言模型（ChatGPT 3.5 和 4，以及 Microsoft Bing）进行了查询，要求它们量化 14 种野生动物群体杀害人类或牲畜的可能性，这些动物群体通常被描述为危险的或耸人听闻的。然后，我们将这些分数与从相关文献和/或专家意见中获得的 “真实 “风险进行比较。我们发现，大语言模型得出的可能性风险得分与 “真实 “风险之间存在正相关关系。这表明，大型语言模型在核对有关水母、胡蜂、蜘蛛、秃鹫和各种大型食肉动物等普遍被误传和令人广为恐惧的动物的信息方面具有广阔的潜力。本文的分析结果展现了大型语言模型在消除野生动物流言、帮助缓解人类与野生动物冲突、塑造更加公正和谐的共存关系以及最终助力生物保护方面的关键作用。【审阅:孟义川】</p>","author":"Andrea Santangeli, \nStefano Mammola, \nVeronica Nanni, \nSergio A.
