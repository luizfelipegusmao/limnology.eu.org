The steels are stable during creep exposure due to the pinning forces exerted by particles of different origin. During in-service creep conditions, these nanometer sized precipitates evolve, which decreases the pinning forces exerted by the particles leading to a decrease in the long-range internal stress field [<a href=\"#ozae044.299-B1\">1</a>]. Quantitative measurements of these secondary phases can potentially be used for remnant-life predictions of service exposed components and to study the microstructural stability of newly developed material grades.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6a2d56f28451929dd92ab39a9ea791a4d4ff3bf3b10bf7bbd09e45e8a74e58ea","category":"Environment"}
