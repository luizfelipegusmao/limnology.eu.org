{"title":"Analysis of the population genetics of the Yangtze finless porpoise population in the Poyang Lake Basin: Insight of conservation recommendations","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4145?af=R","date":1712852875000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nThe genomes of 32 Yangtze finless porpoises (YFPs) in the Poyang Lake Basin were sequenced, and the data were used for population genetic analysis.\nThe population genetic structure of YFP in the Poyang Lake Basin is relatively simple, with a linkage disequilibrium decay distance of 705 bp.\nThe correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance for YFP populations from different regions showed that the populations had a fixed range.\nAlthough Poyang Lake is connected during the rainy season, changes in water levels and human activities have hindered the exchange and migration of YFP populations between different areas. In particular, these changes may lead to differences in physiological metabolism and reproduction between populations in the main lake area and those in the sand pits, which are connected to the main lake area during the dry season.\nThis study highlights the need for measures such as artificial translocation, dredging and habitat restoration to improve the exchange of YFP populations between different areas. We also suggest that the sand pits should be designated as protected areas, as their environment is conducive to the survival of the population.\n</p>","author":"Rao Rongcheng, \nQue Jianglong, \nTian Zhen, \nMin Jialing, \nYang Ying, \nHuang Qinghai, \nYu Jinxiang, \nDai Yingen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"94f51cb3963163638fb3707e1e93c6e05340606055168838eb280295f81fcb28","category":"Environment"}
