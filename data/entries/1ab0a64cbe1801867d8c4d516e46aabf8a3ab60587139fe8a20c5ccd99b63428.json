{"title":"Human-In-The-Loop Optimization Of Knee Exoskeleton Assistance For Minimizing User’s Metabolic And Muscular Effort","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1732/v1","date":1711685937000,"content":"Lower limb exoskeletons have the potential to reduce the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders; however, they often lack user-oriented control strategies. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) controls can adapt an exoskeleton’s assistance in real-time, to optimize the user-exoskeleton interaction. This study presents a HITL control for a knee exoskeleton to minimize the users’ physical effort, a parameter innovatively evaluated by their interaction torque with the exoskeleton (a muscular effort indicator) and metabolic cost. This work innovates by estimating the user’s metabolic cost within the HITL control through a machine-learning model. The regression model was able to estimate the metabolic cost, in real-time, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.66 W/kg and a mean absolute percentage error of 26%, making faster (10s) and less noisy estimations than a respirometer (K5, Cosmed) device. The HITL reduced the user’s metabolic cost and interaction torque by 7.3% and 32.3%, respectively, when compared to a zero-torque control. The developed HITL control surpassed both a non-exoskeleton and a zero-torque condition regarding the user’s physical effort, even for a simple task such as slow walking. Furthermore, the user-specific control enabled a lower metabolic cost than the non-user-specific assistance. This proof-of-concept demonstrated the potential for HITL controls in assisted working.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ab0a64cbe1801867d8c4d516e46aabf8a3ab60587139fe8a20c5ccd99b63428","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
