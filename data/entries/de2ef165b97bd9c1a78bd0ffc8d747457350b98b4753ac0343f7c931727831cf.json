The results highlight the Paratethys Paleo-sea as a major driver of diversification, implement a new timetree validation approach, emphasize the rare ability of lineages to hybridize despite substantial genomic divergence, and showcase the multiple origins of the exotic water frog populations extending all over Western Europe.

Despite half a century of genetic research and hundreds of publications, the diversity, systematics and biogeography of <i>Pelophylax</i> still remain highly confusing, in no small part due to a lack of correspondence between studies. To provide a comprehensive overview, we gathered &gt;13,000 sequences of barcoding genes from &gt;1700 native and introduced localities and built multigene mitochondrial (~17 kb) and nuclear (~10 kb) phylogenies. We mapped all currently recognized taxa and their phylogeographic lineages (&gt;40) to get a grasp on taxonomic issues, cyto-nuclear discordances, the genetic makeup of hybridogenetic hybrids, and the origins of introduced populations. Competing hypotheses for the molecular calibration were evaluated through plausibility tests, implementing a new approach relying on predictions from the anuran speciation continuum. Based on our timetree, we propose a new biogeographic paradigm for the Palearctic since the Paleogene, notably by attributing a prominent role to the dynamics of the Paratethys, a vast paleo-sea that extended over most of Europe. Furthermore, our results show that distinct marsh frog lineages from Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Near East, and Central Asia (<i>P. ridibundus</i> ssp.) are naturally capable of inducing hybridogenesis with pool frogs (<i>P. lessonae</i>). We identified 14 alien lineages (mostly of <i>P. ridibundus</i>) over ~20 areas of invasions, especially in Western Europe, with genetic signatures disproportionally pointing to the Balkans and Anatolia as the regions of origins, in line with exporting records of the frog leg industry and the stocks of pet sellers. <i>Pelophylax</i> thus emerges as one of the most invasive amphibians worldwide, and deserves much higher conservation concern than currently given by the authorities fighting biological invasions.</p>","author":"Christophe Dufresnes, \nBenjamin Monod‐Broca, \nAdriana Bellati, \nDaniele Canestrelli, \nJohanna Ambu, \nBen Wielstra, \nSylvain Dubey, \nPierre‐André Crochet, \nMathieu Denoël, \nDaniel Jablonski","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"de2ef165b97bd9c1a78bd0ffc8d747457350b98b4753ac0343f7c931727831cf","category":"Environment"}
