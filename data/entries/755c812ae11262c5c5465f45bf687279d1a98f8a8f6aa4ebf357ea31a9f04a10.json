{"title":"OOT Therapy Combined with Porcine Collagen Injection in Patients with Low Back Pain: The Booster to Increase Short- and Long-Term Efficacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0534/v1","date":1725617522000,"content":"Intervertebral disc degeneration is one of the most frequent causes of lower back pain, and lum-bosciatica puts a strain on healthcare systems around the world. For years, ozone therapy has been used with excellent results in intervertebral disc pathology and in patients with low back pain (LBP). Treatment with intramuscular paravertebral ozone injection is based on the combination of the anti-inflammatory action with the action of accelerating the dehydration process of the cartilage tissue of the disc, and on the action of general oxygenation of the tissues. We know that the main functional structures involved in the onset of pain in LBP are rich in type 1 collagen: the fascial system, the annulus fibrosus and the zygo-apophyseal joints. In all these facilities, collagen repair and regeneration processes deserve an important mention as collagen turnover plays a fundamental role in the well-being of patients with LBP. In particular, in vitro studies have demonstrated the positive action of porcine type 1 collagen in the face of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and homeostasis. In fact, the tissue modification, associated with LBP, could also suggest an indication for combined ozone/collagen treatment in patients with LBP. However, no studies regarding combined ozone treatment with collagen have been performed in patients with LBP. The present work compared two different arms (10 lumbar patients each) Oxygen-Ozone Therapy (OOT) vs OOT plus Porcine Collagen Type 1 Injections (COL I, MD-LUMBAR). NSR, physiological function (trunk movement) and disability questionnaire were studied for all patients before, during and after treatments. Patient follow-up was performed again 6 months after the last treatment. Statistical analysis tests revealed significant differences compared to the two arms. In which, the dual choice (OOT+COL I), demonstrated a booster effect in both short-term and long-term NSR (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"755c812ae11262c5c5465f45bf687279d1a98f8a8f6aa4ebf357ea31a9f04a10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
