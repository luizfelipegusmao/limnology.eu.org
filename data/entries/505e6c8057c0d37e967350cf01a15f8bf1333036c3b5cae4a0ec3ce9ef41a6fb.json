{"title":"Diffusion Bonding 321-Grade Stainless Steel: Failure and Multimodal Characterization","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/192/7634488?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Vacuum diffusion-bonded printed circuit heat exchangers are an attractive choice for the high-temperature, high-pressure demands of next-generation energy applications. However, early reports show that the high-temperature materials desired for these applications suffer from poor bond strengths due to precipitation at the bond line, preventing grain boundary migration. In this study, a diffusion bond of the high-temperature stainless steel grade 321H is investigated, and poor mechanical properties are found to be caused by Ti(C, N) precipitation at the bond line. Through <span>in situ</span> studies, it is found that Ti diffuses from the bulk to the mating surfaces at high temperatures. The Ti subsequently precipitates and, for the first time, an interaction between Ti(C, N) and Al/Mg-oxide precipitates at the bond line is observed, where Ti(C, N) nucleates on the oxides forming a core-shell structure. The results indicate that small amounts of particular alloying elements can greatly impact diffusion bond quality, prompting further research into the microstructural evolution that occurs during bonding conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"505e6c8057c0d37e967350cf01a15f8bf1333036c3b5cae4a0ec3ce9ef41a6fb","category":"Environment"}
