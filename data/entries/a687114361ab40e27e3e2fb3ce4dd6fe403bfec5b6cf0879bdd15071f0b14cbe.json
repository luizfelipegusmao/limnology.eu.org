{"title":"Morphological Differentiation, Yield and Cutting Time of Lolium multiflorum L. under Acid Soil Conditions in Highlands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1558/v1","date":1721377590000,"content":"Livestock production in the Cajamarca, La Libertad and Amazonas basins is based on pasture-based feeding with \"Cajamarquino ecotype\" ryegrass under monoculture or in association with white clover. The objective of this research work was the morphological characterization and evaluation of the productive yield and cutting time of annual ryegrass - Lolium multiflorum L. Six local genotypes of Lolium multiflorum in six locations were characterised, using the multiplicative interaction effect model and additive main effects for the analysis of interaction and variability of the genotypes and locations. Ryegrass “Cajamarquino ecotype” is semi-erect with intermediate growth, with a dark green colouring, 0.8 cm broadleaf, and can reach an average stem length of 46 cm, up to 1.6 cm.day, achieving the growth of the fourth leaf after 28 days under adequate management conditions. Despite the differentiated characteristics, according to the BLASTn evaluation, the ITS1 sequences showed an identification greater than 99.9% similar to Lolium multiflorum L. It was determined that the Cajamarquino ecotype produces from 3.52 to 4.98 Mg.ha.biomass cutting. Likewise, the pasture's quality is better when used at 30 days with 14.84% protein and at 45 days, it achieves 12.75% protein with a biomass of 4.05 Mg.ha.cut. With these morphological and yield characteristics, the \"Cajamarca ecotype\" ryegrass is a well-adapted species for local livestock farming. These species are adapted to the Sierra Norte area of Peru.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a687114361ab40e27e3e2fb3ce4dd6fe403bfec5b6cf0879bdd15071f0b14cbe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
