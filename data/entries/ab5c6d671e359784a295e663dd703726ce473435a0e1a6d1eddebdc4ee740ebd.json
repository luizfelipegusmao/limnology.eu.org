{"title":"Fenoldopam for Renal Protection in Cardiac Surgery: Pharmacology, Clinical Applications, and Evolving Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1558/v1","date":1726750345000,"content":"This comprehensive review examines the role of fenoldopam, a selective dopamine-1 receptor agonist, in preventing and treating acute kidney injury (AKI) during cardiac surgery. AKI remains a significant complication in cardiac surgery, associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The review explores fenoldopam's pharmacological properties, mechanism of action, and clinical applications, synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and observational studies. While some studies have shown promising results in improving renal function and reducing AKI incidence, others have failed to demonstrate significant benefits. The review discusses these conflicting findings, explores potential reasons for discrepancies, and identifies areas requiring further research. It also compares fenoldopam to other renoprotective strategies, including dopamine, diuretics, and N-acetylcysteine. The safety profile of fenoldopam, including common side effects and contraindications, is addressed. Current guidelines and recommendations for fenoldopam use in cardiac surgery are presented, along with a cost-effectiveness analysis. The review concludes by outlining future research directions and potential new applications of fenoldopam in cardiac surgery. By providing a thorough overview of the current state of knowledge, this review aims to facilitate informed decision-making for clinicians and researchers while highlighting areas for future investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab5c6d671e359784a295e663dd703726ce473435a0e1a6d1eddebdc4ee740ebd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
