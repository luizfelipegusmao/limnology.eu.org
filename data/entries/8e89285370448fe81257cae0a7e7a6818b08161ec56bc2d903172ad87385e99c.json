{"title":"Intellecta Cognitiva: A Comprehensive Dataset for Advancing Academic Knowledge and Machine Reasoning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0849/v1","date":1712918787000,"content":"Intellecta dataset emerges as an innovative synthetic dataset, engineered to enhance the cognitive processing capabilities of contemporary language models. With a composition of 11.53 billion tokens, integrating 8.01 billion tokens of synthetic data with 3.52 billion tokens of rich textbook data, Intellecta is crafted to foster advanced reasoning and comprehensive educational narrative generation. Leveraging the Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 model, the dataset facilitates the generation of complex thought processes and detailed, textbook-style explanations, thus enabling language models to engage in both critical thinking and profound educational discourse. This hybrid dataset stands as a testament to the potential of synthetic data in pushing the boundaries of AI, offering a repository that is not only vast and varied but also refined to align with ethical standards and intellectual rigor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e89285370448fe81257cae0a7e7a6818b08161ec56bc2d903172ad87385e99c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
