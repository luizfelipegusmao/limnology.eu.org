{"title":"Identification of CTNNB1 in the lined seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and its function in innate immunity and cell proliferation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13061?af=R","date":1717392617000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>β-Catenin (<i>CTNNB</i>) is a core downstream mediator in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a role in immune regulation and cell differentiation. In the present study, two <i>CTNNB</i> genes were identified by genomic analysis of <i>Hippocampus erectus</i> and named <i>He-CTNNB1</i> and <i>He-CTNNB2</i>. <i>He-CTNNB1</i> was more conserved than <i>He-CTNNB2</i>. The full length of <i>He-CTNNB1</i> was 2369 bp, including an open reading frame of 2275 bp that encoded 737 amino acids containing 12 armadillo repeats. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>He-CTNNB1</i> clusters had homologs in other bony fishes. Tissue distribution analysis showed the highest mRNA expression of <i>He-CTNNB1</i> in the ovary, liver, and kidney of the lined seahorse under normal physiological conditions. The transcription level of <i>He-CTNNB1</i> was significantly increased in the liver and kidney in response to LPS, poly I:C, and <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> challenge (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In vitro overexpression of <i>He-CTNNB1</i> significantly upregulated the expression of key genes of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, such as <i>axin2</i>, <i>cMyc</i>, and <i>cyclinD</i> (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), which increased cell proliferation during the wound-healing process. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>He-CTNNB1</i> is essential for cell proliferation and the innate immune response in <i>H. erectus</i>.</p>","author":"Lele Zhang, \nFang Wang, \nChunhui Lv, \nLanliang Yu, \nXiaojing Ci, \nNing Zhang, \nLongwu Jia, \nYuanyuan Xue, \nXu Zhang, \nXiaolei Su, \nKai Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"f961f99b6e3f96a06fc940306e766f943b98ebb8fc2c5015d2861a4926348053","category":"Environment"}
