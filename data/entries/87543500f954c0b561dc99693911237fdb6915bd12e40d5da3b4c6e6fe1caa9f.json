{"title":"Dissimilar Resistance Welding of NiTi Microwires for High Performance SMA Bundle Actuators","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0356/v1","date":1722933575000,"content":"Shape memory alloys (SMA) are becoming a more important factor in actuation technology. Due to their unique features, they bring the potential to safe weight, installation space and reduce energy consumption. The system integration of the generally small diameter NiTi wires is an important cornerstone for the emerging technology. Crimping, a common method for the mechanical and electrical connection of SMA wires, has several drawbacks when it comes to miniaturization and high force outputs. For high force applications for example, multiple SMA wires in parallel are needed to keep actuation frequencies high, while scaling up the actuation force. To meet these challenges, the proposed study deals with the development of a resistance welding process for manufacturing NiTi wire bundles. The wires are welded to sheet metal substrate, resulting in promising functional properties and high joint strengths. The welding process benefits from low cost, easy to control parameters and good automation potential. A method for evaluating the resistance welding process parameters is presented. With these parameters in place, a manufacturing process for bundled wire actuators is discussed and implemented. The welded joints are examined by peel tests, microscopy, and fatigue experiments. The performance of the manufactured bundle actuators is demonstrated by comparison to a single wire with the same accumulated cross-sectional area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87543500f954c0b561dc99693911237fdb6915bd12e40d5da3b4c6e6fe1caa9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
