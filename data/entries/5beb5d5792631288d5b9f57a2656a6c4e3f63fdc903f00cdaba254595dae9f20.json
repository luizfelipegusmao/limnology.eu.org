To counter these threats, plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms primarily involving physical and chemical strategies to protect themselves against these microbes (<a href=\"#kiae095-B3\">Jones and Dangl 2006</a>; <a href=\"#kiae095-B5\">Ramirez-Prado et al. 2018</a>). In addition to these preformed physical/chemical barriers, plants actively detect pathogens and trigger defense signaling networks, restricting the further growth and spread of pathogens. Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in these signaling networks by governing the expression of defense genes. Exploring TF regulation during plant-pathogenic fungi interactions opens avenues to discover novel virulence factors and enhance our understanding of the regulatory networks associated with pathogen evolution. Moreover, targeting TFs themselves can be a strategy for disease control.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"5beb5d5792631288d5b9f57a2656a6c4e3f63fdc903f00cdaba254595dae9f20","category":"Environment"}
