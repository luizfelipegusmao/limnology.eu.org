{"title":"Evaluation and Rehabilitation After Adult Lumbar Spine Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0682/v1","date":1712671508000,"content":"With an increase in proportion of elderly patients, the global burden of spinal disease is on the rise. Likewise, there has been an increasing trend in the number of spine surgeries being performed worldwide. As we know, rehabilitation following spine surgery is critical for optimal recovery. However, current literature lacks consensus regarding the appropriate post operative rehabilitation protocol. The goals of rehabilitation after lumbar spine surgery are to improve physical and psychosocial function and may include multiple modalities such as physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, specialized instruments, and instruction to be followed during activities of daily living. In recent years, not only are a greater number of spine surgeries being performed, various different techniques of lumbar spine surgery and spinal fusion have emerged. Physical therapy programs need to be curated after assessing the functional status of the patient by using various patient reported outcome measures and taking into consideration the technique of spinal fusion used and the muscle groups involved in these surgeries. By doing so it is possible to assess the level of functional impairment and then specifically target strengthening of those muscle groups affected by surgery whilst also improving impaired balance and allowing return to activities of daily living. We reviewed available literature pertaining to the history of spinal rehabilitation, the popular patient reported outcome measures used and different rehabilitation methods with the purpose of summarizing the current guidelines for postoperative rehabilitation after spine surgery and to introduce the rehabilitation after lumbar surgeries that we provide at our hospital.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"237dad0d65c2e6c8f09036ce407a53eede373d2d34f12f9c6152b5eab4f67abd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
