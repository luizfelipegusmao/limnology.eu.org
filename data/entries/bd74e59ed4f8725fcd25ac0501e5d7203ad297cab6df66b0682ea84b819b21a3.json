{"title":"Comprehensive Analysis of Kisspeptin Signaling: Effects on Cellular Dynamics in Cervical Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1462/v1","date":1716425745000,"content":"Kisspeptin, a key neuropeptide derived from the KISS1 gene, is renowned for its critical role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and reproductive hormone secretion. Beyond its primary function in reproductive biology, emerging research has illuminated its influence in various cancers, mediating significant effects through its interaction with the G-protein coupled receptor, Kisspeptin receptor. This interaction has been implicated in modulating cellular pro-cesses such as proliferation and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interven-tion. Our study initially screened ten kisspeptin-10 analogs through cytotoxic effects of kisspep-tin-10 (KP10) and its analogs in several cancer types, including cervical, prostate, breast, and gastric cancers, with a particular focus on cervical cancer where the most profound effects were observed. Further exploration using kinase array assays revealed that these analogs specifically alter key kinases involved in cancer progression. Migration assays demonstrated a substantial decrease in cell motility, and Bioluminiscence Resonance Energy Transfer assays confirmed these analogs strong interactions with the kisspeptin receptor. Overall, our results indicate that these KP10 analogs not only hinder cervical cancer cell proliferation but also curtail migration through targeted modulation of kinase signaling, suggesting their potential as therapeutic ayfgents in managing cervical cancer progression. This comprehensive approach underscores the therapeutic promise of exploiting kisspeptin signaling in cancer treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd74e59ed4f8725fcd25ac0501e5d7203ad297cab6df66b0682ea84b819b21a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
