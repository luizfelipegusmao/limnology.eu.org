{"title":"Revalidation of the arboreal Asian snake genera Gonyophis Boulenger, 1891, Rhynchophis Mocquard, 1897, and Rhadinophis Vogt, 1922, with description of a new genus and tribe (Squamata: Serpentes: Colubridae)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2225/v1","date":1722244546000,"content":": Based upon the latest molecular phylogenies of Gonyosoma sensu lato, which recovered five clades with robust support, we utilize morphological characters to demonstrate the distinctiveness of each clade, resulting in the resurrection of three genera (Gonyophis Boulenger, 1891 [1], Rhynchophis Mocquard, 1897 [2], and Rhadinophis Vogt, 1922 [3]) and proposal of a new genus and a new tribe. A synopsis of the group, with descriptions and diagnoses, is provided for the five genera and eight species in addition to distribution maps and illustrations of the head of each taxon. An artificial key to the species and genera in the new tribe is presented in addition to estimated origin times for each clade.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25722798637b9d4172f55dbdd6375ef6eb9a0df3ee9d445a9000d2dc2dceed91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
