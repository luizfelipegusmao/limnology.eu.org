In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), the lipid phosphate phosphatases LPPγ, LPPε1, and LPPε2 have been previously implicated in chloroplast lipid assembly, with LPPγ being essential, as null mutants were reported to exhibit embryo lethality. Here, we show that <span>lpp</span>γ mutants are in fact viable and that LPPγ, LPPε1, and LPPε2 do not appear to have central roles in the plastid pathway of membrane lipid biosynthesis. Redundant LPPγ and LPPε1 activity at the outer envelope membrane is important for plant development, and the respective <span>lpp</span>γ <span>lppε1</span> double mutant exhibits reduced flux through the ER pathway of galactolipid synthesis. While LPPε2 is imported and associated with interior chloroplast membranes, its role remains elusive and does not include basal nor phosphate limitation-induced biosynthesis of glycolipids. The specific physiological roles of LPPγ, LPPε1, and LPPε2 are yet to be uncovered, as does the identity of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase required for plastid galactolipid biosynthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e4a6e90267605538023d88df3f2f75fa2f68e34e9198f9c2300fd6601fafb46c","category":"Environment"}
