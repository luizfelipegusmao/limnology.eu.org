{"title":"Chicken Embryo Fibroblast Viability and Trans-Differentiation Potential for Cultured Meat Production Across Passages","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1676/v1","date":1724389715000,"content":"This study was conducted to analyse viability of primary chicken embryo fibroblasts by pre-plating and efficiency of adipogenic trans-differentiation for cultured meat production. Morphology and proliferative capabilities of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were compared with those of chicken satellite cells (CSC) isolated from chicken embryos. Isolated CEF exhibited significantly lower expression of Pax7 (paired-box protein 7) and MHC (Myosin Heavy Chain) than CSC (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Over 90% of isolated CEF expressed CD29 and Vimentin. Analysis of proliferative capabilities of CEF revealed no significant differences in EdU-positive cell (%), cumulative cell number, doubling time, and growth rate from passage 1 to passage 9 (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Up to the passage 9, CEF underwent adipogenic trans-differentiation. As passages increased, lipid accumulation and adipocyte size decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This indicates that CEF can be isolated by 2 hours of pre-plating and survive stably up to the 9th generation. Moreover, efficient production of fat can be achieved by inducing adipogenic trans-differentiation of lower-generation CEF.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"934522224047c7bdce32157520cec75b6681e71107db1994333843e37a09b70b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
