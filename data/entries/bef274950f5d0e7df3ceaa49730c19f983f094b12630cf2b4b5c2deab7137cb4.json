{"title":"Metastatic Cancer Expression Generator (MetGen): A Generative Contrastive Learning Framework for Metastatic Cancer Generation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0397/v1","date":1712307708000,"content":"Despite significant advances in tumor biology and clinical therapeutics, metastasis remains the primary cause of cancer-related deaths. While RNA-seq technology has been used extensively to study metastatic cancer characteristics, challenges persist in acquiring adequate transcriptomic data. To overcome this challenge, we propose MetGen, a generative contrastive learning based on deep learning model. MetGen generates synthetic metastatic cancer expression profiles using primary cancer and normal tissue expression data. Our results demonstrate that MetGen generates comparable samples to actual metastatic cancer samples, and we discuss the learning mechanism of MetGen. Additionally, we demonstrate MetGen's interpretability using metastatic prostate cancer and metastatic breast cancer. MetGen has learned highly relevant signatures in cancer, tissue, and tumor microenvironment, such as immune response and the metastasis process, which potentially fosters a more comprehensive understanding of metastatic cancer biology. The development of MetGen represents a significant step toward the study of metastatic cancer biology by providing a generative model that identifies candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of metastatic cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bef274950f5d0e7df3ceaa49730c19f983f094b12630cf2b4b5c2deab7137cb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
