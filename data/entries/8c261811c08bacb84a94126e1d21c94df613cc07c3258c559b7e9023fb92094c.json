{"title":"The effect of diet composition on the diversity of active gut bacteria and on the growth of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae031/7633074?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gut microbiota plays a functional role in nutrition among several insects. However, the situation is unclear in Lepidoptera. Field studies suggest the microbiome may not be stable and is determined by diet, while in the laboratory, Lepidoptera are routinely reared on diet containing antibiotics with unknown effects on microbial communities. Furthermore, molecular approaches for the characterization of lepidopteran microbiomes rarely describe the metabolically active gut bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate how diet and antibiotics affect <span>Spodoptera exigua</span> (HÃ¼bner) growth and the diversity and activity of the gut bacteria community. We assessed how alfalfa and wheat germ-based diets affected larval growth, in the presence and absence of streptomycin. Alfalfa diet improved larval growth, pupal mass, and survival, but antibiotic was only beneficial in the wheat germ diet. We observed diet-driven changes in the gut bacterial communities. In the active community, the alfalfa colony was dominated by <span>Enterococcus</span> and <span>Rhodococcus</span> whereas in the wheat germ colony, only <span>Enterococcus</span> was present. In contrast, spore-forming <span>Bacilli</span> species were very common members of the DNA community. In both cases, streptomycin had a selective effect on the relative abundance of the taxa present. Our study highlights the importance of characterizing both the diversity and activity of the gut microbiota community. DNA-derived communities may include environmental DNA, spores, or non-viable bacteria, while RNA-derived communities are more likely to give an accurate representation of the diversity of active members that are potentially directly involved in the metabolic processes of the host.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"8c261811c08bacb84a94126e1d21c94df613cc07c3258c559b7e9023fb92094c","category":"Environment"}
