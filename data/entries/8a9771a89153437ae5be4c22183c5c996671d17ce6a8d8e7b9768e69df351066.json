{"title":"13 Impact of precision feeding during gestation on the productive career of sows over three reproductive parities","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/60/7665048?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of precision feeding during gestation on the career performances and longevity of sows, initially gilts, monitored over three successive reproductive cycles. Four isoenergetic treatments were compared: two conventional constant-concentration feeding strategies (0.53 % DIS Lys) with feed supply either constant (flat feeding; FF) or variable (bump feeding; BF), and two precision feeding strategies based on the InraPorc model applied considering either the mean weight by parity (PFP) or the individual weight of each sow at breeding (PFI). Four groups, representing 393 gilts, were followed from breeding to weaning over three cycles. Body weight and backfat depth were measured at breeding, 90 d of gestation, parturition, and weaning. Feed consumption was monitored daily. Litter variables were measured, including birth and weaning weight, mortality, and overall body weight gain. A mixed model was used to analyze differences between the four treatments using the sow as the experimental unit for performance analysis during the third reproductive cycles. For the analysis of the overall productive career over the three reproductive cycles, the performances of the two conventional strategies (with constant Lys DIS concentration feeding, CONV) were compared with the two precision feeding strategies (PF). During the third cycle, PFP and PFI sows had a lighter body weight at the beginning of gestation than the FF sows (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), but increased their body weight gain during gestation (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Backfat loss in PFP and PFI sows during lactation was greater compared with BF sows (<span>P</span> = 0.05), FF sow being intermediate. PFP sows had a lower stillborn rate (<span>P</span> = 0.04) and tended to have less total piglet mortality (<span>P</span> = 0.06) than FF and BF sows. Over the three reproductive cycles, the stillborn rate and total piglet mortality were less in PF sows than in CONV sows (respectively -0.9 %; <span>P</span> = 0.02 and -1.5 %; <span>P</span> = 0.03). PF sows weaned more piglets during their three cycles than CONV sows did (+ 0.7; <span>P</span> = 0.03), with weaning litter weight gain also increasing for PF sows (+3.7 %; <span>P</span> = 0.02). The culling rate of gilts after three cycles did not differ significantly among treatments (<span>P</span> = 0.27), but tended to be greater for PF sows after one cycle (+4.9 %; <span>P</span> = 0.08). The results seem to show a lasting benefit of precision feeding for sows, with a decrease in piglet mortality during lactation, suggesting greater piglet viability without significantly decreasing sow longevity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8a9771a89153437ae5be4c22183c5c996671d17ce6a8d8e7b9768e69df351066","category":"Environment"}
