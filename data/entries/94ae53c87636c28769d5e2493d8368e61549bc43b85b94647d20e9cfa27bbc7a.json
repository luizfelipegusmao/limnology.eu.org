These techniques address opposite ends of the SEM spectrum in terms of specimen size and image resolution. While LVSTEM is mostly focused on small area (100 mm<sup>2</sup>), and thin specimens (10â€™s of nm) imaged at nm scale resolution, MBSEM is used to rapidly collect images over large areas of bulk samples at image resolutions down to a few nm (about 1 hour for an area of 10 mm<sup>2</sup>). LVSTEM and MBSEM span a huge range of sample size and image resolutions and both methods present unique but different opportunities for imaging of a variety of specimens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"94ae53c87636c28769d5e2493d8368e61549bc43b85b94647d20e9cfa27bbc7a","category":"Environment"}
