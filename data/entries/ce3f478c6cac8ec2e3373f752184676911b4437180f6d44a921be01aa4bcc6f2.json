This advancement has provided invaluable insights into the relationship between materials' microstructure and properties at elevated temperatures in real time. Utilizing microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-type microheaters [<a href=\"#ozae044.824-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.824-B3\">3</a>], precise control over local temperatures during in-situ TEM experiments has become achievable.
