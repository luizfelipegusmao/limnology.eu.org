In this paper, we delve into the challenges faced by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in efficiently managing bandwidth and traffic within their networks. We propose a synergy between two pivotal technologies, Multi-Protocol Label Switchingâ€”Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Diffserv Quality of Service (Diffserv-QoS), which have implications beyond traditional networks and resonate strongly with the realm of smart agriculture. The increasing adoption of technology in agriculture relies heavily on real-time data, remote monitoring, and automated processes. This dynamic nature requires robust and reliable high-bandwidth connections to facilitate data flow between sensors, devices, and central management systems. By optimizing bandwidth utilization through MPLS-TE and implementing traffic control mechanisms with Diffserv-QoS, ISPs can create a resilient network foundation for smart agriculture applications. The integration of MPLS-TE and Diffserv-QoS has resulted in significant enhancements in throughput and a considerable reduction in Jitter. Employment of the IPv4 header has demonstrated impressive outcomes, achieving a throughput of 5.83 Mbps and reducing Jitter to 3 msec.","author":"Emad S.
