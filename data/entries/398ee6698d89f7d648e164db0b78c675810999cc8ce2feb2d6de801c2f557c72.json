{"title":"Diversity of free-living flatworms (Platyhelminthes) in Cuba","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/140/3/423/7243496?rss=1","date":1692230400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cuban biodiversity is characterized by high species richness and endemism; however, free-living flatworms have been neglected in studies of the fauna of the archipelago. These animals constitute an essential component of marine and freshwater ecosystems as top predators and secondary producers. In this contribution, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of turbellarian diversity in Cuba based on a long-term sampling effort in marine, brackish, freshwater and terrestrial environments. We used observed and estimated species richness as indicators of alpha diversity. As a result, we have collected, for the first time, 279 species in Cuba, including 189 species of rhabdocoels, 33 species of polyclads, 21 species of macrostomorphs, 14 species of proseriates, 12 species of prolecithophorans, seven species of triclads and one representative each of Prorhynchida, Gnosonesimida and Bothrioplanida. At least 184 species (67%) are new to science. Fifty of these species have been recorded in published journal contributions. The remainder are pending formal identification and/or description. We demonstrate the turbellarian fauna of Cuba to be one of high diversity and endemism. Estimated species richness is much higher than that observed, exemplifying the taxonomic impediments and stressing the need for more intense sampling campaigns in the archipelago.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"398ee6698d89f7d648e164db0b78c675810999cc8ce2feb2d6de801c2f557c72","category":"Environment"}
