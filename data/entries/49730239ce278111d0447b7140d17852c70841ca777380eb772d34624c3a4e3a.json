{"title":"Determination of Rhythmicity and Gestational Stage-Related Distribution of Blood Plasma Melatonin Concentration in Donkey Mares","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0425/v1","date":1717752642000,"content":"The aim of the study is to obtain a more complete picture of the blood plasma melatonin concentration in the donkey species. To this purpose sampling and statistical processing were carried out in such a way that allowed to establish the annual and daily rhythm. Based on human observations, according to the hypothesis of the authors, the blood plasma melatonin concentration of pregnant individuals rises during late gestational period, before parturition. To confirm this, the melatonin concentration of pregnant and non-pregnant mares was monitored and compared. In regard to the circannual rhythm, the significantly lowest midnight melatonin value (27.67 pg/ml) is typical for the summer solstice. Under consideration of circadian changes, a significantly strongest melatonin production (45.16 pg/ml) can be observed on the night of the winter solstice (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Considering the gestational age, the blood plasma melatonin concentration (around 38 pg/ml) does not change as pregnancy progresses (p = 0.136). The results obtained in the study population of the domestic ass usefully expand the little knowledge previously gathered about the development of blood plasma melatonin concentration of this species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49730239ce278111d0447b7140d17852c70841ca777380eb772d34624c3a4e3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
