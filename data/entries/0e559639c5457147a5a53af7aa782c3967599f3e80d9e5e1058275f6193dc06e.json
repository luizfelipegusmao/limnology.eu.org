{"title":"Hybrid Biomechanical Design of Dental Implants: Integrating Solid and Gyroid TPMS Lattice Architectures for Optimized Stress Distribution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0694/v1","date":1725879829000,"content":"Dental implantology has evolved greatly as a result of the application of biomechanical engineering concepts, notably the utilization of additive manufacturing technologies that recreate the intricate architecture of real bone. This technique intends to improve functional compatibility with bone tissue while also addressing continuing problems of stress distribution inside dental implants. The research examines two types of dental implants: fully gyroid latticed and hybrid gyroid latticed with a solid neck, comprising three different cell sizesâ€”FI-111, FI-222, FI-333, and their hybrid equivalents HI-111, HI-222, and HI-333. Traditional solid implants often cause stress shielding, which reduces long-term osseointegration and implant durability. Developed using nTopology for lattice configuration and meshing, this design undergoes a comprehensive stress analysis using finite element analysis (FEA). The study seeks to determine the most efficient implant design by maximizing stress distribution and mechanical stiffness. Analyses suggest that hybrid latticed implants, notably the HI-222 type, possess superior mechanical characteristics. These implants successfully balance stiffness and flexibility, reducing stress concentrations and improving stress distribution throughout the implant structure. This balance is critical for decreasing micromotions at the bone-implant interface, boosting osseointegration, and, ultimately, increasing implant longevity and success rates in clinical settings. The paper describes a substantial redesign of dental implants by combining biomechanical engineering and modern additive manufacturing. The novel proposed hybrid structure not only addresses typical challenges such as stress shielding, but it also establishes new standards in implantology, potentially leading to better clinical results and patient quality of life. This complete approach emphasizes the ability of personalized implant designs to fulfill individual clinical demands, indicating a significant improvement in dental treatment technology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e559639c5457147a5a53af7aa782c3967599f3e80d9e5e1058275f6193dc06e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
