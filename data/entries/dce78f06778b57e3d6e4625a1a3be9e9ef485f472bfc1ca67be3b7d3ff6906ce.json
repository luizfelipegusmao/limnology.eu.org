{"title":"Economic Impacts of Viroids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2134/v1","date":1717151010000,"content":"Abstract\n\nPlant diseases are responsible for over 10% loss in global food production and have serious \nimpacts on world-wide food security across several countries. Amongst these diseases, those \ncaused by viroids are highly significant, accounting for extensive damage to crops every year \nand pose a major economic threat to agricultural crops. Combined infections with viroids, plant \nviruses and their satellites further exacerbate the situation. Vector transmission of viroids \nnecessitates the use of pesticides, thus incurring high costs in addition to eliciting several \ndetrimental effects on the ecosystem due to the noxious outcomes of pesticide use. The current \nreview addresses the major economic impacts of viroids on crops, costs to the world economy \nand impacts on regions, farmers and consumers in addition to describing remediation measures \nto mitigate the losses caused by these subviral agents. Also described are issues relating to the \npros and cons of pesticide use, the compelling need towards sustainable agricultrual practices \nwhile reducing pesticide use. In particular, the role of RNAi and genome editing technologies \ntowards amelioration of agricultural loss is discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dce78f06778b57e3d6e4625a1a3be9e9ef485f472bfc1ca67be3b7d3ff6906ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
