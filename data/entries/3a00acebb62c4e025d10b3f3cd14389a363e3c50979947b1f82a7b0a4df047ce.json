{"title":"Shrinking suitable habitat of a sub‐Arctic foundation kelp under future climate scenarios","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13493?af=R","date":1729597128000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change has profound effects on the distribution of kelp forests in the Arctic and sub-Arctic. However, studies on the responses of kelps to climate change, particularly along the sub-Arctic regions of the Alaska coast, are limited. <i>Eualaria fistulosa</i> is a foundational kelp species in the Aleutian Islands, with an east–west distribution that extends from Japan to southern southwest Alaska. In this study, we utilized a species distribution model (SDM) to explore changes in the future habitat suitability of <i>E. fistulosa</i> under contrasting Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. Our model exhibited relatively high predictive performance, validating our SDM predictions. Notably, the SDM results indicate that minimum sea surface temperature, annual range in sea surface temperatures, and annual mean current velocities are the three most important predictor variables determining <i>E. fistulosa</i>'s distribution. Furthermore, the projected geographic distribution of <i>Eualaria</i> is generally consistent with its observed occurrence records. However, under high emission scenarios (SSP5-8.5), <i>E. fistulosa</i> is predicted to contract its distribution range by 9.0% by 2100, with widespread disappearance along the southeast Alaskan coast and limited northward migration to Kamchatka Krai in Russia and Bristol Bay in Alaska. These findings contribute valuable insights for conservation strategies via addressing climate-induced alterations in sub-Arctic kelp distribution.</p>","author":"Huiru Li, \nJunmei Qu, \nZhixin Zhang, \nEun Ju Kang, \nMatthew S.
