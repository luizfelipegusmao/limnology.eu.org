This study was conducted on a nanoparticle-filled rubber to investigate its nanoscale deformation behaviour under a large shear strain. First, the shear deformation process of a large area in the specimen was accurately examined and proven to exhibit an almost perfect simple shear. At the nanoscale, voids grew along the maximum principal strain during shear deformation. In addition, the nanoscale regions with rubber and silica aggregates exhibited deformation behaviours similar to the global shear deformation of the specimen. Although the silica aggregates exhibited displacement along the shearing directions, rotational motions were also observed owing to the torque generated by the local shear stress. This <span>in-situ</span> shear deformation system for TEM enabled us to understand the nanoscale origins of the mechanical properties of soft materials, particularly polymer composites.<strong>Graphical Abstract</strong>  </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"963b80ae09a48f82f4a02f2c070982d780e33dbc4ee0d594faeb8845f9250105","category":"Environment"}
