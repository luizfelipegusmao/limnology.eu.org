{"title":"Saint-Venant Torsion of Beams with Rectangular Cross-Section Using the Fourier Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0770/v1","date":1718172805000,"content":"This paper presents an approach to the analysis of beams with rectangular cross-sections subjected to Saint-Venant torsion using the Fourier analysis, body forces being not considered. The Saint-Venant torsion of beams, also called free torsion or unrestrained torsion, is characterized by the absence of axial stresses due to torsion; only shear stresses are developed. The solution to this torsion problem consists of finding the Prandtl stress function that satisfies the governing equation and the boundary conditions, the governing equation being such that the Laplacian of the stress function has a constant value within the cross-section. In this paper, Fourier sine series was utilized to describe the constant value of the above mentioned Laplacian, while double sine series or simple sine series was utilized to describe the Prandtl stress function. Closed-form solutions in form of infinite series were derived for shear stresses, torsional constant and warping function. Those solutions were identical to the exact solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1128fbc5b438cb67866a9c7bfc3b05fdf77f2e66a990b9a797950d383cd502b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
