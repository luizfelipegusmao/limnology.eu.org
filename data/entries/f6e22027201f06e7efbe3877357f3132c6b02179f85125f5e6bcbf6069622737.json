{"title":"Quantum Entanglement Asymmetry and the Cosmic Matter-Antimatter Imbalance: A Theoretical and Observational Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0771/v1","date":1710319928000,"content":"In this study, we investigate Quantum Entanglement Asymmetry (QEA) as a potential explanation for the matter-antimatter imbalance observed in the universe. By integrating quantum mechanics with cosmological phenomena, the study proposes a model in which quantum entanglement among particle-antiparticle pairs in the early universe leads to an asymmetry favoring matter. Through theoretical development and numerical simulations, we explore how this model predicts unique patterns in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies and the distribution of matter, setting a foundation for empirical verification. The study aims to enhance the understanding of cosmological asymmetries and highlight the significance of quantum entanglement in the universe's evolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6e22027201f06e7efbe3877357f3132c6b02179f85125f5e6bcbf6069622737","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
