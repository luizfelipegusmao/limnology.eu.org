{"title":"Efficacy and Safety of Herbal Medicine Treatment on Post-Surgical Recovery in Gastric Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1198/v1","date":1716156101000,"content":"Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is the second most prevalent cancer in Korea, significantly impacting morbidity and mortality. While advancements in early detection and treatment have improved survival rates, managing post-surgical recovery remains vital. Herbal medicine (HM) has emerged as a potential adjunct therapy to enhance recovery and quality of life (QoL) in patients post-GC surgery. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of HM in the post-surgical recovery of GC patients. We searched both Korean and international databases, identifying 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting our criteria. We assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and analyzed data with Review Manager Software (RevMan). Results: Our analysis included 1,546 patients from the selected studies, demonstrating that HM significantly improved gastrointestinal recovery times, including time to first flatus, bowel movement, and return of bowel sounds. Significant improvements were also seen in nutritional markers such as albumin and prealbumin, alongside beneficial effects on immune markers like CD3+ and CD4+ levels. QoL assessments using WHOQOL-BREF and QLQ-C30 scores indicated substantial improvements. HM had a favorable safety profile, showing a reduced incidence of adverse effects compared to controls. Conclusion: The findings suggest that HM can significantly enhance recovery and improve the quality of life following gastric cancer surgery, with a favorable safety profile. However, due to considerable heterogeneity in study results, extended clinical trials and rigorous follow-ups are recommended to assess long-term effects and side effects comprehensively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05896fd30b53f990e28430ff5c3baa8adcea06ceb0defa221cb771cd63195876","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
