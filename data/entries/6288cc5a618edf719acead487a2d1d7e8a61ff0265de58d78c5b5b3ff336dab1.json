{"title":"Biochar/Biopolymer Composites for In-Situ Groundwater Remediation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1407/v1","date":1718868737000,"content":"(max 200 words): The contamination of groundwater is a serious concern for ecosystems and human health. In this regard, biochar represents a promising low-cost and sustainable material for in-situ groundwater remediation. Herein, biochar waste of biomass energy production process derived from pine wood gasification at 950°C was used as active carbonaceous material in combination with different biopolymers: chitosan (CS), alginate (ALG), potato starch (PST), and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to produce BC@biopolymer composite materials. Different concentrations of biochar (0.3–1.0 g·L-1) and biopolymers (0.2–20.0 g·L-1) were tested and blending mode was used as simple and straightforward strategy to obtain BC composites. Scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), UV-Visible, infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, specific surface area (BET method), pore volume, and pore size distribution (textural parameters), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and ζ-potential were used to investigate the composite chemical structure, stability, and to assess the interaction among counterparts. On optimized formulations, breakthrough tests and batch adsorption isotherms on trichloroethylene (TCE) as a model contaminant were performed to evaluate the capability of composites to be delivered through a porous medium determining the transport properties, (hydrodynamic dispersion retention percentage, and adsorption capacity). This biopolymer-modified biochar holds significant promise as a sustainable and effective solution to address various groundwater pollution challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6288cc5a618edf719acead487a2d1d7e8a61ff0265de58d78c5b5b3ff336dab1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
