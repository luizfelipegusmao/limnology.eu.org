{"title":"Development of a New IoT Device to Acquire and Analyze Gait Information of Horses in Training","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0507/v1","date":1718000979000,"content":"Techniques have been developed to determine whether a horse is in resting or running mode by measuring at least one of the following: the horse's body temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and exercise level. However, the existing technology has not reached a level where a trainer can accurately assess a horse's running conditions, such as speed, acceleration, stride, limb rotation, ground impact, and frontal balance, during the training of racehorses. In addition, data is needed to quickly detect abnormalities during training and provide a basis for changing the intensity of training or deciding to give a rest to the horse. Devices that detect abnormalities in equine gait with high sensitivity will contribute to animal welfare and increase the athletic longevity of horses. This paper reports the development results of a new IoT device that acquires, processes, and analyzes information such as heart rate, position, speed, acceleration, pitch, stride, and ground contact during a training of racehorses. The purpose of this development is to provide an information on a novel processing system, device, method, and program that can analyze training condition of racehorses from multiple angles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01b6feb87a59d1e70b1fbf0dba81a458537d7daa1f4ac3a8fbb71b8a60a1d29a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
