The channel is expressed in heart and generates the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current, IKs. Loss of function mutations in KCNQ1 lead to long QT syndrome (LQTS), gain of function leads to atrial fibrillation or short QT syndrome [<a href=\"#ozae044.373-B1\">1</a>]. Each α-subunit includes VSD domain, pore domain and large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain formed by four α-helixes (A, B, C and D). A and B helixes of the C-terminal domain are constitutively bound to calmodulin (CaM). This domain is responsible for tetramerization, proper trafficking, and the maintenance of biophysical properties of the channel [<a href=\"#ozae044.373-B2\">2</a>]. A structure of the isolated HD helix was solved before using X-ray crystallography [<a href=\"#ozae044.373-B3\">3</a>]. All published structures of Kv7.1 channels [<a href=\"#ozae044.373-B4\">4-8</a>] did not resolve HD helix due to flexibility of a HС-HD connection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8afc5cff385675960dfcd55576750b4cb499020f95df2dc3a43125d1c9312619","category":"Environment"}
