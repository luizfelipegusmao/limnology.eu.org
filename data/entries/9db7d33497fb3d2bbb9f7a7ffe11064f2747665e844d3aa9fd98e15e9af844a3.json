{"title":"Potent Anti-HIV-1 Activity of Sacran, a Megamolecular Polysaccharide from Cyanobacterium Aphanothece sacrum, as a Microbicide Candidate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2237/v1","date":1722322625000,"content":"Since cART was introduced to treat AIDS, the mortality rate due to AIDS has markedly decreased and the convalescence of HIV-infected individuals has improved drastically. However, HIV-1 sexual transmission has made HIV become a global epidemic. Sacran is a megamolecular poly-saccharide extracted from cyanobacterium Aphanothece sacrum that exhibits numerous desirable characteristics for transdermic applications, such as safety as a biomaterial, a high moisture re-tention effect, the ability to form a film and hydrogel, and an anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, we evaluated the anti-HIV-1 effects of Sacran as a barrier to HIV transmission. Sacran inhibited HIV-1 infection and envelope-dependent cell-to-cell fusion. Moreover, we used a Transwell assay to confirm that sacran inhibited viral diffusion and captured viruses. The synergistic effects of sacran and other anti-HIV infection drugs were also evaluated.HIV-1 infections can be reduced through the synergistic effects of sacran and anti-HIV-1 drugs. Our study suggests the use of sacran gel to protect against HIV-1 transmission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9db7d33497fb3d2bbb9f7a7ffe11064f2747665e844d3aa9fd98e15e9af844a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
