Integrating cervical cancer screening services into healthcare facilities is essential in combating the disease. Thus, this review aims to map evidence related to integrating cervical cancer screening into existing primary care services and identify associated barriers and facilitators in LMICs. The scoping review employed a five-step framework as proposed by Arksey and Oâ€™Malley. Five databases (MEDLINE, Maternity Infant Care, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science) were systematically searched. Data were extracted, charted, synthesized, and summarised. A total of 28 original articles conducted in LMICs from 2000 to 2023 were included. Thirty-nine percent of the reviewed studies showed that cervical cancer screening (CCS) was integrated into HIV clinics. The rest of the papers revealed that CCS was integrated into existing reproductive and sexual health clinics, maternal and child health, family planning, well-baby clinics, maternal health clinics, gynecology outpatient departments, and sexually transmitted infections clinics. The cost-effectiveness of integrated services, promotion, and international initiatives were identified as facilitators while resource scarcity, lack of skilled staff, high client loads, lack of preventive oncology policy, territorial disputes, and lack of national guidelines were identified as barriers to the services. The evidence suggests that CCS can be integrated into healthcare facilities in LMICs, in various primary care services, including HIV clinics, reproductive and sexual health clinics, well-baby clinics, maternal health clinics, and gynecology OPDs. However, barriers include limited health system capacity, workload, waiting times, and lack of coordination. Addressing these gaps could strengthen the successful integration of CCS into primary care services and improve cervical cancer prevention and treatment outcomes.","author":"Rahel Nega Kassa","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"025813e50021e66b59732264f4dd855b83e3e23e2ec6bc179eef21e0c3c22d77","category":"Environment"}
