{"title":"Monitoring of Long COVID Symptoms Using Digitalised COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRS) in Patients Attending Long COVID Rehabilitation Clinic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0871/v1","date":1723531725000,"content":"Abstract\nIntroduction: Long COVID (LC) affects multiple systems and has a significant health impact on patients and society. Therefore, long COVID services should address patients’ needs through a holistic assessment and monitoring of patients’ symptoms. \nAim: The aim was to understand which of the symptoms were most and least likely to improve, after our rehabilitation intervention so that the rehabilitation measures in the clinic could be modified to meet patients’ needs. At the same time, we wanted to assess the feasibility of using C19-YRS ELAROS application in monitoring of LC symptoms during and after the rehabilitation clinic attendance.\nMethodology: In this study, a total of 50 patients who have attended long COVID rehabilitation clinic in Salford, UK; were assessed by using digitalised C19-YRS ELAROS application. A total of 100 eligible initial and final post rehabilitation assessments were analysed. \nConclusion: Pain and anxiety symptoms were the two most likely symptoms to improve after intervention at LC rehabilitation clinic, whereas swallowing difficulty is least likely to improve. Issues with caring for family/ social life (symptoms affecting social role) are likely to worsen even after treatment. \nIt is feasible to monitor and track Long COVID symptoms utilising the digitalised version of C19-YRS via the ELAROS App. This also allows the tracking of symptoms overtime.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"093405dc1f461a43a60c18b2e19ff899aed4c0c93504f24b7e260f953516c759","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
