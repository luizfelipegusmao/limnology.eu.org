The complex anatomy of the male mouse urethra presents significant challenges in transurethral catheterization, leading to a predominance of research focused on female specimens. This bias limits the utilization of male mice in lower urinary tract disease studies. Our research aims to develop new reliable methods for transurethral catheterization in adult male mice, thereby expanding their use in relevant disease research. Experiments were conducted on adult male C57BL/6J mice. Utilizing a PE10 catheter measuring 4.5–5 cm in length, the catheter was inserted into the bladder via the mouse’s urethra under anesthesia. The intubation technique entailed regulating the insertion force, ensuring the catheter's lubrication, using a trocar catheter, modifying the catheter’s trajectory, and accommodating the curvature of the bladder neck. Post-catheter insertion, ultrasound imaging was employed to confirm the catheter's accurate positioning within the bladder. Subsequent to catheterization, the bladder was perfused using trypan blue. This method was further validated through its successful application in establishing an acute urinary retention (AUR) model, where the mouse bladder was infused with saline to a pressure of 50 or 80 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, maintained steadily for 30 min. A thorough morphological assessment of the mouse bladder was conducted after the infusion. Our study successfully pioneered methods for transurethral catheterization in male mice. This technique not only facilitates precise transurethral catheterization but also proves applicable to male mouse models for lower urinary tract diseases, such as AUR.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"de854019bb0b5c7d657558497ba023e71940b81c4ad3d4c25d9f9b639cc9f124","category":"Environment"}
