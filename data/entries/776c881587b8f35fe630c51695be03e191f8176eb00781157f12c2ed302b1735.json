{"title":"German Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) Flowers Extract, Its Amino Acids Preparations and 3D-Printed Dosage Forms: Phytochemical, Pharmacological, Technological and Molecular Docking Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1591/v1","date":1719220296000,"content":"German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) is an essential oil-content medicinal plant widely used worldwidely. The aim of this study was (1) to gain knowledge of the phytochemical composition and the analgesic and soporific activity of M. chamomilla flowers extract and its amino acid preparations, (2) to predict the mechanisms of their effects by molecular docking, and (3) to develop aqueous printing gels and novel 3D-printed oral dosage forms for M. chamomilla flowers extracts. In total 22 phenolics and 14 amino acids were identified and quantified in the M. chamomilla extracts. The in-vivo animal studies with rodents showed that the oral administration of such extracts revealed the potential for treating of sleep disorders and diseases accompanied by pain. Amino acids were found to potentiate these effects. Glycine enhanced the analgesic activity the most, while lysine and Î²-alanine improved the soporific activity. The molecular docking analysis revealed a high probability of GABAA and NMDA receptor antagonism and COX-1,2 inhibition by the extracts. A polyethylene oxide (PEO) based gel composition with the M. chamomilla extracts were proposed for preparing a novel 3D-printed dosage form for the oral administration. These 3D-printed extract preparations can be used for example in dietary supplement applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"776c881587b8f35fe630c51695be03e191f8176eb00781157f12c2ed302b1735","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
