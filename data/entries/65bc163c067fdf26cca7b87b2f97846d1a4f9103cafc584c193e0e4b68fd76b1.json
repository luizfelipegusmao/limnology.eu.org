{"title":"Delayed senescence and crop performance under stress: always a functional couple?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4244/7650987?rss=1","date":1713398400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Exposure to abiotic stresses accelerates leaf senescence in most crop plant species, thereby reducing photosynthesis and other assimilatory processes. In some cases, genotypes with delayed leaf senescence (i.e. ‘stay-green’) show stress resistance, particularly in cases of water deficit, and this has led to the proposal that senescence delay improves crop performance under some abiotic stresses. In this review, we summarize the evidence for increased resistance to abiotic stress, mostly water deficit, in genotypes with delayed senescence, and specifically focus on the physiological mechanisms and agronomic conditions under which the stay-green trait may ameliorate grain yield under stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"65bc163c067fdf26cca7b87b2f97846d1a4f9103cafc584c193e0e4b68fd76b1","category":"Environment"}
