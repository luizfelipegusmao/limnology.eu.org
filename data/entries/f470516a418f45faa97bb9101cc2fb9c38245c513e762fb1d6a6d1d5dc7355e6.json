{"title":"Trust, Commitment, and Adaptation: Key Factors in Effective Supplier Relationship Management in E-Commerce","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1105/v1","date":1721098278000,"content":"This study investigates the critical factors of trust, commitment, and adaptation within supplier relationship management (SRM) in the context of e-commerce. Through qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis, the study explores how these factors influence relationship dynamics and organizational outcomes in digital business environments. Trust is examined as foundational to effective SRM, encompassing integrity, reliability, and shared values between buyers and suppliers. Commitment is analyzed in terms of long-term orientation, resource allocation, and relationship-specific investments aimed at mutual growth and sustainability. Adaptation emerges as essential for navigating the dynamic e-commerce landscape, encompassing proactive strategies, flexibility, and innovation to respond to market changes and technological advancements. The findings highlight the interplay and mutual reinforcement among trust, commitment, and adaptation, contributing synergistically to relationship resilience and organizational performance. However, challenges such as information asymmetry, cybersecurity risks, and organizational inertia are identified as barriers to effective SRM. Practical implications include strategies for enhancing trust, fostering commitment, and cultivating adaptive capabilities through continuous learning, collaborative innovation, and technology integration. By integrating these insights, businesses can strengthen supplier relationships, drive sustainable growth, and achieve competitive advantage in the digital economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f470516a418f45faa97bb9101cc2fb9c38245c513e762fb1d6a6d1d5dc7355e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
