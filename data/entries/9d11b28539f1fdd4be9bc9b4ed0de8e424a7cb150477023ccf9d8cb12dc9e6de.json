{"title":"Men’s education and intimate partner violence—Beyond the victim-oriented perspective: Evidence from demographic and health surveys in Central Africa","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302627","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Zacharie Tsala Dimbuene, Bright Opoku Ahinkorah, Dickson Abanimi Amugsi</p>\r\nBackground <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) has increasingly received attention in the last three decades. However, IPV-related studies in both high- and low- and middle-income countries adopted a victim-oriented perspective in which men are perpetrators and women, the victims. Using socio-cultural and resource theories as guiding frameworks, this paper assessed the associations between men’s education and IPV in Central Africa, using nationally representative data of married and cohabiting women of reproductive ages.</p> Methods <p>Data included in the analyses come from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Cameroon, Gabon, and Chad. Analyzed sub-samples consisted of 3421, 5023, 3930, and 3221 married/cohabiting women of reproductive ages in Chad, DRC, Cameroon, and Gabon, respectively.</p> Results <p>Findings indicated significant variations of IPV prevalence within and across countries. Previous research demonstrated that men’s education is a protective factor in health-related studies. The present study, however, provide no clear evidence on the linkages between men’s education and IPV. In contrast, the paper substantiated that highly educated women were at higher risks of IPV when spouses/partners were less educated.</p> Conclusion <p>These findings have policy and programmatic implications because they might impede progress towards SDG goals on the elimination of all forms of violence against girls and women in Central Africa, which recorded the worst development indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. On a methodological note, studies are increasingly using pooled data to increase statistical power. Those studies can be very limited to devise effective IPV—interventions since they mask geographical variations within and across countries. More effective IPV—interventions should be culturally rooted and accounting for geographical variations because some areas are more affected than others.</p>","author":"Zacharie Tsala Dimbuene","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9d11b28539f1fdd4be9bc9b4ed0de8e424a7cb150477023ccf9d8cb12dc9e6de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
