{"title":"The cellular zeta potential: cell electrophysiology beyond the membrane","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/doi/10.1093/intbio/zyae003/7591594?rss=1","date":1706572800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The standard model of the cell membrane potential <span>Vm</span> describes it as arising from diffusion currents across a membrane with a constant electric field, with zero electric field outside the cell membrane. However, the influence of <span>Vm</span> has been shown to extend into the extracellular space where it alters the cell’s ζ-potential, the electrical potential measured a few nm from the cell surface which defines how the cell interacts with charged entities in its environment, including ions, molecules, and other cells. The paradigm arising from surface science is that the ζ-potential arises only from fixed membrane surface charge, and has consequently received little interest. However, if the ζ-potential can mechanistically and dynamically change by alteration of <span>Vm</span>, it allows the cell to dynamically alter cell–cell and cell-molecule interactions and may explain previously unexplained electrophysiological behaviours. Whilst the two potentials <span>Vm</span> and ζ are rarely reported together, they are occasionally described in different studies for the same cell type. By considering published data on these parameters across multiple cell types, as well as incidences of unexplained but seemingly functional <span>Vm</span> changes correlating with changes in cell behaviour, evidence is presented that this may play a functional role in the physiology of red blood cells, macrophages, platelets, sperm, ova, bacteria and cancer. Understanding how these properties will improve understanding of the role of electrical potentials and charges in the regulation of cell function and in the way in which cells interact with their environment.<div><strong>Insight</strong> The zeta (ζ) potential is the electrical potential a few nm beyond the surface of any suspensoid in water. Whilst typically assumed to arise only from fixed charges on the cell surface, recent and historical evidence shows a strong link to the cell’s membrane potential <span>Vm</span>, which the cell can alter mechanistically through the use of ion channels. Whilst these two potentials have rarely been studied simultaneously, this review collates data across multiple studies reporting <span>Vm</span>, ζ-potential, electrical properties of changes in cell behaviour. Collectively, this points to <span>Vm</span>-mediated ζ-potential playing a significant role in the physiology and activity of blood cells, immune response, developmental biology and egg fertilization, and cancer among others.</div></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"08ec31a93e0a3f830088f3051f0870206dac7048d685312e4717ea0a4882ca75","entryHash":"ebe9f1c54a104dad6b202e9b4d1f7979c12c2a6253277a86558a479c2ce6955a","category":"Environment"}
