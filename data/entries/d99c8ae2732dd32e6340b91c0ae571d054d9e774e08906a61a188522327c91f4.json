{"title":"An experimental exploration of modified basin solar still performance through integration of flat plate collector and built condenser","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14493?af=R","date":1728975954000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study experimentally investigates the integration of a flat plate solar collector and a condensation chamber into a basin solar still. Three prototypes were designed and constructed for evaluation: a basin solar still coupled to both a solar collector and a condensation chamber, a basin coupled with a solar collector, and a simple basin solar still as a reference. The experiments, conducted from July 24 to 28, 2016, at the UDES site in Bouismail, Algeria, used seawater from the Fouka region. Solar radiation emerged as the primary influencer on the solar desalination system, with active solar stills, particularly those equipped with a flat plate collector, showing significant temperature increases. Daily cumulative production analysis revealed the condensation chamber as a significant contributor, representing 58% of total production. Incorporating a flat plate collector resulted in a 110% increase in daily production compared to the conventional solar still. Simultaneously incorporating both the flat plate collector and the condensation chamber showcased an impressive 176% increase in daily production. Daily production quantified at 5.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the active with a condensation chamber, 4.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the active solar still, and 2.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the simple solar still. Economic analysis indicated that the active solar still with the condensation chamber enables more cost-effective freshwater production than the active solar still alone. Water analyses demonstrated the efficiency of solar distillation, converting high-salinity saltwater (31.4%) into exceptionally pure distillate (0.00%).</p>","author":"Rabah Kerfah, \nFerhat Kamel Benabdelaziz, \nZahia Tigrine, \nOussama Hamrat","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"d99c8ae2732dd32e6340b91c0ae571d054d9e774e08906a61a188522327c91f4","category":"Environment"}
