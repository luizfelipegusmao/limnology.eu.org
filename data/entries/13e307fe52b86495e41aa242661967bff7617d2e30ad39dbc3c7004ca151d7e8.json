{"title":"Pest Elaterids of North America: New Insights and Opportunities for Management","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-120220-123249?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>The larval stages of click beetle (Coleoptera: Elateridae) species, several of which are serious agricultural pests, are called wireworms. Their cryptic subterranean habitat, resilience, among-species differences in ecology and biology, and broad host range, as well as the lack of objective economic injury thresholds, have rendered wireworms a challenging pest complex to control. Significant progress has been made in recent years, introducing a new effective class of insecticides and improving species identification and our understanding of species-specific phenology, chemical ecology (i.e., adult sex pheromones and larval olfactory cues), and abiotic and biotic factors influencing the efficacy of biological control agents. These new developments have created opportunities for further research into improving our risk assessment, monitoring, and integrated pest management capabilities.</p></div>","author":"Arash Rashed and Willem G. van Herk","siteTitle":"Annual Reviews: Annual Review of Entomology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7a213ec7b64ebddde52fd1163df325e740564b5ca434e1b9e961510d51a3f261","entryHash":"13e307fe52b86495e41aa242661967bff7617d2e30ad39dbc3c7004ca151d7e8","category":"Environment"}
