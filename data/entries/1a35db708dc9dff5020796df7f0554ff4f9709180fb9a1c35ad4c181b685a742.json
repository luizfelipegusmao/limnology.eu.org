{"title":"Exploring the Role of CBX3 as Potential Therapeutic Target in Lung Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2421/v1","date":1722328921000,"content":"Epigenetic changes regulate gene expression through histone modifications, chromatin remod-eling and proteins interpreter of these modifications. The PRC1 and PRC2 complexes shape gene repression via histone modifications. Specifically, the CBX protein family aids PRC1 recruitment to chromatin, impacting the progressive multistep process driving chromatin silencing. Among family members, CBX3 is a complex protein involved in aberrant epigenetic mechanisms that drive lung cancer progression. CBX3 promotes lung tumorigenesis by interacting with key pathways such as PI3K/AKT, Ras/KRAS, Wnt/Î²-catenin, MAPK, Notch, and p53, leading to in-creased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and enhanced resistance to therapy. Given our current lack of knowledge, additional research is required to uncover the intricate mechanisms underlying CBX3 activity, as well as its involvement in molecular pathways and its potential biomarker evaluation. Specifically, the dissimilar roles of CBX3 could be reexamined in order to gain a greater insight into lung cancer pathogenesis. This review aims to provide a clear overview of the context-related molecular profile of CBX3, which could be useful for addressing clinical challenges and developing novel targeted therapies based on personalized medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a35db708dc9dff5020796df7f0554ff4f9709180fb9a1c35ad4c181b685a742","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
