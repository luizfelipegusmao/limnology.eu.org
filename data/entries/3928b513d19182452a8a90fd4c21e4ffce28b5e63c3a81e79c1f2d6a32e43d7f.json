{"title":"A Multi Mediation Analysis of Risk Factors for Non-suicidal Self-Injury among South African Adolescents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0670/v1","date":1725882743000,"content":"Available research findings suggest that non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) constitutes an important public health issue, with identified risk factors for NSSI having been found to include exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and comorbidity with various mental disorders. However, available findings have, to the large part, been based on the experiences of individuals living in high-income countries, and it is not clear whether these findings can be confidently generalized to individuals living in low-resourced countries. As such, this cross-sectional study assessed risk factors for NSSI in a non-clinical sample of 636 South African adolescents (12-18-years-old), with data being analysed using a multi mediation analysis. ACEs were assessed  using a revised version of the ACEs Questionnaire, NSSI was assessed using items adapted from the Self-Harm subscale of the Risk-Taking and Self-Harm Inventory for Adolescents, with emotion dysregulation, depression and PTSD being considered as possible mediators. High prevalence rates for NSSI and exposure to five or more ACEs were reported by participants, with the mediation analysis indicating that significant direct effects of adverse childhood experiences on NSSI were partially mediated by emotion dysregulation.  These findings are discussed with respect to their implications for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3928b513d19182452a8a90fd4c21e4ffce28b5e63c3a81e79c1f2d6a32e43d7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
