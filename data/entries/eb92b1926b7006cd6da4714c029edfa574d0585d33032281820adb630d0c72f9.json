{"title":"Late Pleistocene to Holocene vegetation changes in southeastern Patagonia (49° S): landscape changes related to disturbances","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3638?af=R","date":1723011794000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Southeastern Patagonia's (49° S) post-glacial history inferred from high Andean lake sediments provides new insights regarding Late Pleistocene and Holocene vegetation dynamics at the eastern margin of the Southern Patagonian Icefield. The fossil records of pollen, charcoal and geochemical data from tephra layers from Laguna Chiquita and Laguna Gemelas Este were analysed to reveal past landscape dynamics related to vegetation changes, fire and volcanic events from <i>ca</i>. 15 200 cal a \n<span>bp</span> to the present. <i>Nothofagus</i> forest expanded over shrubland communities sometime between 15 200 and 4600 cal a \n<span>bp</span>, along with at least three disturbance sources related to the volcanic eruptions of Lautaro, Aguilera and Hudson, important local fire episodes, and neoglacial advances. Major charcoal deposition reveals moderate fire activity during the Late Pleistocene related to an open landscape characterised by a grass/shrub steppe. Local glacier advances may have affected the Laguna Gemelas Este sedimentation. Tephra deposition events do not correlate to vegetation changes inferred from the Laguna Gemelas Este and Laguna Chiquita pollen records. Late Holocene eastern Andean forest changes and fire activity at 49° S match other southern palaeoenvironmental records (50–52° S) suggesting that changes in the Southern Westerly Wind latitudinal position and intensity drove major palaeovegetation and fire dynamics before the European settlement. In the last centuries, fire and vegetation changes have been closely related to an increase in local ignition sources and the introduction of alien species.</p>","author":"Víctor Merino‐Campos, \nGonzalo David Sottile, \nMaría Eugenia de Porras, \nMarcela Sandra Tonello","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Quaternary Science: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e4cb264adfd99de4695eda5f992d61d2819971c444b4237b1e7b12202742678e","entryHash":"eb92b1926b7006cd6da4714c029edfa574d0585d33032281820adb630d0c72f9","category":"Environment"}
