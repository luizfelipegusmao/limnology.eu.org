{"title":"Targeted Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis: a Case for Antigen-specific Tregs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0325/v1","date":1712213280000,"content":"Multiple sclerosis is an autoinflammatory condition that results in damage of myelinated neurons in affected patients. While disease-modifying treatments have been successful in slowing the progression of relapsing remittent disease, most patients still progress to secondary progressive disease that is largely unresponsive to disease-modifying treatments. Similarly, there is currently no effective treatment for patients with primary progressive MS. Innate and adaptive immune cells in the CNS play a critical role in initiating an autoimmune attack and in maintaining the chronic inflammation that drives disease progression. In this review, we will focus on recent insights into the role of T cells with regulatory function in suppressing the progression of MS, and, more importantly, in promoting the remyelination and repair of MS lesions in the CNS. We will discuss the exciting opportunity to genetically reprogram regulatory T cells to achieve immune suppression and enhance repair locally at sites of tissue damage, while retaining a fully competent immune system outside the CNS. In the future, reprogramed regulatory T cells with defined specificity and function may provide life medicines that can persist in patients and achieve lasting disease suppression after one cycle of treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36021c46ff6306b4bdc40e10ca0a54adc105fda79ce8cada5fc1092b32584040","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
