{"title":"Inertial Energy Storage Integration with Wind Power Generation by Transgenerator-Flywheel Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0536/v1","date":1718004473000,"content":"This paper designed a new type of generator, transgenerator, that integrates the wind turbine and flywheel into one system, aiming to make the flywheel distributed energy storage (FDES) more modular and scalable than the conventional FDES. The transgenerator is a three-member dual-mechanical-port (DMP) machine with two rotating members (inner and outer rotors) and one stationary member (stator). The transgenerator-flywheel system is introduced with the system configuration, transgenerator overview, flywheel operation principle and power management strategies, and control system. Simulations are performed in MATLAB/ Simulink to verify the system viability, including control system verification and the flywheel storage performance evaluation. Results show that the inner and outer rotors can be controlled independently with accurate and fast control response, and the grid-side control works properly. The flywheel performs well with considerable charging power and storage capacity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"291da84c5bf8bb19cef6e388ab7a0262539602a194efb0bdbf6512e6e1b15e25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
