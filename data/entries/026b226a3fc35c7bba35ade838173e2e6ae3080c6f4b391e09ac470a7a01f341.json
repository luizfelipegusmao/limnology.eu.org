{"title":"305 Factors influencing palatability of wet cat food","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/119/7757404?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Mouthfeel and piece shape are important to feline palatability preference; however, the impact of these attributes on wet pet food palatability has not yet been well established. Moreover, food acceptance is a primary decision factor for cat parents while flavor, ingredients, and brand are key selection contributors when buying wet cat food. The objective of this study was to evaluate consumption preference of adult cats for different formats of wet pet foods. Formulations were created in a commercial pet food manufacturing facility and included five product formats: paté, minced, shreds, standard cuts in gravy, and flaked. The primary protein source was chicken, and equivalent ingredients were used to maintain format as the variable. Pairs of formats were fed in a series of two-bowl feeding studies (n = 9). Each feeding panel (n = 20 cats) was fed for 3 d with bowls presented for 2 h. Bowl position was reversed daily, and both bowls were removed if one format was fully consumed before 2 h elapsed. Significance was determined at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. Paté performed at parity (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) to minced, standard cuts in gravy, and flaked formats. Similarly, both the minced and the standard cuts in gravy format performed at parity (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) to flaked or shreds format, respectively. The overall consumption ratio of shreds was significantly greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) as compared with the paté (1.85:1) and the minced (1.67:1) format. Similarly, minced was significantly preferred (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) to the standard cuts in gravy format (2.07:1). Interestingly, a subsequent feeding study demonstrated that cats consumed a significantly greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) ratio of a minced format containing 4% extra gravy (46% minced:54% gravy) as compared with a typical minced with gravy format (50% minced:50% gravy; 1.93:1). In conclusion, these data suggest shreds or minced formats with additional gravy could lead to enhanced palatability of wet pet food for cats. This presentation will further investigate how various factors such as processing conditions, nutrient composition, palatants, ingredient selection, and freshness influence the palatability of wet cat food.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"026b226a3fc35c7bba35ade838173e2e6ae3080c6f4b391e09ac470a7a01f341","category":"Environment"}
