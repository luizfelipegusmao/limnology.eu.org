{"title":"Innovative Assessment of Mun River Flow Components through ANN and Isotopic End-Member Mixing Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1843/v1","date":1711704388000,"content":"This study innovatively assesses the Mun River flow components in Thailand, integrating Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Isotopic (18O) End-Member Mixing Analysis (IEMMA). It quantifies the contributions of the Upper Mun River (UMR) and Chi River (CR) to the overall flow, revealing a discrepancy in their estimated contributions. ANN predicts the UMR and CR contribute approximately 70.1% and 29.5% respectively, while IEMMA indicates a more pronounced disparity with 84% from UMR and 16% from CR. This divergence highlights the distinct perspectives of ANN, focusing on hydrological data patterns, and IEMMA, emphasizing isotopic signatures. Despite discrepancies, both methods validate UMR as a significant contributor to the overall flow, highlighting their utility in hydrological research. The findings underscore the complexity of river systems and advocate for an integrated approach of river flow analysis for a comprehensive understanding, crucial for effective water resource management and planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"989947ea9d9eacebe55968750a693547dba2eaa67dc17758daffc1eae58bfda0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
