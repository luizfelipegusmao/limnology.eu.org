Minimal sleep interruption related to newborn care is normally expected, insomnia, however has negative impact during the postpartum period. Although its causes and contributing factors are poorly understood, it has a wide-ranging impact on the mother and her infant. So far, studies in Ethiopia have focused on the general community, neglecting mothers in the postpartum period. Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of insomnia and the factors associated with it. A community-based cross-sectional study included 451 study participants who were chosen using a simple random sampling technique. A structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. After entering the data into EpiData version 3.1, it was exported to the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 26 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were carried out. Variables with a P-value of 0.2 in the bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable analyses. Those with a P-value of 0.05 were declared statistically significant in the final model. The current study included 444 mothers in total. Insomnia was prevalent among 23.2% (95% CI: 19.3%, 27.4%) of mothers who had given birth within the previous 12 months. Insomnia was associated with unplanned index pregnancy [AOR = 4.4, 95% CI (2.2, 8.7)], alcohol consumption [AOR = 3.0, 95% CI (1.4, 6.5), low social support [AOR = 9.7, 95% CI (4.4, 21.1)], medium social support [AOR = 2.2, 95% CI (1.1, 4.3)] and depression [AOR = 10.7, 95% CI (5.7, 20.0). A planned index pregnancy, abstaining from alcohol, and recognizing and treating postpartum depression were all advised.","author":"Mesfin Difer Tetema","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"55211aaf10c1b3b4a20d0e0ac6ebb0d7ef973dc34311b1cb9a51c513cf199a2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
