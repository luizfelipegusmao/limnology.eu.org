The related dynamical problem results to be then exactly solvable both in the time-independent and in the time-dependent case. Basing on the formal, general form of the related time evolution operator, the time-dependence of the level of entanglement of some initial conditions is studied within both the Rabi and the Landau-Majorana-St√ºckelber-Zener scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19692cafba638a76ea6bbe7a6606c2818ee81a759bce4cf3ced625a3a815329e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
