{"title":"Using palm oil residue for food nutrition and quality: from palm fatty acid distillate to vitamin E toward sustainability","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13878?af=R","date":1726050819000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Increasing global palm oil production yields a valuable palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) – a rich vitamin E (Vit-E) source and multifunctional ingredient in the food agro-industry – that can be utilized to achieve sustainability. This article reviews trends in the use and role of PFAD and its Vit-E in the food sector and proposes an integrated agro-industrial concept toward sustainability. Vit-E can be separated from PFAD with diverse and impactful pharmaceutical activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and anti-ultraviolet effects. Based on <i>in vivo</i> experimental tests, PFAD and Vit-E supplementation can enhance the productivity and quality of livestock-based food products. PFAD is a plasticizer and antistatic packaging material in food packaging systems, and its derivatives can be used as food additives. Meanwhile, the Vit-E molecule in packaging can extend food shelf life by maintaining color stability, reducing lipid oxidation and rancidity, adding antimicrobial properties, and influencing changes in packaging properties such as water vapor, tensile strength, melting point and other physical properties. Toward sustainability, an integrated agro-industrial design has been proposed to implement clean production, increase the added value of palm oil industry residues, minimize environmental risks and increase profits to achieve long-term social welfare. In conclusion, PFAD residues and their Vit-E content have shown broad benefits in the food sector and prospects toward sustainability. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Angga Pramana, \nDihan Kurnia, \nAfrinal Firmanda, \nEvy Rossi, \nNur Hasnah AR, \nVivin Jenika Putri","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"2c158b016778cf13944483100cb6fcdd3315eb4eb24873c6f420450cbac3fdab","category":"Environment"}
