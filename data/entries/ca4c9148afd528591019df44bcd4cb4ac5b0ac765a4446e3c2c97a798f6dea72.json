{"title":"Title Influence of Newborns Characteristics on Postpartum Depression: The Impact of Birth Season and Male Gender in a Romanian Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0434/v1","date":1722953407000,"content":"Background and Objective: Although possible risk factors associated with maternal\npostpartum depression (PPD) have been elucidated, it is still unknown how some newborns\ncharacteristics could influence the appearance of PPD. Our research aimed to unravel the\nimpact of newbornâ€™s characteristics on PPD. Methods: The study was conducted in the\nObstetrics &amp;amp; Gynecology Department, from our University Emergency County Hospital, between\nAugust 2019 and April 2021. We included women in the 2 nd day of the postpartum period\n(n=904), divided into 2 groups: women with PPD (n=236) and control (women without PPD,\nn=668), by using the Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale. Characteristic information on\nnewborns (i.e., the months in which they were born, premature delivery, birth weight, or gender)\nwere assessed. Results: Our findings suggest that the winter season (i.e. December and January,\np=0.01) births and male newborns (p=0.02) were associated with the appearance of depressive\nsymptoms during postpartum. Conclusions: Therefore, our study showed that women who give\nbirth to male newborns in winter are likely to develop PPD. This should be considered by all public\nhealth systems in order to prevent such manifestations in certain groups of women.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca4c9148afd528591019df44bcd4cb4ac5b0ac765a4446e3c2c97a798f6dea72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
