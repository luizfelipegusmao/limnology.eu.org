{"title":"Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of chikungunya virus among dengue-negative patients in Kolkata, India","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301644","date":1712239200000,"content":"<p>by Rajendra Prasad Chatterjee, Aroni Chatterjee, Sabbir Ansari, Shilpa Chatterjee, Shyamalendu Chatterjee, Nilanjan Chakraborty</p>\r\n\r\nDengue and chikungunya are co-circulating vector-borne diseases that share a significant number of clinical symptoms. To identify variables to aid physicians in making rapid and effective diagnostic decisions, we performed molecular diagnosis of the chikungunya virus and examined the clinical manifestations of chikungunya cases to identify the prevalence among dengue-negative individuals in Kolkata. Dengue suspected patients’ samples were collected during January 2020—December 2021 and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods have been performed to confirm the prevalence of chikungunya infection among dengue-negative patients. By performing phylogenetic analysis, comparing clinical classifications, identifying disease aetiology using clinical and laboratory factors, and evaluating the time course of several clinical variables, we have evaluated the clinical manifestations linked to dengue and chikungunya virus infections. Chikungunya infection was found in 15.1% and 6.3% of the 635 dengue-negative patients, as determined by ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Arthritis and myalgia were more common in chikungunya-infected patients at the time of hospital admission while conjunctivitis, photosensitivity, arthralgia, Anorexia, fatigue, retro-orbital pain, vomiting, dermatitis, or swollen glands were significantly presented as an overlapping symptom. Although dengue and chikungunya infections have significant clinical overlap, basic clinical and laboratory criteria can predict these diseases at presentation for proper management. Effective management enables doctors to treat and care for patients properly and contributes to the development of control measures for these infections in a medical setting.","author":"Rajendra Prasad Chatterjee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"df2909fec7d4257bc02a45501025cbbd778d0a37fba0548728f5458647a56981","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
