{"title":"Collatz Conjecture Proof and General Equation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0778/v1","date":1712812076000,"content":"A proof is given showing the Collatz Conjecture is true for all positive integers. The proof was possible once the perspective of the proof was changed from looking at the pattern of the positive integers to looking at the conjecture rules. The conjecture rule for even numbers organizes all positive integers into unique sets and the rule for odd numbers interconnects the unique sets into dendritic pathways to “1.” Infinite loops, other than the minor 4-2-1 loop after reaching “1,” and pathways to infinity are shown to be mathematically impossible. The proof predicted a general equation that shows all positive integers ultimately reach a final value of “1,\" and calculates the values and locations of the odd positive integers during the iterations for each tested positive integer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21ae960c63ece1b9f2c2c2eacc017f346b70add7e1d96809a81327fcfb7b2460","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
