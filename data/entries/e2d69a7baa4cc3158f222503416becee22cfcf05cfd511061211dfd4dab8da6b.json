{"title":"Ellagic acid protects against angiotensin II‐induced hypertrophic responses through ROS‐mediated MAPK pathway in H9c2 cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24170?af=R","date":1707986354000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The early myocardial response of hypertension is an elevation of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) concentration, leading to heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy. This hypertrophic event of the heart is mediated by the interaction of Ang type 1 receptors (AT-R1), thereby modulating NADPH oxidase activity in cardiomyocytes, which alters redox status in cardiomyocytes. Ellagic acid (EA) has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative capacities. Thus, EA has potential preventive effects on cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. In the last decades, because the protective effect of EA on Ang-II-induced hypertrophic responses is unclear, this study aims to investigate the protective effect of EA in cardiomyocytes. H9c2 cells were treated to Ang-II 1 μM for 24 h to induce cellular damage. We found that EA protected against Ang-II-increased cell surface area and pro-hypertrophic gene expression in H9c2. EA reduced Ang-II-caused AT-R1 upregulation, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress NADPH oxidase activation. EA mitigated Ang-II-enhanced p38 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Moreover, EA treatment under Ang-II stimulation also reversed NF-κB activity and iNOS expression. This study shows that EA protects against Ang-II-induced myocardial hypertrophy and attenuates oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in H9c2 cells. Thus, EA may be an effective compound for preventing Ang-II-induced myocardial hypertrophy.</p>","author":"Ya‐Che Lee, \nYeong‐Chin Jou, \nWan‐Ching Chou, \nKun‐Ling Tsai, \nCheng‐Huang Shen, \nShin‐Da Lee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"e2d69a7baa4cc3158f222503416becee22cfcf05cfd511061211dfd4dab8da6b","category":"Environment"}
