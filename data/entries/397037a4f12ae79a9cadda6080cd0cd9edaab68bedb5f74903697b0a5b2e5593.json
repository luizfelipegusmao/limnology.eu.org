{"title":"Socio-demographic disparities in the familiarity with coastal climate adaptation strategies: implications for coastal management and climate justice","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11069-024-06940-3","date":1728345600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Public preferences for coastal climate adaptation strategies have been increasingly documented in the face of climate change and sea-level rise in coastal regions worldwide. However, empirical evidence of whether the public is familiar with these strategies remains unclear. In this study, we conducted an online survey among residents in three coastal counties in Southeast Florida, the United States to elicit households’ familiarity with different coastal climate adaptation strategies and examine the socio-demographic disparities. Using a multinomial logit model, we find that although most respondents are familiar with coastal climate adaptation strategies, socio-demographic disparities in the level of familiarity are evident. Specifically, Black respondents are significantly less likely to be familiar with coastal climate adaptation strategies when compared to their White counterparts. Moreover, having college degrees or more advanced degrees significantly increases the respondents’ probability of being very familiar with these strategies. Respondents’ risk perception and their awareness of current flood risk also significantly influence their familiarity with coastal climate adaptation strategies. Since adaptive planning often overlooks equitable access, and local support is essential for implementing climate adaptation strategies, our results can provide insightful policy implications for coastal management. A lack of familiarity with coastal climate adaptation strategies among marginalized and vulnerable populations can lead to insufficient support for these strategies aimed at mitigating climate risks, exacerbating the issue of climate justice.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"397037a4f12ae79a9cadda6080cd0cd9edaab68bedb5f74903697b0a5b2e5593","category":"Environment"}
