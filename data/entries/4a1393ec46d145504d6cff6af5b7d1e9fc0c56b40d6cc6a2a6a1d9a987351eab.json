Patterns of genetic diversity and natural population structure in the target species were investigated to gain a better understanding of its evolutionary history. Samples were collected from five sites across the Indonesian Archipelago. We characterized sequence variation in an mtDNA control region fragment in 249 individuals. The genetic diversity (<i>h</i> = ranging from 0.83 to 0.92) and nucleotide diversity (<i>π</i> = ranging from 0.24 to 0.32) were low compared to the estimates reported for many other similar shellfish taxa. Nonetheless, analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic differentiation, <i>F</i>\n<sub>ST</sub> = 0.0203 (<i>p</i> &lt; .005 after Bonferroni corrections). Furthermore, both Pairwise fixation index values showed significance among majority population sites, indicating that dispersal potential and gene flow were low in the past. This pattern likely reflects a low dispersal potential, potentially allowing local adaptation to sites that augment any oceanographic and geographic contribution to genetic structure. The results described herein provide a foundation for developing better conservation strategies for the target species in the future.</p>","author":"Eko Hardianto, \nDiah Permata Wijayanti, \nHideyuki Imai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"4a1393ec46d145504d6cff6af5b7d1e9fc0c56b40d6cc6a2a6a1d9a987351eab","category":"Environment"}
