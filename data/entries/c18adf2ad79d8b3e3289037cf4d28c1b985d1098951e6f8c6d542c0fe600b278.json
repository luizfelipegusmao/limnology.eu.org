{"title":"Applications of HPLC-ICP-MS in the Analysis of Chemical Warfare Agents and Other Highly Toxic Compounds in Environmental Samples","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1552/v1","date":1721379508000,"content":"The analysis of chemical warfare agents and their degradation products has become increasingly important for public and military safety in recent years. In the article, we drew attention to the possibilities of the HPLC-ICP-MS analytical technique, which has been relatively rarely used for identifying and quantitatively analyzing highly toxic and hazardous substances in environmental samples. This technique enables the identification and determination of minimal amounts (ppt range) of chemicals in various matrices. This fact is important for the analysis of chemical warfare agents and other highly harmful compounds, even small amounts of which can have serious consequences for living organisms. The article critically analyzes the results of scientific research on the identification and quantitative analysis of extremely toxic organophosphorus, organosulfur and organoarsenic substances, their derivatives and degradation products using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c18adf2ad79d8b3e3289037cf4d28c1b985d1098951e6f8c6d542c0fe600b278","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
