{"title":"Increased force and elastic energy storage are not the mechanisms that improve jump performance with accentuated eccentric loading during a constrained vertical jump","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308226","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Eric Yung-Sheng Su, Timothy J. Carroll, Dominic J. Farris, Glen Lichtwark</p>\r\n\r\nAccentuated eccentric loading (AEL) involves higher load applied during the eccentric phase of a stretch-shortening cycle movement, followed by a sudden removal of load before the concentric phase. Previous studies suggest that AEL enhances human countermovement jump performance, however the mechanism is not fully understood. Here we explore whether isolating additional load during the countermovement is sufficient to increase ground reaction force, and hence elastic energy stored, at the start of the upward movement and whether this leads to increased jump height or power generation. We conducted a trunk-constrained vertical jump test on a custom-built device to isolate the effect of additional load while controlling for effects of squat depth, arm swing, and coordination. Twelve healthy, recreationally active adults (7 males, 5 females) performed maximal jumps without AEL, followed by randomised AEL conditions prescribed as a percentage of body mass (10%, 20%, and 30%), before repeating jumps without AEL. No significant changes in vertical ground reaction force at the turning point were observed. High load AEL conditions (20% and 30% body weight) led to slight reductions in jump height, primarily due to decreased hip joint and centre of mass work. AEL conditions did not alter peak or integrated activation levels of the knee extensor muscles. The constrained movement task used here, which excluded potential contributions of trunk motion, arm swing, rate of descent, squat depth, and point of load application, allows the conclusion that increased elastic energy return is not the primary mechanism for potentiating effects of AEL on jump performance.","author":"Eric Yung-Sheng Su","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c406ac9be4a2bec6b1c6b2e938bed23b8d56878ec1fdf1d1de3da29fcabe9507","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
