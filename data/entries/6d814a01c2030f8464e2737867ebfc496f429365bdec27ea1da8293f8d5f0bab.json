{"title":"Tryptophan Metabolism in Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1529/v1","date":1716460631000,"content":"Tryptophan, an essential amino acid in mammals obtained from the diet, is influenced by maternal diet, which impacts early life and development of offspring. This is studied under the Developmental Origins of Diseases and Health (DOHaD) concept, so factors from conception to early childhood affect health and disease susceptibility. Tryptophan is metabolized mainly through two pathways: serotonin (5-HT) and kynurenine. The kynurenine pathway, active in the brain, gut, liver, and placenta, breaks down over 95% of tryptophan and plays roles in inflammation, neurotransmission, immune responses, and immune modulation during pregnancy. The serotonin pathway uses up to 5% of Tryptophan, mainly in the gut, adipose tissues, pancreatic cells, and central nervous system, and regulates responses to environmental changes, including sleep, cognition, and feeding behavior. Key enzymes in these pathways include Trp-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) type1 (IDO1), and type 2 (IDO2) (kynurenine pathway), and tryptophan hydroxylase type 1 (TPH1) and type 2 (TPH2), serotonin pathway. The fetus-placental unit manages tryptophan metabolism. Serotonin and kynurenine are crucial for placental health and fetal development. Serotonin adjusts placental blood volume and aids neurodevelopment. Kynurenine metabolites protect the fetus from maternal immunity and offer initial neuroprotection. At birth, infants switch from placental nutrients to breast milk, rich in tryptophan and protective bioactive molecules. Tryptophan, solely from breast milk, is crucial for infants. Its levels are high in newborns (first three weeks, 2-4 times higher than in adults), gradually declining to adult levels by the fourth week. The highlights the importance of tryptophan for the serotonin and kynurenine pathways in fetuses, newborns and babies applied to the DOHaD concept.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d814a01c2030f8464e2737867ebfc496f429365bdec27ea1da8293f8d5f0bab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
