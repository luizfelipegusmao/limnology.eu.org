An example of such forests is those composed of <i>Quercus</i>, an important genus of woody angiosperms in the montane neotropical forest. The Andean oak, or <i>Quercus humboldtii</i> Bonpl., is the sole member of this genus in South America and a characteristic component of montane ecosystems. Although there are several studies on the ecology and genetic structure of this species, there are few studies on the functional trait diversity among populations. Understanding functional traits can improve our comprehension of how organisms respond to various environmental conditions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate differences in six functional traits in individuals of the Andean oak, in two ontogenetic stages (juveniles and adults) from three populations with contrasting environmental conditions. Additionally, using T-statistics, we assessed the impact of external filters (e.g., climate, resource availability, large-scale biotic interactions) on population assembly. We found a remarkable level of functional differentiation among Andean oak forests, with all traits differing between populations and five traits differing between ontogenetic stages. External filters had a stronger influence in populations with more extreme environmental conditions. These findings emphasize the dynamic and context-dependent nature of functional traits in this species. However, given the limited exploration of functional diversity in Andean oak populations, further studies are needed to inform conservation efforts.","author":"Diana Bonilla","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"abf81c8c92f0e28d77402e18bf364a230db7cb9eb68bf4e9065bb6e7bde31417","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
