{"title":"Papillary Tumor of the Pineal Region Treated with Surgery and Postoperative Radiotherapy; Literature Review and Case Description with Radiation Treatment Volumes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0439/v1","date":1728379052000,"content":"Papillary tumors of the pineal region (PTPR) are extremely rare malignancies usually treated with surgery and adjuvant tumor bed radiotherapy (RT). We present the case of a 69-year-old man diagnosed with PTPR after presenting with two weeks of confusion and ataxia. Imaging the head with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hydrocephalus and a 2 cm pineal region mass. We review the presenting symptoms, investigations, and differential diagnosis for patients with pineal region masses.  The pathological features, including immunohistochemistry, are described with exemplative images.  We report how the patientâ€™s hydrocephalus was managed with medications and neurosurgical interventions, as well as the curative treatment of his tumor with surgery and postoperative tumor bed RT with 54 Gray (Gy) in 30 fractions. We also review the PTPR literature, including prognostic features and the evidence for treatment modalities.   Few publications outline adjuvant radiotherapy planning treatment volumes, which are reported here.  The patient was followed with a brain MRI every three months and is asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrent disease 18 months after surgery. PTPR has very high local recurrence rates following treatment and further research is needed to find more effective interventions and improve patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"affd6aa49123b9e5fcde6a2cf115e8e749bc143284259ef18120ebc5e4d6a1d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
