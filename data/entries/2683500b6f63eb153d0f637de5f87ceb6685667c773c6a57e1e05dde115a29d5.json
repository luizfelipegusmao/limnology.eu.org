{"title":"Association of the rs9896052 Polymorphism Upstream of GRB2 With Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy in Patients With Less Than 10 Years of Diabetes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1967/v1","date":1721818601000,"content":"Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and positive regulator of angiogenesis. Its expression is increased in a mouse model of retinal neovascularization and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This case-control study aimed to investigate the association between the rs9896052 polymorphism (A&gt;C) upstream of GRB2 and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in patients with T2DM from Southern Brazil, taking into consideration self-reported skin color (white or non-white) and the known duration of diabetes (&lt; 10 years or â‰¥ 10 years). Genotypes were determined using real-time PCR in 838 patients with T2DM (284 cases with PDR and 554 controls without DR). In the total study group and in the analysis stratified by skin color, the genotype and allele frequencies were similar between the cases and controls. However, among patients with less than 10 years of diabetes, the C allele was more frequent in cases than in controls (63.3% versus 51.8%, p = 0.032), and the CC genotype was independently associated with an increased risk of PDR (adjusted OR = 2.82, 95% CI 1.17-6.75). In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that the rs9896052 polymorphism near GRB2 is associated with PDR in Brazilian patients with T2DM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2683500b6f63eb153d0f637de5f87ceb6685667c773c6a57e1e05dde115a29d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
