Rojas<br />Flexible Zn–air batteries are typically constrained by sluggish oxygen electrocatalysis and electrochemical interface instability, and their operational range across wide temperatures are resultant restricted. Accordingly, we propose the wide temperature...<br />The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"RSC - Energy Environ.
