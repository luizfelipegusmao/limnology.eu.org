{"title":"Starch phosphorylation regulates starch granule morphological homogeneity in Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2600/7462148?rss=1","date":1701907200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Starch granule morphological homogeneity presents a gap in starch research. Transitory starch granules in wild-type plants are discoid, regardless of species. Notably, while the shape of starch granules can differ among mutants, it typically remains homogeneous within a genotype. We found an <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> mutant, <span>dpe2sex4</span>, lacking both the cytosolic disproportionating enzyme 2 (DPE2) and glucan phosphatase SEX4, showing an unprecedented bimodal starch granule diameter distribution when grown under a light/dark rhythm. <span>dpe2sex4</span> contained 2 types of starch granules: large granules and small granules. In contrast to the double starch initiation in wheat (<span>Triticum aestivum</span>) endosperm, where A-type granules are initiated first and B-type granules are initiated later, <span>dpe2sex4</span> small and large granules developed simultaneously in the same chloroplast. Compared with the large granules, the small granules had more branched amylopectin and less surface starch-phosphate, thus having a more compact structure that may hinder starch synthesis. During plant aging, the small granules barely grew. In in vitro experiments, fewer glucosyl residues were incorporated in small granules. Under continuous light, <span>dpe2sex4</span> starch granules were morphologically homogeneous. Omitting the dark phase after a 2-wk light/dark cycle by moving plants into continuous light also reduced morphological variance between these 2 types of granules. These data shed light on the impact of starch phosphorylation on starch granule morphology homogeneity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e1f9551768e9cef15bb112b25a2069a4190bb382b0eb9996cf0689db92ec4beb","category":"Environment"}
