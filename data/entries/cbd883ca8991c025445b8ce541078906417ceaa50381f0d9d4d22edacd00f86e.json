{"title":"Identifying Potential Therapeutic Targets in Long COVID Related Inflammatory, Coagulation, Mitochondrial, and Oxidative Stress Pathways through In Silico Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0825/v1","date":1723462339000,"content":"Long COVID, characterized by persistent symptoms lasting from weeks to several months following initial infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), significantly impacts individuals' quality of life and poses a potential long-term burden on global healthcare systems. Clinical manifestations of Long COVID are diverse, affecting multiple systems including respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and gastrointestinal. While the precise mechanisms underlying Long COVID remain unclear, emerging evidence suggests involvement of various bodily pathways. This study employs bioinformatics tools to investigate the mechanisms of Long COVID and identify potential drug targets associated with key pathways, including inflammation, cytokines, immune response, coagulation, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and autonomic dysfunction. Tools such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, PubChem, UniProt, and iGEMDOCK were utilized for pathway analysis and molecular docking. The analysis aimed to identify drug molecules that may interact with target proteins to regulate or inhibit pathway activity, yielding several potential drug candidates for further investigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbd883ca8991c025445b8ce541078906417ceaa50381f0d9d4d22edacd00f86e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
