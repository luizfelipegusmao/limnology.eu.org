{"title":"Presepsin in Critical Illness: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2060/v1","date":1717069816000,"content":"The accurate identification of bacterial infections is critical for effective treatment in intensive care units (ICUs), yet current diagnostic methods face limitations in sensitivity and specificity, along-side cost and accessibility issues. Consequently, there's a pressing need for a marker that is economically feasible, rapid, and reliable. Presepsin (PSP), also known as soluble CD14 subtype (sCD14-ST), has emerged as a promising biomarker for early sepsis diagnosis. PSP, derived from soluble CD14, reflects the activation of monocytes/macrophages in response to bacterial infec-tions. It has shown potential as a marker of cellular immune response activation against patho-gens, with plasma concentrations increasing during bacterial infections and decreasing post-antibiotic treatment. Unlike traditional markers such as procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), PSP specifically indicates monocyte/macrophage activation in bacterial infections. While limited studies in critical illness have explored PSP's role in sepsis, its diagnostic accuracy varies with threshold values, impacting sensitivity and specificity. Recent meta-analyses suggest PSP's diagnostic potential for sepsis, yet its standalone effectiveness in ICU infection management remains uncertain. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PSP's utility in ICU set-tings, including its diagnostic accuracy, prognostic value, therapeutic implications, challenges, and future directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a72249bcb26e7fff314e54a02cb95d11b343fa21590950f9e51dcdc2653190b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
