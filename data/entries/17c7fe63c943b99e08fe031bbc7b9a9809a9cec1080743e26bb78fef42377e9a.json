{"title":"Enhanced Vital Parameter Estimation Using Short-Range Radars with Advanced Motion Compensation and Super-Resolution Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0385/v1","date":1725532232000,"content":"Various short-range radars, such as impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) and frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars, are currently employed to monitor vital signs, including respiratory and cardiac rates (RR and CR). However, these methods do not consider the motion of an individual, which can distort the phase of the reflected signal, leading to inaccurate estimation of RR and CR because of a smeared spectrum. Therefore, motion compensation (MOCOM) is crucial for accurately estimating these vital rates. This paper proposes an efficient method incorporating MOCOM to estimate RR and CR with super-resolution accuracy. The proposed method effectively models the radar signal phase and compensates for motion. Additionally, applying the super-resolution technique to RR and CR separately further increases the estimation accuracy. Experimental results from the IR-UWB and FMCW radars demonstrate that the proposed method successfully estimates RR and CR even in the presence of body movement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17c7fe63c943b99e08fe031bbc7b9a9809a9cec1080743e26bb78fef42377e9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
