A constrained phylogeny based on COI barcodes for 604 species was used to analyse 1390 species x elevation occurrences at eight elevational sites separated by 500 m elevation increments. We obtained Nearest Relatedness Index (NRI), Nearest Taxon Index (NTI) and Standardised Effect Size of Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (SES.PD) and regressed these on temperature, plant species richness and predator abundance as key abiotic and biotic predictors. We also quantified beta diversity in the moth communities between elevations using the Phylogenetic Sorensen index. Overall, geometrid communities exhibited phylogenetic clustering, suggesting environmental filters, particularly at higher elevations at and above 2200 m a.s.l and no evidence of overdispersion. NRI, NTI and SES.PD showed no consistent trends with elevation or the studied biotic and abiotic variables. Change in community structure was driven by turnover of phylogenetic beta-diversity, except for the highest 2700–3200 m elevations, which were characterised by nested subsets of lower elevation communities. Overall, the elevational signal of geometrid phylogeny was weak-moderate. Additional insect community phylogeny studies are needed to understand this pattern.","author":"Sentiko Ibalim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"75dc932be95125bd0c9c4e259c6c7da43c806aeef59b89a204507a08c242cb41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
