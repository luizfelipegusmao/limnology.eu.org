{"title":"On Non Commutative Multirings with Involutions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2549/v1","date":1722427900000,"content":"The primary motivation for this work is to develop the concept of Marshall's quotient (\\cite{ribeiro2016functorial}) applicable to non-commutative multirings endowed with involution, expanding the main ideas of the classical (= commutative, without involution) case presented in Marshall's seminal paper \\cite{marshall2006real}. We define two multiplicative properties to deal with the involutive case and characterize their Marshall quotient. Besides, this article presents various cases showing that the ''multi'' version of rings with involution offers many examples, applications, and relatives in (multi) algebraic structures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9363d95f9d1e4a6e0fdd441ad8abef5be062c9cffd49965c3f01882d520432ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
