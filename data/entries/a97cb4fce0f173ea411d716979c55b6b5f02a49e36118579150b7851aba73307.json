{"title":"Luminescent Materials for Dye-sensitized Solar Cells: Advances and Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0755/v1","date":1725955798000,"content":"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) belong to the group of thin-film solar cells which have been extensively researched for over two decades due to their low cost of fabrication, flexibility and ability to function under low-light conditions. Some issues have to be addressed in terms of energy losses, material integration, weak photocurrent generation and stability to improve the performance of DSSCs. One of the approaches to enhance the performance of DSSCs is through luminescent materials. These are materials which can absorb light and re-emit at different wavelengths which can be used to convert ultraviolet (UV) and near infra-red (NIR) light that are not efficiently utilized by the DSSCs, into visible light that can be absorbed. The main objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive review on the impact of luminescent materials in DSSCs. Research interest in luminescent materials particularly, down conversion, up conversion and quantum dots were analyzed from the “Web of Science”. It reflected a remarkable number of over 200, 000 publications in the past decade. Therefore, the state of the art of luminescent materials for enhancing the performance of the solar cells were reviewed, which showed significant potential in enhancing the performance of DSSCs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a97cb4fce0f173ea411d716979c55b6b5f02a49e36118579150b7851aba73307","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
