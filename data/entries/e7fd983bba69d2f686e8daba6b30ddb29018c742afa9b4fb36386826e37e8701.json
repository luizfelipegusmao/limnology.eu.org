{"title":"Production and characterization of anti‐hypertensive and anti‐diabetic peptides from fermented sheep milk with anti‐inflammatory activity: in vitro and molecular docking studies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13617?af=R","date":1718016440000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic activities from biologically active peptides produced by fermented sheep milk with <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> M11 (MG027695), as well as to purify and characterize the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and anti-diabetic peptides produced from fermented sheep milk.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>After 48 h of fermentation at 37 °C, sheep milk demonstrated significant changes in anti-diabetic effects and ACE-I effects, with inhibition percentages observed for ACE inhibition (76.32%), α-amylase (70.13%), α-glucosidase (70.11%) and lipase inhibition (68.22%). The highest level of peptides (9.77 mg mL<sup>–1</sup>) was produced by optimizing the growth conditions, which included an inoculation rate of 2.5% and a 48 h of incubation period. The comparison of molecular weight distributions among protein fractions was conducted through sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, whereas spots were separated using 2D gel electrophoresis according to both the molecular weight and pH. Peptide characterization with ultra-filtration membranes at 3 and 10 kDa allowed the study to assess molecular weight-based separation. Nitric oxide generated by lipopolysaccharide and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 immune cells were both inhibited by sheep milk fermented with M11. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to assess changes in functional groups after fermentation, providing insights into the structural changes occurring during fermentation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study demonstrates that fermentation with <i>L. paracasei</i> (M11) led to significant changes in fermented sheep milk, enhancing its bioactive properties, notably in terms of ACE inhibition and anti-diabetic activities, and the generation of peptides with bioactive properties has potential health benefits. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Rinkal Pipaliya, \nBethsheba Basaiawmoit, \nAmar A.
