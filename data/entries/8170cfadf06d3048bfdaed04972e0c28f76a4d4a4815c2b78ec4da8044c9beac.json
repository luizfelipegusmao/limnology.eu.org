{"title":"Symbiotic nitrogen fixation reduces belowground biomass carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition under low, but not high, nitrogen availability","link":"https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plae051/7756379?rss=1","date":1726099200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Many plant species form symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Through this symbiosis, plants allocate photosynthate belowground to the bacteria in exchange for nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere. This symbiosis forms an important link between carbon and nitrogen cycles in many ecosystems. However, the economics of this relationship under soil nitrogen availability gradients is not well understood, as plant investment toward symbiotic nitrogen fixation tends to decrease with increasing soil nitrogen availability. Here, we used a manipulation experiment to examine how costs of nitrogen acquisition vary under a factorial combination of soil nitrogen availability and inoculation with <span>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</span> in <span>Glycine max</span> L. (Merr.). We found that inoculation decreased belowground biomass carbon costs to acquire nitrogen and increased total leaf area and total biomass, but these patterns were only observed under low fertilization and were the result of increased plant nitrogen uptake and no change in belowground carbon allocation. These results suggest that symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria reduce carbon costs of nitrogen acquisition by increasing plant nitrogen uptake, but only when soil nitrogen is low, allowing individuals to increase nitrogen allocation to structures that support aboveground growth. This pattern may help explain the prevalence of plants capable of forming these associations in less fertile soils and provides useful insight into understanding the role of nutrient acquisition strategy on plant nitrogen uptake across nitrogen availability gradients.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"AoB PLANTS Current Issue","siteHash":"8840dd5ab55c091f7de845d03e42c474dbe2d076eb4181d88cf52a09aca2b17e","entryHash":"8170cfadf06d3048bfdaed04972e0c28f76a4d4a4815c2b78ec4da8044c9beac","category":"Environment"}
