{"title":"Optimisation and Standardisation of the Extraction Method of Balanites aegyptiaca Del. Seeds (Zygophyllaceae) Used to Formulate a Phytomedicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0773/v1","date":1723448261000,"content":"Balanites aegyptiaca del. (Zygophyllaceae) is widely used in traditional medicine, both human and veterinary, throughout Africa for its many properties, including antiparasitic properties. This experimental study aims to optimise the extraction conditions of the seeds of Balanites aegyptiaca del. Aqueous maceration was carried out with mass to volume ratios of 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% and 5% and extraction times of 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours. Extraction yields, phytochemical screening, saponins assay, antioxidant activities (ABTS and FRAP) and antiparasitic tests on Heligmosomoides bakeri were used to compare the different extracts. The pharmaco-chemical study generally showed that aqueous maceration gave the best results, with a mass/volume ratio of 10% after 12 hours of maceration. The yield obtained was 28.03% with a saponins content of 13.81 mg/g. The antioxidant activities were 4.25 ± 0.17µg/mL by the ABTS method and 0.739µg/mL by the FRAP method. The larvicidal activity also showed that the 10%12h extract produced 100% larval mortality from 25ug/mL. These data provide a basis for guiding the choice of extraction process parameters in producing this antiparasitic phytomedicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e28327286f0da60c1839f6c702ad36c1e7810a1368a4090741bdb94f3f24053f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
