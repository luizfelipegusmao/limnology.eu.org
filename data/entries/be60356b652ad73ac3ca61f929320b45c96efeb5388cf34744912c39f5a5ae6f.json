{"title":"Lipase B Immobilized Silica-coated Magnetic Nanoparticles for Rapid Hydrolysis, Acylation, and Lipolysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0671/v1","date":1723198318000,"content":"This study reports rapid hydrolysis, acylation, and lipolysis with lipase B from Candida antarctica (CalB) and nanofructosome encapsulated CalB (CalB@NF) enzymes immobilized on silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (Si-MNPs). Enzymatic hydrolysis was confirmed for conversion to p-nitrophenol (p-NP, λex=400 nm) from p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB, λex=270 nm), and various catalytic parameters such as Km, Vmax, and Kcat were calculated from Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plot. Efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis was in the order of CalB &gt; Si-MNPs@CalB &gt; CalB@NF &gt; Si-MNPs@CalB@NF, and reusability was much better with the enzyme immobilized on Si-MNPs than with the native enzyme. Enzymatic acylation was confirmed by the formation of benzyl benzoate (λex=229 nm) from benzoic anhydride (λex=240 nm), and efficiency exceeded 99% in all samples. Finally, enzymatic lipolysis was confirmed by the decomposition of olive oil to fatty acid such as oleic acid (λex=230 nm) using thin-layer chromatography (TLC), column chromatography, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H -NMR). The lipases immobilized on Si-MNPs have the advantage of good thermal stability and reusability and are thus applicable to a wide range of industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be60356b652ad73ac3ca61f929320b45c96efeb5388cf34744912c39f5a5ae6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
