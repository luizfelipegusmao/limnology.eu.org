{"title":"Synergistic Enhancement of Maize Crop Yield and Nutrient Assimilation via ZnO Nanoparticles and Phosphorus Fertilization","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13500?af=R","date":1711726999000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Low recovery of conventional fertilizers remains a significant bottleneck for maize production globally. Particularly, with phosphate fertilization, zinc is prone to precipitation in soil reducing recovery of both phosphorus and zinc by maize.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The present study designed to investigate the synergistic effect of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and phosphorus (P) on maize crop growth, yield, and nutrient uptake under ZnO seed coating and foliar application in Randomized Completely Block Design (RCBD). However, plants were subjected to two ZnO NPs levels including 0.5 and 12 Kg ha<sup>-1</sup> amended with two P levels 45 and 90 Kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. ZnO NPs especially in the form of foliar application with P dose 90 Kg ha<sup>-1</sup> significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) improved maize crop growth, yield and nutrient uptake as compared with control. In comparison to the control group, plants grown in these conditions absorbed higher levels of zinc (Zn) and phosphorus (P). Zinc uptake rose to 16.34 g ha<sup>-1</sup>, 137.88 g ha-1, and 166.89 g ha-1 in roots, grains, and stover, respectively. P uptake increased to 0.80 mg kg-1, 10.066 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, and 12.17 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, in the same order. Additionally, seed emergence rate, plant height, and cob length have increased by up to 2%, 1177cm<sup>2</sup>, and 3.3 cm than control, respectively. Furthermore, Zn use efficiency was increased upto 38.55% in ZnO NPs foliar application.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>ZnO NPs 0.5 Kg ha<sup>-1</sup> in the form of foliar application with 90 Kg ha<sup>-1</sup> P dose depicted more pronounced increment in the studied parameters than ZnO NPs seed coating.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
