{"title":"Early Detection of Cervical Adenocarcinoma Using Immunohistochemical Staining Patterns Analyzed through Computer Vision Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2003/v1","date":1724833981000,"content":"This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) in predicting functional recovery in patients with ischemic stroke. As technology advances, ML shows significant potential in the field of stroke medicine, especially in the areas of big data analytics and personalized medicine. Studies have shown that ML algorithms can improve the accuracy of stroke image analysis, subtype classification, risk assessment, treatment guidance, and prognosis prediction. However, the widespread use of ML still faces challenges such as data standardization, model validation, privacy, and bias. This paper reviews the current application status of ML in the field of stroke, discusses the challenges faced, and looks forward to the future development direction, aiming to promote the practical application of ML technology in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke to improve the prognosis and quality of life of patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6bbac3b184d43b3c51698b01acdd2772638483c39ebd584f5ad141d3aa47b30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
