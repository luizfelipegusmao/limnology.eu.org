Straddling the equator and extending to temperate latitudes (at 37°N and 34°S; not including oceanic islands such as Marion and Prince Edward), the continent accommodates a variety of ecosystems and biomes, including tropical and temperate forests, savanna and montane grasslands, deserts, and Mediterranean-type ecosystems (<a href=\"#CIT0047\">Olson <span>et al.</span>, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0037\">Linder, 2014</a>). The continent has remained relatively stable in the Cenozoic period (66 to 2.5 million years ago, Ma), despite dramatic geological events, including shifting coastlines, volcanism and formation of the rift valley (<a href=\"#CIT0017\">Couvreur <span>et al.</span>, 2021</a>). Africa has a rich diversity of vascular plants, with over 65 000 species recorded on the continent and its surrounding islands (<a href=\"#CIT0055\">Qian <span>et al.</span>, 2021</a>). This equates to approximately 18.5% of plant species recorded globally (<a href=\"#CIT0002\">Antonelli <span>et al.</span>, 2023</a>). However, efforts to catalogue African plant diversity and composition are uneven, with certain regions (e.g. tropical east and central Africa) being relatively well catalogued and others (e.g. Sudan) being barely explored (<a href=\"#CIT0042\">Marshal <span>et al.</span>, 2016</a>). At the same time, increased ecological and evolutionary research points to varied patterns of diversification and assembly of the flora; however, there is a lack of wider consolidation of the disparate knowledge. This Special Issue aims to bring together pan-African research and build a holistic synthesis of knowledge on the ecology and evolution of African plants. The 17 research papers cover broad themes in biogeography and macroevolution (<a href=\"#CIT0020\">Dagallier <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0035\">Lamont <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0040\">Lopes <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0043\">Masters <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0063\">Swart <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0070\">Xue <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>); patterns and determinants of species richness and composition in tropical- (<a href=\"#CIT0005\">Bello <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0015\">Courtenay <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0033\">Karimi and Hanes, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0068\">Wieczorkowski <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>) and temperate- (<a href=\"#CIT0019\">Cramer and Verboom, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0075\">Verboom <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0072\">Zhigila <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>) areas; and ecological and genetic processes structuring population patterns (<a href=\"#CIT0014\">Chumová <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0073\">Escudero <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0074\">Kafuti <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0056\">Rincón Barrado <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>). These contributions focus on vascular plants in open and closed habitats (<a href=\"#F1\">Fig. 1</a>), with a bias towards the Cenozoic. Furthermore, the specific role of fire and its impact on the African Flora is featured in several papers (i.e. <a href=\"#CIT0015\">Courtenay <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0019\">Cramer and Verboom, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0075\">Verboom <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0068\">Wieczorkowski <span>et al.</span>, 2024</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Annals of Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"4dcd6862a4440fa3d0035d60c859bc6843aabf7c9786ca821198500245ae243e","entryHash":"cfd82aaa2681a102a758cae4ecc257f3be1ce64e2a03d4da59266dfa3fda2d64","category":"Environment"}
