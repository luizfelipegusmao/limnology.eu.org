{"title":"Identification and functional characterization of conserved cis-regulatory elements responsible for early fruit development in cucurbit crops","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2272/7616170?rss=1","date":1709164800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A number of <span>cis</span>-regulatory elements (CREs) conserved during evolution have been found to be responsible for phenotypic novelty and variation. Cucurbit crops such as cucumber (<span>Cucumis sativus</span>), watermelon (<span>Citrullus lanatus</span>), melon (<span>Cucumis melo</span>), and squash (<span>Cucurbita maxima</span>) develop fruits from an inferior ovary and share some similar biological processes during fruit development. Whether conserved regulatory sequences play critical roles in fruit development of cucurbit crops remains to be explored. In six well-studied cucurbit species, we identified 392,438 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs), including 82,756 that are specific to cucurbits, by comparative genomics. Genome-wide profiling of accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) and gene expression patterns mapped 20,865 to 43,204 ACRs and their potential target genes for two fruit tissues at two key developmental stages in six cucurbits. Integrated analysis of CNSs and ACRs revealed 4,431 syntenic orthologous CNSs, including 1,687 cucurbit-specific CNSs that overlap with ACRs that are present in all six cucurbit crops and that may regulate the expression of 757 adjacent orthologous genes. CRISPR mutations targeting two CNSs present in the 1,687 cucurbit-specific sequences resulted in substantially altered fruit shape and gene expression patterns of adjacent <span>NAC1</span> (<span>NAM</span>, <span>ATAF1/2</span>, and <span>CUC2</span>) and <span>EXT-like</span> (<span>EXTENSIN-like</span>) genes, validating the regulatory roles of these CNSs in fruit development. These results not only provide a number of target CREs for cucurbit crop improvement, but also provide insight into the roles of CREs in plant biology and during evolution.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"269e398b9a1e75460350a730aeb6346d2be691f79d9cf112ebe43de86c8ac505","category":"Environment"}
