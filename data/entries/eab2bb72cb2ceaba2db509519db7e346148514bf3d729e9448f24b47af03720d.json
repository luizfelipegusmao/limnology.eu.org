We evaluated how human land-use and climate affect white-tailed deer densities in western Canada's boreal forest, where they are an invasive species. Taking advantage of a jurisdictional boundary to decouple these two factors, we found that deer numbers were lower in places with harsher winters. However, human land-use did not affect deer populations strongly. This suggests that habitat restoration alone may not effectively recover the boreal mammal community.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Anthropogenic habitat alteration and climate change are two well-known contributors to biodiversity loss through changes to species distribution and abundance; yet, disentangling the effects of these two factors is often hindered by their inherent confound across both space and time. We leveraged a contrast in habitat alteration associated with the jurisdictional boundary between two Canadian provinces to evaluate the relative effects of spatial variation in habitat alteration and climate on white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) densities. White-tailed deer are an invading ungulate across much of North America, whose expansion into Canada's boreal forest is implicated in the decline of boreal caribou (<i>Rangifer tarandus caribou</i>), a species listed as Threatened in Canada. We estimated white-tailed deer densities using 300 remote cameras across 12 replicated 50 km<sup>2</sup> landscapes over 5 years. White-tailed deer densities were significantly lower in areas where winter severity was higher. For example, predicted deer densities declined from 1.83 to 0.35 deer/km<sup>2</sup> when winter severity increased from the lowest value to the median value. There was a tendency for densities to increase with increasing habitat alteration; however, the magnitude of this effect was approximately half that of climate. Our findings suggest that climate is the primary driver of white-tailed deer populations; however, understanding the mechanisms underpinning this relationship requires further study of over-winter survival and fecundity. Long-term monitoring at the invasion front is needed to evaluate the drivers of abundance over time, particularly given the unpredictability of climate change and increasing prevalence of extreme weather events.</p>","author":"Melanie Dickie, \nRobert Serrouya, \nMarcus Becker, \nCraig DeMars, \nMichael J.
