Speciation researchers use a suite of comparative approaches to understand both the generalities and the variance underpinning this diversification. Here, we summarize these approaches and what they have taught us, and weÂ then apply them to understand speciation in the night lizards <span>Xantusia</span>, a genus of small lizards found in the arid regions of western North America. Although <span>Xantusia</span> species span both a range of phenotypic and genetic divergence, we find that speciation in <span>Xantusia</span> appears to be a predictable consequence of divergence in extended periods of allopatry. We conclude by identifying possible areas of growth for comparative studies of speciation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"3a6bf3189332aa8d860b0369d5aa2ac065f7385b7c3f4543469ad2a55950d26a","entryHash":"ce17ef5b5f981f4daa54371aaa33a3ef406c12617856925ec9533b66ed963a97","category":"Environment"}
