The visualization in diverse devices, provide a user experience that can be different. A virtual tour with 360 photos of the Chapel of Dolores (Tenerife), has been created. Whose access is limited to specific days, so the creation of a virtual tour allows you to visit it at any time, in addition, a pilot test has been carried out with students of the degree of restoration and conservation of cultural heritage in order to measure the user experience of the virtual tour depending on the device used. The participants took a virtual tour of the Dolores Chapel, first with a cell phone and then with the virtual reality headset, and then completed a user experience questionnaire. The results obtained comparing both visualization technologies are detailed, highlighting that when using the virtual reality headset no better results are obtained in the immersion subscale, in addition, the visualization on a Smartphone is more comfortable and obtains better results in consequences such as dizziness and vertigo. Therefore, it may be an interesting strategy to have simple versions that work quickly on the cell phones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc651b21da0e8531133ac9a6857385f1f12b04622fb2d1da5a13526349e75703","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
