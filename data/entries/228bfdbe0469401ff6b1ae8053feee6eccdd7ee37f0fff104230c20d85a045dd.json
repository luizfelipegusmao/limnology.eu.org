{"title":"Impacts of dietary supplementation of chitosan nanoparticles on growth, carcass traits nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, intestinal microbial load, and meat quality of broilers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae134/7756927?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study explores the impact of chitosan nanoparticles (<strong>CNP</strong>) on the performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemical, immunity, microbial load, carcass traits, and meat attributes of broilers. A total of 200 7-d-old Cobb chicks were distributed to 4 groups, each replicated 5 times, with 10 birds in each replicate. The experimental diets were as follows: First group was fed a basal diet only (control); 2nd, 3rd, and 4th groups received a basal diet supplemented with 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 g CNP/kg of feed, respectively. Results showed that the body weight (<strong>BW</strong>) and body weight gain significantly improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in the birds belonging to the 0.4 CNP group compared to the other groups. The best feed efficiency (feed conversion ratio [<strong>FCR</strong>]) was found in the group supplemented with a 0.4-g CNP/kg diet. The digestibility coefficients for dry matter and crude protein were significantly higher, and ether extract was significantly lower in the 0.4 g CNP/kg group than in other groups (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Broiler birds of the 0.4 CNP group had significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) reduced serum cholesterol, AST, and ALT levels. The humoral immunity (increased serum IgG and IgM levels) tended to improve in birds fed 0.3 and 0.4 g CNP/kg of feed. Compared to the control, total bacterial load and coliform count decreased significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) by supplementing 0.4 g CNP in the diet. The dressing weight, breast weight, and abdominal fat % were altered in birds receiving dietary 0.4 g CNP/kg. The treatment with CNP at 0.4 g/kg feed enhanced the broiler meat quality by increasing the values for water holding capacity, ABTS [2, 2ʹ-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)], DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) while reducing the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value. Based on the results above, it could be concluded that CNP supplementation at 0.4 g/kg is recommended as a beneficial feed additive for broiler chickens.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"228bfdbe0469401ff6b1ae8053feee6eccdd7ee37f0fff104230c20d85a045dd","category":"Environment"}
