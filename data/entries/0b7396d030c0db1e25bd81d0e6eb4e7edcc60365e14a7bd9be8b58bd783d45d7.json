{"title":"The Effect of Ageing on Phase Transformations and Nanoindentation Behaviour in Ni-Rich NiTi Alloys","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1131/v1","date":1713347211000,"content":"In the article, the results of research on a NiTi alloy with a high nickel content (51.7 at.%), produced using the additive technology SLM method and subjected to isothermal aging after so-lution annealing, are presented. The study involved the determination of the sequence of phase transformations occurring using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the determination of the temperature range of these transformations. In parallel, the phase composition was determined using the XRD method; hardness and the Young’s modulus were also determined. The analysis of the DSC results obtained indicates the following characteristic features of the NiTi alloy, which change with ageing time: (1) during cooling (from +1500C to -500C), the type of transformation changes from a one-step transformation after solution annealing to a two-step transformation after the ageing process over 1, 20 and 100 hours at 500°C; (2) during heating (from -500C to +1500C) for all the samples, regardless of the ageing time, only a one-step transformation from martensite M(B19’) to austenite A(B2) is observed; (3) the temperature at which the transformation starts increases with the ageing time, (4) the width of the total temperature range of the transformation M(B19’)  A(B2) during heating changes from large (∆T=49,7°C), after solution annealing, to narrow (∆T=19.3°C and ∆T=17.9°C after 20 h and 100 h of ageing) and, most importantly, (5) a comparison with literature data shows that, irrespective of the composition of the NiTi alloy and the manufacturing technology of the alloy samples (regardless of the fact whether this was traditional or additive technology), a sufficiently long ageing process period leads to the occurrence of the martensite  austenite transformation in the same temperature range.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b7396d030c0db1e25bd81d0e6eb4e7edcc60365e14a7bd9be8b58bd783d45d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
