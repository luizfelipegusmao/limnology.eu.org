{"title":"Exploring the Diversity and Potential Use of Flower-Derived Lactic Acid Bacteria in Plant-Based Fermentation: Insights into Exo-Cellular Polysaccharide Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0371/v1","date":1722918057000,"content":"Isolation of new plant-derived lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is highly prioritized in developing novel starter cultures for plant-based fermentation. This study explores the diversity of LAB in Danish flowers and their potential use for plant-based food fermentation. 46 flower samples under 34 genera were collected for LAB isolation. By introducing an enrichment step, in total of 61 LAB strains were isolated and identified by using MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA sequencing. These strains represent 24 species across 9 genera, predominantly Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Fructobacillus fructosus, Apilactobacillus ozensis, and Apilactobacillus kunkeei. Phenotypic screening for exo-cellular polysaccharide production revealed that 40 strains exhibited sliminess or ropiness on sucrose containing agar plate. HPLC analysis confirmed that all isolates produced exo-cellular polysaccharides containing glucose, fructose or galactose as sugar monomer. Therefore, the strains were glucan, fructan and galactan producers. The suitability of these strains for plant-based fermentations was characterized by using almond, oat and soy milk. The results showed successful acidification in all three types of plant-based matrices but only observed texture development in soy by Leuconostoc, Weissella, Lactococcus, Apilactobacillus, and Fructobacillus. The findings highlight the potential of flower-derived LAB strains for texture development in soy-based dairy alternatives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"065add8a98615663e0d2610ac7b0f3242c9c048b822f25bdaf72e8924d7028e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
