{"title":"Amantadine for Traumatic Brain Injury – Supporting Evidence and Mode of Action","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0450/v1","date":1715176411000,"content":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important global clinical issue, requiring not only prevention but also effective treatment. Following TBI, diverse parallel and intertwined pathological mechanisms affecting biochemical, neurochemical, and inflammatory pathways can have severe impact on the patient’s quality of life. The current review summarizes evidence for utility of amantadine in TBI in connection to its mechanism of action. Amantadine combining multiple mechanisms of action may offer both neuroprotective and neuroactivating effects in TBI patients. Indeed, use of amantadine in TBI has been encouraged by several clinical practice guidelines/recommendations. Amantadine is also available as infusion which may be of particular benefit in unconscious patients with TBI, due to immediate delivery to the central nervous system and the possibility of precise dosing. In other situations, orally administered amantadine may be used. There are several questions that remain to be addressed: Can amantadine be effective in disorders of consciousness requiring long-term treatment and in combination with drugs approved for treatment of TBI? Do the observed beneficial effects of amantadine extend to disorders of consciousness due to factors other than TBI? Well controlled clinical studies are warranted to ultimately confirm its utility in the TBI and provide answers these questions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe58a20a7e6269870ce299b820e55746e3c451722e98f0660c4390d3296e6dcd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
