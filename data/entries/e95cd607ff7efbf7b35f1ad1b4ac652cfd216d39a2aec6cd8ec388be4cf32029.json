{"title":"Rigorous Mathematical Derivation of Inclination Angle for Single Cut Rotational Osteotomy for Tibia Deformity Correction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0698/v1","date":1718100230000,"content":"Background: To rigorously derive easy to use formulae for the inclination angle for single cut rotation osteotomy that can be used for tibia deformity correction. \nMethod: Three theorems were proven using trigonometric identities and concepts of linear algebra. These were rigorously shown. The three concepts were how to convert deformities in an AP/Lateral plane to an oblique plane deformity with a true angular magnitude of deformity; how to project an angular quantity from one plane to another; and the calculation of the inclination angle for the oblique osteotomy plane. All figures in this article were created by the authors of this paper. \nResults: From the formula derived, a statistical t-test was performed that showed no significant difference between the formula derived in this paper and the original Sangeorzan paper charts (p=0.0079). \nConclusions: The formulae described in this article are a method to accurately calculate the inclination angle of the osteotomy for a single cut rotational osteotomy for tibial deformity correction. \nClinical Relevance: The article gives a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts behind deformity correction and provides an easy-to-use mathematical formula to calculate the osteotomy inclination for single cut rotational osteotomies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e95cd607ff7efbf7b35f1ad1b4ac652cfd216d39a2aec6cd8ec388be4cf32029","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
