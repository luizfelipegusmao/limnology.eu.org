{"title":"Evaluating Kolmogorov&ndash;Arnold Networks for Scientific Discovery: A Simple Yet Effective Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1184/v1","date":1724084034000,"content":"Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Network (KAN) is an emerging interpretable neural network compared to fully black-box MLPs. Recently, emerging works focus on comprehensive and fair comparisons between KAN and MLP in various tasks. However, these works didn't focus on the strongest advantage of KAN: generating symbolic outputs. The ability of KAN to provide scientific insights or even discover new science is under-examined. In this work, we propose several novel metrics to measure how well a KAN performs on symbolic function fitting: R^2-Mean, weighted R^2-complexity loss, and ranking metrics. We also propose a metric to determine mathematical complexity of a target function and evaluate KAN with several functions of different mathematical complexity. Additionally, we also tried inputs with different ranges to find the effect of normalization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ef35f83abc90abecd1b54616c0f7b0bfe3382a21585a15e9f15e0665ca1912e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
