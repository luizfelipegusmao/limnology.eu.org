{"title":"Viscoelastic Hertzian Impact &mdash; Feature Article","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1173/v1","date":1713366163000,"content":"The problem of normal impact of a rigid sphere onto a Maxwell viscoelastic solid half-space is considered. The first-order asymptotic solution is constructed in the framework of Hunter’s model of viscoelastic impact [Hunter, S. C., 1957. Energy absorbed by elastic waves during impact. Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 5(3), 162–171.]. In particular, simple analytical approximations have been derived for the maximum contact force and the time to achieve it. A linear regression method is suggested for evaluating the instantaneous elastic modulus and the mean relaxation time from a set of experimental data collected for different impactors and impact velocities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b329d3360a1668855bd552143843fa13d2e4aa5acade7b5abc5ed13504b6c701","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
