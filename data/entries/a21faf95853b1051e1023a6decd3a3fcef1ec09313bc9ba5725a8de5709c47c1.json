Thus, it is very important to identify the groundwater source to control groundwater pollution. The Pearson correlation coefficient among major ions (Na + K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub>\n<sup>−</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup>, and Cl<sup>−</sup>) was employed to deduce the groundwater types in Zhong Liang Mountain, Southwest China. Then, the combined method of principal component analysis and cluster analysis were employed to identify the groundwater sources in a typical karst region of southwest China. The results shown that (1) the high positive correlation between cations and anions indicated the water–rock reaction of Ca-HCO<sub>3</sub>, Ca-SO<sub>4</sub>, (Na + K)-Cl, and Mg-SO<sub>4</sub>. (2) The major two principal components that would represent water–rock reaction of CaSO<sub>4</sub> and Ca-HCO<sub>3</sub> would, respectively, explain 60.41% and 31.80% of groundwater information. (3) Based on the two principal components, 33 groundwater samples were clustered into eight groups through hierarchical clustering, each group has similar water–rock reaction. The findings would be employed to forecast the surge water, that was an important work for tunnel construction and operation.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe components of groundwater was highly correlated with water–rock reaction.\nThe principal component analysis screens the types of groundwater.\nThe cluster analysis identifies the groundwater sources.\n</p>","author":"Zhang Jing, \nYang Lu Ping, \nXie Qing, \nGuo Hang, \nBing Xing, \nWu Meng Jun, \nCao Peng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"a21faf95853b1051e1023a6decd3a3fcef1ec09313bc9ba5725a8de5709c47c1","category":"Environment"}
