Data were collected via detailed interviews with 30 university staff, comprising 19 faculty members and 11 academic leaders. Following this, the data were qualitatively analyzed using MAXQDA 2022 software. The results showed that KKU has 30 sub-competitive strengths, including work ethics, future vision, academic excellence, creativity, teamwork, respect for intellectual property, continuous customer-focused improvement, a positive workplace environment, organizational trust, and the ability to attract international students. Additionally, the study identified 8 challenges hindering KKU’s advancement in global university rankings, spanning academic, human, and administrative areas. To improve its standing in international rankings, thematic analysis revealed 11 strategies to enhance KKU’s competitiveness. These include aligning academic programs with job market demands, enhancing research facilities, boosting funding for academic and research endeavors, fostering international academic and scientific partnerships, and upgrading the technological infrastructure for academics and administration. The analysis underscores the need for KKU to adopt a comprehensive suite of academic, human, and administrative strategies to bolster its competitive position. This is crucial for KKU’s rise in global university rankings and its alignment with the National Vision 2030, aiming to place over five Saudi universities among the top 100 or 200 globally.","author":"Boshra Ismael Ahmed Arnout","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8925c27f2c086ed82aa41fc5ea05fc4ccc3b7e8001141dcf45fa5d4273c4bbb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
