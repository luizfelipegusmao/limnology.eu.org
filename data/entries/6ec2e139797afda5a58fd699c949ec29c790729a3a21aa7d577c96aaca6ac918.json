{"title":"Urban Renewal and Transformation of Residents&#039; Pro-environmental Behaviors: Evidence from the Renovation of Old Residential Areas in Chengdu, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1651/v1","date":1719223345000,"content":"Based on research data from the renovation of old residential areas in Chengdu, China, this study provides empirical evidence regarding the causal relationship between urban renewal and the transformation of residents' pro-environmental behaviors. The research findings demonstrate a significant enhancement in residents' engagement in pro-environmental behaviors due to the renovation of old residential areas. Robustness tests based on replacement samples and two-stage difference-in-difference models also confirm the reliability of the conclusions. The preliminary mechanism test indicates that the mechanism of the impact of renovation of old residential areas on the transformation of residents' pro-environmental behaviors can be attributed to two main factors. Firstly, the improvement of environmental infrastructure provides residents with better conditions for participating in pro-environmental activities. Secondly, there is an elevation in residents' environmental protection awareness, prompting a more voluntary engagement in pro-environmental behavior. This study suggests that decision-makers should fully recognize that urban renewal activities nationwide are not only a process of improving urban hardware and functionality, but also a realistic and vivid \"environmental education\" course for the whole nation. Taking urban renewal as an opportunity to enhance citizens' awareness of environmental protection will effectively promote the transformation of pro-environmental behaviors among residents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ec2e139797afda5a58fd699c949ec29c790729a3a21aa7d577c96aaca6ac918","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
