{"title":"Hydrothermal liquefaction of Datura stramonium L.: Influence of temperature and heterogeneous catalysts","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14322?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this study, <i>Datura stramonium</i> L. plant was converted into liquid products by hydrothermal liquefaction method with and without catalysts (Al, Zn, and Cu). The reaction temperature was determined as 300, 325, and 350°C, and the waiting time was determined as 30 min. The obtained liquid products were characterized by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and elemental analysis methods. Higher light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil yields were obtained with Al, Zn, and Cu catalysts compared to experiments without catalysts. The highest light bio-oil yields were found as 10.24%, 8.87%, and 7.98% for Zn, Cu, and Al catalysts, respectively. In heavy bio-oil, the highest efficiency was obtained as 26.98% in the presence of Al catalyst. For all experiments, the highest liquid product yield was obtained at 325 C. At the end of the experiments, it was determined that heterogeneous catalysts were effective on product yield and compound types.</p>","author":"Salih Genel","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"601fa74a72d89335cab86755f04afb2a304e745efc627f253c6b8fec76619ddf","category":"Environment"}
