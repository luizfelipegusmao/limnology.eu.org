The study of mass transport mechanisms is particularly necessary in elucidating the fundamental processes governing oxidation kinetics. Typically, oxidation kinetics of metals or alloys are controlled by either outward diffusion of metal ions or inward diffusion of anion species through the oxides [<a href=\"#ozae044.1051-B1\">1</a>]. Although these transport mechanisms are often inferred from measurements of the rate of weight gain and oxygen consumption as a function of oxidation temperature and oxygen pressure, direct experimental evidence to support these mass mechanisms remains elusive.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a9fd30bc3c565af9e532830fb2a03405d66d9a63b1278ada5a7536f0d281d532","category":"Environment"}
