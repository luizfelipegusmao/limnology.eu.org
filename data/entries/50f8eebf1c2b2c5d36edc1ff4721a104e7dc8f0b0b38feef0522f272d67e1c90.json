{"title":"Laser Metal Deposition of WC-NiCrBSi Powders on Gas Carburization Steels Used in Mining Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202311.0486/v2","date":1720077253000,"content":"The fusion of surface-modified steel with tungsten carbide (WC) and NiCrBSi powder through laser metal deposition has emerged as a formidable strategy for fortifying components against wear and corrosion in extreme operating environments. Meticulous selection of WC content, innovative pre-alloying techniques, and precise control of laser metal deposition profoundly influence the mechanical properties and microstructural evolution of WC-NiCrBSi coatings applied to surface-enriched commercial alloy steel (805M2, 832M13, and 827M40). These tailored coatings exhibit exceptional resilience, ideal for harsh industrial settings in Oil and gas drilling, petrochemical, and Mining sectors. Advanced materials testing techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, light optical microscopies, and microhardness testing, unveil the innate hardness attributes, with findings highlighting the unassailable fortitude of the Mixed matrix layer's side face. The amalgamation of these testing methodologies with laser metal deposition promises an unparalleled path to extend the operational lifespan of critical components in challenging working conditions. The research horizon for WC-NiCrBSi coatings remains broad, with the potential to enhance durability, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness across diverse applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50f8eebf1c2b2c5d36edc1ff4721a104e7dc8f0b0b38feef0522f272d67e1c90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
