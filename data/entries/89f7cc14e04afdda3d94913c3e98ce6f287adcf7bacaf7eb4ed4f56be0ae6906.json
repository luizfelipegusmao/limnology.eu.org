{"title":"Optimizing Groundwater Exploration Strategies in Huarong, China with 2-Dimensional Resistivity Imaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1802/v1","date":1719363725000,"content":"The growing expansion of the economy and population has resulted in an increased inclination towards the utilization of groundwater resources. Conducting a geophysical survey is a widely employed method for subsurface mapping and the detection of groundwater. A geophysical study was conducted in Nanshan township, Huarong County, located in the Hunan province of the South-Central region of China. The investigation involved the utilization of a 2D Electrical Resistivity Imaging technique employing forward and inverse pole-dipole electrode array. A total of six survey lines were established, each with an electrode distance from the nearest measuring point to exceeding 800 m. The maximum current electrode separation was utilized in this setup. The spacing between the electrical resistivity sounding points was established at regular intervals. The findings from the exploration indicate the existence of multiple faults within the surveyed region. The study additionally identified two regions of structural failure, which occurred due to the convergence of faults oriented in different directions. This convergence led to the fracturing of rocks, an increase in water content, and a decrease in resistivity. The findings from the exploration were utilized in the formulation of five verification target boreholes. The results of this study offer significant insights that can inform future investigations into groundwater exploration endeavors within the region.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89f7cc14e04afdda3d94913c3e98ce6f287adcf7bacaf7eb4ed4f56be0ae6906","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
