{"title":"Hypoxia in the Blue Mussel Mytilus chilensis Induces Transcriptome Shift Associated with Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Metabolism, and Immune Response.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0005/v1","date":1711957895000,"content":"The increase in hypoxia events, a result of climate change in coastal and fjord ecosystems, impacts the health and survival of mussels. These organisms deploy physiological and molecular responses as an adaptive mechanism to maintain cellular homeostasis under environmental stress. However, the specific effects of hypoxia on mussels of socioeconomic interest, such as Mytilus chilensis, are unknown. Using RNA-seq, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of the gills, digestive gland, and adductor muscle of M. chilensis under hypoxia (10 days at 2 mg L-1) and reoxygenation (10 days at 6 mg L-1). There were 15,056 differentially expressed transcripts identified in gills, 11,864 in the digestive gland, and 9,862 in the adductor muscle. The response varied among tissues, showing chromosomal changes in Chr1, Chr9, and Chr10 during hypoxia. Hypoxia regulated signaling genes in the Toll-Like, mTOR, citrate cycle, and apoptosis pathways in gills, indicating metabolic and immunological alterations. These changes suggest that hypoxia-induced a metabolic shift in mussels, reducing reliance on aerobic respiration and increasing reliance on anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, hypoxia appeared to suppress the immune response, potentially increasing disease susceptibility, with negative implications for the mussel culture industry and natural bed populations. This study provides pivotal insights into metabolic and immunological adaptations to hypoxia in M. chilensis, offering candidate genes for adaptive traits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80737693b7046f92c9bc68eedbb19d407a437c3c54a369aee077aadfdb01dde4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
