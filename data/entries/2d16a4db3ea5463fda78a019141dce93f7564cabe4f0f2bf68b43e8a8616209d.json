{"title":"Microwave Corona Breakdown Suppression of Microstrip Coupled-Line Filter Using Lacquer Coating","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1264/v1","date":1718710563000,"content":"Due to its potential harm to space payload, microwave corona breakdown of microstrip circuits has attracted much attention. This work describes an efficient way to suppress corona breakdown. Since corona breakdown threshold is determined by the highest electric field intensity at the surface of microstrip circuits, lacquer coating with thickness of tens of microns is sprayed on the top of microstrip circuits. The applied dielectric coating is used to move the discharge location away from circuitâ€™s surface which is equivalent to reduce the highest electric field intensity on the in-terface of solid/air of the circuit and thus results into higher breakdown threshold. Two designs of classic coupled-line band-pass filter were used for verification. Corona experimental results at 2.5 GHz show that, in the interested low pressure range (100 to 4500 Pa), 5.3 dB improvement of mi-crowave corona breakdown threshold can be achieved for a filter with narrowest gap of 0.2 mm while its electrical performances like insertion loss, Q-factor are still acceptable. A threshold improvement prediction method is also presented and validated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d16a4db3ea5463fda78a019141dce93f7564cabe4f0f2bf68b43e8a8616209d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
