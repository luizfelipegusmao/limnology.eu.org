{"title":"Length‐Weight Relationships of Native and Non‐Native Fishes in the Lower Red River Catchment, USA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5578825?af=R","date":1727429850000,"content":"<p>Length-weight relationships are useful for stock assessments and modeling alternative conservation and management strategies for both native and non-native fishes. We developed length-weight relationships for 18 native and non-native riverine fishes in the lower Red River catchment. Fishes were sampled in the summer and autumn seasons between May 2021 and March 2024 via electrofishing and gill nets. Measurements for each specimen consisted of total length (mm) and weight (g). We provide L-W relationships for 14 native fishes consisting of 5 families (Lepisosteidae, Catostomidae, Ictaluridae, Sciaenidae, and Polyodontidae) and 4 non-native species belonging to the family Cyprinidae. We collected 6,845 individuals ranging from 67 alligator gar to 1,848 smallmouth buffalo. All the L-W relationships were significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and the majority (72% of species) of relationships between length and weight had <i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> values &gt; 0.70. Our findings provide insight into the L-W relationships of riverine fishes and can be useful for modeling alternatives targeted at native fishes of recreational value and the removal efforts of non-native fishes.</p>","author":"Mariaguadalupe Vilchez, \nJohn Dattilo, \nShannon K.
