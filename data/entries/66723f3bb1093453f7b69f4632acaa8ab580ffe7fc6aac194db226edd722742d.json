{"title":"Nano-indentation Response of Structural Self-Healing Epoxy Resin: A Hybrid Experimental-Simulation Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0112/v1","date":1717418953000,"content":"In these last years, self-healing polymers have emerged as a topic of considerable interest owing to their capability to partially restore material properties and thereby extend the product's lifespan. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the nano-indentation response in terms of hardness, reduced modulus, contact depth and coefficient of friction of a self-healing resin developed for use in aeronautical and aerospace contexts. To achieve this, the bifunctional epoxy precursor underwent tailored functionalization to improve its toughness, facilitating effective compatibilization with a rubber phase dispersed within the host epoxy resin. This approach aimed to highlight the significant impact of the quantity and distribution of rubber domains within the resin on enhancing its mechanical properties. The main results are that pure resin exhibits a higher hardness (about 36.7% more) and reduced modulus (about 7% more), consequently leading to a lower contact depth and coefficient of friction (11.4% less) compared to other formulations that, conversely, are well-suited for preserving damage from mechanical stresses due to their capabilities in absorbing mechanical energy. Furthermore, finite element method (FEM) simulations of the nanoindentation process were conducted. The numerical results were meticulously compared with experimental data, demonstrating a good agreement. This validation of the FEM model underscores its efficacy in predicting the mechanical behavior of nanocomposite materials under nanoindentation. The proposed investigation aims to contribute knowledge and optimization tips about self-healing resins.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66723f3bb1093453f7b69f4632acaa8ab580ffe7fc6aac194db226edd722742d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
