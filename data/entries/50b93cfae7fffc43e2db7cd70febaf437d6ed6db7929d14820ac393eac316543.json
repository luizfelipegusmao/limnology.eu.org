A promising avenue for tackling this issue involves harnessing carbon dioxide as a carbon source and leveraging \"green hydrogen\" generated from renewable energy sources. The utilization of heterogeneous catalytic systems in carbon dioxide hydrogenation reactions has been extensively studied, such as Cu/ZnO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ni/CeO<sub>2</sub>, Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub>, Rh/TiO<sub>2</sub> and Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#ozae044.540-B1\">1</a>]. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reaction dynamics occurring at the surface and interface, particularly at the atomic scale, remains notably lacking due to the complexity of gas/oxide interface interactions and microscopic dynamics. To investigate the catalytic dynamics, our attention is directed towards the dynamic behaviors of oxide support (e.g., TiO<sub>2</sub>) during reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reactions. Using in-situ environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM) observations, we unravel the atomic mechanisms of the catalytic reactions, which involve the loss and replenishment of lattice oxygen, and competitive behaviors during redox reactions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"50b93cfae7fffc43e2db7cd70febaf437d6ed6db7929d14820ac393eac316543","category":"Environment"}
