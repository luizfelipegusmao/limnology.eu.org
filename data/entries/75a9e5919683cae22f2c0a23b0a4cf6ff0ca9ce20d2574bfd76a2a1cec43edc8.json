{"title":"Morphology, Internal Architecture, Facies Model, and Emplacement Mechanisms of Lava Flows from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) of the Hartford and Deerfield Basins (USA)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0422/v1","date":1717739339000,"content":"The morphology, internal architecture, and emplacement mechanisms of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) lava flows of the Hartford and Deerfield basins (USA) are presented. The Talcott, Holyoke, and Hampden formations within the Hartford basin constitute distinct basaltic units, each exhibiting chemical, mineralogical, and structural differences corresponding to flow fields. Each flow field was the result of several sustained eruptions that produced both inflated pahoehoe flows and subaquatic extrusions: 1â€“5 eruptions in the Talcott formation and 1-2 in Holyoke and Hampden basalts, where simple flows are dominant. The Deerfield basin displays the Deerfield basalt unit, characterized by pillow lavas and sheet lobes, aligning chemically and mineralogically with the Holyoke basalt unit. Overall, the studied flow fields are composed of thick, simple pahoehoe flows that display the entire range of pahoehoe morphology, including inflated lobes. The three-partite structure of sheet lobes, vertical distribution of vesicles, and segregation structures are typical. The characteristics of the volcanic pile suggest slow emplacement during sustained eruptive episodes and are compatible with a continental basaltic succession facies model. The studied CAMP basalts of the eastern United States are correlated with the well-exposed examples on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Canada, Portugal, and Morocco).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75a9e5919683cae22f2c0a23b0a4cf6ff0ca9ce20d2574bfd76a2a1cec43edc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
