{"title":"Adaptation of Artificial Intelligence to Everyday Life for a Sustainable World: A Comparative Analysis of Artificial Intelligence and Teacher Decision-Making","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1339/v1","date":1726609980000,"content":"The utilization of artificial intelligence in education can contribute to sustainable development goals in various ways. AI in education can effectively convey sustainability issues to students. Through simulations and virtual environments, learners can experience sustainable practices firsthand. On the other hand artificial intelligence can assist administrators and educators in making data-informed decisions. This allows for more effective shaping of educational policies. This study explores how teachers and artificial intelligence (AI) address ethical dilemmas in edu-cation, comparing their decisions and examining the influence of variables such as gender, years of service, and education level. A total of 141 teachers from public schools in Turkey participated, and their responses were compared to AI-generated decisions using Yin's nested multiple-case de-sign. The scenarios were analyzed through five ethical frameworks: virtue ethics, deontological ethics, utilitarianism, social justice ethics, and situation ethics. Results showed that AI provided the same answer as the majority of teachers in six out of eight dilemmas but differed in two. AI favored a more analytical, result-oriented approach, while teachers emphasized empathy and rule adherence. Gender differences revealed that males leaned towards utilitarianism, while females favored social justice and situation ethics. Less experienced teachers preferred deontological and social justice ethics, while more experienced teachers leaned towards virtue ethics and utilitarian-ism. Elementary teachers emphasized virtue and social justice ethics, while middle and high school teachers favored deontological ethics and utilitarianism. The findings provide insights into ethical decision-making in education by highlighting the differences between solutions proposed by artificial intelligence and those offered by teachers. Additionally, they emphasize the im-portance of adapting artificial intelligence to everyday life to foster a sustainable world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a5f145ddffc6c8b77bcb6b4dc213eeafe34e8019d3eb4d24b30aaaf87445ad1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
