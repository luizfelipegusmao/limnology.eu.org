{"title":"Investigating the Fish Assemblages of the Neosho River System","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5663254?af=R","date":1706515200000,"content":"<p>Barrier presence in river systems has been demonstrated to impair fish assemblages. Low head dams specifically are frequently occurring barriers in riverine environments. Well-supported impacts of these structures on fishes include diminished movement, reproduction, and habitat availability. Longitudinal patterns in riverine fish assemblages have long been researched to ascertain dynamics and display interactions. The need for research becomes more critical when factoring in impacts of barriers and detrimental invasive species. Knowledge of fish assemblages can inform fisheries biologists and aid in improved management practices for recreational and ecologically important species, as well as invasive species. The Neosho River system in Kansas has 14 barriers present. Little fisheries sampling has been done in the Kansas portion of this river system from the John Redmond Dam to the Oklahoma border; therefore, sampling was conducted to inform questions posed about the fish assemblages. We sought to document the fish assemblages of the system in Kansas and examine for assemblage composition distinctions by geographic region along a longitudinal gradient. The fish assemblage dataset from this research generated a wealth of knowledge on sportfish infiltration from reservoirs, imperiled fishes, and apparent impacts from low-head dams. Information from this study will aid in future management and direct new research investigating imperiled fishes.</p>","author":"Ethan J. Rasset, \nHae H. Kim, \nBen C. Neely, \nQuinton E.
