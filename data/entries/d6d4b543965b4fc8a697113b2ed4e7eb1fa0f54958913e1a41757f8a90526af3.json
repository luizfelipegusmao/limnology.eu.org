{"title":"Effect of Virtual Reality Technology in Table Tennis Teaching: A Multi-Center Controlled Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1142/v1","date":1726619196000,"content":"This study investigated the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) technology in table tennis education compared to traditional training methods. A 12-week randomized controlled trial was conducted with 120 participants divided equally between VR and traditional training groups. Performance metrics, learning motivation, and satisfaction were assessed at regular intervals. Results demonstrated significant advantages of VR training, with the VR group showing superior improvements in serve accuracy (23.5% vs. 15.8%, p &lt; 0.001), rally endurance (increase of 8.2 vs. 5.7 shots, p &lt; 0.01), and overall skill scores (18.7 vs. 13.2 points improvement, p &lt; 0.001). The VR group also exhibited higher increases in learning motivation (23.5% vs. 12.8%, p &lt; 0.001) and satisfaction (31.5% vs. 18.7%, p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed particular benefits for novice players and younger participants. These findings suggest that VR technology offers a promising approach to enhance table tennis education, potentially revolutionizing sports training methodologies. Future research should focus on long-term skill retention and the optimization of VR training protocols.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d6d4b543965b4fc8a697113b2ed4e7eb1fa0f54958913e1a41757f8a90526af3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
