Explicit recognition of the elements of hydrological variability and linkages with extreme precipitation is necessary to combat the spread of schistosomiasis. We call for the use of a vulnerability framework to account holistically for the dynamic interplay among environmental and human factors that influence susceptibility to schistosomiasis infection across spatial scales.</p>","author":"Delphis F.
