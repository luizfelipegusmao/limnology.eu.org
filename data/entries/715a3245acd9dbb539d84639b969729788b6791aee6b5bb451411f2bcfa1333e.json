{"title":"Application Effect Analysis of Bimodal Collaborative Nursing Model in Gastric Cancer with Concurrent Inguinal Hernia Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1503/v1","date":1729252859000,"content":"Objective: To explore the application effect of a bimodal collaborative nursing model in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery with concurrent inguinal hernia repair. Methods: Sixty patients with gastric cancer and concurrent inguinal hernia who were admitted to our hospital between August 2019 and August 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Based on the different nursing approaches, all patients were divided into a control group and an observation group, with 30 patients in each group. The control group received conventional nursing care, while the observation group received the bimodal collaborative nursing model in addition to conventional care. The postoperative recovery, psychological status, and quality of life of the two groups of patients were compared. Results: The postoperative recovery of the observation group was superior to that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). The anxiety and depression scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group, with statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05). The quality of life score of the observation group was higher than that of the control group, with statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The application of a bimodal collaborative nursing model in gastric cancer surgery with concurrent inguinal hernia repair is effective. It not only promotes postoperative physical recovery and improves the psychological well-being of patients but also enhances their quality of life. It is worthy of clinical promotion and application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"715a3245acd9dbb539d84639b969729788b6791aee6b5bb451411f2bcfa1333e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
