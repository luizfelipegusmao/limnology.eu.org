Within clinical settings, the existing method of determining gene load involves traditional culture to determine bacterial load and polymerase-chain-reaction-based Xpert Carba-R Assay to determine carbapenemase gene type. However, there is a need for a fast and accurate method of quantifying CPO colonisation to study the risk of persistent CPO carriage.</p> Objective <p>This study evaluated the accuracy of Xpert Carba-R Ct value in estimating carbapenamase producing bacterial loads in stool samples.</p> Methods <p>Stool samples were obtained from an ongoing study investigating the household transmission of CPO in Singapore. Stool samples lacking carbapenemase producing organisms were spiked with organism carrying a single carbapenemase gene (<i>bla</i><sub>KPC</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>VIM</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48(-like)</sub> or <i>bla</i><sub>IMP-1</sub>) and serially diluted before being subjected to Xpert Carba-R assay and traditional culture. Standard curves with regression lines showing correlation between C<sub>t</sub> values and plate counts were generated. The standard curves were validated with stool samples collected from patients.</p> Results <p>The limit of detection of <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>KPC</sub>, and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub> was approximately 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/mL, while that of <i>bla</i><sub>IMP-1</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>VIM</sub> was approximately 10<sup>4</sup> cfu/mL. Validation of the <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub> curves revealed average delta values of 0.56 log(cfu/mL) (95% CI 0.24–0.88) and 0.80 log(cfu/mL) (95% CI 0.53–1.07), respectively.</p> Conclusions <p>Our validation data for stool positive for <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48-type</sub> suggests that bacterial loads can be estimated within a reasonable range of error.</p>","author":"Jie Yin Chua","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c21e87398c639d88c59faec6c1a84efdd39630e54002ddaeef5700da814c1f99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
