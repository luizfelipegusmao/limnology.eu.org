{"title":"Simultaneous Bayesian estimation of size-specific catchability and size spectrum parameters from trawl data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/1/145/7459507?rss=1","date":1701820800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fisheries-independent surveys are a critical tool for monitoring marine populations and communities. However, considerations must be made to account for variable-size-based catchability. The size-specific catchability function is therefore key for estimating size distributions, but often requires extensive data sets or specialized field experiments to determine. We develop a Bayesian model capable of simultaneously estimating both a size-based catchability curve and species-specific size spectrum parameters from trawl data by assuming that individual species size spectra follow a theoretically derived parametric size spectrum model. The resulting model provides a means of estimating catchability and size spectra within an adaptive framework capable of accommodating confounding factors such as vessel power and fish density, potentially allowing for improved biomass and productivity estimates. We demonstrate the application of this model using 15 years of Greenland Halibut (<span>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</span>) survey data from Nunavut to determine size-specific catchabilities and assess whether the size spectrum of Greenland Halibut has changed across the time series. While size spectrum parameters for this stock were not found to vary, we did find evidence of time-varying catchability parameters across the study period.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"5b261e8b0936970eb85bee383db567e5e843e93ed9de86d3cfe576edade922b6","category":"Environment"}
