{"title":"Comprehensive Study of Burn Patients in Pediatric Population and Their Management With Cryopreserved Epidermal Allograft.

Analyze and compare the results obtained from the treatment of burn wounds by using the bio-preserved human epidermis allograft (BHEA) and other types of dressings and determine the need for further need of a skin graft. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study of pediatric population with burn injuries was conducted, grouped into categories based on their age group, and the mechanisms of injury into 6 categories: scald, flame, contact, electrical, chemical and friction. Describing the extension and depth of the burn injury. The results of treatment of two groups; the patients who used (BHEA) and the group with “other dressings” were analyzed by inferential statistics to establish the relationship between the use of BHEA and the need for skin grafts compared to the other group. Results: A total of 65 patients were obtained. The average age was 4.5 years (±3.8). Preschoolers (1-5 years old) were the most frequent age group 64% (n=42). Male patients represented 61% (n=40) of cases. Scald was the most reported mechanism 64% (n=42). The average total body surface area burned (TBSAB) was 10.8% (± 9.2). Mixed partial thickness burn (superficial and deep) was the most common with a 55%. The head was the most affected anatomical site; 30%.  The face was the most reported “special anatomical site” with a 40% (n=30). 32.2 % of the population (n=21) was treated with BHEA. The average time of epithelialization of the BHEA group was 8 days (±7.2), and their average hospital stay time was 7 days (±5.7). In the “other dressing” group, the average epithelialization time was 18 days (±13.6), and the average hospital stay time was 11 days (±12.6). Fifty percent (n=22) of the “other dressing” group required skin grafts. In the BHEA group only 19% (n=4) required skin grafts. An OR of 0.23 and CI of 95% (0.06 – 0.81) with a p value of (0.017) for the need of skin grafts after de use of BHEA was obtained. Conclusion: The epidemiological results reported are similar to those described in the literature. The use of (BHEA) proved to be a good option for the management of partial thickness burns and burns in transition, promoting timely epithelilization and avoiding deepening of the burns while reducing morbidity, hospital stay and care costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81813a5542b08b8c4fe2f7defdd36dfbfdfe55fb47de3fa2dd36c23623996796","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
