{"title":"Beyond Transduction: Biological Effects  of Cell Penetrating Peptides","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0154/v1","date":1722592782000,"content":"One of the bottlenecks to bringing new therapies to the clinic has been a lack of vectors for delivering novel therapeutics in a targeted manner. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have received a lot of attention and have been the subject of numerous developments since their identification nearly 3 decades ago. Known for their transduction abilities, they have generally been considered inert vectors. In this review we present a schema for their classification, highlight what is known about their mechanism of transduction, and outline the existing literature, as well as our own experience, vis a vis the intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties that certain CPPs exhibit. Given the inflammatory responses associated with viral vectors, CPPs represent a viable alternative to these vectors; further, the anti-inflammatory properties of CPPs, mostly through inhibition of the NF-ÎºB pathway, are encouraging. Much work in relevant animal models, toxicity studies in large animal models, and ultimately human trials are needed before their potential is fully realized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"964609703caf728370c4593558df0017d9b0bf51b0e634371299a7a994dfc5f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
