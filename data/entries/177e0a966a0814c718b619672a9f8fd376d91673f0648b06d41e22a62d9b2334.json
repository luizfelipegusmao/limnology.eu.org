{"title":"Forskolin-mediated cAMP activation upregulates TNF-α expression despite NF-κB downregulation in LPS-treated Schwann cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302223","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Caitlyn Henry, Mackenzie Wilcox, Angela L. Asirvatham</p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Schwann cells have been found to play a key role in inflammation and repair following nerve injury, the exact pathway is still unknown. To explore the mechanism by which Schwann cells exert their effects in the neuron microenvironment, we investigated two main inflammatory pathways: the NF-κB and cAMP pathways, and their downstream signaling molecules. In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin, was used to activate the NF-κB pathway, and forskolin, a plant extract, was used to activate the cAMP pathway. The rat RT4-D6P2T Schwann cell line was treated with 0.1, 1, or 10 μg/mL of LPS, with or without 2 μM of forskolin, for 1, 3, 12, and 24 hours to determine the effects of elevated cAMP levels on LPS-treated cell viability. To investigate the effects of elevated cAMP levels on the expression of downstream signaling effector proteins, specifically NF-κB, TNF-α, AKAP95, and cyclin D3, as well as TNF-α secretion, RT4-D6P2T cells were incubated in the various treatment combinations for a 3-hour time period. Overall, results from the CellTiter-Glo viability assay revealed that forskolin increased viability in cells treated with smaller doses of LPS for 1 and 24 hours. For all time points, 10 μg/mL of LPS noticeably reduced viability regardless of forskolin treatment. Results from the Western blot analysis revealed that, at 10 μg/mL of LPS, forskolin upregulated the expression of TNF-α despite a downregulation of NF-κB, which was also accompanied by a decrease in TNF-α secretion. These results provide evidence that cAMP might regulate TNF-α expression through alternate pathways. Furthermore, although cAMP activation altered AKAP95 and cyclin D3 expression at different doses of LPS, there does not appear to be an association between the expression of AKAP95 or cyclin D3 and the expression of TNF-α. Exploring the possible interactions between cAMP, NF-κB, and other key inflammatory signaling pathways might reveal a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of nerve injury and inflammation.","author":"Caitlyn Henry","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"177e0a966a0814c718b619672a9f8fd376d91673f0648b06d41e22a62d9b2334","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
