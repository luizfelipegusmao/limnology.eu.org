{"title":"Anthocyanins and nucleation seeds are key factors affecting quercetin precipitation in red wines","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13352?af=R","date":1709030049000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Climate changes have been leading to an excessive synthesis of quercetin (Q) and its glycosides (Q-Gs) in specific red grape varieties, such as Sangiovese. This has resulted in concentrations overcoming the solubility threshold of Q in wines, with the consequent formation of undesirable precipitates. This study aims at assessing the impact of various factors, including anthocyanins, temperature, nucleation seeds and time, on the precipitation of Q in red wine.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The influence of anthocyanins on Q solubility was examined by adding a grape skin extract rich in anthocyanins to a model solution containing 89 μmol L<sup>−1</sup> of Q. The data revealed that the solubility of both Q and Q-Gs increased as a function of the anthocyanin concentration in the model solution. In a subsequent experiment, red wines were stored at two different temperatures (2 and 20 °C), supplemented with Q nucleation seeds, and monitored over a 10-day period. Notably, after only 3 days of contact with Q seeds at 2 °C, a reduction of over 75% in Q concentration was observed in the supernatant. Among the considered factors, contact with nucleation seeds emerged as the most significant one (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Q precipitation in red wines is influenced by the presence of anthocyanins in solution, although it is not the sole determinant. The data also suggested that a potential strategy for wineries to mitigate the risk of Q precipitation in bottled wine would be the acceleration of this process by promoting the formation of nucleation seeds. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Alessandra Luciano, \nLuigi Picariello, \nMartino Forino, \nLuigi Moio, \nAngelita Gambuti","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"f65446b364e755ae9952d0eebb82ed518c590173d6dae1effd74731877d7f873","category":"Environment"}
