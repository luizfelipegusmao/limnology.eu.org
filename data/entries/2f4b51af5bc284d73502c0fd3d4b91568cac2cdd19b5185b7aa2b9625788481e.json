For this purpose, their life cycle was traced experimentally. Eggs obtained from adult trematodes raised in chicks (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) were used to infect snails (<i>Succinea putris</i>, laboratory strain). Histological studies of sporocysts were conducted for 95â€‰days after exposure. During this time, the embryos of sporocysts developed into a small stolon filled with numerous metacercarial embryos. We found that miracidia hatched in the stomach and in the proximal part of the snail's midgut. After the larvae migrated into the area of the hepatopancreas, their body was destroyed, and germinal cells were released. They cleaved to form the embryos of sporocysts, in which only metacercarial embryos developed. Our study showed that these trematodes lack the parasitic phase of the mother sporocyst and have only one generation of parthenitae, the daughter sporocysts.</p>","author":"Gennady L.
