{"title":"PSIV-16 The role of veterinary services on nutrition schemes, management, and health practices for sheep and goats in rural Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality, North West Province of South Africa","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/465/7757775?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Poverty is a feature of rural households, and as a result rural people usually adopt low-input agriculture to alleviate poverty. Many households in Ngaka Modiri Molema District keep animals, particularly sheep and goats, for a variety of reasons, including as source of income, milk, and meat. However, they lack the management skills that are necessary for their livestock to increase their productivity. Inadequate animal management, including poor feeding and housing standards and poor application of proper animal health procedures are compounded by a lack of agricultural experience and low-input farming methods. In addition, poor animal nutrition, sickness and a high prevalence of parasites, and low animal production output further contribute to low overall productivity. Therefore, support offered by the veterinary services, and the impact these interventions have on sheep and goat farming among rural farmers need to be investigated. The present study will seek to describe the feeding schemes and management practices adopted by sheep and goat owners, as well as the role of veterinary and extension services in the development of such practices. Health care provided to sheep and goat farmers by the veterinary services will also be determined. A survey will be conducted in Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality, a rural area in North West Province of South Africa. The study population will consist of all farmers, both female and male, rearing sheep and goats. Animal and farm information level data and general farm management practices will be collected via a questionnaire survey. Using the Statistical Kit for STATA (version 16), data will be examined by computing frequency, percentages, and proportions based on the characteristics of the sample population. This survey will help to provide opportunities for resource-poor farmers in rural areas to develop their flocks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b2d82fcd451992454345acdfd00cf1700f9063afe2faf1d73b5e15f78d6c55eb","category":"Environment"}
