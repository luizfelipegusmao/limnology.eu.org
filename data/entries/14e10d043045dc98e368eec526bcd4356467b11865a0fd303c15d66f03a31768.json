Present research work was conducted using wheat straw in submerged conditions for the growth of white rot fungus, <i>Phlebia brevispora</i> in the presence of varying concentrations of Cd, Pb, Ni, and Cr. The lignocellulolytic enzyme production ability of fungus was monitored. A wheat straw-based fixed-bed bioreactor was designed to treat metal-containing water in continuous mode. The fungus showed a positive influence on laccase production, cellulase production, and lignin peroxidase activity. As observed through atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Cr removal efficiency was 78%–80%, regardless of the initial metal concentration. The Cr was also found on the surface of fungal mycelium as per the results obtained from SEM–EDX. The continuous bioreactor achieved 98%–99% metal removal, making it a natural and cost-effective solution for metal removal from wastewater using <i>P. brevispora</i>.</p>","author":"Kalu Ram Sharma, \nRakesh Kumar Sharma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"14e10d043045dc98e368eec526bcd4356467b11865a0fd303c15d66f03a31768","category":"Environment"}
