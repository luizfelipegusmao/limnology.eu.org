{"title":"Consumption of pollen contaminated with field-realistic concentrations of fungicide causes sublethal effects in Bombus impatiens (Hymenoptera: Apidae) microcolonies","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/706/7683096?rss=1","date":1716768000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bumble bees are declining across the globe. The causes of this decline have been attributed to a variety of stressors, including pesticides. Fungicides are a type of pesticide that has been understudied in the context of bumble bee health. As a result, fungicides are often applied to flowering plants without consideration of pollinator exposure. Recent work demonstrates that fungicides have sublethal effects in bumble bees, but little is known about how much fungicide it takes to cause these sublethal effects. To address this gap in the literature, we fed microcolonies of the common eastern bumble bee (<span>Bombus impatiens CressonHymenoptera: ApidaeHymenoptera: ApidaeHymenoptera: ApidaeHymenoptera: Apidae</span>) pollen contaminated with a range of fungicide concentrations. We chose these concentrations based on the range of fungicide concentrations in pollen and nectar that were reported in the literature. Results revealed that later-stage pupae and newly emerged males are potentially sensitive to fungicide exposure, showing smaller size and reduced fat reserves at intermediate levels of contamination. Compared to the control, intermediated levels of fungicide-contaminated pollen led to increased pupal mortality and delayed male emergence. Contrary to expectations, higher fungicide levels did not exhibit a linear relationship with negative impacts, suggesting nuanced effects. Because body size and emergence timing are important aspects of bumble bee reproductive behavior, results have implications for mating success, potentially disrupting colony development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"6d4bc7dac54353500fe8a344ec9dd87c573ea77118cbc951be4c8d0fdd6cce0f","category":"Environment"}
