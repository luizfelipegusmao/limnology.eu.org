{"title":"Modeling college EFL teachers’ intentions to conduct academic research: Integrating theory of planned behavior with self-determination theory","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307704","date":1724767200000,"content":"<p>by Xiaobin Ren</p>\r\n\r\nThis study constructed a robust theoretical model aimed at elucidating the determinants that shape college EFL teachers’ research intentions by integrating the tenets of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) with Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This model was empirically validated using data from 271 EFL teachers from eight colleges in China, selected through stratified sampling and collected via paper questionnaires, then analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings underscore the instrumental roles of both autonomous and controlled motivations in driving research-related behaviors, thereby reinforcing the foundational concepts of SDT. Additionally, this study provides intricate insights into the mechanisms wherein motivation steers immediate determinants of research intention, encompassing attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This melding of SDT and TPB offers an all-encompassing perspective on the multifaceted nexus between motivation and research intentions. Consequently, this refined model not only marks a pivotal stride in advancing teacher education theory but also establishes a guiding framework for forthcoming research and interventions, accentuating the imperative of fostering research intentions among college EFL educators.","author":"Xiaobin Ren","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0f0a94d7ef337278e1f4c5bb3ebff375a020d8aab7b2410d7f6b0ed5bbbd4683","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
