K. Schum (Rubiaceae) is an annual weed with a strong allelopathic inhibitory effect on malignant weeds in orchards in southern China. This study was carried out to investigate its allelopathic potential and to identify allelochemicals present in <i>B</i>. <i>latifolia</i>.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Aqueous extracts of <i>B</i>. <i>latifolia</i> inhibited the germination and radicle growth of <i>Eleusine indica</i> and the radicle growth of <i>Bidens alba</i> in a dose-dependent manner. However, only the high-concentration treatment at 50 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> delayed the germination of <i>B</i>. <i>alba</i> and <i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i>. Among the root, stem, and leaf aqueous extracts of <i>B</i>. <i>latifolia</i>, the leaf extract had the strongest inhibitory effects on the germination and seedling growth of <i>E</i>. <i>indica</i>, followed by stem extract and then root extract. A total of 47 published allelochemicals, including coumarin, 4-hydroxybenzoate, salicylic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and vanillic acid, were identified in the leaf extract. Among the five allelochemicals, coumarin was found to be present in the highest concentration in the leaf extract. Furthermore, coumarin exhibited a significantly greater inhibitory effect on <i>E</i>. <i>indica</i> (EC<sub>50</sub> = 36.87 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) than did the other allelochemicals (EC<sub>50</sub> = 100.87–156.30 mg L<sup>−1</sup>).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study indicates that the leaf extracts of <i>B</i>. <i>latifolia</i> and their allelochemicals have excellent potential as bioherbicides and that coumarin is one of the key allelochemicals in <i>B</i>. <i>latifolia</i>. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Tai‐Jie Zhang, \nWenlei Guo, \nXingshan Tian, \nYin‐Zhi Lv, \nKai‐Fan Feng, \nChun Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"ad68584e05fac9777a1c63d266131e7f776a766f3c8a87833ed3f14102bcf8f2","category":"Environment"}
