{"title":"Rabies Virus Presence in the Brain of Suspected Rabid, Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Dogs: Implications for Rabies Control in Ghana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202309.0650/v2","date":1716976230000,"content":"Rabies is a viral zoonotic disease caused by the lyssavirus and endemic to most tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. This study reports on the occurrence of rabies in dogs and relates the results to the vaccination status of the dogs. A total of each of the 50 brain and 50 saliva samples from 100 dogs were tested for Lyssavirus using RT-PCR and visualized using gel electrophoresis. Additionally, a histopathological diagnosis of rabies was made on the brain samples. A lyssavirus positivity of 34 % was realized with 29/50 from brain and 5/50 from saliva being positive for rabies. Statistical significance was associated with vaccination (p=0.011) and health (p=0.0) statuses and attack by a stray dog prior to exhibition of signs of rabies (p=0.002). The rabid positive dogs had bitten at least 15 humans and a dog before their demise. This study confirms vaccination as an effective tool for the prevention of rabies. However, elimination of the disease is possible if there is an established and effective collaboration between veterinary and human medicine through one health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d400327637a7bebd923ac7c0e5f06c86a6b9c4c601e446191c8609886a173558","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
