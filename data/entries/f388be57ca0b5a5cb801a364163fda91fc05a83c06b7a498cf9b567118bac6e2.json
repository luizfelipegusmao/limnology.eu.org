Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study with 501 individuals aged 35 to 75 years recruited from five health centers by random sampling stratified by age and sex (55.90±14.24 years, 49.70% men). HVA was determined in two steps. Step 1: Subjects with vascular damage to the carotid arteries or peripheral arterial disease were classified as non-HVA. Step 2: The study population was classified by age and sex using the percentiles of the vascular aging index (VAI), with VAI ≤p25 considered HVA and &gt;p25 considered non-HVA. The VAI was estimated using the following formula (VAI = (log (1.09) × 10 cIMT + log (1.14) cfPWV) × 39.1 + 4.76. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) was measured with the SphygmoCor® device and carotid intima-media thickness using Sonosite Micromax® ultrasound. Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence, alcohol and tobacco use were recorded through validated questionnaires. Physical activity was assessed with the ActiGraph-GT3X® accelerometer. Results: The mean VAI value was 61.23±12.86; (Men 63.47±13.75 and women 59.04±11.54; p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f388be57ca0b5a5cb801a364163fda91fc05a83c06b7a498cf9b567118bac6e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
