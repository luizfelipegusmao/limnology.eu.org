{"title":"Targeting divergent pathways in the nutritional management of depression","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1247/v1","date":1718710629000,"content":"Nutritional management of depression has long been discussed due to the perceived benefit of a nutritional product having less side effects than pharmaceutical agents. Candidate nutrients for managing depression include Vitamin D, B-vitamins, tryptophan, branch chain amino acids, probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, folate/methylfolate (aka Vitamin B9), and s-adenosylmethionine. \nThis paper reviews three nutrients which have significant scientific support for the management of depression and have evidence of low levels in subjects with depression, and that correction of the nutritional deficiency provides clinical benefit. We present epidemiological evidence, mechanistic explanation and a review of interventional studies for these nutrients. Finally, relevant nutritional guidelines are presented with their conclusion for the role of each nutrient in the management of depression.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1c555046c72b5aed13addc1d10b67a5c48f47840b789e59d791df7e8bb7d212","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
