{"title":"Inter-Organellar Effects of Defective ER-Localized Linolenic Acid Formation on Thylakoid Lipid Composition, Non-Photochemical Quenching of Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Xanthophyll Cycle Activity in the Arabidopsis fad3 Mutant","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/doi/10.1093/pcp/pcad141/7441135?rss=1","date":1699401600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is the main lipid constituent of thylakoids and a structural component of photosystems and photosynthesis-related proteo-lipid complexes in green tissues. Previously reported changes in MGDG abundance upon stress treatments are hypothesized to reflect mobilization of MGDG-based polyunsaturated lipid intermediates to maintain extraplastidial membrane integrity. While exchange of lipid intermediates between compartmental membranes is well documented, physiological consequences of mobilizing an essential thylakoid lipid, such as MGDG, for an alternative purpose are not well understood. <span>Arabidopsis</span> seedlings exposed to mild (50 mM) salt treatment displayed significantly increased abundance of both MGDG and the extraplastidial lipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC). Interestingly, similar increases in MGDG and PC were observed in <span>Arabidopsis fad3</span> mutant seedlings defective in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–localized linolenic acid formation, in which compensatory plastid-to-ER-directed mobilization of linolenic acid–containing intermediates takes place. The postulated (salt) or evident (<span>fad3</span>) plastid–ER exchange of intermediates concurred with altered thylakoid function according to parameters of photosynthetic performance. While salt treatment of wild-type seedlings inhibited photosynthetic parameters in a dose-dependent manner, interestingly, untreated <span>fad3</span> mutants did not show overall reduced photosynthetic quantum yield. By contrast, we observed a reduction specifically of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under high light, representing only part of observed salt effects. The decreased NPQ in the <span>fad3</span> mutant was accompanied by reduced activity of the xanthophyll cycle, leading to a reduced concentration of the NPQ-effective pigment zeaxanthin. The findings suggest that altered ER-located fatty acid unsaturation and ensuing inter-organellar compensation impacts on the function of specific thylakoid enzymes, rather than globally affecting thylakoid function.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"afe9d2020c52d92e6c2bc892c3b25dfb605b5ff0c3618d51e30d9d1b575bd9bc","category":"Environment"}
