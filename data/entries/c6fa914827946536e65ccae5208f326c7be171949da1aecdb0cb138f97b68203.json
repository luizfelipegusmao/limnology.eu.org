{"title":"Italian Validation of the Children&rsquo;s Attributional Style Questionnaire-Revised: Psychometric Properties and Cluster Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1186/v1","date":1715953294000,"content":"There is evidence that the tendency to adopt a particular pattern of causal inference, known as attributional style, is likely to be associated with specific pattern of psychopathology among youth. This study aims to assess preliminary psychometric properties of the Italian Childrenâ€™s Attributional Style Questionnaire-Revised (CASQ-R) and to explore the presence of any subgroups of children and early adolescents from the general population who might exhibit internally homogeneous and externally heterogeneous attributional styles, through cluster analyses, delving also potential sociodemographic and clinical differences among the identified clusters of attributional styles. A sample of 337 children was recruited and their attributional styles and depressive symptoms were analyzed. Four distinct clusters emerged using the six CASQ-R subscales in a multivariate finite mixture model. In particular, high levels of depressive symptoms were reported by children showing high scores in all the negative attributional subscales (globality, internality and stability) and medium scores in all the positive attributional subscales. Conversely, low levels of depressive symptoms were reported by children showing medium-to-high scores in the positive attributional subscales and low-to-medium scores in the negative attributional subscales. The identified clusters shed light on distinct patterns associated with depressive symptoms, offering potential insights for targeted interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6fa914827946536e65ccae5208f326c7be171949da1aecdb0cb138f97b68203","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
