{"title":"Water Quality Benefits of Porous Pavement on Major Arterial Roads","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0598/v1","date":1723099746000,"content":"Stormwater runoff from large roads is a major source of pollutants to receiving waters. Porous pavements have been shown to substantially reduce many of these pollutants, but studies are lacking on arterial roads. We sampled typical stormwater pollutants in runoff from sections of an arterial road 9-16 years after installation of three pavement types: control with conventional asphalt, porous asphalt overly, and full-depth porous asphalt. Both types of porous pavements substantially reduced most of the stormwater pollutants measured. Total suspended solids, turbidity, total lead, total copper, and 6PPD-quinone were all reduced by &amp;gt;75%. Total nitrogen, ammonia, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, total and dissolved copper, total mercury, total zinc, total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate were all reduced by &amp;gt;50%. Reductions were lower or absent for nitrate, orthophosphate, E. coli, dissolved lead, and dissolved zinc. Most reductions were statistically significant. Many pollutants exceeded applicable water quality standards in the control samples but met them with both types of porous pavement. This study demonstrates that porous overlays and full-depth porous asphalt can provide substantial reductions of several priority stormwater pollutants on arterial roads for many years after installation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b84d8fb704249c85e1fcfd248888c21263295dda389934aafbb661fae64235c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
