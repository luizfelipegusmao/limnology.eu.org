{"title":"How Safe are COVID-19 Vaccines in Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases? The SUCCEED Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0311/v1","date":1722851524000,"content":"We were tasked by Canada’s COVID-19 Immunity Task Force to describe severe adverse events (SAE) associated with emergency department (ED) visits and/or hospitalizations in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). At 8 Canadian centres, data were collected from adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (AxS), systemic lupus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We administered questionnaires, analyzing SAEs experienced within 31 days following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. About two-thirds (63%) of 1556 participants were female; mean age was 52.5 years. BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine was the most common, with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) being second. Forty-nine percent of participants had IBD, 27.4% RA, 14.3% PsA, 5.3% SpA, and 4% SLE. Twelve SAEs leading to ED visit or hospitalization were self-reported, occurring in 11 participants.  SAEs included 6 ED visits (including one Bell’s Palsy 31 days after first vaccination) and 6 hospitalizations (including one Guillain-Barré syndrome 15 days after the first vaccination). Two SAEs involved pericarditis, one in SLE (considered a serious disease flare) and one in RA. Thus, in the 31 days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IMID, though several serious AEs occurred, these were relatively few. As SARS-CoV2 continues to be a common cause of death, our findings may help optimize vaccination acceptance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a473523308820d0711e5c988ab4ec581c85a159373e4e9fd6c07fd03edb4c50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
