{"title":"Temporal variation of braided intensity and morphodynamic changes in a regulated braided river using 2D modeling and satellite images","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4268?af=R","date":1717390567000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The river morphology of a braided-type river is rather complex. High sediment transport rates and frequently changing discharges are the cause of dynamic planform evolution. Over the past few decades, scientific attention has been directed toward understanding the coexistence of alternating bars and the consequent emergence of confluences and divergences, all of which interact intricately with the process of bank erosion. It is still rather challenging to estimate or predict the total sediment transport rate in this type of river, especially by considering various hydrologic data and climate effects. This study is focused on the reach of the Devoll River in Albania, located upstream of the Banja dam. Understanding the morphodynamics of this river reach holds significance due to the expanding delta upstream of the dam reservoir. The objectives of the two-dimensional depth-averaged approach of the present study are to investigate the temporal variation of braided intensity of Devoll River and the effect of using a discharge hydrograph from hydrologic data compared to the regulated one from the upstream dam on the morphodynamics and sediment transport of the river. After evaluating various parameters such as 11 different sediment transport functions, the best results were reached for a cell size of 5 × 5 m<sup>2</sup>, Manning roughness coefficient of 0.03, Meyer-Peter and Müller's sediment function, Hayashi et al. (1980) hiding function, and Van Rijn bed roughness predictor in this study. In addition, the results of comparing satellite images and modeling the river from 2019 to 2023 show that the braided index decreased, and this can be due to the fact that the real scenario of the river has a regulated discharge compared to the non-regulated discharge from hydrologic data, in the mentioned period.</p>","author":"Behnam Balouchi, \nNils Rüther, \nKordula Schwarzwälder","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"fead3da6a5e55f580f1addb381e0e0f11703a27012ebc34da9cdf1cad92579c3","category":"Environment"}
