{"title":"Polarization Coupling between Ferroelectric Liquids and Ferroelectric Solids: Effects of the Fringing Field Profile","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0769/v1","date":1712812480000,"content":"Recent experiments devoted to characterizing the behavior of sessile ferroelectric liquid droplets on ferroelectric solid substrates, showed the existence of a droplet electromechanical Rayleigh-like instability. The instability is induced by the bulk polarization of the ferroelectric fluid which couples to the polarization of the underlying substrate through its fringing field and solid-fluid interface coupling. With the aim of characterizing this phenomenon, namely the coupling between the polarizations of a fluid and a solid material, we studied the behavior of ferroelectric liquid droplets confined between two solid substrates, arranged in different configurations realized so to generate fringing fields with different profiles. Results show that the features of the droplets instability are indeed affected by the specific fringing field shape in a way dominated by the minimization of the electrostatic energy associated to the bulk polarization of the ferroelectric fluid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"276c71e60acdb2d7a03fc1067aeea51d65162abdf5abf0729bfbd90e66434c72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
