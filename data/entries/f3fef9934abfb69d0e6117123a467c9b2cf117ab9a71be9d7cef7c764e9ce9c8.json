{"title":"Comparative Transcriptomic Reveals Greater Similarities in Response to Temperature Than to Invasive Alien Predator in the Damselfly Ischnura elegans Across Different Geographic Scales","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70002?af=R","date":1725606000000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The impact of global changes on populations may not be necessarily uniform across a species' range. Here, we aim at comparing the phenotypic and transcriptomic response to warming and an invasive predator cue in populations across different geographic scales in the damselfly <i>Ischnura elegans</i>. We collected adult females in two ponds in southern Poland (central latitude) and two ponds in southern Sweden (high latitude). We raised their larvae in growth chambers and exposed them to combination of temperature and a predator cue released by the crayfish <i>Orconectes limosus</i>. When larvae reached the prefinal larval stage, they were phenotyped for traits related to growth and size and collected for a gene expression analysis. High-latitude populations exhibited greater phenotypic and transcriptomic variation than central-latitude populations. Across latitudes and ponds, temperature generally increased growth rate and the predator cue decreased mass, but the effects of temperature were also pond-specific. Comparison of the transcriptomic profiles revealed a greater overlap in the response to temperature across latitudes and ponds, especially for pathway-related oxidative stress and sugar and lipid metabolism. The transcriptomic response to a predator cue and to the interaction temperature × predator cue was more pond-specific and overlapped only for few genes and pathways related to cuticle, development and signal transduction. We demonstrated that central- and high-latitude populations may partially respond through similar mechanisms to warming and, to a lower extent to a predator cue and to the interaction temperature × predator cue. For the predator cue and the interaction, the large fraction of ponds-specific genes suggests local adaptation. We show that high-latitude populations were generally more plastic at the phenotypic and transcriptomic level and may be more capable to cope with environmental changes than their central-latitude counterparts.</p>","author":"Guillaume Wos, \nGemma Palomar, \nMarzena Marszałek, \nSzymon Sniegula","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"f3fef9934abfb69d0e6117123a467c9b2cf117ab9a71be9d7cef7c764e9ce9c8","category":"Environment"}
