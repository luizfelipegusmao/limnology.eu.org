{"title":"Preliminary Evaluation of Performance, Cost and Environmental Sustainability of a LH2‚ÄêPowered Narrow Body Aircraft","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1506/v1","date":1721306509000,"content":"The commercial aviation industry is constantly evolving, driven by technological innovation and the growing demand for more efficient and environmental friendly transportation solutions. In this context, the design and development of next-generation aircraft is a crucial task, with the goal of reducing environmental impact and improving flight efficiency while continuing to ensure passenger comfort and safety. This paper aims at evaluating the technical feasibility as well as economic and environmental viability of a narrow body aircraft powered by hydrogen for direct combustion. Notably, the paper offers innovative insights regarding the update of literature models for conceptual design, in order to consider the impact of hydrogen fuel on the sizing loop at aircraft level. Moreover, it also focuses on the evaluation of operating costs for the aforementioned aircraft class, highlighting the required model updates and considerations to properly match the effect on costs of the introduction of the innovative fuel. Ultimately, a preliminary analysis of upstream sustainability of the concept, considering fuel life cycle, is provided, in order to understand the overall competitiveness, not only in terms of monetary resources but also of environmental impact, beyond the pure operating life of the airplane.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"150b5ad4c14b23c47b2418e1590a2ad9bfe2d37630882a3bfca4ab549d75f306","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
