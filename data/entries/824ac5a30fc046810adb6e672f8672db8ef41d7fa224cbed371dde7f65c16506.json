{"title":"Investigation of the effect of water and feed sourced boron on the growth performance and blood parameters of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13104?af=R","date":1728723615000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigated the effects of water and feed-derived boron on the growth performance and blood parameters of Nile tilapia fingerlings. Two different experiments were designed for this purpose. The first phase of the study determined the LC<sub>50</sub> (96-h) value of boron for Nile tilapia. Fish were then fed in water containing boron at a ratio of 1:20 of the LC<sub>50</sub> value. In the second experiment, feed containing boron at different rates (0.00%, 0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.10%) was fed for 40 days. At the end of the feeding period, growth performance, hematology, and blood biochemistry parameters were determined. The study concluded with a calculated LC<sub>50</sub> value of 161.053 mg/L boron for Nile tilapia. The initial weight was 12.51 ± 0.79 g; at the end of feeding, the final weights were determined as 26.36 ± 0.15 g for the control and 28.07 ± 0.23, 32.28 ± 0.25 and 24.81 ± 0.48 g for 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.10% of boron feed treatments, respectively. At the end of feeding in water containing boron, the final weight of Nile tilapia was determined as 24.26 ± 0.26 g (LC<sub>50</sub>/20%). The results showed that feeding Nile tilapia with 0.05% boron-supplemented feed stimulated growth and positively affected blood parameters, whereas waterborne boron inhibited Nile tilapia growth and negatively affected blood parameters.</p>","author":"Mustafa Çelik, \nSuat Dikel, \nMustafa Öz","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"824ac5a30fc046810adb6e672f8672db8ef41d7fa224cbed371dde7f65c16506","category":"Environment"}
