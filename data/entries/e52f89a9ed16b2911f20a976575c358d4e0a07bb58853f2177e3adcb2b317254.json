Undertaking a rigorous adaptation process, this investigation aimed to ensure the questionnaire’s relevance and intelligibility, subsequently, assessing its psychometric properties within a cohort of 387 participants. The exploratory factor analysis revealed a tripartite structure that reflects the original instrument, covering utilitarian use, hedonic and social use, and the inclination to delegate tasks. This congruity underscores the STP-Q’s adeptness in capturing the complex dimensions of smart tool interaction across various contexts. Demonstrated by a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.954 and a test-retest reliability index of 0.851, the results affirm the questionnaire’s exceptional internal consistency and significant temporal stability. Further, the execution of convergent validity assessments alongside the E-Learning Readiness Scale and the Nomophobia Questionnaire augmented the STP-Q’s validity, unveiling correlations that delineate the intricate interrelations among smart tool proneness, e-learning readiness, and nomophobia. Conclusively, the STP-Q distinguishes itself as a reliable and valid instrument for gauging tendencies towards smart tool use among the Turkish populace, providing profound insights into digital behavior across different cultural backgrounds. Its confirmed three-factor structure and robust psychometric attributes render it an indispensable resource for both individual assessments and expansive digital behavior investigations, enabling cross-cultural comparisons and enhancing our understanding of technology engagement dynamics.","author":"Serdar Yılmaz Esen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e52f89a9ed16b2911f20a976575c358d4e0a07bb58853f2177e3adcb2b317254","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
