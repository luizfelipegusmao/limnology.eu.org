{"title":"From Mind to Plate to Pillow: Examining the Interplay of Mental Health, Eating Disorders, and Sleep Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1141/v1","date":1713348208000,"content":"In the contemporary accelerated pace of life, emphasizing the importance of sleep quality is essential for enhancing overall well-being and health. This study investigates the link between poor sleep quality and key factors affecting wellness, such as mental health and eating disorders. Through a cross-sectional analysis involving 407 participants, utilizing established measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS), and the single-item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS), data was collected and analyzed using SPSS v28 and R-Statistics. The findings reveal a significant correlation (p&amp;lt;0.05) between DASS-21, EDE-QS, and SQS, indicating that individuals experiencing poor sleep quality exhibit higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, multinomial logistic regression analysis highlights low sleep quality as a risk factor for both mental health (OR: 1.071, 95% CI: 1.042, 1.102, p&amp;lt;0.05, low vs. high sleep quality), and eating disorders (OR: 1.047, 95% CI: 1.004, 1.092, p&amp;lt;0.05, low vs. high sleep quality). Overall, these results underscore the critical role of sleep quality in mental health and suggest insomnia as a predictive factor for both poor mental well-being and disordered eating habits. Further research through randomized controlled trials is warranted to validate the findings of this cross-sectional study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdbedc81a106b9039c3510cf7f266cbe7f2c602eaa13b5a4c6c9dd321a8ca07e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
