{"title":"Molecular Docking Analysis, of Natural Compounds from Cold-Pressed and Essential Oils, Against Human Papillomavirus (HPV): Therapeutic Implications for Gynecological Viral Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0987/v1","date":1723619256000,"content":"This study investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ethnobotanical knowledge to identify natural compounds with potent antiviral activity against HPV-16. Through molecular docking simulations, we evaluated the binding affinities of various essential oil components, in-cluding Apigenin, against the key antigenic determinants of HPV-16 (E6, E7 oncoproteins, and L1 major capsid protein). Apigenin exhibited strong binding affinities, particularly to E6 Oncopro-tein. To further enhance these findings, we employed an AI-driven reverse engineering approach to predict a natural compound with superior efficacy. The AI identified Luteolin, a flavonoid with additional hydroxyl groups, as a promising candidate. Comparative docking studies demon-strated that Luteolin possesses significantly stronger binding affinities to all three HPV-16 targets, surpassing the efficacy of Apigenin. This work highlights the potential of AI in accelerating the discovery and optimization of natural antiviral agents, providing a powerful tool for pharmaco-logical and ethnopharmacological screenings. Our findings suggest that AI-guided identification of natural compounds can lead to the development of more effective antiviral therapies, warranting further experimental validation and potential synthesis in laboratory settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48dc4ebba9a75ad238f2d988caa4921b957180e0045cc3d43c780066c8f3557b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
