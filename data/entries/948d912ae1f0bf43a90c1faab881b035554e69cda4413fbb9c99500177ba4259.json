{"title":"Proteolysis in plant immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3099/7667908?rss=1","date":1715212800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Compared with transcription and translation, protein degradation machineries can act faster and be targeted to different subcellular compartments, enabling immediate regulation of signaling events. It is therefore not surprising that proteolysis has been used extensively to control homeostasis of key regulators in different biological processes and pathways. Over the past decades, numerous studies have shown that proteolysis, where proteins are broken down to peptides or amino acids through ubiquitin-mediated degradation systems and proteases, is a key regulatory mechanism to control plant immunity output. Here, we briefly summarize the roles various proteases play during defence activation, focusing on recent findings. We also update the latest progress of ubiquitin-mediated degradation systems in modulating immunity by targeting plant membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors, intracellular nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat receptors, and downstream signaling components. Additionally, we highlight recent studies showcasing the importance of proteolysis in maintaining broad-spectrum resistance without obvious yield reduction, opening new directions for engineering elite crops that are resistant to a wide range of pathogens with high yield.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"948d912ae1f0bf43a90c1faab881b035554e69cda4413fbb9c99500177ba4259","category":"Environment"}
