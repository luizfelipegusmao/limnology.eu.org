{"title":"Telling Tales (Tails): Factors Associated with Older People&rsquo;s Anxiety Symptom Positioning after COVID-19","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1049/v1","date":1723627046000,"content":"This study sheds light on personal characteristics of and the coping strategies that older Canadians self-identifying as severely anxious post-COVID-19 were more and less prone to gravitate to. Our studied sample consisted of 606 older people residing in 10 Canadian provinces. Participants completed the Geriatric Anxiety Scale â€“ 10 and a personal checklist of everyday coping strategies for mitigating anxiety. Severely anxious older Canadians tended to be in their 60s, and in poor to fair health. They were not significantly more likely to be women or to be chronically ill, nor to self-identify as non-binary or as having a life partner. Older Canadians experiencing severe anxiety were, however, far more likely to normalize their fear and anxiety, challenge their worries, and to relax or meditate. They were less inclined to decrease other sources of stress in their lives, to stay active, and to get enough sleep. We offer anticipatory guidance for mental health program planners and practitioners, and researchers, fruitful avenues of inquiry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e24071c9070a37479c32b7117c2da9a3842214e547418051f134b0e4d1da7a3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
