{"title":"Crosslinked All-Femtosecond laser-cut Corneal Allogenic Intracorneal Ring Segments (AFXL CAIRS): Pilot Ex-Vivo and In-Vivo Study in Italy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1945/v1","date":1724771379000,"content":"Purpose: This pilot ex-vivo study and first clinical experience in Italy evaluate the impact of using pre-implantation crosslinking on all-femtosecond laser-cut corneal allogenic intracorneal ring segments (AFXL CAIRS).  \nMethods: Six human donor eye-bank corneas were used for the preclinical ex-vivo human study. Three corneas were used for AFXL CAIRS. First, they were prepared (D) with the IntraLase™ femtosecond laser (Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA). The allogenic tissue rings were crosslinked before implantation with Riboflavin -UV-A accelerated crosslinking protocol (ACXL) with a 0.1% HPMC Riboflavin isotonic solution (Vibex Rapid, Glaukos-Avedro, USA) and the new KXL UV-A emitter (Glaukos-Avedro, USA). Three corneas were used as recipients (R) of the AFXL CAIRS. After completing the ex-vivo phase, the first two Italian patients were treated. A single ACXL CAIRS was implanted in a 51-year-old male with 53.53 D K steep, 363 m minimum corneal thickness (MCT) and a double ACXL CAIRS was implanted in a 46-year-old male patient with 58.30 D K steep and 443 m MCT. The follow-up was at three months.  \nResults: Crosslinking of the segments enhanced tissue strength and grip, facilitating manipulation and CAIRS insertion into the recipient tunnels and the yellowish color of the crosslinked segments improved visibility. The segment’s thickness and volume remained unaltered during the follow-up. Both patients improved UDVA and BSCVA. K steep and HOAs were reduced and MCT increased. \nConclusions Pre-implantation ACXL facilitated CAIRS insertion by increasing the viscoelastic consistency without altering physical characteristics and volume during the follow-up, rendering this important step a promising candidate in method standardization. Functional data and MCT improved significantly without adverse events.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e58b6d95452f369f74996699f11df305d594b90bd039cdbe0f0942d19001e14f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
