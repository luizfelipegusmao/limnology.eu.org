{"title":"Construction of a Second-Countable Treon Space From a New Metric Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1483/v1","date":1721291463000,"content":"Bermejo Algebras, which consist of Algebra B and Treon Algebra, are non-associative and unital algebraic structures that introduce new complex entities. Recently, a Hausdorff space associated with the space where these algebras act was defined. We constructed a second-countable treon space utilizing a novel metric derived from these algebras. We defined topological spaces and established a metric to prove the second-countable property within Bermejo Algebras. Our findings contribute to the construction of manifolds in treon spaces by defining a countable base using the density of rationals in the real numbers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49a272892fcf6e4f7c7b5d132445df545aed364eaa6e9f82daeebebf2dd92d5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
