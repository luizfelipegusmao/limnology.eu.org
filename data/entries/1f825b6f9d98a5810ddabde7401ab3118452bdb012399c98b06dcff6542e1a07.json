{"title":"Understanding the Importance of Daily Imaging in the Treatment of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer with Image Guided Superficial Radiation Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0109/v1","date":1711976306000,"content":": Image guided superficial radiation therapy (IGSRT) combines superficial radiation therapy (SRT) with full dermal visualization (FDV) via high resolution dermal ultrasound (HRDUS) for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The gold standard for IGSRT delivery includes a comprehensive cancer care model with support for the dermatologists by a multidisciplinary team. When delivered in this model, IGSRT can achieve cure rates of 99% for treatment of NMSC. This paper focuses on the benefits of IGSRT during therapy. Medical records from 7 dermatology clinics of 883 patients with 1,507 cases of NMSC treated with IGSRT be-tween 2017 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. 92% of the NMSC lesions showed daily depth fluctuations, 60.32% of lesions did not require changes during therapy, and nearly 40% of lesions required at least one compensatory change during therapy. 83% of NMSC lesions were labeled high-risk based on the 2024 NCCN guidelines. Increasing and decreasing tumor depth measurements during IGSRT inform dermatologists when adaptive changes in energy (kV), TDF and dose will result in more efficacy and less toxicity, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f825b6f9d98a5810ddabde7401ab3118452bdb012399c98b06dcff6542e1a07","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
