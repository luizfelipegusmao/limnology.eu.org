This study aimed to investigate the role of the SEMA4B gene in Cr(VI)-mediated malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. In our population survey of workers, the geometric mean [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of Cr in blood was 3.80 (0.42, 26.56) μg/L. Following treatment with various doses of Cr(VI), it was found that 0.5 μM had negligible effects on the cell viability of BEAS-2B cells. The expression of SEMA4B was observed to decrease in BEAS-2B cells after 7 days of treatment with 0.5 μM Cr(VI), and this downregulation continued with increasing passages of Cr(VI) treatment. Chronic exposure to 0.5 μM Cr(VI) enhanced the anchorage-independent growth ability of BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, the use of a methylation inhibitor suppressed the Cr(VI)-mediated anchorage-independent growth in BEAS-2B cells. Considering that Cr levels exceeding 0.5 μM can be found in human blood due to occupational exposure, the results suggested a potential carcinogenic risk associated with occupational Cr(VI) exposure through the promotion of malignant transformation. The in vitro study further demonstrated that Cr(VI) exposure might inhibit the expression of the SEMA4B gene to promote the malignant transformation of BEAS-2B cells.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"28fc0dc32ecfff8c356b850bda33907ea5943ff6ecfa83b7b7e4eeba69a4c5b4","category":"Environment"}
