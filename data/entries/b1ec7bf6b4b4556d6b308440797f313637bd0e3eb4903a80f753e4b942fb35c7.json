{"title":"Validation of a Mid-fidelity Numerical Approach for Wind Turbine Aerodynamics Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0747/v2","date":1710991171000,"content":"This work is aimed at investigating the capabilities and limits of the mid-fidelity numerical solver DUST for the evaluation of wind turbines aerodynamic performance. In particular, this study was conducted by analysing the benchmarks NREL- 5MW and Phase VI wind turbines, widely investigated in literature by from experimental and numerical activities. The work started by simulating simpler configuration of the NREL- 5MW turbine to progressively integrate complexities such as shaft tilt, cone effects and yawed inflow conditions, offering a detailed portrayal of their collective impact on turbine performance. A particular focus was then given to the evaluation of aerodynamic responses from the tower and nacelle, as well as aerodynamic behavior in yawed inflow condition, crucial for optimizing farm layouts. In the second phase, the work was focused on NREL Phase VI turbine due to the availability of experimental data on this benchmark case. Comparison of DUST simulations results with both experimental data and high-fidelity CFD tools shows the robustness and adaptability of this mid-fidelity solver for this applications, thus opening a new scenario for the use of such mid-fidelity tools for the preliminary design of novel wind turbines configurations or complex environments as wind farms, characterised by robust interactional aerodynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1ec7bf6b4b4556d6b308440797f313637bd0e3eb4903a80f753e4b942fb35c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
