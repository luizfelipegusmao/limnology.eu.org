{"title":"Building conceptual and methodological bridges between SSE’s diversity, equity, and inclusion statement and educational actions in evolutionary biology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/5/809/7617404?rss=1","date":1709251200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The field of evolutionary biology must bridge the gap between its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) commitments and data-driven educational actions in the nation’s undergraduate classrooms and degree programs. In this article, we discuss the urgent need for the adoption of <span>equity frameworks</span> and why they are centrally important to data-driven DEI efforts in evolutionary biology. We describe why <span>equity indicators</span> (e.g., measures) must be anchored in and aligned with equity frameworks. We introduce a specific equity framework for learning (the enhanced educational debt framework) and illustrate how it may be leveraged to document, interpret, and improve outcomes in evolutionary biology. We apply the equity framework and associated indicators to &gt;3,500 students’ first college-level experience with evolutionary biology at a public, 4-year institution in the Northeastern United States to demonstrate how these conceptual tools and empirical perspectives may be used by faculty, departments, and degree programs to better understand their roles in mitigating or perpetuating inequities. We end by discussing how this framework may be applied to a range of evolution concepts and courses in the educational hierarchy and used to help evolutionary biologists better understand the extent to which a core aspect of SSE’s diversity statement is being realized.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"e55efc82d482a7db22eab5cd4fe11cfeb94994704203e0b4f6a427fdc4987186","category":"Environment"}
