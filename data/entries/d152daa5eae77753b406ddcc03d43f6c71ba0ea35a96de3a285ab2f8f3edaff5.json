{"title":"Diagnostic Role of MDCT in Acute Mesenteric Ischemia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0860/v1","date":1715603506000,"content":"Mesenteric ischemia diagnosis is challenging with an overall mortality in up to 50% of cases despite advances in treatment. The main problem that affects the outcome is the delayed diagnosis because of non-specific clinical presentation.\nMulti Detector CT Angiography (MDCTA) is the first line investigation for the suspected diagnosis of vascular abdominal pathologies and is the diagnostic test of choice in suspected mesenteric bowel ischemia. MDCTA can accurately detect the presence of arterial and venous thrombosis, determine the extension and the gastrointestinal tract involved, and provide detailed information determining the subtype and the stage progression of the diseases helping clinicians and surgeons for the proper management. CT can differentiate forms that are still susceptible to pharmacological or interventional treatment (NOM= non-operative management) from advanced disease with transmural necrosis in which a surgical approach is required. Knowledge of CT imaging patterns and corresponding vascular pathways is mandatory in Emergency settings to reach a prompt and accurate diagnosis. The aims of this paper are 1. to provide technical information about the optimal CTA protocol; 2. To empathize the CTA arterial and venous supply to gastrointestinal tract and relative ischemic pattern; 3. To describe vascular, bowel and extraintestinal CT findings for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d152daa5eae77753b406ddcc03d43f6c71ba0ea35a96de3a285ab2f8f3edaff5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
