{"title":"Implementation of learning management systems (Moodle): effects on students&rsquo; language acquisition and attitudes towards learning English as a Foreign Language","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0878/v1","date":1710454710000,"content":"Among the most popular learning management systems available worldwide is Moodle [1]. This current study examines how learners' attitudes toward English as a foreign language (EFL) and their language proficiency are affected by Moodle's interactive language learning activities. Thirty-three undergraduate students participated in this study. We investigated the effects of engaging language learning exercises that were practiced on Moodle using an experimental re-search design. To find out if the experimental and control groups differed significantly from one another on pre- and post-measures regarding the development of language skills and attitudes toward language classrooms, a number of statistical tests were employed. We conducted data analysis using SPSS software. Results demonstrated that there were differences favoring the ex-perimental group in the language skills developments and attitudes of learners toward the lan-guage classroom. There were no apparent differences in the forming structures, speaking, or listening of the control group's learners. On the other hand, there were notable differences in the overall score, writing and reading skills, and lexical item mastery. Additionally, significant dif-ferences in the language acquisition growth of the experimental and control groups were found using an Independent Samples T-test in the post-test, with the experimental group benefiting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbb093eb8af3278bc45bcee24aafe8398bfe28354b430b0b8974f1d287ac1e93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
