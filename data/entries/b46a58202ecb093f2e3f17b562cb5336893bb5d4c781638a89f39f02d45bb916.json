{"title":"Control of the Properties of the Voronoi Tessellation Technique and Biomimetic Patterns: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1782/v1","date":1721734938000,"content":"The cellular behavior of Voronoi tessellation has generated interest due to its applicability in various fields and its notable structural properties. Controlling factors such as the gradient of the cells, the position of seed points and the thickness of the arms allows for adjusting rigidity and flexibility according to specific needs. This article analyzes the state of the art of this technique, exploring its modification for applications in engineering and design, complemented with information on natural structural properties. This comprehensive analysis provides a complete overview of Voronoi tessellation and its potential in engineering and design, categorizing methodologies according to selected processing methods and highlighting techniques for altering structural behavior. Additionally, it emphasizes the integration of biomimetic approaches, connecting nature with technology to foster continuous innovation. Finally, the article addresses encountered limitations, offering future perspectives for the cellular technique and highlights the complexity of reproducibility due to reserved or generalized steps, despite the significant diversity in implemented techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b46a58202ecb093f2e3f17b562cb5336893bb5d4c781638a89f39f02d45bb916","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
