{"title":"Differences in Physical Activity and Self-Rated Health Levels Based on Satisfaction with Physical Environment of Local Communities: From School to Lifelong Physical Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0397/v1","date":1725527720000,"content":"In Korea, substantial disparities exist in physical environments across regions, exacerbating the polarization between metropolitan and provincial areas, and urban and rural regions. This study examines the differences in physical activity and self-rated health of local communities in relation to satisfaction with the physical environment. By identifying and addressing these underlying causes of health disparities, the study provides foundational data to inform policy efforts. The study utilized data from the 2023 Community Health Survey conducted by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. It included 231,752 individuals aged 19 and older (105,754 men and 125,998 women) selected through a two-stage probability proportional systematic sampling method. One-on-one online interviews were conducted from May 16 to July 31, 2023. Physical environment was assessed based on public satisfaction with safety, natural and living environments, public transportation, and medical services. Study variables included subjective health status and physical activity, with sub-variables for physical activity encompassing the duration of vigorous and moderate physical activity, walking, and flexibility exercises. For data analysis, MANOVA and ANOVA were conducted, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Considerable variations in physical activity were observed based on satisfaction with the local community environment. Regarding self-rated health, significant differences were found in safety levels, living environment, and medical services. Satisfaction with the physical environment positively influenced physical activity and self-rated health. Therefore, it is imperative to reduce disparities in the physical environment between regions and enhance residents' satisfaction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72e1b5bf0b59adae70c9c42b55afc97a6b8303acb6a36d90de148674ac214181","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
