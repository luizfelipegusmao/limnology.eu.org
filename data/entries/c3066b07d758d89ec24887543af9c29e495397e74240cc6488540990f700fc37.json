{"title":"Human Salivary Microbiota Diversity According to Ethnicity, Sex, TRPV1 Variants and Sensitivity to Capsaicin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0184/v1","date":1727946122000,"content":"The salivary microbiota of Italian and sub-Saharan African individuals was investigated using Nanopore Sequencing Technology (ONT- Oxford Nanopore Technologies). We detected variations in community composition in relation to endogenous (ethnicity, sex and diplotypic variants of the TRPV1 gene) and exogenous (sensitivity to capsaicin) factors. The results showed that, Prevotella, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Streptococcus, Veillonella and Rothia, are the most abundant genera, in accordance with the literature. However, alpha diversity and frequency spectra differed significantly between DNA pools. The microbiota in African, male, TRPV1 bb/ab diplotype and capsaicin low sensitive DNA pools was more diverse than Italian, female, TRPV1 aa diplotype and capsaicin high sensitive DNA pools. Relative abundance differed at phylum, genus and species level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c3066b07d758d89ec24887543af9c29e495397e74240cc6488540990f700fc37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
