{"title":"Green Hydrogen Integration for Decarbonization: Solving Challenges in &ldquo;Hard-to-Abate&rdquo; Sectors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0271/v1","date":1714977618000,"content":"The energy transition is a challenge that affects all sectors, from transport to civil structures and industry. With reference to the industrial sector, the greatest need is the decarbonisation of industries energy-intensive, such as producers of iron and steel, aluminium, cement, petrochemicals, paper, etc. In particular, the steel industry is a hard to abate high-emissivity industry which due to chemical processes and high thermal demands (often above 500 Â°C) contributed to 7.4% of global CO2 in the year 2021. This paper has explored the potential applications of hydrogen in the hard-to-abate sectors, highlighting its versatility and significance in decarbonization efforts. It provides an overview of hydrogen production methods, emphasizing the importance of sustainable and green hydrogen production. It reviews hydrogen production methods, storage, and potential in blended combustion. In the final part of the article, some considerations are introduced on the possible role of hydrogen in the steel sector (both as a supplementary fuel and as a reducing agent in innovative processes), showing how although there is potential for its inclusion as an element for the decarbonization, it is necessary to evaluate the energy balances of the various processes and the methods of hydrogen production very carefully, in order not to risk obtaining a marginal effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d79e27b4e11823a9d9f208c02ec34758a1dce372d1727f5ddff7fde124a65c0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
