{"title":"149 Using respiratory gas flux and backward dietary energy partitioning to estimate energy intake by beef cattle fed a high concentrate diet","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/76/7617991?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Twelve Charolais steers (BW = 498 ± 47.4 kg) were used in a 73-d feeding experiment. Our objective was to determine if CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and O<sub>2</sub> consumption could be used as biomarkers to estimate energy intake in growing beef cattle when integrated with backward dietary energy partitioning calculations when fed a high concentrate diet. Steers were housed in a pen equipped with individual feed bunks with access to an automated head chamber system (AHCS; GreenFeed, C-Lock, Inc., Rapid City, SD). Steers were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments according to DMI as multiple of maintenance, which are 1.1 (1.1 M, n = 4), 1.4 (1.4 M, n = 4), and 1.8 (1.8 M, n = 4). The diet fed was 35% chopped sorghum hay (CP = 6.39% of DM; in vitro OM digestibility = 57.77%) and 65% concentrate (CP = 19.10% of DM; in vitro OM digestibility = 91.84%). The concentrate consisted of 41.75% flaked corn, 8.5% cottonseed meal, 13% distillers’ grain and 1.75% limestone. Steers were supplemented daily with 0.85 kg of alfalfa pellets (Medicago sativa; CP= 16.55%; in vitro OM digestibility = 87.01%) that were fed through the AHCS as bait. Methane tended (P = 0.09) and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and O<sub>2</sub> consumption (P &lt; 0.01) increased with the increasing feeding rates. Measured gross energy (GE; 21.9, 24.8, 29.5 Mcal/d, respectively), digestible energy (DE; 19.7, 22.0, 25.8 Mcal/d, respectively), and metabolizable energy (ME; 17.2, 19.2, 22.7 Mcal/d, respectively) intake levels increased with the increases in energy retention and heat production. The predicted values for GE (17.4, 23.6, 28.2 Mcal/d), DE (15.1, 20.8, 24.4 Mcal/d), and ME (12.6, 17.9, 21.3 Mcal/d) intake rates increased with the increase from 1.1 M to 1.8 M. Comparison of measured and predicted GE, DE, and ME intake rates agreed closely (r = 0.95, 0.93, 0.92 Pearson correlation, respectively). This experiment shows that together with multiple short-term breath measurements from an AHCS, BW, and an estimate of average daily gain, GE, DE, and ME intakes by cattle consuming a high concentrate diet can be predicted.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"42a4229906a8994fb10eb91889d9cd9d954d1297bed9d6a53d0ae1c4b9ab4fea","category":"Environment"}
