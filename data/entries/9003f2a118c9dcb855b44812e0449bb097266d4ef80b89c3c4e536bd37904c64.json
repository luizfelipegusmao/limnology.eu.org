{"title":"Effect of Biological Pre-treatment with Cellulolytic Bacteria Consortium on Biogas Production from Crop Residues","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0278/v1","date":1725399442000,"content":"Biological pre-treatment holds much promise as an innovative and sustainable strategy to improve biogas production from crop residues. In the present study, a novel hot spring cellulolytic microbial consortium (HSCMC) was used to pre-treat crop residues, such as maize stover, wheat straw and soybean straw to improve biogas production by anaerobic digestion (AD). Results indicated that the ash and volatile solids in maize stover were significantly reduced by maximum values of 21.3 % and 69.2 % respectively, after 7 days of pre-treatment over non-treated residues. The maximum decline of 83.9 % in total solid content was reported in wheat straw. The total reducing sugar content was increased by maximum yields of 60.9 %, 96.3 % and 84.7 % in maize stover, wheat straw and soybean straw, respectively. Furthermore, the HSCMC consortium enhanced the cumulative methane yield of wheat straw, maize stover and soybean straw by 50.6 %, 50.2 % and 56.6 %, respectively. Increased methane yield from pre-treated crop residues implies that this method could be an economically viable option for large-scale valorization of the AD process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9003f2a118c9dcb855b44812e0449bb097266d4ef80b89c3c4e536bd37904c64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
