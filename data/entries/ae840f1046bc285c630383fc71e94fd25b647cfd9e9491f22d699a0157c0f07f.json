{"title":"Dynamic Covalent Boronic Acid-Functionalized Alginate/PVA Hydrogels for pH and Shear-Responsive Drug Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0984/v1","date":1720696126000,"content":"Herein, we investigated hydrogels composed of boronic Acid functionalized alginate and blended with polyvinyl alcohol of different molecular weights to control the release of metoclopramide hydrochloride (MTC) as a function of pH and shear stress. The functionalization of alginate introduced dynamic covalent bonding and pH-responsive properties that can modulate network connectivity. The study investigated the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels, their drug release profiles, and their responsiveness to changes in pH and shear forces. The results showed higher PVA molecular weight and alkaline pH conditions increased hydrogel viscosity and stiffness due to a more stable and interconnected network structure than acidic pH. Metoclopramide release revealed that the hydrogels exhibited pH-responsive drug release behavior. The drug was more readily released under acidic conditions due to the instability of sp2-hybridized boronate ester bonds. The influence of shear forces on the release of metoclopramide was also investigated at shear rates of 1, 10, and 100 s-1, revealing their effect on matrix stiffening. The research shows that AlgBA/PVA hydrogels have unique properties, such as dynamic covalent bonding, that make them sensitive to external mechanical forces. This sensitivity makes them ideal for applications where physiological conditions trigger drug release","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae840f1046bc285c630383fc71e94fd25b647cfd9e9491f22d699a0157c0f07f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
