{"title":"Deep learning-based stress detection for daily life use using single-channel EEG and GSR in a virtual reality interview paradigm","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305864","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Hun-gyeom Kim, Solwoong Song, Baek Hwan Cho, Dong Pyo Jang</p>\r\n\r\nThis research aims to establish a practical stress detection framework by integrating physiological indicators and deep learning techniques. Utilizing a virtual reality (VR) interview paradigm mirroring real-world scenarios, our focus is on classifying stress states through accessible single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) data. Thirty participants underwent stress-inducing VR interviews, with biosignals recorded for deep learning models. Five convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and one Vision Transformer model, including a multiple-column structure combining EEG and GSR features, showed heightened predictive capabilities and an enhanced area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in stress prediction compared to single-column models. Our experimental protocol effectively elicited stress responses, observed through fluctuations in stress visual analogue scale (VAS), EEG, and GSR metrics. In the single-column architecture, ResNet-152 excelled with a GSR AUROC of 0.944 (±0.027), while the Vision Transformer performed well in EEG, achieving peak AUROC values of 0.886 (±0.069) respectively. Notably, the multiple-column structure, based on ResNet-50, achieved the highest AUROC value of 0.954 (±0.018) in stress classification. Through VR-based simulated interviews, our study induced social stress responses, leading to significant modifications in GSR and EEG measurements. Deep learning models precisely classified stress levels, with the multiple-column strategy demonstrating superiority. Additionally, discreetly placing single-channel EEG measurements behind the ear enhances the convenience and accuracy of stress detection in everyday situations.","author":"Hun-gyeom Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6ae072999dc32af7a6610150ef74fa4c7d9ea30c97a7fc63dc656b2d99c73beb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
