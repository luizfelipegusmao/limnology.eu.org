{"title":"Multi-Timescale Reactive Power Optimization and Regulation Method for Distribution Networks Under Multisource Interaction Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1541/v1","date":1726746748000,"content":"In the context of constructing new power systems, distribution networks are increasingly incorporating distributed resources such as distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems, decentralized wind turbines (WT), and new types of energy storage system (ESS), which may lead to prominent issues such as voltage overruns and reverse heavy overloads in the distribution network. While distributed resources are valuable for voltage regulation, their regulation characteristics vary with their operation means, and the randomness and volatility of renewable power generation will also influence the optimization and regulation of voltage in the distribution network. This paper proposes a multi-time scale reactive power optimization and regulation method for distribution networks in a multi-source interactive environment. Firstly, the voltage regulation characteristics of distributed PV systems, decentralized ES, and distributed WT are analyzed. Based on this analysis, then a multi-time scale voltage optimization scheme for distribution networks using MPC method is proposed, which optimizes the voltage regulation strategies for each distributed resource in a rolling manner. Furthermore, an event-triggered real-time voltage zoning control strategy based on voltage sensitivity is proposed to address the real-time sudden voltage overlimit problems. The modified IEEE 33-node system is used to verify the performance of proposed method, simulation results indicate that the issue of voltage overruns at distribution network nodes has been improved, and the intraday rolling optimization yields results that are more realistic compared to the day-ahead optimization method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7826aa79a887243de36a2ccd47fb425496164c71e8f41faf3392fa820b1b77b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
