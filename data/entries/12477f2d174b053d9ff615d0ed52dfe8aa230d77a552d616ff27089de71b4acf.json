{"title":"Integrating Blockchain with Deep Packet Inspection and The Performance Overhead Introduced","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1475/v1","date":1724224538000,"content":"As computer networks develop in size and complexity, the need for equipment that can characterize, inspect, monitor, and summarize the features of a transmission in real time grows. Many transmission and packet inspection theories are required to examine network traffic. Unfortunately, loss the track or traceability of one traffic scenarios against others over real-time network. Deep packet inspection (DPI) approaches can be used to alleviate the problem but still face flexibility constraints in the sense that it will be difficult to keep track of prior occurrences. There have been significant theoretical improvements in packet inspection, but the problem of event tracking flexibility remains unsolved. A novel approach for “integrating blockchain with DPI” in summarizing computer network traffic flow events has emerged as a result of this research: This technique captured traffic flows in the network, DPI report, and the entire transmission session header and load them into a smart-contract based- Blockchain. Two experimental scenarios are used to test the validity of the system. The first scenarios involve analysis of DPI transmission without integrating blockchain, follow by the captured of transmission session involving DPI with blockchain. The finding indicates that DPI transmission with blockchain is more secured against \"Tampering Incidents\", \"Unauthorized Access Attempts\", “Auditability” and many other security concern. Whereas, the performance overhead introduced by blockchain-based DPI indicate an increase in \"DPI Processing Time from 68ms to 150ms, a \"CPU Usage increment by 20%, Network Latency increment of 15ms from 20ms to 35ms, and almost all other computational resources increase. Therefore, the finding can be summarized that the performance overhead introduced by integrating blockchain with DPI increases, but it provides a secure DPI reports for decision making.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12477f2d174b053d9ff615d0ed52dfe8aa230d77a552d616ff27089de71b4acf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
