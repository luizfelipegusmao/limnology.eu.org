In the pursuit of efficiently characterizing materials, the development of scanning probe techniques has emerged as a transformative tool across scientific disciplines. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is one such powerful tool for imaging both the atomic positions and the electronic structure of material surfaces. However, the identification of diverse structures typically involves a manual process, with a human operator correlating the corresponding material properties using auxiliary information. The exploration of structures follows a sequential approach, requiring meticulous sifting across various length scales within the sample space. This step-by-step exploration, while essential for comprehensive analysis, contributes to the time-consuming nature of experimentation in STM. The endeavor to locate such features often involves an exhaustive search and, at times, relies on serendipitous discoveries.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5224d8e5225b8ec3b7c1466f83005199eada5087d97e41c546ec967505b0f00c","category":"Environment"}
