{"title":"Quantum Stability of Hamiltonian\nEvolution on a Finsler Manifold","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1475/v1","date":1716425742000,"content":"This paper is a study of a generalization of the quantum Riemannian Hamiltonian evolution, previously\nanalyzed by us in our work [6], in the geometrization of quantum mechanical evolution in a Finsler geometry.\nWe find results with dynamical equations governing the evolution of the trajectories defined by the expectation values of position. The analysis appears to provide an underlying geometry described by a geodesic equation, with connection form with a second term which is an essentially quantum effect.\nThese dynamical equations provide a new geometric approach to the quantum evolution where we suggest a definition for \"local instability\" in the quantum theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"061bc060cd9e3fc0a16eaa7e6410dc68af6b521ba257af1cde1a324ae2e64a40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
