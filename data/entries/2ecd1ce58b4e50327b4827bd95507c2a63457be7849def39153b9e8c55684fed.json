{"title":"Diverse Fatty Acid Profiles and Antioxidant Properties in Different Populations of Ox Tongue (Echium amoenum) Fisch. &amp; Mey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1894/v1","date":1727168394000,"content":"Ox Tongue (Echium amoenum) is an important medicinal plant rich in secondary metabolites, including alkaloids, quinones, and unsaturated fatty acids. The present study examined the concentration of oil, fatty acid profiles, and antioxidant activity of six different Iranian Echium accessions. The oil concentration varied across these populations, ranging from 16.20% to 22.36% in the first year and from 21.00% to 25.50% in the second year. The major fatty acids identified in the oils were oleic acid (18.35% to 19.40%), linoleic acid (23.80% to 26.20%), and α-linolenic acid (32.30% to 34.20%) during the first year. In the second year, the predominant fatty acids were oleic acid (15.82% to 19.32%), linoleic acid (21.55% to 24.70%), and α-linolenic acid (33.95% to 37.40%). Principal component analysis revealed distinct profiles for each population: Sari was notable for its high α-linolenic acid and γ-linolenic acid content, Fasa was distinguished by its high stearidonic acid levels, Roodsar had a high concentration of stearic acid, Vazneh Sar was rich in linoleic acid and palmitic acid, and Leron had the highest oleic acid content. The Sari population had the highest oil content at 25.50%, while Fasa had the highest α-linolenic acid content at 37.40% during the establishment year. Leron exhibited the highest antioxidant attributes. These findings indicate that selecting elite Echium populations with high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and potent antioxidant properties could be advantageous for the food industry, as they offer enhanced nutritional and functional qualities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ecd1ce58b4e50327b4827bd95507c2a63457be7849def39153b9e8c55684fed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
