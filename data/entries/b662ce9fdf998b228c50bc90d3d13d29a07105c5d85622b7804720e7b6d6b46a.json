Behavioral and neural changes after lesions of the right STN show a causal role of the right STN. Subthalamotomies to alleviate Parkinson's disease motor symptoms worsen inhibition and are accompanied by compensatory changes in fronto-striatal activities. We demonstrated that the STN and its network is necessary for response inhibition.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The neural network mediating successful response inhibition mainly includes right hemisphere activation of the pre-supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), subthalamic nucleus (STN), and caudate nucleus. However, the causal role of these regions in the inhibitory network is undefined. Five patients with Parkinson's disease were assessed prior to and after therapeutic thermal ablation of the right STN in two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions while performing a stop-signal task. Initiation times were faster but motor inhibition with the left hand (contralateral to the lesion) was significantly impaired as evident in prolonged stop-signal reaction times. Reduced inhibition after right subthalamotomy was associated (during successful inhibition) with the recruitment of basal ganglia regions outside the established inhibitory network. They included the putamen and caudate together with the anterior cingulate cortex and IFG of the left hemisphere. Subsequent network connectivity analysis (with the seed over the nonlesioned left STN) revealed a new inhibitory network after right subthalamotomies. Our results highlight the causal role of the right STN in the neural network for motor inhibition and the possible basal ganglia mechanisms for compensation upon losing a key node of the inhibition network.</p>","author":"Ignacio Obeso, \nFrancis R.
