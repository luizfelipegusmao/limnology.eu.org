{"title":"The S-acylation cycle of transcription factor MtNAC80 influences cold stress responses in Medicago truncatula","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/7/2629/7637620?rss=1","date":1711670400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>S-acylation is a reversible post-translational modification catalyzed by protein S-acyltransferases (PATs), and acyl protein thioesterases (APTs) mediate de-S-acylation. Although many proteins are S-acylated, how the S-acylation cycle modulates specific biological functions in plants is poorly understood. In this study, we report that the S-acylation cycle of transcription factor MtNAC80 is involved in the <span>Medicago truncatula</span> cold stress response. Under normal conditions, MtNAC80 localized to membranes through MtPAT9-induced S-acylation. In contrast, under cold stress conditions, MtNAC80 translocated to the nucleus through de-S-acylation mediated by thioesterases such as MtAPT1. MtNAC80 functions in the nucleus by directly binding the promoter of the glutathione <span>S</span>-transferase gene <span>MtGSTU1</span> and promoting its expression, which enables plants to survive under cold stress by removing excess malondialdehyde and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Our findings reveal an important function of the S-acylation cycle in plants and provide insight into stress response and tolerance mechanisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"6f44c7bb38b6cd798f4c089ea67c564680673be556ae675bc250a7db2634d77b","category":"Environment"}
