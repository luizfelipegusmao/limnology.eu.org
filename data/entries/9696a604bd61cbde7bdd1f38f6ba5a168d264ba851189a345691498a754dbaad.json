{"title":"On Nilpotent Elements and Armendariz Modules","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0181/v1","date":1725342950000,"content":"For a left module RM over non-commutative ring R, the notion for the class of nilpotent elements (nilR(M)) was first introduced and studied by SSevviiri and Groenewald . Moreover, Armendariz and semicommutative modules are generalizations of reduced modules and nilR(M)=0 in the case of reduced modules. Thus, the nilpotent class plays a vital role in these modules. Motivated by this, we present the concept of nil-Armendariz modules as a generalization of reduced modules and a refinement of Armendariz modules, focusing on the class of nilpotent elements. Further, we demonstrate that the quotient module M/N is nil-Armendariz if and only if N is within the nilpotent class of RM. Additionally, we establish that the matrix module Mn(M) is nil-Armendariz over Mn(R) and explore conditions under which nilpotent classes form submodules. Finally, we prove that nil-Armendariz modules remain closed under localization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9696a604bd61cbde7bdd1f38f6ba5a168d264ba851189a345691498a754dbaad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
