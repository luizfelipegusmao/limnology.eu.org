{"title":"Social Determinates of Health Relating to Manual Labor, Chronic Pain, and Risk of Opioid Addiction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1898/v1","date":1724746597000,"content":"Abstract: This brief report investigates the potential correlation between manual labor and opioid addiction, focusing on contributing factors such as chronic pain, regular exercise, healthcare access, and housing stability. Although manual labor is associated with higher rates of work-related injuries and chronic pain, the review finds no strong, direct correlation between manual labor and increased opioid addiction rates. The relationship is complex and influenced by a range of socio-economic factors. The findings highlight the need for further research, particularly longitudinal studies, to explore these dynamics in depth and develop targeted interventions for at-risk populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20d114b0ead5b40ab57e788fbd41888a7941bffaf03968c9adf5b141310cf20c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
