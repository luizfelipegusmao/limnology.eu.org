This HPA employs the a corporate configuration for FET transistors, optimizing its performance. This article provides an in-depth study and analysis of the critical design parameters of such HPAs in Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology. The designed MMIC chip measures 7.5 x 7 mm^2 and includes three stages, each carefully optimized to maximize efficiency and performance. Both the design and the measurement results of amplifier are presented. he most remarkable feature of this chip is an operational bandwidth exceeding two octaves, covering a wide RF frequency range from 2 to 10 GHz (2.23:1 ratio. Additionally, the amplifier achieves an output power higher than 43 dBm, along with a power-added efficiency(PAE) surpassing 20% in the mentioned frequency range (2-10 GHz). This HPA is suitable to be integrated into future Transmit and Receive Modules (TRMs) for Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) systems. These systems include multiple capabilities in a single device, such as Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications (COMMs) functions, demonstrating the versatility and high efficiency of this design in advanced multifunctional applications","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d838efcf4df4b48ef652cb16f88999a792051f2eba6a852e7cb4d9f59f86c841","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
