Blockchain technology can effectively address trust issues and information sharing difficulties in current multimodal transport document collaboration. However, in current blockchain-based electronic document research, the bottleneck problem lies in the collaboration of multiparty in multimodal transport under the \"one-bill coverage system\". We design a blockchain platform architecture for multimodal transport, reshaping collaboration processes for different modes of transport based on the blockchain platform. It proposes a collaboration model for multimodal transport under the \"one-bill coverage system\" and performs model solving and case analysis. The obtained collaboration strategies are embedded into the platform's application layer. Finally, using Solidity language, it writes smart contracts related to multimodal transport under the \"one-bill coverage system \" and deploys and executes them on the Remix platform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cb07a9d5df98e67b8273f0b7578713725a995e9e3329400fd6ca34c6d67d114","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
