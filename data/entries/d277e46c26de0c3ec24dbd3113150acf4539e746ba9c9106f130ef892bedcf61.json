{"title":"Echocardiography myocardial work and cardiac biomarkers indicate subclinical systolic myocardial dysfunction in patients with systematic lupus erythematous","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0600/v1","date":1712647577000,"content":"Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by inflammation and cardiovascular complications. Our study aimed to investigate subclinical and early indicators of systolic myocardial dysfunction in SLE patients using advanced echocardiographic methods and biomarkers. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 102 SLE patients without known cardiac impairment and 51 healthy controls. Demographics, disease characteristics, laboratory results, disease activity (SLEDAI) and organ damage (SDI) indices were recorded. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) and myocardial work indices were assessed by utilizing speckle tracking echocardiography. In addition, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), high sensitivity troponin (hsTn) and N-terminal-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were measured in blood samples. Results: In comparison to controls, SLE patients had significantly higher GLS (-19.94±2.71%vs-21.15±1.55%, p&amp;lt;0.001) and global wasted work (GWW) (94±71mmHg%vs71±49 mmHg%, p=0.025). Notably, NT-proBNP and hsTn were threefold and twofold higher in SLE group compared to control group, respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001). Within SLE cohort, patients with at least moderate disease activity (SLEDAI≥4) both biomarkers were significantly elevated than those with low disease activity (SLEDAI&amp;lt;4). Conclusion: Advanced echocardiographic parameters combined with specific biomarkers have a promising role in detecting systolic dysfunction at an early phase in SLE patients, potentially enabling timely interventions to mitigate cardiovascular risk.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d277e46c26de0c3ec24dbd3113150acf4539e746ba9c9106f130ef892bedcf61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
