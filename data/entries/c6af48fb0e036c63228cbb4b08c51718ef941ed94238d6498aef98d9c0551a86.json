{"title":"Sustainable renewable energy supply chain with current technological adaptation: Macro energy progress policy in Iran","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14433?af=R","date":1719405925000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change is a global challenge today that has been highly considered due to the wide impacts on different sectors of a society. That is why the use of renewable energy for countries and communities should be considered. In addition, the limitation of fossil fuels and the problems incurred by greenhouse gas emissions have made it increasingly important to make renewable energy more attractive. Sustainable energy means continuous supply of energy for today's needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Sustainable energy technologies include renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric power, solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, synthetic photo center and wave energy, as well as technologies designed to improve energy efficiency. Thus, this article discusses the development and performance of renewable supply chain energy in Iran. A strategic model is proposed and investigated to cover various aspects of sustainable renewable energy within a supply chain configuration integrated with machine learning method for quantification purpose. The novelty is on integrating machine learning and strategic plan to handle sustainability indicators within a renewable energy supply chain. The study also provides managerial insights to governments, researchers and stakeholders for the initiation of renewable energy use and suggestions for overcoming the barriers to its developments.</p>","author":"Hamed Fazlollahtabar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"c6af48fb0e036c63228cbb4b08c51718ef941ed94238d6498aef98d9c0551a86","category":"Environment"}
