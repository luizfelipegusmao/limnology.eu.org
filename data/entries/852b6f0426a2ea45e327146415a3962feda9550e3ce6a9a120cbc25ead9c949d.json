{"title":"OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the Influence of Myopia, at the Level of the Retina and Optic Nerve in Patients Diagnosed with Open Angle Glaucoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1573/v1","date":1716476185000,"content":"MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is an observational analytical cohort study carried out on a total of 160 patients, divided into 4 groups: healthy, with myopia, with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and with POAG and myopia together. The study variables were Bruch's membrane opening area (BMO), the thickness of the RNFL and the RGC layer using the Glaucoma Premium program of the OCT Spectralis of Heidelberg.\nRESULTS: Regarding the analysis between age and the thickness of the RNFL, significant results were found in the healthy and glaucoma groups with myopia, for the rest of the groups, although there are no significant results, the correlation is negative, the older the younger is the thickness. Regarding intraocular pressure (IOP), significant results have been found in the nasal sector in the glaucoma group. In the glaucoma with myopia group, statistically significant results have been obtained when analyzing the thickness of the RNFL with refraction. In the analysis between the thickness of the RNFL and the RGC layer, significant results were obtained in the myopia and glaucoma groups; in the group of glaucoma with myopia, it occurs in the superior temporal sector.\nCONCLUSION: In the case of myopic patients with glaucoma, damage at the functional, both the thickness of the RNFL, the RCG and the BMO-MRW are greater than other groups. All these alterations can be evaluated and monitored with the OCT Spectralis thanks to the programs it includes, making this instrument one of the best for an early diagnosis of glaucoma and the damage produced in myopic patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"852b6f0426a2ea45e327146415a3962feda9550e3ce6a9a120cbc25ead9c949d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
