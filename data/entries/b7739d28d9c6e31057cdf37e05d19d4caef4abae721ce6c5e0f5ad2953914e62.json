{"title":"Case Studies (CS) Method: Perspectives from Learning Plant Nutritional Biology with CS Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1225/v1","date":1721119765000,"content":"Case studies (CS) attempt to help students increase critical thinking skills and engagement while working through a real-life scenario in various disciplines, including medicine, law, and business.  However, the CS method has not been heavily utilized in biological sciences. The present study investigated the effect of the CS method on undergraduate biology studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding, academic outcomes, and perspectives. A case study was applied in a one-semester undergraduate biology course, which was compared to ten semesters of standard sections. Participants completed course pre- and post-tests, pre- and post-case tests, and an online survey to assess their conceptual understanding and engagement. The initial lowest quartiles were determined from the individual course pre-test scores, which were lower than class averages. Results suggested that the CS method helped students in learning outcomes, critical thinking, and conceptual understanding toward biology. In post-test learning gains, the CS group did 20% better than the non-CS group, with the largest benefit seen in the initially lowest pre-test quartile of the class. Moreover, post-case learning gains were 55% improved in the case test. Survey results indicated that students had positive attitudes toward CS for their engagement in plant biology content. Overall, the distribution of A grades improved by 2.6-fold from standard to CS groups.  We conclude that the use of CS may address course content engagement and have the potential to effectively boost academic performance, especially for the initially lowest quartile in undergraduate plant biological sciences courses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7739d28d9c6e31057cdf37e05d19d4caef4abae721ce6c5e0f5ad2953914e62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
