A retrospective study was conducted and 402 patients (378 women and 24 men)  with pSS were analyzed. Patients were categorized into three subgroups based on serological tests. These; 1) quadruple seropositive (positive for anti-Sjögren’s-syndrome-related antigen A antibodies (anti-SSA; anti-Ro) and anti-Sjögren’s-syndrome-related antigen B antibodies (anti-SSB; anti-La), rheumatoid factor (RF), and antinuclear antibody (ANA)), 2) double seropositive (positive for ANA and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies), 3) quadruple seronegative (negative for ANA, RF, anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies). The number of quadruple seropositive patients was 72 (18.6%), double seropositive 174 (43.2%), and quadruple seronegative was 85 (21.1%). The diagnosis age of quadruple seropositive pSS was 42.4±10.8, significantly younger than patients with double seropositive and quadruple seronegative pSS (p = 0.021, p=0.112). In terms of organ involvement, salivary gland enlargement, arthralgias, arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis-purpura, interstitial lung disease, neurological involvement, autoimmune thyroiditis, renal interstitial disease, anemia, leukopenia, hypergammaglobulinaemia and hypocomplementaemia were more common in quadruple seropositive pSS compared to quadruple seronegative (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bf7ec79248d67302d815b408e80ca264fbe16707a74267996923d4e2421881c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
