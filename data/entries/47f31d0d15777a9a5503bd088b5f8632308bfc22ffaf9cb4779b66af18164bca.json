{"title":"Trends of <i>Mansonia</i> (Diptera, Culicidae, Mansoniini) in Porto Velho: Seasonal patterns and meteorological influences","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303405","date":1715176800000,"content":"<p>by José Ferreira Saraiva, Nercy Virginia Rabelo Furtado, Ahana Maitra, Dario P.

Its significance also reaches into environmental management, aiming to prevent inconveniences caused by non-vector mosquitoes like the <i>Mansonia</i> Blanchard, 1901 mosquito. In this study, we carried out a five-year (2019–2023) monitoring of these mosquitoes at ten sites in Porto Velho, Rondônia, using SkeeterVac SV3100 automatic traps positioned between the two hydroelectric complexes on the Madeira River. Throughout this period, we sampled 153,125 mosquitoes, of which the <i>Mansonia</i> genus accounted for 54% of the total, indicating its prevalence in the region. ARIMA analysis revealed seasonal patterns of <i>Mansonia</i> spp., highlighting periods of peak density. Notably, a significant decreasing trend in local abundance was observed from July 2021 (25<sup>th</sup> epidemiological week) until the end of the study. Wind speed was observed to be the most relevant meteorological factor influencing the abundance of <i>Mansonia</i> spp. especially in the Joana D’Arc settlement, although additional investigation is needed to comprehensively analyze other local events and gain a deeper understanding of the ecological patterns of this genus in the Amazon region.","author":"José Ferreira Saraiva","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"47f31d0d15777a9a5503bd088b5f8632308bfc22ffaf9cb4779b66af18164bca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
