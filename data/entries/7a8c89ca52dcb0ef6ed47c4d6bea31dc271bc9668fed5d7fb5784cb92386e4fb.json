{"title":"Optimization of Lost Foam Coating Performance: Effects of Blade Shape, Stirring Speed, and Drying Temperature on Viscosity, Coating Weight, and Surface Morphology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2343/v1","date":1722262896000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of blade shape, stirring speed, and stirring time on the performance of lost foam casting coatings, specifically focusing on their viscosity, coating weight, and surface morphology. Commercially available lost foam coating materials were used, with varying blade shapes employed in high-speed dispersers. The effects of different stirring speeds and durations on coating viscosity and coating weight were systematically analyzed. It was observed that blade shape significantly influences the uniformity and performance of the coating. Among the blade shapes tested, the three-blade configuration demonstrated the highest efficiency in achieving uniform mixing, with optimal viscosity and coating weight. Stirring speed was found to have a minor effect on viscosity but a notable impact on coating weight, with speeds of 800 to 1200 rpm producing consistent results. Stirring time was shown to stabilize viscosity and coating weight after reaching a certain duration, beyond which no significant changes were observed. Drying behavior was analyzed at various temperatures, revealing that higher temperatures led to increased surface roughness and more pronounced cracks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a8c89ca52dcb0ef6ed47c4d6bea31dc271bc9668fed5d7fb5784cb92386e4fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
