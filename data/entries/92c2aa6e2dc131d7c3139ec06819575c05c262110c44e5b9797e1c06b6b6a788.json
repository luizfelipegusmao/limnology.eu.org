Built around stiff 38mm stanchions, it’s aimed at riders and racers who need maximum stiffness and travel from a single-crown package.</p>\n<p>Sitting at the top of the range is the <strong>ZEB Ultimate</strong>, often found on some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro bikes</a> on the market. Specced with a DebonAir+ <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">air spring</a> and the new Charger 3 RC2 damper, this fork also benefits from RockShox’s ButterCup technology, and premium SKF wiper seals and Maxima Plush damper fluid.</p>\n<p>The ZEB Ultimate also features Pressure Relief Valves on the fork lowers. Rounding out this flagship package is a machined and anodised crown for durability and weight reduction.</p>\n<p>The <strong>ZEB Select+</strong> shares many features with the flagship ZEB, including the DebonAir+ air spring, Charger 3 RC2 damper and Pressure Relief Valves, but it misses out on the vibration-damping ButterCups and machined crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>ZEB Select</strong> is specced with a DebonAir+ air spring and the more basic Charger RC damper. The rest of the technology is carried over from the Select+ model, apart from the Pressure Relief Valves, which can be retrofitted if desired.</p>\n<p>The entry-level ZEB shares the same DebonAir+ air spring as its higher-end counterparts. However, it gets RockShox’s new entry-level Rush RC damper for easy low-speed compression and rebound adjustability.

With 35mm stanchions, it is aimed at mountain bikers who want to be equipped to ride a variety of trails.</p>\n<p>The top-of-the-range <strong>Lyrik Ultimate</strong> gets all the bells and whistles. It’s equipped with a DebonAir+ air spring and Charger 3 RC2 damper, making it a popular choice for some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Much like the ZEB, it also boasts ButterCup technology, Pressure Relief Valves, premium SKF seals and Maxima Plush damper fluid, as well as a machined and anodised crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Lyrik Select+</strong> also gets most of RockShox’s top-of-the-line technology, such as the DebonAir+ air spring and Charger 3 RC2 damper. While it also benefits from Pressure Relief Valves and premium seals and damper fluid, it misses out on the ButterCups and machined crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Lyrik Select</strong> has a DebonAir+ air spring, but not the premium Charger 3 RC2 damper, instead getting the more basic Charger RC with low-speed compression and rebound adjustment. It also lacks Pressure Relief Valves, but these can be retrofitted.</p>\n<p>In its most basic guise, the Lyrik relies on a DebonAir+ air spring and entry-level Rush RC damper. The internal seals and damper fluid are shared with the rest of the line-up and you can also upgrade to Pressure Relief Valves.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>RockShox Pike</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox fork 2023\" title=\"RockShox fork 2023 - Pike Ultimate\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pike comes with 120, 130 or 140mm of travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> Trail and downcountry</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 120, 130 or 140mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 26 (Pike DJ), 27.5 or 29in</li>\n</ul><p>The RockShox Pike is all about trail and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">downcountry</a> riding.

Like the ZEB and Lyrik Ultimate, it features a DebonAir+ air spring, Charger 3 RC2 damper, Pressure Relief Valves and ButterCups. Premium SKF seals, Maxima damper fluid and a machined and anodised crown complete the package.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Pike Select+</strong> is treated to almost all the same technology as the Pike Ultimate, but misses out on the ButterCups and the machined crown.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Pike Select</strong> gets a more basic Charger RC damper, with easy-to-adjust low-speed compression and rebound. Apart from the Pressure Relief Valves, which can be retrofitted, the Pike Select shares the same DebonAir+ air spring, seals and damper fluid as the rest of the Pike line-up.</p>\n<p>RockShox’s entry-level trail fork, the Pike, shares the same Rush RC damper as the other base models in the signature trail and enduro range. It also has the same internal seals and damper fluid.

It uses SKF wiper seals and Maxima Plush damper fluid.</p>\n<p>The <strong>BoXXer</strong> uses the same chassis and downhill-tuned DebonAir+ air spring as its flagship counterpart but forgoes the ButterCups.

This should translate to reduced fatigue in the hands and arms on rough descents.</p>\n<p>ButterCups are retrofittable and included in Charger 3 and DebonAir+ upgrade kits.</p>\n<h3>DebonAir+ spring</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox fork 2023\" title=\"RockShox fork 2023 - DebonAir+ springs\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox says the DebonAir+ is said to offer all the pros of the DebonAir spring, but with none of the negatives.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The DebonAir+ is RockShox’s latest air spring and is seen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-rockshox-pike-lyrik-zeb/\">2023 ZEB, Lyrik and Pike models</a> and the 2024 SID and BoXXer.</p>\n<p>Although the design is similar to its predecessor, the new DebonAir+ has a larger negative chamber and a tweaked equalisation design to improve sensitivity and mid-stroke support.</p>\n<h3>DebonAir spring</h3>\n<p>The RockShox DebonAir spring is the predecessor of the DebonAir+ and tuned versions are used across a wide range of models, such as the SID SL.</p>\n<h3>SoloAir spring</h3>\n<p>The SoloAir spring is RockShox’s basic air spring and is found on forks such as the RockShox Reba and 35.</p>\n<h3>Pressure Release Valves</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox fork 2023\" title=\"RockShox fork 2023 - Pressure Relief Valves\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pressure Release Valves are useful if you ride at altitude.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>RockShox’s Pressure Release Valves are small valves found on the back of the fork lowers, just under the seals. These enable the release of unwanted pressure build-up in the fork lowers, caused by changes in altitude or temperature.</p>\n<h3>Flight Attendant</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rock Shox Flight Attendant fork controle module top\" title=\"Rock Shox Flight Attendant fork controle module top\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can adjust the Flight Attendant fork’s settings via a dial.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman/SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>RockShox <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-flight-attendant/\">Flight Attendant</a> is an electronic suspension adjustment system that optimises your suspension damping on the fly using sensors in the forks, shock and cranks.
