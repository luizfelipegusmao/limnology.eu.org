{"title":"Sex chromosome turnover in hybridizing stickleback lineages","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/8/5/658/7670581?rss=1","date":1715385600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Recent discoveries of sex chromosome diversity across the tree of life have challenged the canonical model of conserved sex chromosome evolution and evoked new theories on labile sex chromosomes that maintain less differentiation and undergo frequent turnover. However, theories of labile sex chromosome evolution lack direct empirical support due to the paucity of case studies demonstrating ongoing sex chromosome turnover in nature. Two divergent lineages (viz. WL &amp; EL) of nine-spined sticklebacks (<span>Pungitius pungitius</span>) with different sex chromosomes (linkage group [LG] 12 in the EL, unknown in the WL) hybridize in a natural secondary contact zone in the Baltic Sea, providing an opportunity to study ongoing turnover between coexisting sex chromosomes. In this study, we first identify an 80 kbp genomic region on LG3 as the sex-determining region (SDR) using whole-genome resequencing data of family crosses of a WL population. We then verify this region as the SDR in most other WL populations and demonstrate a potentially ongoing sex chromosome turnover in admixed marine populations where the evolutionarily younger and homomorphic LG3 sex chromosome replaces the older and heteromorphic LG12 sex chromosome. The results provide a rare glimpse of sex chromosome turnover in the wild and indicate the possible existence of additional yet undiscovered sex chromosome diversity in <span>Pungitius</span> sticklebacks.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Letters Current Issue","siteHash":"ccc44437a8276654c44dddd156a8ce3b5dae5730f1c2406ed04aa90599bdf071","entryHash":"d07830d2418eeca63fd6483be4ef24cb7de417b98545f3a292912cc17319a8af","category":"Environment"}
