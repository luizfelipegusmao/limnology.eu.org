{"title":"Heat-Induced Oxidative Stress and Use of Astaxanthin on the NF-kB, NFE2L2 Transcription Factors and Cytoprotective Capacity in the Thymus of Broilers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0313/v2","date":1719376249000,"content":"The thymus, a central lymphoid organ in animals serves as the site for T cell development, differentiation and maturation, vital to adaptive immunity. Thymus is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis to protect against tumors and tissue damage. Overactive or prolonged immune response can lead to oxidative stress from increased production of reactive oxygen species. Heat stress induces oxidative stress and overwhelms the natural antioxidant defense mechanisms. The study objectives were to investigate the protective properties of astaxanthin against heat-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the chicken thymus, by comparing the growth performance and gene signaling pathways among three groups- thermal neutral, heat stress and heat stress with astaxanthin. The thermal neutral temperature conditions were 21-22°C and heat stress temperature was 32-35°C. Both heat stress groups experienced reduced growth performance, while the astaxanthin treated group showed a slightly lesser decline. The inflammatory response and antioxidant defense system were activated by the upregulation of the NF-kB, NFE2L2, PPARα, cytoprotective capacity and apoptotic gene pathways in the heat stress compared to the thermal neutral group. Conversely, expression levels were without significance between the thermal neutral and heat stress with antioxidant groups, suggesting astaxanthin antioxidant effectiveness to mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress damage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"531d0b72a55d8efc633e8264723866a0d09ee38ae3b967de57f88a2869082050","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
