{"title":"Analyzing the Characteristics of Complications Associated with Computer-controlled Pressurized Monoplace Hyperbaric Chambers: A Retrospective Observational Multicenter Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1293/v1","date":1729088054000,"content":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves inhaling nearly 100% oxygen in a pressurized environment and is commonly used to treat various diseases and injuries. Despite its well-known safety, HBOT is associated with complications, with frequent middle ear barotrauma (MEB) and oxygen toxicity. Understanding the characteristics and risk factors associated with these complications is critical for improving patient’s compliance and treatment outcomes. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to analyze the characteristics and factors associated with complications during HBOT using a computer-controlled pressurized monoplace hyperbaric chamber. We conducted a retrospective observational study across two tertiary hospitals in Korea, involving patients who received HBOT from October 2017 to June 2020. Data were extracted from electronic medical records and hyperbaric chamber logs, including patient demographics, medical history, HBOT indications, and details of complications. Statistical analyses, including chi-square and t-tests, were used to compare variables. A total of 247 patients (mean age: 59.35 ± 15.05 years, 63.56% male) were included. The most common indications for HBOT were sudden sensorineural hearing loss (27.94%) and post-graft/flap (24.29%). Hypertension (46.15%) and diabetes mellitus (39.27%) were the most frequent comorbidities. Otalgia was the most prevalent side effect (33.20%), followed by chest discomfort (2.02%) and headache (1.62%). A significant proportion of patients (11.74%) terminated HBOT due to complications, with most pauses occurring at pressures between 1.2 to 1.4 ATA (26.67%). Complications, particularly otalgia, significantly impact patient compliance with HBOT. The incidence of complications varies by pressure level during treatment, suggesting the need for tailored strategies to minimize complications. This study highlights the importance of patient monitoring and education to improve the safety and efficacy of HBOT in monoplace chambers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3140914e1b9a8eaf46c5ac6f05b655d88c8577237411b0814dec8661cb5e7a3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
