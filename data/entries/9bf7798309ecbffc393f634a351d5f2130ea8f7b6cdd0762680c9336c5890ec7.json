{"title":"Individual Human Climate Analysis Applying the New Clothing Resistance Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0201/v1","date":1717596837000,"content":"A new clothing resistance model is described and applied to characterize the human thermal and moisture climates. The climate was described by the thermal (rcl,t) and evap-orative (rcl,e) resistances of comfortable, imaginary clothing. The key input variable of the model is the rate of sweating (λEsw). Since sweating is an individual-specific process, the model applies to the individual. The observations were carried out by a single individual in Martonvásár (Hungarian lowland, Central Europe) in the summer of 2023 and the winter of 2024. During the observations, the observer walked at a speed of 1.1-1.7 ms-1 in weather-appropriate clothing. Among the results, we would highlight the following: Dur-ing large environmental heat surpluses, the rcl,t values were found to be between 0.1-0.5 clo-t (clo-t = 0.155 m2·℃·W-1), while the rcl,e values fell between 0.4-0.8 clo-e (clo-e = 0.155 m2·hPa·W-1). The values of the parameters close to 0 were caused by intense sweating (λEsw &gt; 200 Wm-2). The applicability of the model is limited and largely depends on the rela-tionship between λEsw and the metabolic heat flux density.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bf7798309ecbffc393f634a351d5f2130ea8f7b6cdd0762680c9336c5890ec7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
