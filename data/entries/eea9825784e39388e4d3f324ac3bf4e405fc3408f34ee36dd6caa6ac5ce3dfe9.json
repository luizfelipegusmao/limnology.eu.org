{"title":"Siting Considerations for Satellite Observation of River Discharge","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034583?af=R","date":1719212400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>With growing global capability for satellite measurement of river discharge (flow) comes a need to understand and reduce error in satellite-based discharge measurements. Satellite-based discharge estimates are based on measurements of water surface width, elevation, slope, and potentially velocity. Site selection is important for reducing error and uncertainty in both conventional and satellite-based discharge measurements because geomorphic river characteristics have strong control over the relationships between discharge and width, water surface elevation (or depth), slope, and velocity. A large ground-truth data set of 8,445 conventional hydraulic measurements, collected by acoustic Doppler current profilers at 503 stations in the United States, was developed and quality assured to examine correlation between river discharge and water surface width, depth, velocity, and cross-sectional area. A separate database of river surface slope and discharge time-series was developed from paired continuous monitoring stations to examine slope-discharge correlations. Results show that discharge correlates most strongly with velocity, cross-sectional area, depth, width, and slope, in that order. Uncertainty of satellite discharge estimates is affected by observed hydraulic variable and reach-specific variability in observed variable(s) characteristics including range of variability, georegistration accuracy, and stability over time of relationships between discharge and observed hydraulic variable.</p>","author":"Jack Eggleston, \nChris Mason, \nDave Bjerklie, \nMike Durand, \nRob Dudley, \nMerritt Harlan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"eea9825784e39388e4d3f324ac3bf4e405fc3408f34ee36dd6caa6ac5ce3dfe9","category":"Environment"}
