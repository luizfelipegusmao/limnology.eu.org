{"title":"Platelet Function, Platelet Size and Content of Reticulated Platelets. Interactions in Patients Receiving Dual Antiplatelet Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0248/v1","date":1725362116000,"content":"Increased platelet activity is a risk factor of thrombotic events in cardiovascular patients. We studied the relationship between platelet function, platelet size and content of reticulated platelets (RP) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, n = 55) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS, n = 95) receiving acetylsalicylic acid + clopidogrel or ticagrelor respectively. Control group consisted of patients with risk factors for CHD, but no CHD/ACS and free of antiplatelet drugs (n = 66). Platelet function was evaluated by exposure of activated glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa and P-selectin. In the control group, platelets were activated by TRAP (Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide) 10 µM, ADP 20, 5, 2.5 µM and in CHD/ACS groups, by TRAP 10 µM, ADP 20, 5 µM (+/- epinephrine 20 µM). Platelet size was assessed by mean volume, % large forms and forward scattering. RP were stained by thiazole orange. In the control group activated GP IIb-IIIa and P-selectin correlated with platelet size and RP content after platelet activation by all agonists. Despite the decrease of platelet activity by antiplatelet drugs, most correlations (primarily for activated GP IIb-IIIa) were preserved in CHD/ACS patients. In conclusion, increased platelet size and RP content are associated with increased platelet activity and reduced efficacy of antiplatelet therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0fb791ef44bde7ecb9a3f10ce5c44e56e9f7a7f718badd59deadcc3840d92b18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
