Hexagonal boron nitrite (hBN) has a layered structure and a bandgap near 6eV [<a href=\"#ozae044.005-B1\">1</a>]. The hBN materials have been engineered extensively to create quantum emitters. A library of emission lines has been reported from ultraviolet light to near infrared light regime with different fabrications and treatments on hBN.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"445c5ab4dc145ff4845e71a74306e997c2fc8f81a7e66371346b0de0d7653a8a","category":"Environment"}
