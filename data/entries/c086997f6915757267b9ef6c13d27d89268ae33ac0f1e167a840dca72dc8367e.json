{"title":"Gopal as a Sustainable Alternative: Chemical, Rheological, and Mechanical Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1087/v1","date":1726292409000,"content":"The availability of petroleum asphalt, derived from non-renewable sources, is steadily declining alongside diminishing petroleum reserves. To reduce reliance on petroleum, alternative renewable natural sources are being explored as both modifiers and replacements for petroleum asphalt, particularly in asphalt binders. This study explores the chemical, rheological, and mechanical properties of Gopal, a bio-asphalt derived from Gondorukem (gum rosin) and crude palm oil (CPO). Two Gopal variants, Gopal-GEM130 and Gopal-GEG90, were analyzed using FTIR and EDX methods, with Pen 60 petroleum asphalt as a control. The results reveal that Gopal-GEG90 and Gopal-GEM130 exhibit 86% chemical similarity to Pen 60 asphalt. Gopal-GEM130 is less toxic and less alkaline compared to Pen 60, while Gopal-GEG90 is less toxic but more alkaline. Both variants fall under the same classification as Pen 60 in terms of rheological properties, with Gopal-GEG90 demonstrating slightly better stripping resistance but lower aging resistance. Gopal-GEM130 showed better stripping resistance and rutting performance, though with lower fatigue resistance and faster aging compared to Pen 60 asphalt. Both bio-asphalt variants align with performance grade PG64S, signifying their potential as alternatives to conventional petroleum asphalt.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c086997f6915757267b9ef6c13d27d89268ae33ac0f1e167a840dca72dc8367e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
