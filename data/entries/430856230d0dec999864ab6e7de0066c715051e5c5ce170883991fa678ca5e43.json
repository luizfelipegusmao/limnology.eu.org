{"title":"A Novel Technique for Optimizing Volumetric Avatars: From 2D Images to Lightweight 3D Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1391/v1","date":1724143807000,"content":"In the world of digital avatars, three-dimensional (3D) human models are utilized to replicate real-world appearance and movements with a higher degree of realism compared to traditional 2D representations. Currently, extensive person-specific data capturing and 3D artists are required to create photorealistic avatars of existing people. Determining the 3D pose and articulation of an avatar from 2D images requires complex algorithms, a capability commonly found in the Visual Effects (VFX) industry but not readily available elsewhere. Hence, this study proposes an approach to generate 3D avatar from a 2D image of a person with uncanny resemblance and an accurate depiction of the subjectâ€™s likeness. The proposed approach, PIFu+CycleGAN, combines Pixel-aligned Implicit Function (PIFu) and cycleGAN for textured avatar construction. PIFu is specifically used to capture intricate details and arbitrary topology. Additionally, the hourglass architecture-based module is utilized for T-pose estimation for predicting the initial geometry and shape. Evaluating the proposed approach on the benchmark RenderPeople dataset, it outperforms the state-of-the-art models with values of 1.53 and 1.50 for the Chamfer and P2S distance, respectively. This indicates the creation of high-quality 3D meshes with promising textures, which are of exceptional quality and suitable for animation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"430856230d0dec999864ab6e7de0066c715051e5c5ce170883991fa678ca5e43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
