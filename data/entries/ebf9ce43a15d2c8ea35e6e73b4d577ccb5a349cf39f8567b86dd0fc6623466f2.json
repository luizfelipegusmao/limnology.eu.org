{"title":"Innovationology: A Comprehensive, Transdisciplinary Framework for Driving Transformative Innovation in the 21st Century","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0700/v1","date":1725883935000,"content":"In an era of rapid technological advancements, complex global challenges, and intense market competition, the ability to generate and scale innovative solutions has become a critical imperative for organizations, policymakers, and societies worldwide. However, the existing academic landscape has lacked a cohesive, multidisciplinary framework for comprehensively understanding the multifaceted nature of innovation. Innovationology, a newly established scientific discipline, aims to address this gap by providing a unifying, transdisciplinary approach to the study and practice of transformative innovation. This comprehensive article introduces Innovationology as a cutting-edge science that integrates insights from diverse fields, including management, psychology, sociology, economics, and technology studies. Innovationology posits that innovation is a multilayered, context-dependent phenomenon, shaped by the intricate interplay of individual, team, organizational, and ecosystem-level factors. By synthesizing the latest theoretical advancements and empirical evidence, this article presents a holistic model of Innovationology that illuminates the key determinants of radical, game-changing innovations capable of disrupting existing industries and creating new market spaces. The article delves deep into the individual cognitive, behavioral, and motivational drivers of innovativeness, the team dynamics and organizational structures that foster collaborative innovation, and the ecosystem-level characteristics that catalyze the emergence and scaling of transformative innovations. Importantly, the article explores the crucial role of contextual factors, such as socio-cultural norms, institutional support, and resource availability, in shaping innovation outcomes. This article also establishes the epistemological foundations of Innovationology, grounding it in a transdisciplinary, holistic, and pragmatic approach to knowledge generation. Innovationology embraces a pluralistic epistemology that acknowledges the complexity and context-dependence of innovation, drawing on diverse methodological approaches to capture the multifaceted nature of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the article outlines the object of Innovationology, which is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of the drivers, processes, and outcomes of transformative innovation. Innovationology seeks to elucidate the multilevel determinants of innovation, the dynamic interplay between various factors, and the contextual influences that shape innovation trajectories. By establishing a unifying, transdisciplinary framework, Innovationology aims to bridge the gap between innovation theory and practice, empowering a wide range of stakeholders to unlock the transformative potential of innovation. Importantly, this article outlines the practical applications of Innovationology, providing comprehensive strategies and evidence-based interventions for cultivating innovative mindsets, designing innovation-conducive organizational systems, and navigating the challenges of innovative ecosystems. The implications of Innovationology for entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, policymakers, and innovation scholars are discussed in detail. By establishing Innovationology as a distinct, authoritative scientific discipline, this article sets the foundation for a more holistic, context-sensitive understanding of innovation and its multifaceted drivers. The insights generated by this new science can empower global organizations, institutions, and policymakers to address the complex, interconnected challenges of the 21st century through the strategic deployment of transformative innovations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ebf9ce43a15d2c8ea35e6e73b4d577ccb5a349cf39f8567b86dd0fc6623466f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
