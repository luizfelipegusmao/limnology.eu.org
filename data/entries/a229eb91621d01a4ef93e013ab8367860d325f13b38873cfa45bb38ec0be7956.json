{"title":"Cellulose Membranes: Synthesis and Applications for Water and Gas Separation and Purification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1595/v1","date":1716538173000,"content":"Membranes are a selective barrier that allows certain species (molecules and ions) to pass through while blocking others. Some rely on size exclusion, where larger molecules get stuck while smaller ones permeate through. Others use differences in charge or polarity to attract and repel specific species. Membranes can be used to purify air and water by allowing only air and water molecules to pass through but preventing contaminants such as microorganisms and particles or to separate target gas or vapor, such as H2, COâ‚‚, from other gases. The higher the flux and selectivity, the better a material is for membranes. The desirable performance can be tuned through material type (polymers, ceramics, and biobased materials), microstructure (porosity and tortuosity), and surface chemistry. Most membranes are made from plastic from petroleum-based resources, which contribute to global climate change and plastic pollution. Cellulose can be an alternative sustainable resource to make renewable membranes. Cellulose exists in plant cell walls as natural fibers, which can be broken down into smaller components such as cellulose fibrils, nanofibrils, nanocrystals, and cellulose macromolecules through mechanical and chemical processing. Membranes made from reassembling these particles and molecules have variable pore architecture, porosity, and separation properties and therefore have a wide range of applications in nano-, micro-, and ultrafiltration or forward osmosis. Despite their advantages, cellulose membranes face some challenges. Improving the selectivity of membranes for specific molecules often comes at the expense of permeability. The stability of cellulose membranes in harsh environments or under continuous operation needs further improvement. Research is ongoing to address these challenges and develop advanced cellulose membranes with enhanced performance. This article reviews the microstructure, fabrication methods, and potential applications of cellulose membranes, providing some critical insights into processing-structure-property relationships for current state-of-the-art cellulosic membranes that could be used to rationally improve their performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a229eb91621d01a4ef93e013ab8367860d325f13b38873cfa45bb38ec0be7956","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
