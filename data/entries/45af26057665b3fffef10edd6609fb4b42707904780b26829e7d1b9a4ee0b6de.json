{"title":"Eigenvalue Distributions in Random Confusion Matrices: Applications to Machine Learning Evaluation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1010/v1","date":1713245872000,"content":"In this paper, we derive the distribution of eigenvalues for a 2×2 random confusion matrix stemming from a machine learning (ML) evaluation problem. Additionally, we present the distributions of both the matrix’s trace and the difference between the two traces of random confusion matrices. We also illustrate the application of these derived distributions in calculating the superiority probability of four baseline ML models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45af26057665b3fffef10edd6609fb4b42707904780b26829e7d1b9a4ee0b6de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
