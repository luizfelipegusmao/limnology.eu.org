{"title":"The Characterization of Newly Secreted Dental Enamel by Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.981/7720192?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Teeth are one of the hardest organs in the human body. Typically, mature enamel contains up to 95% of inorganic minerals and 5% of organic components, with hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>) constituting the majority of the inorganic material [<a href=\"#ozae044.981-B1\">1</a>]. However, during the development of the tooth, the forming HA phase in enamel lacks a high degree of crystallization, leading to cheesy texture and weak mechanical properties until the maturation process is completed. The abundance of protein in developing enamel also makes it sensitive to the electron beam, posing a challenge in characterizing evolving changes in crystallization.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"00d8e39f81cb3cc907982a3e4606bde885587a50720a8d61064585ac0629176d","category":"Environment"}
