We know little about how temperature and diet interact with rainbow trout gut microbes. A total of 288 fish (average body weight: 45.6 g) fed four iso-caloric, -lipidic, and -nitrogenous diets comprised crude protein (40%) and lipid (20%) manufactured as 100% animal-based protein (AP) and blend of 50 fish oil (FO)/50 camelina oil (CO), 100% AP and 100% CO, 100% plant-based protein (PP) and blend of 50 FO/50 CO or 100% PP and 100% CO at 14 or 18°C water temperature. Gut content was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing. Alpha-diversity did not change significantly. Regardless of diet, Tenericutes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria dominated. At family level, Aeromonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae dominated at 18°C, while Mycoplasmataceae dominated at 14°C. Moreover, genes relating to amino acid, carbohydrate, fat, and energy metabolisms and fatty acid biosynthesis significantly increased at 18°C. Functional profiles did not vary significantly among diets, except for a higher methionine and cysteine metabolism in fish fed plant ingredient compared animal diet, suggesting trout fed plant-derived protein mixed with CO could be as effective as those fed fish meals mixed with 50/50 FO and CO.</p>","author":"John N.
