{"title":"CAR-Macrophages: Precision Enhancer of Cancer Immunotherapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1102/v1","date":1726470742000,"content":"Recognizing the need to enhance immune cells' ability to target and eliminate tumor cells by focusing on tumor-associated antigens is crucial for the success of immunotherapy. Numerous cell-based therapies, such as CAR-T cell therapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, CAR-NK cell therapy, and T-cell receptor (TCR)-based therapies, are currently undergoing clinical and pre-clinical evaluation across various cancer types. However, a significant challenge lies in managing the inflammatory responses that are harmful to cancer patients. To overcome this, developing advanced strategies to target tumor cells precisely while preserving immune balance in cancer patients is imperative. One promising approach involves using modified tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which constitute approximately 50% of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and play a pivotal role in tumor progression. CAR-Macrophage (CAR-M) therapy is an emerging potential asset of immunotherapy for a wide range of tumors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ed65fe994490b5fb16102070f3abe61d3c3ad2409607f3a75f1edfcd92108fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
