The development of new scientific hardware and methods is critical to advancing in-situ nano-scale liquid cell microscopy and spectroscopy of these reactions. Traditional LC-TEM electrochemical cells employ a three-electrode geometry where the working, reference and counter electrodes are patterned on the chip. In this case, the reference electrode is known as a pseudo-reference. Due to exposure of the pseudo-reference to the electrolyte and reaction environment, it can have a limited stability window, which leads to shifts in the reference potential over extended experiments. This issue is further exacerbated by the limited liquid volume in the LC-TEM cells [<a href=\"#ozae044.604-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"08f57fb134aff009d635d104101bee5b8fcf8d730ac1c9772f8182753cefaee9","category":"Environment"}
