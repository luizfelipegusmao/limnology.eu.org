MICA/B are the ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D, found on cytotoxic immune cells like NK cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and γδ T cells. Upon engagement of NKG2D, these cells are activated to eradicate the MICA/B-positive targets, assisted by the secretion of cytokines. Nanobodies, or VHHs, are derived from the variable regions of camelid heavy-chain only immunoglobulins. Nanobodies are characterized by their small size, ease of production, stability, and specificity of recognition. We generated nanobodies that recognize membrane-bound MICA with high affinity. Here, we use these nanobodies as building blocks for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to establish VHH-based CAR NK cells. These anti-MICA nanobody-based CAR NK cells recognize and selectively kill MICA-positive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. We track localization of the VHH-based CAR NK cells to MICA-positive lung metastases by immuno-positron emission tomography imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"6e04451991c669ec95dbbc97a5faa2cb237b898c83fe77b7d0f3dae246440512","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
