{"title":"122 A retrospective analysis of gestational length and its influencers for Bos taurus beef cows","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/2/7617956?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The gestational length of cows is commonly set at 283 d. The objective of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis to determine gestational length and evaluate cow and calf parameters that influence gestational length of Bos taurus beef cows. A total of 10,037 reproductive records were used in this study. Data evaluated were obtained from reproductive records collected from Fall of 2011 through Spring of 2018, from 14 herds from the Virginia Department of Corrections beef cattle operations and the Virginia Tech Beef Center research herd. Cows used to measure gestation length were all pregnant to artificial insemination (AI) to ensure accurate breeding dates, and only pregnancies that resulted in a live birth were included in the dataset. Data were analyzed using the MIXED and CORR procedures of SAS. The average age of cows in this study was 5.5 ± 0.03 yr, with a minimum of 2 yr and a maximum of 18 yr of age. The average gestation length was 280.2 ± 0.05 d. The shortest and longest gestation lengths recorded were 253 d and 300 d, respectively. Gestation length was affected by calving season (P &lt; 0.0001), with a shorter gestation period for Fall (279.1 ± 0.08 d) than Spring born calves (281.1 ± 0.07 d). Calf sex also had an impact on gestation length (P = 0.0002), where male calves were on average gestated almost a day longer (280.8 ± 0.07 d) than females (279.6 ± 0.07 d). To evaluate whether a correlation exists between gestation length and selected variables, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Cow age (r = 0.2136; P &lt; 0.0001), calf birth weight (r = 0.3834; P &lt; 0.0001), calf weaning weight (r = 0.1438; P = 0.01) and calf adjusted weaning weights (r = 0.0253; P &lt; 0.0001) were correlated with gestation length of beef cows. In conclusion, the average gestation length of Bos taurus beef cows was 280 d, which is shorter than the commonly used 283 d, and it was affected by calving season (Fall and Spring) and calf sex. Further, while correlations exist among gestation length, cow age and calf traits, these correlations were weak to moderate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"87e31231655cbac7e997a7650943a331d1ba1d38b029436144fa89b040ec7a95","category":"Environment"}
