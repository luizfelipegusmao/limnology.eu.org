{"title":"The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress of Student-athletes&rsquo; from a Pre- to Post-COVID-19 World","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0121/v1","date":1717423983000,"content":"This study explored differences in student-athletes’ symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress pre- to post-COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO reported a 25% increase in depression and anxiety rates worldwide with young people disproportionately affected. Student-athletes face many stressors related to their sporting and academic feats but what is not known is how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their experiences of mental illness. A multiple cohort cross-sectional study design was employed, and data collected using physical and online surveys. Participants (M age = 19.98 years, SD = 1.50) were recruited from UK universities (N = 807; 427 pre-pandemic cohort, 380 post-pandemic cohort). Results revealed statistically significant differences in mean depression, anxiety, and stress scores between cohorts. Scores for the post-pandemic cohort were significantly higher than pre-pandemic, suggesting a worsening of symptom severity. Distributions of student-athletes across categories of symptom severity also worsened for depressive and anxiety symptoms post-pandemic and were skewed towards more severe categories. Symptoms of de-pression, anxiety, and stress were a concern pre-pandemic. Rates are higher in the post-pandemic cohort, suggesting a worsening of symptoms. This data adds to evidence on student-athletes’ symptoms of mental illness by exploring a UK sample and comparing scores pre- and post-pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a22b216b98c17e47a6fd6e5f6e9d6b7b0a4f24886322533158bf0e0652ef3907","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
