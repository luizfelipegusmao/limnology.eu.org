{"title":"The Interplay of Climate Change and Water Chemistry: Impacts on Freshwater Aquaculture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1258/v1","date":1729066248000,"content":"Fish is essential to feeding the world's population and provides hundreds of millions of people with a substantial amount of protein in their diets. Fish is one of the most affordable and readily available forms of animal protein, making up roughly 20% of total animal protein intake. It is simple to obtain these fish through cultivated or captured fisheries. However, the aquaculture industry is viewed as the main means of supplying the world's growing fish demand given the ongoing indiscriminate harvests in capture fisheries. Global aquaculture systems are under serious threats from climate change, which will have an impact on disease prevalence, species mix, water quality, and overall production. The possible impacts of climate change on freshwater aquaculture production and its consequences for the sustainability of the sector are reviewed in this paper. Rising temperatures, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation events, lowered dissolved oxygen, toxic algal blooms, altered rainfall patterns, water pH, altered salinity, and extreme weather events are a few of the aspects of a changing climate that have been discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bcf8d521a074a7a6bfe7014a5c2b073b0d0180c40f113835c7722a679b689197","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
