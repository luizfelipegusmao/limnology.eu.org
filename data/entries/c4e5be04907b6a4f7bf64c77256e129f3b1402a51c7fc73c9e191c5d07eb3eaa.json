{"title":"A Review of Plasma Chemical Surface Treatment on Parylene for Deposition on Ionic Polymers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0946/v1","date":1726132148000,"content":"The field of smart materials is attaining global industrial importance rapidly. The ionic polymer metal metaIl composites withheld there importance in this field. They are not only used as biocompatible devices but also in the field of thin and conformal bio coatings. The nafion 117 is unstable at elevated temperatures and its water intake resistance is low, so the nafion 117 is coated with the noble material to increase its thermal stability and water resistant property. The high cost of noble metal make its too costly to use in day to day applications so parylene has been used as substitute for noble metal in order to reduce the cost. The high thermal stability and water intake property if parylene make its suitable for the same. Multiple chemical treatments like plasma ionization and others have been done on the parylene coated nafion to increase its desirable properties considerably. The low adhesion rate between parylene and nafion 117 has been increased upto the certain extend by the use of ionized plasma. This paper reviewed the plasma chemical treatment of paryelene coatings for the biocompatible devices and provides an insight knowledge on classification, structure and thermal stability of the parylene coatings","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4e5be04907b6a4f7bf64c77256e129f3b1402a51c7fc73c9e191c5d07eb3eaa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
