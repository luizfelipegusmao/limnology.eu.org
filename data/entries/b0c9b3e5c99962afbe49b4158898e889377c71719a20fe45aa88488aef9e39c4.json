{"title":"Conceptual Design of Wood Pillar Foundation in Swampy Soil A Construction Solution for Drainage Improvement with Adaptation of Rain Garden&rsquo;s Concept","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1473/v2","date":1723639505000,"content":"Building on swampy land is a major challenge due to the soft and waterlogged soil properties. Traditional approaches using wooden pile foundations have long been used but new technology with a more environmentally friendly and efficient approach needs to be applied to swampy land. The objectives of this research are: to obtain a conceptual model of modified wooden pile foundation construction combined with concrete, to identify the impact of soil condition changes due to foundation implementation and the swampy groundwater environment, and to determine the application of the 'constructed wetland' and rain garden adaptation methods to the foundation model concept.In this research, a qualitative method was used with a descriptive approach based on literature studies and data collection through surveys/field observations. There is interdisciplinary collaboration from architectural, material, and environmental fields. The method conducted includes experimental testing of the foundation model concept. The research stages are: identifying variations in foundation design on wetland, survey/field study observation of foundations in Banjarmasin, architectural-material-environmental analysis of the foundation model concept with rain garden adaptation, and finally, conclusions and suggestions.The rain garden concept is an innovation that can help address waterlogging issues by enhancing the improvement of foundation construction and drainage in swampy soils. In this paper, the use of galam wood, wooden pile foundations, and construction technology innovations to improve swampy soil conditions are discussed in detail.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0c9b3e5c99962afbe49b4158898e889377c71719a20fe45aa88488aef9e39c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
