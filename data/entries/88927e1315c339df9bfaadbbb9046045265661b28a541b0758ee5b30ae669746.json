{"title":"Developing a Mobility as a Service Status Index: A Quantitative Approach Using Mobility Market and Macroeconomic Metrics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1054/v1","date":1723629310000,"content":"Despite the growing adoption of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) in urban transportation systems, standard monitoring methods for evaluating its impact and effectiveness still need to be developed. This study proposes a quantitative state of MaaS analysis based on mobility market indicators and macroeconomic metrics to generate a MaaS Status Index (MSI). The intention is to introduce a standardised quantitative methodology for systematically assessing and comparing the state of MaaS in urban mobility systems. The MSI aims to quantitatively capture the economic, social, technological, and infrastructural conditions relevant to MaaS implementation. The methodology includes four steps: identifying relevant mobility markets, defining mobility market metrics, integrating macroeconomic metrics, and deriving the MSI formula. We apply the MSI methodology to the Austrian mobility market as a case study, demonstrating its practicality in assessing MaaS readiness and highlighting specific challenges and opportunities within the Austrian mobility system. The analysis covers the present (2017-2022) and the projected future (2023-2028). The findings indicate that the proposed MSI is an effective tool for evaluating MaaS implementation readiness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88927e1315c339df9bfaadbbb9046045265661b28a541b0758ee5b30ae669746","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
