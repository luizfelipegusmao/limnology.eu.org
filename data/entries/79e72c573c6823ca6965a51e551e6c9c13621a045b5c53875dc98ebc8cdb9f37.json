{"title":"Developing a Manufacturing Industry Brain in Smart Cities: The Yiwu Knitting Industry Cloud Platform Case Study, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1053/v1","date":1710774912000,"content":"Smart cities are a new approach to facilitating urban development and transformation, driving coordinated development between regions, and achieving sustainable urban development. In the era of smart cities, industrial cloud platforms, as a concrete representation and carrier of “industrial brains”, are gradually becoming one of the core competences of urban manufacturing industries. Case study and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of a knitting industrial platform in Yiwu City, China are carried out. The following conclusion can be drawn: the construction mechanism and path of the manufacturing “industrial brain” in the smart city are divided into three stages according to the construction of the industrial platform. These include: functional development (FD), trust-building (TB), and value co-creation (VCC). The research conclusion helps to more deeply understand the effects of industrial platforms on constructing “industrial brains”. It provides effective transformation strategies and guidance for the manufacturing industry in the smart city, and pushes the industry to develop towards an intelligent, efficient, and environmental-friendly one. The research provides useful reference for applying the industrial platform to other industries and fields. Exploring the construction mechanism and path of the manufacturing “industrial brain” in the smart city can also contribute to the establishment of a new industrial ecosystem in the era of smart cities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79e72c573c6823ca6965a51e551e6c9c13621a045b5c53875dc98ebc8cdb9f37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
