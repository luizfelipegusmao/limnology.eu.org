{"title":"64Cu2+ Complexes of Tripodal Amine Ligands on In Vivo Tumor and Liver Uptake and Intracellular Cu Distribution in the Extrahepatic Bile Duct Carcinoma Cell Line TFK-1: A Basic Comparative Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1949/v1","date":1716984975000,"content":"Copper (Cu) is a critical element for cancer cell proliferation and considerably accumulates in the nucleus. 64Cu2+ is an anticancer radiopharmaceuticals targeting the copper requirement of cancer cells. However, intravenously injected 64Cu2+ ions primarily accumulate in the liver. Ligand complexation of 64Cu2+ would be a promising method for increasing tumor delivery by reducing liver uptake. Herein, we used three tripodal amine ligands [tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (Tren), diethylenetriamine (Dien), and tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA)] to enclose 64Cu2+ ions and compared their in vivo tumor and liver uptake using a tumor-bearing xenograft mouse model of the extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma cell line TFK-1. We examined intracellular Cu distribution using microparticle-induced X-ray emission (micro-PIXE) analysis for these compounds. 64Cu2+-Tren and 64Cu2+-Dien showed higher tumor uptake than 64Cu2+-TPMA and 64Cu2+ ions in TFK-1 tumors. Among the three 64Cu2+ complexes and 64Cu2+ ions, liver uptake was inversely correlated with tumor uptake. Micro-PIXE analysis showed that in vitro cellular uptake was similar to in vivo tumor uptake and nuclear delivery was the highest for 64Cu2+-Tren. Conclusively, an inverse correlation between tumor and liver uptake was observed using three 64Cu2+ complexes of tripodal amine ligands and 64Cu2+ ions. These results provide useful information for the future development of anticancer 64Cu radiopharmaceuticals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa6d7b42105cc54fc08e4220e21221aee1f1cc686d01832d085712e63b1eb498","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
