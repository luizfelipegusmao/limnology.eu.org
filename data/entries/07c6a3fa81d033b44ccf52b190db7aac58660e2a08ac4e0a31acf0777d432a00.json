Still, effective therapies on retinal neuroprotection are not available. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcriptional factors which strongly regulate angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, intracellular metabolism, and programed cell death under a hypoxic or an abnormal metabolic oxidative stress condition. Therefore, we aimed to unravel that inhibition of HIFs could prevent disease progression in photoreceptor cell death, as recent studies showed that HIFs might be pathologic factors in retinal diseases. Adult male balb/cAJcl (8 weeks old; BALB/c) were used to investigate preventive effects of a novel HIF inhibitor halofuginone (HF) on a murine model of light-induced retinopathy. After intraperitoneal injections of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or HF (0.4 mg/kg in PBS) for 5 days, male BALB/c mice were subjected to a dark-adaption to being exposed to a white LED light source at an intensity of 3,000 lux for 1 hour in order to induce light-induced retinal damage. After extensive light exposure, retinal damage was evaluated using electroretinography (ERG), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and TUNEL assay. Light-induced retinal dysfunction was suppressed by HF administration. The amplitudes of scotopic a-wave and b-wave as well as that of photopic b-wave were preserved in the HF-administered retina. Outer retinal thinning after extensive light exposure was suppressed by HF administration. Based on the TUNEL assay, cell death in the outer retina was seen after light exposure. However, its cell death was not detected in the HF-administered retina. Halofuginone was found to exert preventive effects on light-induced outer retinal cell death.","author":"Yukihiro Miwa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"07c6a3fa81d033b44ccf52b190db7aac58660e2a08ac4e0a31acf0777d432a00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
