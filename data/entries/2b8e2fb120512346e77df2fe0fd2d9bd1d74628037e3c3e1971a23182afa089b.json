The CICERO confocal spinning disk system embodies these principles, designed for easy integration into any imaging setup. Its compactness and flexibility make advanced fluorescence microscopy accessible to laboratories worldwide. This article will focus on the great versatility and strengths of the CICERO system, which is a complete widefield (WF) and spinning disk confocal (CF) solution. It will demonstrate its key features, namely its use on both inverted and upright microscopy configurations, its wide spectral range, the high resolution and sectioning power, and its large field of view (FOV). <span>Microscopy Today</span> has awarded CICERO a 2024 Innovation Award for these features.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"2b8e2fb120512346e77df2fe0fd2d9bd1d74628037e3c3e1971a23182afa089b","category":"Environment"}
