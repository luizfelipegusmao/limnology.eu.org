First, the structural characterization of the polymeric layer were obtained from Raman spectroscopy. Second, the electrochemical profiles of selected synthetic stimulants and their affinity to ThPhCF3/G-modified electrodes were studied using square wave voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spec-troscopy. The values of the adsorption constant show the importance of – PhCF3 groups in the interaction with synthetic stimulants, namely recognition by the formation of hydrogen bonds (Kads (buphedrone) &lt; Kads (2-AI)) and interaction with aromatic H atoms (Kads (buphedrone) &lt; Kads (naphyrone)). It was demonstrated that the polymeric layer derived from thiophene with – PhCF3 group is capable to increase the intensity of the electrochemical signal.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c91461200ba54f94cd908aadffdc7e79b6b1ad91497d3212d23deb113806291","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
