{"title":"Multimodal Analgesia Strategies for Cardiac Surgery: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2580/v1","date":1722482841000,"content":"In cardiac surgery, post-sternotomy pain is a significant issue, peaking within 48 hours and requiring proper analgesia for both acute relief and to avoid chronicization. Opioids are commonly used for pain management post-surgery but pose risks like adverse effects and dependency. Post-cardiac surgery pain can stem from various sources - somatic, visceral, and neuropathic, making opioid reliance a concern. Multimodal analgesia, combining different medications and regional anesthesia techniques, is increasingly recommended to decrease opioid use and its related problems. Strategies include acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, NMDA antagonists, alpha-2 agonists, intravenous lidocaine, anti-inflammatory drugs, and regional anesthesia. Implementing these approaches can enhance pain control, lessen opioid reliance, and improve cardiac surgery outcomes. The ERASÂ® Cardiac Society strongly advocates for an opioid-sparing multimodal approach to benefit patient recovery by reducing complications and enhancing satisfaction. This review aims to consolidate current evidence to assist healthcare providers in customizing pain management for patients post-cardiac surgery, emphasizing reduced opioid use and optimizing the recovery process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c23e5ba5cc106d4cfcf9c2e411feffdf6fec9401c5bc0b2dced45cfe72dbd43","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
