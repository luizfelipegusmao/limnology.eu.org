{"title":"Low Number of Baselines &gamma;&delta; T Cells Increase the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Post-Vaccination Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1115/v1","date":1713333655000,"content":"Background: The effectiveness of the anti-COVID-19 vaccine remains a matter to be clarified.\nMethods: The humoral and cellular immunity after the administration of three doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 over one year and the appearance of post-vaccination COVID-19 have been studied. \nResults: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies showed a progressive increase throughout the vaccination period. This increase was greatest after the third dose. The highest levels were observed in subjects who had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies prior to vaccination. There was an increase in CD4+ αβ, CD8+ γδ and TEM CD8+ γδ T cells, and a decrease in apoptosis in CD4+CD8+ and CD56+ αβ and γδ T cells. Post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection was greater than 60%. The symptoms of COVID-19 were very mild and were related to γδ T cell deficit, specifically CD8+ TEMRA and CD56+ γδ TEM, as well as lower pre-vaccine apoptosis levels.\nConclusions: Those results demonstrate the important role that γδ T cells play in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e09f52aefa70bab96285a295586ea5e1586f0e4566fd898693d66940cbda512","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
