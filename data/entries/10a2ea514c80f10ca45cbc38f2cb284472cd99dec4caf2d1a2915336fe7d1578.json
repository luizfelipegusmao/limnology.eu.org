{"title":"Secrecy Analysis of a Mu-MIMO LIS-Aided Communication Systems Under Nakagami-M Fading Channels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0422/v1","date":1712647895000,"content":"This study delves into the performance evaluation of an avant-garde technology in mobile communications known as Large Intelligent Surface (LIS), poised to be an integral component of the sixth-generation (6G) networks. This groundbreaking technology has the potential to markedly augment the Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) by orchestrating signals originating from the base station through a network of digitally controlled reflectors meticulously engineered to modulate the phase of incoming electromagnetic waves. A LIS can establish a Line of Sight (LoS) within channels that inherently do not have a LoS. In addition, it can also be optimized to increase transmission security by ensuring that the signal reaches only the target users of the message with better quality. In this study, analytical expressions were derived to calculate the distribution parameters, the bit error probability, and the secrecy outage probability. These calculations consider the presence of an eavesdropper link, highlighting the potential of the LIS to increase the confidentiality of digital communication systems. The accuracy of the proposed formulas was demonstrated by showing how the performance of the LIS varies with different design parameters and environmental fading.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10a2ea514c80f10ca45cbc38f2cb284472cd99dec4caf2d1a2915336fe7d1578","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
