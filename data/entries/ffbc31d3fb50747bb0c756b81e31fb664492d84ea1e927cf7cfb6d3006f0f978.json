{"title":"Significant Neurodevelopmental Delays Associated with a Higher Incidence of Abnormal Behavioral Patterns and Paraphilias?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.2108/v2","date":1721998923000,"content":"Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterised by an amalgam of genetic and epigenetic faults implicating neuronal protein-related loss-of-function and gain-of-function respectively, hence their inclusion into the category of complex diseases. Neurodevelopmental disorders are regarded as autism spectrum disorder due to this reason; that the risk factors and phenotype constitute a spectrum of faults and protein overactivity. One example of an epigenetic factor leading to the onset of neurodevelopmental delays constitutes a set of immune response-based dysregulations, as well as the excessive growth of the adaptive immune memory of the foetus or the baby following significant infectious disease during pregnancy, as well as in babies aged 0-2, given the existence of profound links between developmental immunity and developmental neurology. Given that genetic information very likely represents a form of energy, the intake of excessive pathogen-related information may transiently overload the adaptive immune memory similarly to the manner functional pathogens do whilst inducing significant illness, and if events as such occur during important stages of neuro-immunological development, then there could often be irreversible effects upon the rate of development in neurological networks that normally have a major importance in the modulation of the related cognitive and behavioural phenotype. The full extent of evidence may only be obtained via a thorough study of the applications of physical laws into biology and medicine, given the foundational role of the physical matter in the development and maintenance of life. A common misconception is that neurodevelopmental delays are characterised solely by an accumulation of protein loss-of-function incidences in the central nervous system area, rather than a disruption of neuronal region developmental rates. For example, an overexpression of neuronal proteins related to cognition factors that is accompanied by an underexpression of proteins related to social behaviour is phenotypically manifested in people with sharper rational thinking and poorer communication skills, with an impact on the abilities of decision-making as well, and this tends to be regarded as a classical example of the clinical manifestation of neurodevelopmental delays. More severe forms of autism spectrum disorder tend to implicate a more generalistic impact upon the developmental rates of key human behaviours, including those related with the development and maintenance of social and intimate relationships. Likewise, more severe implications upon regular developmental rates tend to bring a major impact upon the healthy function of related functions. As a result, lower functioning forms of neurodevelopmental delays bring fresh concerns with regards to a possible uncanny increase of incidences of deviated sexuality during years of adulthood, and in the worst cases, such deviations may lead to the planning and development of criminal activity, particularly in individuals who are or become prone to breaking the moral code that established the civilised society. What holds the concerns valid is the exponential increase in the number of lower functioning autism cases throughout the world and the major signs that such an increase will continue with a full force. One major solution to this potential future problem would be a much higher investment into awareness of the exact genetic and environmental factors that directly or indirectly result in the onset of lower-functioning autism and of the current research efforts to develop the matching support for people found in situations as such. The most important aim of future research with regards to such a scenario would be a separation of disease and disability with choices made to step into more severe forms of disease and into areas that are outside of the established moral circle.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffbc31d3fb50747bb0c756b81e31fb664492d84ea1e927cf7cfb6d3006f0f978","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
