{"title":"Biogeomorphological response to river restoration of a suburban river with large wood: Creating a restoration vision and cost‐effectively monitoring the response trajectory using the citizen science MoRPh survey","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4262?af=R","date":1710732579000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Biogeomorphological responses to river restoration are rarely reported. Despite a transition in the emphasis and priorities of river management over the last 40 years from controlling river channel forms and processes to restoring and supporting natural processes, forms and functions, remarkably little information is available on project outcomes. Here, using the example of Beverley Brook within Wimbledon Common, Greater London, UK, we illustrate how standardised detailed monitoring information can be assembled at a very low cost using the citizen science MoRPh survey and we demonstrate the importance of having a pre-project vision of likely outcomes that can be tracked by the monitoring programme. We show how a pre-project and five post-project surveys undertaken over 4 years according to a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design provides scientifically robust data. Analysis of the survey data quantifies the nature, abundance and spatial distribution of restoration interventions, the immediate responses to those interventions, and the ensuing trajectory of biogeomorphological adjustments. Changes in the persistence, size, position, abundance and evolution of habitats reveal the degree to which the restoration achieved the pre-project biogeomorphological vision and why the recovery trajectory progressed at the observed rate and to the observed end point over 4 years. Our approach has enormous potential for monitoring the outcomes of river interventions. Whilst our project was limited in its spatial scale and focus on physical habitats, we suggest how these limitations could be overcome whilst still containing costs.</p>","author":"Lucy Shuker, \nAngela Gurnell, \nToby Hull","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"5b678275eddef6220de2986102b691f22ab88e7d912cc1c0bfd97a6dd8787e60","category":"Environment"}
