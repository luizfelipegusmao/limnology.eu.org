Such conflict is not expected under self-fertilization. A new study led by Rifkin and Ostevik suggests that divergence in the degree of conflict between closely related outcrossing and selfing species can lead to aberrant early development of hybrids in morning glories. This dynamic represents a potentially powerful driver of reproductive incompatibility and thus speciation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"9f9f7c653b1a5f261ce5c8655b94d606f026cdcb608c091561f4873fc4f9c327","category":"Environment"}
