{"title":"Stability and Composting Behaviour of Pla-Starch Laminates Containing Active Extracts and Cellulose Fibres from Rice Straw","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1161/v1","date":1713350181000,"content":"The stability and composting behaviour of monolayers and laminates of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and starch with and without active extracts and cellulose fibres from rice straw (RS) were evaluated. The retrogradation of the starch throughout storage (1, 5, and 10 weeks) gave rise to stiffer and less extensible monolayers, with lower water vapour barrier capacity. In contrast, the PLA monolayers, with or without extract, did not show marked changes with storage. However, these changes were more attenuated in the bilayers that gained water vapour and oxygen barrier capacity during storage, maintaining the values of the different properties close to the initial range. The bioactivity of the active films exhibited a slight decrease during the storage, the antioxidant capacity being better preserved in the bilayers. All monolayer and bilayer films were fully composted within 90 days, but with different behaviour. The bilayer assembly enhanced the biodegradation of PLA whose monolayer exhibited a lag period of about 35 days. The active extract reduced biodegradation rate of both mono and bilayers but does not limit the material biodegradation within the time stablished in the Standard. Therefore, PLA-starch laminates, with or without the valorised fractions from RS, can be considered as biodegradable and stable materials for food packaging applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbb9126d7d2118dff94bea7cbe84a9815c5f20f664a8945a76e5d0cc23f49b99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
