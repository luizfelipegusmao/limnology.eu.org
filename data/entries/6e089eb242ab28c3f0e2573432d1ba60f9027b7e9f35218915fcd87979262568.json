{"title":"Call combination in African forest elephants <i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299656","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Daniela Hedwig, Anna Kohlberg</p>\r\n\r\nSyntax, the combination of meaning-devoid phonemes into meaningful words, which in turn are combined in structurally and semantically complex sentences, is fundamental to the unlimited expressiveness of human languages. Studying the functions of call combinations in non-human species provides insights into the evolution of such syntactic capabilities. Here, we investigated the combination of high amplitude broadband calls with low frequency rumble vocalizations in a highly social species, the African forest elephant <i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>. Rumbles play an integral role in coordinating social interactions by transmitting socially relevant information, including individual identity. By contrast, broadband calls, such as roars, are thought to function as signals of distress and urgency as they are typically produced in situations of high emotional intensity. Functional changes associated with the combination of these calls remain little understood. We found that call combinations were produced by all age-sex classes but were most prevalent in immature individuals. We found that rumbles used singularly occurred in all five investigated social contexts, whereas single broadband calls were restricted to two resource-related contexts. Call combinations also occurred in all five contexts, suggesting an increase in the functional use of broadband calls when combined with rumbles, analogous to the generativity brought about through syntax in human speech. Moreover, combining calls appeared to lead to functional shifts towards high-stake contexts. Call combinations were more likely in competition contexts compared to single rumbles, and more likely in separation contexts compared to single broadband calls. We suggest that call combination in forest elephants may aide to reduce message ambiguity in high-stake situation by simultaneously communicating distress and individual identity, which may be critical to secure access to resources, reduce the risk of injury and to reunite with or recruit the support of the family group.","author":"Daniela Hedwig","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6e089eb242ab28c3f0e2573432d1ba60f9027b7e9f35218915fcd87979262568","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
