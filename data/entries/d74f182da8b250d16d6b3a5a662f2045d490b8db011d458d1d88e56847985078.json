{"title":"Knowledge, attitude, and practices of stakeholders involved in healthcare financing programs on economic evaluations in Cameroon","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003101","date":1714053600000,"content":"<p>by Eric Tchouaket, Katya Kruglova, Isidore Sieleunou, Marcellin Tsafack, Joseph Maabo Tankwa, Gislaine Takoguen, Nikolas Argiropoulos, Stephanie Robins, Drissa Sia</p>\r\n\r\nThere are many healthcare financing programs (HFPs) in Cameroon; however, there is a lack of information on these programs’ economic effectiveness and efficiency. Involvement of local stakeholders in the economic evaluations (EEs) of HFPs is critical for ensuring contextual factors are considered prior to program implementation. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the need for EEs of Cameroonian HFPs. Regular staff in supervisory roles aged 18 years and above were recruited in four Cameroonian cities. Data were collected via face-to-face surveys between June 15 and August 1, 2022. Descriptive analyses summarized participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices in relation to performing EEs of HFPs. Principal component analyses identified organizational, individual, and contextual factors that could influence participants’ involvement. The total sample included 106 participants. On average, 65% of participants reported being aware of the listed HFPs; however, of these, only 28% said that they had been involved in the HFPs. Of the 106 participants, 57.5% knew about EEs; yet, almost 90% reported that the HFP in question had never been subject to an EE, and 84% had never been involved in an EE. Most participants indicated that they had intended or would like to receive EE training. Using principal component analyses, the organizational factors were classified into two components (‘policy and governance’ and ‘planning and implementation’), the individual factors were classified into two components (‘training’ and ‘motivation’), and the contextual factors were classified into three components (‘funding,’ ‘political economy,’ and ‘public expectations’). The findings of this study highlight the need to invest in EE training to improve participation rates of Cameroonian stakeholders in the EEs of HFPs. Improved knowledge, diversified skills, and increased participation of stakeholders from all levels of the Cameroonian healthcare system are critical to the effective and efficient development, implementation, and EE of the country’s HFPs.","author":"Eric Tchouaket","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"d74f182da8b250d16d6b3a5a662f2045d490b8db011d458d1d88e56847985078","category":"Environment"}
