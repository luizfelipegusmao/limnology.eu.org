{"title":"Structural Design and Technology of Pocket Foundations for Long Precast Concrete Columns in Seismic Areas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2206/v1","date":1727441837000,"content":"The connection between a prefabricated reinforced concrete column and a pocket foundation is a case treated from a general perspective in the European Standard named EN 1992-1-1, and when the structural engineer deals with the dimensioning or verification of the connection, he tackles several unknowns. The present work aims to fill in the missing information by presenting detailed calculation models based on the strut-and-tie method for 4 of the widely used pocket foundations: pedestal pocket foundation with smooth, rough or keyed internal walls, and pad foundation with pocket possessing keyed internal walls. Additionally, detailed design prescriptions applicable to seismic areas are given. Afterwards, as a case study, a pocket foundation is designed in all 4 variations, having the structural design particularities, similitudes and differences pointed out. Finally, to conclude the advantages and disadvantages are mentioned for pocket foundations in respect to the type of internal wall surface used. Quantifiable data based on the case study undertaken is available.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91de63b099b6a098935ae04f0e30cf475a999854d65e8deb4b0113242d5da9aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
