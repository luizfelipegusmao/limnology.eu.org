{"title":"A New Approach to Achieving Implant Stability with Flexible Synthetic Polymer Bone Graft: An In Vitro Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1177/v1","date":1710936062000,"content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a flexible synthetic polymer bone graft to provide implant stability in the absence of implant stability during implant placement in a dense cortical bone model. Sockets were prepared on polyurethane blocks according to the standard implant socket drilling protocol in the control group, both oversizing and deepening in group 2, and oversizing only in group 3. In groups 2 and 3, flexible synthetic polymer bone grafts were placed in the sockets prior to implant placement. The implants were placed at bone level in all groups. The highest torque value obtained was recorded as the insertion torque. 75 implant sites in 3 groups were included in the study. The torque values of the implants in the control group were significantly higher than those of the implants with the oversized and deepened sockets and the oversized-only sockets (p&amp;lt;0.05; p&amp;lt;0.01).The torque values of the implants with the oversized and deepened sockets were significantly higher than those of the implants with the oversized-only sockets (p&amp;lt;0.01). In this study, flexible synthetic polymer bone graft was shown to be effective in achieving implant stability in the management of implants with loss of primary stability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1825b7fb552a49d0e9a5ea08bb3ac1b3402e3ca1afebc1a29c62045729339b1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
