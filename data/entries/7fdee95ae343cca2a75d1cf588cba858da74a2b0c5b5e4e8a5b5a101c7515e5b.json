{"title":"Mechanism of oxalate decarboxylase Oxd_S12 from Bacillus velezensis BvZ45-1 in defence against cotton verticillium wilt","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3500/7633554?rss=1","date":1711065600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Verticillium wilt, a soilborne vascular disease caused by <span>Verticillium dahliae</span>, strongly affects cotton yield and quality. In this study, an isolated rhizosphere bacterium, designated <span>Bacillus velezensis</span> BvZ45-1, exhibited &gt;46% biocontrol efficacy against cotton verticillium wilt under greenhouse and field conditions. Moreover, through crude protein extraction and mass spectrometry analyses, we found many antifungal compounds present in the crude protein extract of BvZ45-1. The purified oxalate decarboxylase Odx_S12 from BvZ45-1 inhibited the growth of <span>V. dahliae</span> Vd080 by reducing the spore yield, causing mycelia to rupture, spore morphology changes, cell membrane rupture, and cell death. Subsequently, overexpression of <span>Odx_S12</span> in Arabidopsis significantly improved plant resistance to <span>V. dahliae</span>. Through studies of the resistance mechanism of <span>Odx_S12</span>, <span>V. dahliae</span> was shown to produce oxalic acid (OA), which has a toxic effect on Arabidopsis leaves. <span>Odx_S12</span> overexpression reduced Arabidopsis OA content, enhanced tolerance to OA, and improved resistance to verticillium wilt. Transcriptomics and quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that <span>Odx_S12</span> promoted a reactive oxygen species burst and a salicylic acid- and abscisic acid-mediated defence response in Arabidopsis. In summary, this study not only identified <span>B. velezensis</span> BvZ45-1 as an efficient biological control agent, but also identified the resistance gene <span>Odx_S12</span> as a candidate for cotton breeding against verticillium wilt.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7fdee95ae343cca2a75d1cf588cba858da74a2b0c5b5e4e8a5b5a101c7515e5b","category":"Environment"}
