Twenty-five genotypes were evaluated at three locations in two consecutive growing seasons, 2022 and 2023. The genotypes were assessed for their agronomic performance, tuber yield and related traits using various analytical tools such as AMMI (Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction) and MTSI (Multi-trait stability index). The AMMI analysis revealed significant differences among the genotypes and across the environ-ments for all traits (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8a7afe7114b3042bcc76122025dc4c290f62d071bfb8453948cbae250ba8b350","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
