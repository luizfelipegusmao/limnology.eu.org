{"title":"Block Copolymers of Poly(N-Vinyl Pyrrolidone) and Poly(Vinyl Esters) Bearing N-alkyl Side-Groups via RAFT Polymerization Synthesis, Characterization and Thermal Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0732/v1","date":1723430230000,"content":"Amphiphilic block copolymers of N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) and various vinyl esters (VEs), PNVP-b-PVEs, namely vinyl butyrate (VBu), vinyl decanoate (VDc) and vinyl stearate (VSt) were synthesized by RAFT polymerization techniques. The sequential addition of monomers methodology was employed starting from the polymerization of NVP followed by the polymerization of the VEs monomer. The reaction was conducted at 80oC in dioxane solutions using AIBN as initiator and O-ethyl S-(phthalimidylmethyl) xanthate as the CTA. The block copolymers were characterized by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and NMR spectroscopy. The thermal transitions of the copolymers were studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), whereas their thermal stability via Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Thermogravimetry (DTG).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fee6c481e742b3015d978f6047811ad97a62eaa943922156d8abbb0bba5daf9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
