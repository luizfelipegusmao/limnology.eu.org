{"title":"Aloe Vera as a Printed Coating to Demote the Wear of Textiles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1772/v1","date":1721721893000,"content":"Aloe vera is well known for its biological properties as a bioflavonoid-anti-inflammatory, antibacterial agent. It has been used frequently in the food sector as food coating for its hygroscopic properties and as an ingredient in the lucrative industry. Studies have also included Aloe vera as an eco-friendly green solution based on these properties. The current research focuses on the use of Aloe vera gel in printing pastes as an alternative sustainable solution to synthetic thickeners, evaluating its wet performance and ease of fabric stitching, and has been inspired by studies that similarly used this substance measuring its effect on the fabric's coefficient of friction and antimicrobial action. In the current study, printing pastes with natural colourants and Aloe vera gel thickener derived from natural leaves from Crete increased the fabric's mechanical resistance to abrasion compared to the untreated pastes. The measured performance did not differ substantially from prints with traditional synthetic pastes, hence tolerating the substitution with the non-contaminant variant. The enhanced resistance to abrasion and wear prolongates the fabric's serviceable life and resulting garments, decreasing the need for high industry processing volumes and, as a result, reducing pollution. The resistance to wear was evaluated using the dominant method in textile testing of the Martindale apparatus, which measured the cycles to failure, weight loss, and general appearance deterioration using the official photographic standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72ea1dbd6fbafb5a22616d01f44c075349a382a9f1e1a56805a93ffac2edc59a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
