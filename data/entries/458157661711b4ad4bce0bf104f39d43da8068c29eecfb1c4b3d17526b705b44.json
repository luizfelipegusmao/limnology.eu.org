{"title":"Obesity and Cardiovascular Risk in Flight Crew","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0015/v1","date":1727776501000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among Algerian aircrew, a population exposed to unique environmental and occupational stressors. By comparing these rates to the general population, we sought to identify specific health challenges faced by aircrew. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 154 Algerian aircrew participants. Prevalence rates for current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were compared between the aircrew and a general population control group. Results: Our findings revealed significantly higher rates of current smoking among aircrew compared to the general population. Additionally, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes emerged as the most prevalent risk factors within the aircrew population. Conclusions: Despite the rigorous selection process for aircrew recruitment, our study confirms findings from previous literature, highlighting the high rate of normal qualifying examinations. The substantial sample size and homogeneous nature of the aircrew population enhance the reliability and generalizability of our conclusions. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions to mitigate CVD risk factors within this specific population, given the unique environmental and occupational factors associated with aircrew.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"458157661711b4ad4bce0bf104f39d43da8068c29eecfb1c4b3d17526b705b44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
