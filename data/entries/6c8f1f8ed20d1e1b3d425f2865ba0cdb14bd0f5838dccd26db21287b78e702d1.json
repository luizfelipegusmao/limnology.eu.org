{"title":"Evaluation of the Antifungal Activity of Eugenol against the Candida albicans Genomic DNA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1060/v1","date":1726301335000,"content":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of eugenol against the genomic DNA of Candida albicans. A quantitative experimental study was conducted with the C. albicans INCQS 40006 strain. Eugenol was tested in concentrations of 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. The test substance remained in contact with the fungus for 24 hours in a BHI medium in a microbio-logical greenhouse, then the DNA extraction was performed and part of the sample obtained was washed with TE to remove the Eugenol. The fungus was placed in BHI again and placed for 24 hours in a microbiological greenhouse. At the end, the samples with 100% eugenol went through seeds in Sabouraud Dextrose for confirmatory tests. Thus, from the electrophoresis, which admits evaluating the quality of the extracted material, preserving its characteristics and integrity, it was observed in the eugenol concentration test (test 1), in which the eugenol was in direct contact with the pathogen, that in concentrations of equal to or greater than 75% of the test substance the pathogen had no proliferative power. In which the fungus's ability to recover is evaluated (test 2), eugenol was removed from the sample, noting that in 100% of the test substance the fungus did not have the ability to recover, resulting in definitive cell death.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c8f1f8ed20d1e1b3d425f2865ba0cdb14bd0f5838dccd26db21287b78e702d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
