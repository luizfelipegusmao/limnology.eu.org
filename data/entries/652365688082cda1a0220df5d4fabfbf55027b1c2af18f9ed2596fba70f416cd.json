{"title":"Ribonucleotides differentially modulate oral glutamate detection thresholds","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjad049/7513904?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The savory or umami taste of the amino acid glutamate is synergistically enhanced by the addition of the purines inosine 5ʹ-monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine 5ʹ-monophosphate (GMP) disodium salt. We hypothesized that the addition of purinergic ribonucleotides, along with the pyrimidine ribonucleotides, would decrease the absolute detection threshold of (increase sensitivity to) <span>l</span>-glutamic acid potassium salt (MPG). To test this, we measured both the absolute detection threshold of MPG alone and with a background level (3 mM) of 5 different 5ʹ-ribonucleotides. The addition of the 3 purines IMP, GMP, and adenosine 5ʹ-monophosphate (AMP) lowered the MPG threshold in all participants (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), indicating they are positive modulators or enhancers of glutamate taste. The average detection threshold of MPG was 2.08 mM, and with the addition of IMP, the threshold was decreased by approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude to 0.046 mM. In contrast to the purines, the pyrimidines uridine 5ʹ-monophosphate (UMP) and cytidine 5ʹ-monophosphate (CMP) yielded different results. CMP reliably raised glutamate thresholds in 10 of 17 subjects, suggesting it is a negative modulator or diminisher of glutamate taste for them. The rank order of effects on increasing sensitivity to glutamate was IMP &gt; GMP&gt; AMP &gt;&gt; UMP// CMP. These data confirm that ribonucleotides are modulators of glutamate taste, with purines enhancing sensitivity and pyrimidines displaying variable and even negative modulatory effects. Our ability to detect the co-occurrence of glutamate and purines is meaningful as both are relatively high in evolutionarily important sources of nutrition, such as insects and fermented foods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"652365688082cda1a0220df5d4fabfbf55027b1c2af18f9ed2596fba70f416cd","category":"Environment"}
