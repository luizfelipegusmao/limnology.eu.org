{"title":"Artificial Intelligence in the Non-Invasive Detection of Melanoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0984/v1","date":1728956972000,"content":"Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with an increasing incidence. Skin cancer is typically classified as melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer. Melanoma, despite being much less common than basal or squamous cell carcinomas, is the most deadly, with nearly 8,300 Americans expected to die from melanoma each year. Biopsies are currently the gold standard in diagnosing melanoma; however, they can be invasive and expensive and inaccessible to lower-income individuals. Currently, suspicious lesions are triaged with image-based technologies, such as dermatoscopy and confocal microscopy. While these techniques are useful, there is wide inter-user variability and minimal training for dermatology residents on how to properly use these devices. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in dermatology has emerged in recent years to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma that may be more accessible to all patients and more accurate than current methods of screening. This review explores the current status of the application of AI-based algorithms in the detection of melanoma, underscoring its potential to aid dermatologists in clinical practice. We will specifically focus on AIâ€™s application in clinical imaging, dermoscopic evaluation, algorithms that can distinguish melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancers, and in-vivo skin imaging devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a78cfb1a496ecd2026349fd7c6af65821602299d8a897916eb2b0092523b9ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
