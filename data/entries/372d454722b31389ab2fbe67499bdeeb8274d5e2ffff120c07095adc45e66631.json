Switch something that makes the viewing experience more difficult — like making the jersey the same dull color as Bora Hansgrohe’s kit — and we will amplify that with a megaphone tinged with feedback.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1247984770.jpeg?width=730\" alt width=\"1070\" height=\"602\" /><figcaption>He’s Mads about the new color.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<p>But regardless of the feelings of the masses, at least the ones with Twitter accounts, the jersey <a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/news/road/love-it-or-loathe-it-the-green-jersey-at-paris-nice-is-on-its-way-to-the-tour-de-france/\" target=\"_blank\">seems here to stay</a> and is headed straight to the big time this July.</p>\n<p>We would, however, like to offer up some alternatives to the ASO.</p>\n<h2>Number 5: #00fe08</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/00fe08.png?width=604\" alt width=\"604\" height=\"602\" /></figure>\n<p>The new color is too dull.

How much darker can this color go and still be called green? That’s for the courts to decide.<span> </span></p>\n<h2>Number 3: #caffba</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/caffba.png?width=606\" alt width=\"606\" height=\"606\" /></figure>\n<p>How about a cheery pastel?</p>\n<h2>Number 2: #04F404</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/04F404.png?width=602\" alt width=\"602\" height=\"602\" /></figure>\n<p>The green-screen color raises all sorts of exciting opportunities, like swapping it out for the old shade of green in real time on broadcasts.</p>\n<h2>Number 1: #54AC4B</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/54AC4B.png?width=600\" alt width=\"600\" height=\"602\" /></figure>\n<p>Oh yeah, that’s the one. Right there. Some might say that’s the same color as the previous jersey. And they would be right! @ASO please change it back. Let this be a New Coke situation.
