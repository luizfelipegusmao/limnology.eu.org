{"title":"Metamaterial Labyrinth Wall Low-Frequency Sound Absorption Measurements for Restaurant Room Acoustics and Decorative Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1178/v1","date":1710922305000,"content":"A labyrinth metamaterial wall with glass coverage is measured in a reverberating chamber and after its installation in a restaurant. Glass is used to meet two aims, namely acoustic absorption and visual design demands. The wall consists of five multiple labyrinth elements of 1.83 m$^2$ each. Glass was taken to make the wall act as a room lightning device where a translucent cover material is needed. Absorption measurements show about four times improved absorption compared to typical glass. Due to the metamaterial behavior, absorption is high in the low-frequency range below 300 Hz where damping is problematic with traditional materials. Especially in this range, the glass metamaterial wall is an excellent compromise between room acoustic and visual design demands, as loud low-frequencies make visitors speak louder and experience less intimacy with additionally reduced speech intelligibility. For mid-frequencies, absorption is shown less effective and improvements are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07da816fb3edc0e3c7a0b20bc6304f9896ec50147d1e3aab74b01859c1e65d53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
