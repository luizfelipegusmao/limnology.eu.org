{"title":"Exploring the Role of Supplier Relationship Management in Enhancing E-Commerce Scalability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0840/v1","date":1720604946000,"content":"This research investigates the pivotal role of Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) in enhancing e-commerce scalability. SRM practices are essential for optimizing supply chain operations and fostering strategic partnerships with suppliers, crucial in the dynamic and competitive e-commerce landscape. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies, expert interviews, and secondary data, the study examines how leading e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Alibaba implement effective SRM strategies to achieve scalability. Key findings reveal that strategic supplier selection based on capabilities and alignment with business goals, coupled with continuous evaluation and development programs, ensures consistent supply chain performance and customer satisfaction. Technological advancements, including data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, play a transformative role in modern SRM by enhancing transparency, efficiency, and decision-making capabilities. These technologies enable real-time monitoring, automated processes, and risk mitigation strategies that bolster supply chain resilience and operational efficiency. Best practices in SRM, such as clear performance metrics, a culture of continuous improvement, and ethical sourcing policies, are critical for driving supplier accountability, innovation, and sustainability. Moreover, sustainability emerges as a growing priority in SRM, with businesses integrating environmental and social considerations into supplier management strategies to meet regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. Theoretical frameworks like the Resource-Based View and Transaction Cost Economics provide insights into the strategic implications of SRM, emphasizing its role in fostering competitive advantage and long-term business success. As e-commerce continues to evolve, businesses must adapt and innovate in their SRM approaches to navigate global supply chain complexities effectively. By prioritizing effective SRM practices, leveraging advanced technologies, and embracing sustainability, businesses can enhance their scalability, resilience, and competitiveness in the digital economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"044756d7edaffee73ac848efdcc81f59c23f61e68c5a569e0cd6ef8eec533b92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
