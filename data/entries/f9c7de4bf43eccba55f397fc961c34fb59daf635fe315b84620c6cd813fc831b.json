{"title":"Interaction of Silicon-Phosphorus: The Unexplored Connection in the Soil Ecosystem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0945/v1","date":1728650507000,"content":"Phosphorus (P) is an essential element in food production, but it is often largely unavailable for plants as it persists in soils in immobilized forms. Farmers have been using P fertilizers extensively to overcome this unavailability, leading to the exhaustion of non-renewable deposits of phosphorite, rising fertilizers prices and causing several environmental impacts such as eutrophication. Its large-scale utilization is also inefficient since most of the added P becomes quickly unavailable for the plants. Therefore, farming solutions that improve P uptake, P use efficiency of plants and P mobilization in soils are highly important. In this narrative review, we summarized and explored the link between the Silicon (Si) and P cycles in soils. Silicon is quasi-essential for plants, and it has been established that its presence in soil and uptake by plants has several benefits, especially in toxic and nutrient-deficient conditions. Here, we established that Si in soils can affect crop production in P-deficient conditions through: 1) the pH effect – Si improves organic matter decomposition and decreases Al3+ availability; the Si uptake effect – the deposited Si in the plant improves its photosynthetic performance, improves the root ability to uptake P, improves organic matter decomposition and increases P/Mn ration in plant, improving P use; and 3) the Si soil effect – Si stimulates phosphorite rocks weathering and competes with P for the binding places at the surface of Ak and Fe hydroxides, releasing P into soil solution. This positive effect of Si on P mobilization in soils and consequent use by crops should be further disseminated to farmers and other relevant stakeholders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9c7de4bf43eccba55f397fc961c34fb59daf635fe315b84620c6cd813fc831b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
