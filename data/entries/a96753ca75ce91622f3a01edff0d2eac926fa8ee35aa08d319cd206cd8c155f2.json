{"title":"Can AI-Powered Whole Genome Sequencing Be Used Routinely for Personalized Decision Support in Surgical Oncology? &ndash; A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1050/v1","date":1710811551000,"content":"INTRODUCTION : In this scoping review, we delve into the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing challenges inherent in whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis, with a specific focus on its implications in surgical oncology. METHODS: Scoping review of whole genomic sequencing and artificial intelligence.DISCUSSION : Unveiling the limitations of existing sequencing technologies, the review illuminates how AI-powered methods emerge as innovative solutions to surmount these obstacles. The evolution of DNA sequencing technologies, progressing from Sanger sequencing to next-generation sequencing, sets the backdrop for AI's emergence as a potent ally in processing and analyzing the voluminous genomic data generated by these technologies. Particularly, deep learning methods play a pivotal role in extracting knowledge and discerning patterns from the vast landscape of genomic information. In the context of oncology, AI-powered methods exhibit considerable potential across diverse facets of WGS analysis, including variant calling, structural variation identification, and pharmacogenomic analysis. CONCLUSIONS : This review underscores the significance of multimodal approaches in diagnoses and therapies, highlighting the imperative for ongoing research and development in AI-powered WGS techniques. Integrating AI into the analytical framework empowers scientists and clinicians to unravel the intricate interplay of genomics within the realm of multi-omics research, paving the way for more personalized and targeted treatments in surgical oncology and perhaps beyond.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a96753ca75ce91622f3a01edff0d2eac926fa8ee35aa08d319cd206cd8c155f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
