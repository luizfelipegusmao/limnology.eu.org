{"title":"Use of Cosmetics in Pregnancy and Neurotoxicity: Increased Risk of Congenital Enteric Neuropathies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0333/v1","date":1720053152000,"content":"The inclusion of various chemical substances in personal care products (PCPs) and cosmetic formulations can be associated with disruption and damage to the nervous system. Microplastics, benzophenones, parabens, phthalates and metals are among the most common chemical substances found in cosmetics that have been shown to induce neurotoxic mechanisms. Although cosmetic neurotoxin exposure is believed to be minimal, different exposure scenarios of cosmetics suggest that these neurotoxins remain a threat. Special attention should be paid to early exposure in the first gestation weeks, when critical processes, like the migration and proliferation of the neural crest derived cells start to form the ENS. Importantly, cosmeticâ€™s neurotoxins can cross the placenta barrier and so affect the future embryo, but are also secreted in the breast milk, so that babies remain exposed for longer periods, even after birth. In this review we explore how neurotoxins contained in cosmetic and PCPs may have a role in the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopment disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore also in congenital enteric aganglionosis as well as in postnatal motility disorders. Understanding the mechanisms of these chemicals used in cosmetic formulations and their role in neurotoxicity is crucial to determining the safety of use for cosmetic products during pregnancy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b821a397c421694bdbfcc7bff5dbe63e97ca7d715d4c6946799131563c83f79e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
