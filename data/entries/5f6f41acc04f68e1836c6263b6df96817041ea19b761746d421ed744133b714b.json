However, these systems have been impeded by dielectric loss and quasiparticle loss, many of which have been caused by the materials imperfection [<a href=\"#ozae044.554-B1\">1</a>]. In this work, we report a comparative scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) investigation of the impacts of wet and dry etching on superconducting Tantalum (Ta) films. This work has been sparked by the critical importance of superconducting resonators in a wide range of quantum technological applications, which necessitates optimizing their fabrications to improve the performance of various quantum devices and communication systems [<a href=\"#ozae044.554-B2\">2</a>]. The primary objective of this work is to understand the morphology, substrate crystallinity degradation, chemical segregation, and strain of etched Ta films, as well as the characteristics of the oxidized sidewalls that can influence the performance and homogeneity of the superconducting device.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5f6f41acc04f68e1836c6263b6df96817041ea19b761746d421ed744133b714b","category":"Environment"}
