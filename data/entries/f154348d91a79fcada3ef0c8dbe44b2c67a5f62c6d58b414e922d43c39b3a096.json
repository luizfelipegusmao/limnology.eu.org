{"title":"Process Intensification for Enhanced Fluoride Removal and Recovery As Calcium Fluoride Using Fluidized Bed Reactor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1736/v1","date":1711685765000,"content":"This study explored the feasibility of fluoride removal from simulated semiconductor industry wastewater and its recovery as calcium fluoride using fluidized bed crystallization. The continuous reactor showed best performance (&gt;90% fluoride removal and &gt;95% crystallization efficiency) at a calcium to fluoride ratio of 0.6 within first 40 days of continuous operation. The resulting particle size increased by more than double during this time along with a 36% increase in the seed bed height indicating deposition of CaF2 onto the silica seed. The SEM-EDX analysis showed the size and shape of the crystals formed along with high amount of Ca-F ions presence. The purity of the CaF2 crystals were determined to be 91.1% though ICP-OES analysis. Following the continuous experiment, different process improvement strategies are explored. The addition of excess amount of calcium resulted in an additional 6% fluoride removal, however, compared to this single stage process, a two-stage approach was found to be better strategy to achieve a low effluent fluoride concentration. The fluoride removal reached 94% with this two-stage approach under optimum condition of 4 + 1 h HRT combinations and a [Ca2+]/[F-] ratio of 0.55 and 0.7 for the two reactors, respectively. CFD simulation showed the impact of inlet diameter, bottom-angle shape and width and height ratio of the reactor on mixing inside reactor and possibility of further improvement in reactor performance by optimizing the FBR configuration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f154348d91a79fcada3ef0c8dbe44b2c67a5f62c6d58b414e922d43c39b3a096","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
