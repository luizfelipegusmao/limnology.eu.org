{"title":"Design and Analysis of off -Grid PV/Diesel System for Small Scale Factory Located in Wadi Rum, Jordan Using Homer Software","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2550/v1","date":1722584649000,"content":"The fuel prices are increasing nowadays, causing a burden on the power system. From this, diesel generators that are still in use, must be hybridized with renewable energy (RE) to levelized the overall projects costs. This study aims to schedule an operation of a hybrid system photovoltaic (PV)/ diesel in a remote area which located in Wadi Rum district in Jordan to serve factory load in addition to obtain the best economical system combination that can serve the needs of a continuous electrical load without any interruption. Based on the results of the analysis using HOMER software, the configuration in the system will be a combination between PV modules, and diesel generator. The hybrid system has met the target for electricity production which is documented in upcoming sections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4553b33984e503beb700d4b5ff3209303d127af9ce31c44fbd8efa960470bc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
