The unique electrochemical metallization mechanism (ECM) involved during device operation allows for lower power consumption and potentially faster switching speeds, making CBRAM more suitable for neuromorphic computing applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.528-B3\">3</a>]. Investigating local processes via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) would facilitate identifying how the device structure impacts performance and reliability; however, studies are scarce and mainly rely on visual changes [<a href=\"#ozae044.528-B4\">4</a>]. In this study, we utilize low-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) combined with TEM to fingerprint the dynamical processes in HfO<sub>2</sub>-based memristive devices via in situ heating and biasing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"87961af4f53a9f9521ba21ca6805c27b30cf059f2a7cafe39867daba30ac3526","category":"Environment"}
