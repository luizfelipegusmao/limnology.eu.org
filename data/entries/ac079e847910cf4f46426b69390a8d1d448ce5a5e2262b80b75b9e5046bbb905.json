Links between the two are plausible but poorly researched. Our aim was to inform future malnutrition management programmes by better understanding associations between MMH and nutritional status of infants aged under six month (u6m). We conducted a health facility-based cross-sectional survey of 1060 infants in rural Ethiopia, between October 2020 and January 2021. We collected data on: MMH status (main exposure) measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and infant anthropometry indicators (outcome); length for age Z-score (LAZ), weight for age Z-score (WAZ), weight for length Z-score (WLZ), mid upper arm circumference (MUAC), head circumference for age Z-score (HCAZ) and lower leg length (LLL). Analysis of secondary data using linear regression was employed to determine associations between the main exposure and outcome variables. The result showed infants’ mean (SD) age was 13.4 (6.2) weeks. The median score for MMH problem was 0 (inter quartile range 0–2) points, and 29.5% and 11.2% reported minimal and mild to severe depression score of 1–4 and 5–27 points, respectively. Mean (SD) LAZ was -0.4 (1.4), WAZ -0.7 (1.3), WLZ -0.5 (1.2), MUAC 12.4 (1.3) cm, HCAZ 0.4 (1.3) and LLL 148 (13.9) mm. In adjusted linear regression analysis, minimal MMH problem was negatively associated with infant LAZ marginally (β = -0.2; 95% CI: -0.4, 0.00; p = 0.05) and LLL (β = -2.0; 95% CI: -3.8, -0.1; p = 0.04), but not with other anthropometric indicators. Statistically significant associations were not found between mild to severe depressive symptoms and infant anthropometric outcomes. In conclusion, only minimal, but not mild, moderate or severe, maternal/caregivers’ depressive symptoms are associated with infant anthropometry outcomes in this data set. Whilst there is a plausible relationship between maternal mental health problems and offspring nutritional status, we did not observed this. Possible reasons include: PHQ-9 not suited to our population; and only a small number of participants reporting moderate to severe level of depression. Further research to investigate and understand the relationship and pathways between maternal mental health and offspring nutritional status is required.","author":"Mubarek Abera","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"ac079e847910cf4f46426b69390a8d1d448ce5a5e2262b80b75b9e5046bbb905","category":"Environment"}
