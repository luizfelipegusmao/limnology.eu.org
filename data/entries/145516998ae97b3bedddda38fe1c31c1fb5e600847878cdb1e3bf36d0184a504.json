The reason for this is their moderate spin-orbit coupling, which is neither too weak nor too strong compared to the Coulomb interaction U. Due to this interplay, the relatively heavy 4<span>d</span> transition metal ruthenates exhibit a number of unusual properties compared to <span>3d</span> transition metals, including unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, high-temperature ferromagnetism, Haldane chains, and orbital ordering. The interdependence between localized and itinerant electrons, together with the orbital degrees of freedom in ruthenate systems, results in a greater diversity of electronic and magnetic properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.745-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.745-B2\">2</a>].
