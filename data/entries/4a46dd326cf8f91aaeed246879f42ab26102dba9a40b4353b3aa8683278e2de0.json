{"title":"Glycyrrhizin Production in Licorice Hairy Roots Based on Metabolic Redirection of Triterpenoid Biosynthetic Pathway by Genome Editing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/2/185/7503260?rss=1","date":1703721600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Glycyrrhizin, a type of the triterpenoid saponin, is a major active ingredient contained in the roots of the medicinal plant licorice (<span>Glycyrrhiza uralensis, G. glabra</span> and <span>G. inflata</span>), and is used worldwide in diverse applications, such as herbal medicines and sweeteners. The growing demand for licorice threatens wild resources and therefore a sustainable method of supplying glycyrrhizin is required. With the goal of establishing an alternative glycyrrhizin supply method not dependent on wild plants, we attempted to produce glycyrrhizin using hairy root culture. We tried to promote glycyrrhizin production by blocking competing pathways using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing. <span>CYP93E3 CYP72A566</span> double-knockout (KO) and <span>CYP93E3 CYP72A566 CYP716A179 LUS1</span> quadruple-KO variants were generated, and a substantial amount of glycyrrhizin accumulation was confirmed in both types of hairy root. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential for promoting further glycyrrhizin production by simultaneous <span>CYP93E3 CYP72A566</span> double-KO and <span>CYP88D6</span>-overexpression. This strategy resulted in a 3-fold increase (∼1.4 mg/g) in glycyrrhizin accumulation in double-KO/<span>CYP88D6</span>-overexpression hairy roots, on average, compared with that of double-KO hairy roots. These findings demonstrate that the combination of blocking competing pathways and overexpression of the biosynthetic gene is important for enhancing glycyrrhizin production in <span>G. uralensis</span> hairy roots. Our findings provide the foundation for sustainable glycyrrhizin production using hairy root culture. Given the widespread use of genome editing technology in hairy roots, this combined with gene knockout and overexpression could be widely applied to the production of valuable substances contained in various plant roots.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"4a46dd326cf8f91aaeed246879f42ab26102dba9a40b4353b3aa8683278e2de0","category":"Environment"}
