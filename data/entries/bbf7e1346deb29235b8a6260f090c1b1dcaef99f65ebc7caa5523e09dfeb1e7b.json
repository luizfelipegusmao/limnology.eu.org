{"title":"Person-to-Person Bacterial Transmission Can Change the Sleep Pattern in Newly Married Couples","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2354/v1","date":1727675286000,"content":"BACKGROUND: The composition of the gut microbiota varies significantly among healthy individuals and insomniacs, hypersomniacs and healthy people. On the other hand, there is a substantial bacterial strain shared across these populations with distinct intra-population, mother-to-infant and intra-household transmission patterns. Based on these premises, we propose a hypothesis stating that person-to-person bacterial transmission can change the sleep pattern in couples. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this pilot study, 157 couples who had been married and living together for an average of 5.91 months were enrolled. A wide range of questionnaires were administered to participants to measure sleep patterns. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed at two time points: baseline and 3 months. RESULTS: Three months after the marriage, spouses with healthy sleep pattern were significantly more likely to resemble their insomniac or hypersomniac couples. CONCLUSIONS: The research will have important implications in terms of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disturbances through microbiota modulation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbf7e1346deb29235b8a6260f090c1b1dcaef99f65ebc7caa5523e09dfeb1e7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
