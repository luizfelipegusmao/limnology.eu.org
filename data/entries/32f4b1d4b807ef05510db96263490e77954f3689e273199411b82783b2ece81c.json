{"title":"Timber tracking of Jacaranda copaia from Amazon Forest using DNA fingerprint","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1869/v1","date":1716893857000,"content":"Amazon tropical forest is actually subject to strong deforestation, generally originated from illegal logging, resulting in ecological, environmental and economic problems. Aiming stop deforestation and timber commercialization of illegal logging of tropical forest, new laws has been introduced in many countries. Here we investigated the utility of DNA fingerprinting of nuclear and cytoplasmatic SNPs to timber tracking the intensive logged and commercialized of the Amazonian Neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia. Samples of 832 individuals from 43 populations from Bolivia, Brazil, French Guiana, and Peru were used to investigate the power of 113 nuclear SNPs, 11 CpSNPs, and four MtSNP loci to determine the country and population origin. The genetic differentiation among all populations and contries was high (0.233â€“0.942), specialy for CpMtSNP (generally&gt;0.6) loci, and there is a strong isolation by distance pathern among populations, favoring the group or individual samples tracking to correct site. For self-assignment tests, we were able to 100% correct determine country and population origin of all samples using all SNPs. Our results show that the use of 128 SNP markers is suitable to correct determination of country and population site of J. copaia timber origin and very useful tool for customs and local and international policies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32f4b1d4b807ef05510db96263490e77954f3689e273199411b82783b2ece81c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
