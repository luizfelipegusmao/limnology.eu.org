The productivity of Indian mustard needs to be increased in marginal environments such as in arid and semi-arid areas to boost production. For this, identification of promising genotypes with high yield and quality under arid and semi-arid climate is required. In this study, 65 genotypes of Indian mustard were evaluated in Augmented Randomized Block Design in the Purulia district of West Bengal, a mustard growing zone characterized by red laterite soil and semi-arid climate. Considerable variation was observed between the genotypes for most characters such as number of seeds per siliqua (coefficient of variation [CV] 7.39%), followed by days to first flowering (CV 6.9%) and total number of siliquae (CV 6.43%), respectively. However, variation was less for days to maturity and quality parameters. Strong positive correlations were observed between many traits such as number of branches and number of siliquae on branches (0.82), number of branches and siliquae per plant (0.73), number of branches and yield per plant (0.72), number of siliquae on branches and siliquae per plant (0.91), number of siliquae on branches and seed yield per plant (0.76). Relatively strong negative correlation was observed only between oil and glucosinolate content (−0.60). Most of the traits showed high heritability along with high genetic advance over mean. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis classified the genotypes into six clusters. Based on yield, its components, and other quality parameters, promising genotypes such as Pusa Mahak, Narendra Ageti Rai 4, and JM-1 were identified. These genotypes may be targeted for further genetic improvement or be incorporated in breeding programmes for developing high-yielding mustard varieties for arid and semi-arid climate.</p>","author":"Aditya Pratap Singh, \nTimir Majhi, \nDibakar Das, \nSujaya Dewanjee","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"543c3b19d4e4e03a10b3539f1166dc17d48539bcbffc755d68560e9ae5948022","category":"Environment"}
