{"title":"Eyeing DNA barcoding for species identification of fish larvae","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15920?af=R","date":1725428095000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Identification of fish larvae based on morphology is typically limited to higher taxonomic ranks (e.g., family or order), as larvae possess few morphological diagnostic characters for precise discrimination to species. When many samples are presented at any one time, the use of morphology to identify such specimens can be laborious and time-consuming. Using a reverse workflow for specimen sorting and identification leveraging high-throughput DNA sequencing, thousands of fish larvae can be DNA barcoded and sorted into molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) in a single sequencing run with the nanopore sequencing technology (e.g., MinION). This process reduces the time and financial costs of morphology-based sorting and instead deploys experienced taxonomists for species taxonomic work where they are needed most. In this study, a total of 3022 fish larval specimens from plankton tows across four sites in Singapore were collected and sorted based on this workflow. Eye tissue from individual samples was used for DNA extraction and sequencing of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. We generated a total of 2746 barcodes after quality filtering (90.9% barcoding success), identified 2067 DNA barcodes (75.3% identification success), and delimited 256 mOTUs (146 genera, 52 families). Our analyses identified specific challenges to species assignment, such as the potential misidentification of publicly available sequences used as reference barcodes. We highlighted how the conservative application and comparison of a local sequence database can help resolve identification conflicts. Overall, this proposed approach enables and expedites taxonomic identification of fish larvae, contributing to the enhancement of reference barcode databases and potentially better understanding of fish connectivity.</p>","author":"Wan Wen Rochelle Chan, \nJia Jin Marc Chang, \nCharles Zhiming Tan, \nJie Xin Ng, \nMatthew Hui‚ÄêChieh Ng, \nZeehan Jaafar, \nDanwei Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"22de730aeb9c7c705207b5c1cbf715db145f7e67706dbd48e84f36b3811838d1","category":"Environment"}
