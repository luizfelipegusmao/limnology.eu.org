{"title":"Identification of differentially expressed mRNA/lncRNA modules in acutely regorafenib-treated sorafenib-resistant Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301663","date":1712844000000,"content":"<p>by Mina Baek, Minjae Kim, Hae In Choi, Bert Binas, Junho Cha, Kyoung Hwa Jung, Sungkyoung Choi, Young Gyu Chai</p>\r\n\r\nThe multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the standard first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but many patients become sorafenib-resistant (SR). This study investigated the efficacy of another kinase inhibitor, regorafenib (Rego), as a second-line treatment. We produced SR HCC cells, wherein the PI3K-Akt, TNF, cAMP, and TGF-beta signaling pathways were affected. Acute Rego treatment of these cells reversed the expression of genes involved in TGF-beta signaling but further increased the expression of genes involved in PI3K-Akt signaling. Additionally, Rego reversed the expression of genes involved in nucleosome assembly and epigenetic gene expression. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed four differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (DElncRNA) modules that were associated with the effectiveness of Rego on SR cells. Eleven putative DElncRNAs with distinct expression patterns were identified. We associated each module with DEmRNAs of the same pattern, thus obtaining DElncRNA/DEmRNA co-expression modules. We discuss the potential significance of each module. These findings provide insights and resources for further investigation into the potential mechanisms underlying the response of SR HCC cells to Rego.","author":"Mina Baek","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e920bd9c86fcbe0f149967ef05335d57034c3be0fc9d5858a545bb87a7311601","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
