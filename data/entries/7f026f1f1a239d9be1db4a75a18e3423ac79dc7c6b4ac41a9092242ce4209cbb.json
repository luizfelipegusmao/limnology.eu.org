{"title":"Investigating the Synergistic Effects of Carvacrol and Citral- edible Polysaccharide based Nanogels on shelf-life extension of Chalkidiki Green Table Olives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0905/v1","date":1728649073000,"content":"Nowadays bioeconomy and sustainability trend drive food technology in the development of novel biobased edible food preservatives to enhance food shelf-life and safety. This study explored the development, characterization, and application of novel polysaccharide-based nanogels enhanced with essential oil derivatives carvacrol and citral, investigating their potential synergistic effects as active edible coatings for extending the shelf life of Chalkidiki PDO green table olives. Nanogels were formulated using xanthan gum and kappa-carrageenan and tested in various ratios (25:75, 50:50, 75:25). Physicochemical characterization of nanogels was done via zeta potential dynamic light scattering measurements and scanning electron microscopy images, while preliminary tests demonstrated high antioxidant activity. Antimicrobial assessments revealed significant bactericidal effects, with FIC results confirming a synergistic effect of NGCTCV 50:50 against Staphylococcus aureus and NGCTCV 25:75 and 75:25 against. The nanogel coatings were applied to Chalkidiki green table olives and evaluated over a 21-day storage period. The NGCTCV 50:50 and 25:75 coatings effectively reduced weight loss, maintained stable pH levels, and preserved visual quality, while inhibiting spoilage microorganisms without affecting beneficial lactic acid bacteria crucial for fermentation. Lab colorimetry confirmed the ability of these nanogels to prevent discoloration, maintaining the olives' characteristic green color. Sensory analysis indicated that NGCTCV 50:50 and 25:75 outperformed both individual nanogels and uncoated samples, effectively extending shelf life by over 14 days. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of polysaccharide-based nanogels, particularly in the 50:50 and 25:75 ratios, for improving the shelf life of perishable food products, with promising applications in fermented food preservation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7f026f1f1a239d9be1db4a75a18e3423ac79dc7c6b4ac41a9092242ce4209cbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
