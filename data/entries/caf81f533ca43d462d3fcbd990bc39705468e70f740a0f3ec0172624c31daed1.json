The method gained wide applicability due to the development of nearly shot noise-limited counting cameras, confinement in vitreous ice, and an elaborate set of microscope improvements in stability and automation. In a streamlined process of automated data collection, a few thousand image stacks (commonly called movies) are routinely collected on 300 kV transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) equipped with an autoloader and energy filter. The high cost (often above seven figures) prohibits small institutions from establishing high-end cryoEM facilities. National centers can provide some democratization to accessing SPA data collection, but there is more demand than can be met through the national centers. This makes the case for widely accessible single particle data collection access [<a href=\"#ozae044.364-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"caf81f533ca43d462d3fcbd990bc39705468e70f740a0f3ec0172624c31daed1","category":"Environment"}
