{"title":"Optimal Sizing, Energy Balance, Load Management and Performance Analysis of a Hybrid Renewable Energy System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1516/v1","date":1726821724000,"content":"This work utilizes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the optimal sizing of a solar – wind – battery hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for a rural community in Rivers State, Nigeria (Okorobo-Ile Town). The objective is to minimize the total economic cost (TEC), the total annual system cost (TAC) and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). A two – step approach is used. The algorithm first determines the optimal number of solar panels and wind turbines. Based on the results obtained in the first step, the optimal number of batteries and inverters is computed. The overall results obtained is then compared with results from the NGSA-II and hybrid GA – PSO optimization algorithm. An energy management system monitors the energy balance and ensures the load management is adequate using the battery state of charge as a control strategy. Results obtained showed that the optimal configuration consist of solar panels (154), wind turbine (3), inverter (136) and batteries (29). This results in a minimized TEC, TAC and LCOE of 476, 731USD, 301, 947USD and 0.011USD/kWh respectively. The optimal configuration when simulated under various climatic scenarios was able to meet the energy needs of the community irrespective of ambient condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10f65902525d6abae02d745a061fdfd7712396ae50662e095ea7670dffba9364","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
