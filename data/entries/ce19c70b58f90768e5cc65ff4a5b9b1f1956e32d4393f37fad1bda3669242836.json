{"title":"Unique advantages of dynamic l-[<sup>11</sup>C]methionine PET/CT for assessing the rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis: A pilot trial in young men","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305620","date":1722348000000,"content":"<p>by Koichiro Sumi, Kana Yamazaki, Ryuichi Nishii, Misato Sakuda, Kentaro Nakamura, Kinya Ashida, Kentaro Tamura, Tatsuya Higashi</p>\r\n\r\nAlthough the standard method to evaluate skeletal muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is muscle biopsy, the method is invasive and problematic for multisite use. We conducted a small pilot study in volunteers to investigate changes in MPS according to skeletal muscle site using a noninvasive method in which 6 healthy young men were given yogurt (containing 20 g milk protein) or water, and 1 h later, l-[<sup>11</sup>C]methionine ([<sup>11</sup>C]Met) was administered intravenously. Dynamic PET/CT imaging of their thighs was performed for 60 min. The influx constant <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of [<sup>11</sup>C]Met in skeletal muscle protein was calculated as an index of MPS using a Patlak plot, and found to be 0.6%â€“28% higher after ingesting yogurt than after water in 5 of the 6 volunteer participants, but it was 34% lower in the remaining participant. Overall, this indicated no significant increase in <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> after ingesting milk protein. However, when the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were analyzed separately, we found a significant difference in <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>. This demonstrates the potential of visualizing MPS by calculating the <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> for each voxel and reconstructing it as an image, which presents unique advantages of [<sup>11</sup>C]Met PET/CT for evaluating MPS, such as site-specificity and visualization.","author":"Koichiro Sumi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce19c70b58f90768e5cc65ff4a5b9b1f1956e32d4393f37fad1bda3669242836","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
