With the advent of high-throughput cryo-electron tomography and cryo-FIB, paired with cutting edge computational techniques, achieving such an ambitious goal is no longer a far-reaching dream. The new generation of cryo-FIB from Thermo Fisher Scientific uses plasma ions, which reduce redeposition and ion beam damage, substantially improving throughput. In preparation for a large-scale effort towards visual proteomics of the model organism <span>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</span>, we have prepared enough lamellae to allow for acquisition of more than 1800 tomograms of different cellular compartments (Fig 1).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"390b567e281a4663342de4b207515fd51276be0614e48b36520234e6640e0913","category":"Environment"}
