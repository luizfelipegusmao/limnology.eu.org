{"title":"371 Applying precision rangeland grazing management systems in western South Dakota","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/192/7757451?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Western rangelands represent approximately 58% of the total arable land in the U.S. and are used primarily for cow-calf production, which has the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprint of all beef production phases. Further, beef production sustainability concerns involve climate mitigation (reducing GHG output) and adaptation (climate-resilient soil-plant-animals). Precision livestock farming (PLF) may help address sustainability concerns by providing innovative solutions and new opportunities for extensive rangeland production. The use of precision measurement and management tools with precision system models can connect measurement data to inform management capabilities. For example, real-time individual weighing and remote sensing (precision measurement tools) can be used to inform and implement dynamic rotational grazing management using virtual fencing technology (precision management; Menendez et al., 2022, 2023). Recent USDA investment in climate-smart agriculture (CSA) commodities has provided over $3 billion in funding to implement practices to reduce GHG emissions in agriculture production, for which PLF may be one approach to accomplish these goals. The overall purpose is to develop commodities produced using NRCS climate-smart practices (e.g., prescribed grazing, 528) and document reductions to provide market opportunities associated with inset GHG. Currently, South Dakota State University is leading two simultaneous programs, which include precision ranching (virtual fencing, precision weighing, and GHG evaluation) and a beef and bison CSA program (GHG evaluation; 7 producer-owned research ranches, representing more than 1.09 million ha). The scale of the CSA program has revealed that current PLF research has only been a prelude to providing the precision tools necessary to successfully implement CSA practices and document their impact through monitoring, measuring, reporting, and verification (MMRV). This presentation will include rangeland grazing case studies that cover the application of virtual fencing, animal location, behavior tracking, remote sensing, precision weighing, feeding, supplementation, and enteric emissions and soil moisture monitoring on extensive rangelands. Case studies will include an overview of big data processing and precision system model development methods. Increasing awareness of available PLF tools for optimizing grazing management, animal performance, productivity, and associated challenges (maintenance, costs) is essential for meeting livestock and sustainability goals. PLF and data-driven approaches aid in the creation of scalable, cost-effective MMRV protocols and models (soil carbon and enteric GHG) for extensive rangelands (20 to 70,000 ha areas) that allow producers to realize potential CSA market incentives. Further, MMRV will likely help guide management decisions by identifying CSA strategies that build climate-resilient landscapes for sustainable livestock production and other environmental synergies (soil microbiome, bird and insect habit, water retention).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e8e086ea23767137d67fe41cbf5a83f9a1328121b59ccb7f221343ab6ff0b352","category":"Environment"}
