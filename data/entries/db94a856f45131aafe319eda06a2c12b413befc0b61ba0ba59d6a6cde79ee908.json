{"title":"How New Digital Infrastructure Can Promote Green Agricultural Development in China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1921/v1","date":1724752257000,"content":"The new digital infrastructure has become an important basis for the green development of agriculture. This paper selects provincial sample data from 2006 to 2022, constructs an indicator system to measure new digital infrastructure and agricultural green total factor productivity, and explores how new digital infrastructure can promote agricultural green development. The results show that: (1) the new digital infrastructure has a significant role in promoting the green development of agriculture, and this conclusion is still valid after processing endogeneity and heteroscedasticity; (2) Technology and land factors play an intermediary role in the promotion of green agricultural development by the new digital infrastructure, that is, the new digital infrastructure helps to improve the quality and technical level of cultivated land and thus promote green agricultural development; (3) Labor force factors optimize the mediating role of technology factors, that is, the higher the quality of labor force, the stronger the role of the new digital infrastructure in promoting the green development of agriculture through the technological path; (4) The effect of new digital infrastructure on the green development of agriculture is obviously heterogeneous, and the effect is more obvious in northwest China and the regions with lower marketization level, higher environmental regulation level. This study is helpful to clarify the relationship between new digital infrastructure and agricultural green development in China, and provide corresponding policy suggestions for promoting regional agricultural green development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db94a856f45131aafe319eda06a2c12b413befc0b61ba0ba59d6a6cde79ee908","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
