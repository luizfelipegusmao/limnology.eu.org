{"title":"A Model to Optimize the Voltage Plus Laser Pulsing Mode in APT","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.030/7719474?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>One of the notable innovations of the new Leap 6000<sup>TM</sup> XR is the introduction of a synchronous Voltage plus Laser mode (VpL mode). This evaporation mode triggers the field evaporation of surface atoms by superimposing a laser pulse with a voltage pulse on the specimen. The idea of using the combined effect of laser and electric pulses was initially developed with the aim of measuring the thermal effect induced by the laser [<a href=\"#ozae044.030-B1\">1-3</a>]. However, some benefits exist in using this idea in the purpose to improve APT analysis [<a href=\"#ozae044.030-B4\">4</a>]. Some exploratory tests showed the capability to increase the mass spectrometry performance of the instrument at a relatively low cost [<a href=\"#ozae044.030-B5\">5</a>]. This idea was concretized in a commercial instrument (LEAP 6000) recently with benefits in term of signal-to-noise in APT mass spectra in a variety of materials, including aluminum, stainless steel or even non-conductive materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.030-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.030-B7\">7</a>]. The improvement in performances were particularly interesting in non-conductive materials, with an improvement of the FWThM mass resolution and a reduction of the mass spectrum noise (increase of the signal-to-noise ratio by one order of magnitude).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"47915c4b5addab65a12a2d6d6810808adbca261b9abbb781b71957a1298cb6b1","category":"Environment"}
