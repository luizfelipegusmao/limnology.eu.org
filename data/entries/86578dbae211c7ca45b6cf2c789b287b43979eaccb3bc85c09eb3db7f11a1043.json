{"title":"Mitochondrial phylogenomics of bumblebees, Bombus (Hymenoptera: Apidae): a tale of structural variation, shifts in selection constraints, and tree discordance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlad178/7450366?rss=1","date":1700784000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of bumblebees (<span>Bombus</span>) has been widely used for phylogenetic studies, but its evolution is still underexplored. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of 60 bumblebee mitogenomes, including 40 newly assembled ones, to investigate bumblebee mtDNA structure, composition, and informativeness under a phylogenetic framework. Our mtDNA dataset supports the monophyly of <span>Bombus</span> and its subgenera, although we found a high degree of tree discordance in deeper nodes when using different inference methods or matrix composition. Concerning mitogenome structure, our results show that tRNA genes were often rearranged, with unique rearrangements indicating shared ancestry across bumblebee subgenera, illustrating their potential for subgeneric classification. Our results also challenge the notion that faster evolving mtDNA exhibits higher gene rearrangement rates. Finally, we explicitly assessed shifts in selection constraints of mtDNA genes in obligate social parasites of subgenus <span>Psithyrus</span> and found that their mtDNA evolved under relaxed selective constraints. Our findings show the utility of mtDNA in providing insights into bumblebee phylogenetics, evolution, and genome trait diversification. We also highlight the potential for comparative mitogenomics to uncover previously unknown aspects of bumblebee evolution, offering exciting opportunities for future research in this field.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"86578dbae211c7ca45b6cf2c789b287b43979eaccb3bc85c09eb3db7f11a1043","category":"Environment"}
