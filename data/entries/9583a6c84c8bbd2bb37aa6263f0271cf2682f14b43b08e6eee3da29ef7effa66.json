{"title":"Fractals as Pre-training Datasets for Anomaly Detection and Localization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1579/v1","date":1729505161000,"content":"Anomaly detection is crucial in large-scale industrial manufacturing as it helps detect and localise defective parts. Pre-training feature extractors on large-scale datasets is a popular approach for this task. Stringent data security, privacy regulations, high costs and acquisition time hinder the development of large-scale datasets for training and benchmarking. Despite recent work focusing primarily on the development of new anomaly detection methods based on such extractors, not much attention has been paid to the importance of the data used for pre-training. This study compares representative models pre-trained with fractal images against those pre-trained with ImageNet, without subsequent task-specific fine-tuning. We evaluated the performance of eleven state-of-the-art methods on MVTecAD, MVTec LOCO AD, and VisA, well-known benchmark datasets inspired by real-world industrial inspection scenarios. Further, we propose a novel method to create a dataset by combining the dynamically generated fractal images creating a ``Multi-Formula'' dataset. Even though pre-training with ImageNet leads to better results, fractals can achieve close performance to ImageNet under proper parametrisation. This opens up the possibility for a new research direction where feature extractors could be trained on synthetically generated abstract datasets mitigating the ever-increasing demand for data in machine learning while circumventing privacy and security concerns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9583a6c84c8bbd2bb37aa6263f0271cf2682f14b43b08e6eee3da29ef7effa66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
