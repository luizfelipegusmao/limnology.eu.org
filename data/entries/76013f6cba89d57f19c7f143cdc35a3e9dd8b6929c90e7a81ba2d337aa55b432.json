{"title":"Illumination Intelligent Adaptation and Analysis Framework: A comprehensive solution for enhancing nighttime driving fatigue monitoring","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308201","date":1723644000000,"content":"<p>by Zenghui Tian, Nur Safinas Albakry, Yinghui Du</p>\r\n\r\nNighttime driving presents a critical challenge to road safety due to insufficient lighting and increased risk of driver fatigue. Existing methods for monitoring driver fatigue, mainly focusing on behavioral analysis and biometric monitoring, face significant challenges under low-light conditions. Their effectiveness, especially in dynamic lighting environments, is limited by their dependency on specific environmental conditions and active driver participation, leading to reduced accuracy and practicality in real-world scenarios. This study introduces a novel ‘Illumination Intelligent Adaptation and Analysis Framework (IIAAF)’, aimed at addressing these limitations and enhancing the accuracy and practicality of driver fatigue monitoring under nighttime low-light conditions. The IIAAF framework employs a multidimensional technology integration, including comprehensive body posture analysis and facial fatigue feature detection, per-pixel dynamic illumination adjustment technology, and a light variation feature learning system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and time-series analysis. Through this integrated approach, the framework is capable of accurately capturing subtle fatigue signals in nighttime driving environments and adapting in real-time to rapid changes in lighting conditions. Experimental results on two independent datasets indicate that the IIAAF framework significantly improves the accuracy of fatigue detection under nighttime low-light conditions. This breakthrough not only enhances the effectiveness of driving assistance systems but also provides reliable scientific support for reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigued driving. These research findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for advancing intelligent driving assistance technology and improving nighttime road safety.","author":"Zenghui Tian","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"76013f6cba89d57f19c7f143cdc35a3e9dd8b6929c90e7a81ba2d337aa55b432","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
