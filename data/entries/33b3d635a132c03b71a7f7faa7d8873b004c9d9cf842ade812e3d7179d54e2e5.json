{"title":"The impact of multiple abiotic stresses on <i>ns-LTP2</i>.<i>8</i> gene transcript and ns-LTP2.8 protein accumulation in germinating barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.) embryos","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299400","date":1710856800000,"content":"<p>by Michał Kempa, Krzysztof Mikołajczak, Piotr Ogrodowicz, Tomasz Pniewski, Paweł Krajewski, Anetta Kuczyńska</p>\r\n\r\nAbiotic stresses occur more often in combination than alone under regular field conditions limiting in more severe way crop production. Stress recognition in plants primarily occurs in the plasma membrane, modification of which is necessary to maintain homeostasis in response to it. It is known that lipid transport proteins (ns-LTPs) participate in modification of the lipidome of cell membranes. Representative of this group, ns-LTP2.8, may be involved in the reaction to abiotic stress of germinating barley plants by mediating the intracellular transport of hydrophobic particles, such as lipids, helping to maintain homeostasis. The ns-LTP2.8 protein was selected for analysis due to its ability to transport not only linear hydrophobic molecules but also compounds with a more complex spatial structure. Moreover, ns-LTP2.8 has been qualified as a member of pathogenesis-related proteins, which makes it particularly important in relation to its high allergenic potential. This paper demonstrates for the first time the influence of various abiotic stresses acting separately as well as in their combinations on the change in the <i>ns-LTP2</i>.<i>8</i> transcript, ns-LTP2.8 protein and total soluble protein content in the embryonal axes of germinating spring barley genotypes with different <i>ns-LTP2</i>.<i>8</i> allelic forms and stress tolerance. Tissue localization of <i>ns-LTP2</i>.<i>8</i> transcript as well as ns-LTP2.8 protein were also examined. Although the impact of abiotic stresses on the regulation of gene transcription and translation processes remains not fully recognized, in this work we managed to demonstrate different impact on applied stresses on the fundamental cellular processes in very little studied tissue of the embryonal axis of barley.","author":"Michał Kempa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"33b3d635a132c03b71a7f7faa7d8873b004c9d9cf842ade812e3d7179d54e2e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
