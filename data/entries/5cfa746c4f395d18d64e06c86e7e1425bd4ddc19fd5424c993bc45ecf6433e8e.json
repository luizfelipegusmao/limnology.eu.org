Presently, the study is located in an interpretive research paradigm, and hence, it takes the human experiences within educational setups to be subjective and complex. In so doing, to elude this educational transition and its complex dynamics, the research uses such qualitative research methods as document analysis and interviews. Painting a picture of great variety in individual experiences and challenges, strategies, and outcomes not only across these two specific institutions but, certainly, more broadly through the lens of previous case studies. First, it values depth over breadth and tries to unearth the varied experiences, challenges, innovations, and achievements faculty made during their transition into online Language Teaching. The results of the study are believed to be able to contribute quite a rich, detailed, and multi-faceted perspective to the pool of knowledge for the complexities of online Language education in China, which may be of interest to educators, policymakers, and researchers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cfa746c4f395d18d64e06c86e7e1425bd4ddc19fd5424c993bc45ecf6433e8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
