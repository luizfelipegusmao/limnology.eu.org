{"title":"Comparative Studies of Minamata Disease Between inside and outside of Japan: Focusing on Mercury Contamination in the Amazon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1588/v1","date":1724311203000,"content":"The Minamata Disease in Japan was one of the most notorious public nuisance cases in the 1960s and 70s, but is still ongoing “unfinished business” in terms of victims’ protection even after several decades of struggles. The world standard of epidemiological causation has still been applied in limited cases. \n\nHowever, it has been pointed out in the international report that, in recent years, mercury contamination has decreased in countries in the Global North, except the Canadian Indigenous peoples’ case, at the same time that it has increased in the Global South. In the Amazon, many Indigenous peoples, most prominently, the Munduruku people in Para state and the Yanomami people in Roraima state, suffer from the Brazilian Minamata Disease due to mercury contamination differently as a typical case of global environmental injustice issues. \n\nThis paper discusses the comparative difference of the Minamata Disease between inside and outside Japan: In Japan, accumulated mercury contamination in Shiranui Bay of Kyushu due to the poisonous waste release by a big corporation named Chisso Co. was serious, while in the Amazon, contamination due to gold mining by ASGM has been much broader and more diffused. Thus, civil law damages litigation has historically worked despite some challenges in Japan, while it’s practically impossible to stop numerous small scale gold mining by judicial approach in the Amazon. Instead, the administrative regulation under the Lula administration contrasted to the Bolsonaro administration might be especially important, although it’s still limited, considering the global demand for gold and related continuous gold mining activities.\n\nMinamata Disease symptoms among the Indigenous peoples along the Amazon are generally minor compared to the Japanese case, but they should also be considered the case from the liberal standard that criticizes the traditional stringent standard such as the Hunter=Russell criteria. However, facing the worsening situation of mercury contamination, the challenges in the Global South are serious: The effective measures for their global health are limited except for dietary education to avoid poisonous carnivorous fishes as opposed to herbivorous fishes. International assistance for providing clean water is also imminent agenda.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"15fd3c1fe4d6cbac1e94a395b3d15ef0fb918a006d0c8382e63c648cb1c9c474","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
