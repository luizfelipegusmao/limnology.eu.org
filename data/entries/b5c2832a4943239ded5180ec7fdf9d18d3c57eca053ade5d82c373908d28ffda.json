{"title":"Asymmetry in kinematics of dominant/nondominant lower limbs in central and lateral positioned college and sub-elite soccer players","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304511","date":1717768800000,"content":"<p>by Francisco Beron-Vera, Sergio A.

Mann, Francesco Travascio</p>\r\n\r\nChange of direction, stops, and pivots are among the most common non-contact movements associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in soccer. By observing these dynamic movements, clinicians recognize abnormal kinematic patterns that contribute to ACL tears such as increased knee valgus or reduced knee flexion. Different motions and physical demands are observed across playing positions, which may result in varied lower limb kinematic patterns. In the present study, 28 college and sub-elite soccer players performed four dynamic motions (change of direction with and without ball, header, and instep kick) with the goal of examining the effect of on-field positioning, leg dominance, and gender in lower body kinematics. Motion capture software monitored joint angles in the knee, hip, and ankle. A three-way ANOVA showed significant differences in each category. Remarkably, centrally positioned players displayed significantly greater knee adduction (5째 difference, p = 0.013), hip flexion (9째 difference, p = 0.034), hip adduction (7째 difference, p = 0.016), and dorsiflexion (12째 difference, p = 0.022) when performing the instep kick in comparison to their laterally positioned counterparts. These findings suggest that central players tend to exhibit a greater range of motion when performing an instep kicking task compared to laterally positioned players. At a competitive level, this discrepancy could potentially lead to differences in lower limb muscle development among on-field positions. Accordingly, it is suggested to implement position-specific prevention programs to address these asymmetries in lower limb kinematics, which can help mitigate dangerous kinematic patterns and consequently reduce the risk of ACL injury in soccer players.","author":"Francisco Beron-Vera","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b5c2832a4943239ded5180ec7fdf9d18d3c57eca053ade5d82c373908d28ffda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
