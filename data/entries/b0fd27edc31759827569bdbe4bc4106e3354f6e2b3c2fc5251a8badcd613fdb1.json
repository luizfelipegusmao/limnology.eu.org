This allows us to monitor them using ocean colour. However, as the spectral properties of phytoplankton and their relationship with other coloured substances in seawater vary, subtle differences (anomalies) in ocean colour occur that can cause large errors in estimates of phytoplankton abundance. Identifying and understanding these anomalies is required to interpret ocean-colour data properly, but not all scientists have access to, or can afford, the <span>in-situ</span> instrumentation needed to do this. We show that practical, low-cost tools developed in the 19th century (a Secchi disk and Forel-Ule colour scale) can be used to quantify a colour anomaly in the Weddell Sea. Our findings imply that ocean-colour anomalies can be identified using affordable methods. Furthermore, records collected over the last century may contain clues on how ocean ecosystems have changed with climate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"b0fd27edc31759827569bdbe4bc4106e3354f6e2b3c2fc5251a8badcd613fdb1","category":"Environment"}
