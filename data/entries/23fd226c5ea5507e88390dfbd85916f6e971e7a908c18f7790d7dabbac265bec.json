{"title":"Phenolic Compounds from Cherries and Berries for Chronic Disease Management and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1089/v1","date":1713333261000,"content":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Therefore, there is in-creasing interest in dietary interventions to reduce risk factors associated with these conditions. Cherries and berries are rich sources of bioactive compounds and have attracted attention for their potential cardiovascular benefits. This review summarizes the current research on the effects of cherries and berries consumption on cardiovascular health, including in vivo studies and clinical trials. These red fruits are rich in phenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins and flavonoids, which have multiple bioactive properties. These properties include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilatory effects. Studies suggest that regular consumption of these fruits may reducing in-flammation and oxidative stress, leading to lower blood pressure, improved lipid profiles, and enhanced endothelial function. However, interpreting findings and establishing optimal dosages is challenge due to the variability in fruit composition, processing methods, and study design. Despite these limitations, the evidence highlights the potential of cherries and berries as components of preventive strategies against CVD. Further research is needed to maximize their health benefits and improve clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23fd226c5ea5507e88390dfbd85916f6e971e7a908c18f7790d7dabbac265bec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
