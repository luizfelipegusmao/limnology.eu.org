{"title":"A Study of Interface Bond Strength Following Hot Deformation Bonding of AA6061 at Different Temperatures and Loading Rates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1001/v1","date":1710743455000,"content":"Multilayered metallic sheets fabricated by hot metal forming processes are attractive structural components in the aerospace and automobile industry. The strength of the mechanical bond between the different layers is critical to the applicability of such components in load bearing applications. While it is well understood that the process conditions such as temperature, deformation and rate of deformation influence the bond strength, a clear functional relationship between these conditions and the bond strength has yet to be established. The objective of the current study is to investigate the joining of Aluminum-6061 alloy specimens by hot compression bonding. Hot compression tests of beam specimen pairs were conducted at different temperatures (300-500â„ƒ), with different strains and strain rates (10-2-10-1 [1sec]). Coupled thermo-mechanical finite element models were utilized to compute the time dependent thermo-mechanical fields that develop along the specimen interface. The computed values were used to map the spatial distribution of a scalar parameter J which is hypothesized to govern bond formation. Mechanical tensile tests were used to determine the bond strength and expose the bonded surfaces. It is demonstrated that the computed J distribution can be correlated well with SEM observations of the debonded surface. It is also shown that the actual bonded area can be predicted from the computations for a certain range of critical J values.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8bfcb2b10c85dc1767736a9cea322558976cfc3d64f568138e36bf7b6db2525d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
