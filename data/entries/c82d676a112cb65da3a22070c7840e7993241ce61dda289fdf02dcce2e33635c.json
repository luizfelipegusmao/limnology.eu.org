{"title":"Master Regulators of Causal Networks in Intestinal- and Diffuse-Type Gastric Cancer and the Relation to RNA Virus Infection Pathway","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0200/v1","date":1719911978000,"content":"The causal networks are important for understanding the signaling alterations in diseases. To reveal the network pathways affected in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are related to poor prognosis of cancer, the molecular networks and gene expression in diffuse- and intestinal-type gastric cancer (GC) have been analyzed. The network pathways in GC were analyzed in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The analysis of the probe sets of which gene expression has significant differences between diffuse- and intestinal-type GC in RNA Sequencing publicly available data identified 1099 causal networks in diffuse- and intestinal-type GC. Master regulators of the causal networks included lenvatinib, pyrotinib, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), mir-196, and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2). The analysis of the HDAC1-interacting network identified the involvement of regulation of EMT by growth factors pathway, coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, and vorinostat. The network had RNA-RNA interactions with microRNAs such as mir-10, mir-15, mir-17, mir-19, mir-21, mir-217, mir-223, mir-25, mir-27, and mir-34. These molecular networks revealed in the study may lead to the identification of drug targets for GC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c82d676a112cb65da3a22070c7840e7993241ce61dda289fdf02dcce2e33635c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
