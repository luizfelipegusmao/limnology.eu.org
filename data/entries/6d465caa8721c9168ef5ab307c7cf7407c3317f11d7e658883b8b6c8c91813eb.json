{"title":"Relationships Between PM2.5 and Hemoglobin Among Reproductive Women in Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1223/v1","date":1726534567000,"content":"The effects of toxic air in the form of air pollution are known to harm womenâ€™s health. New data has shown that air pollution has effects on maternal anemia. Yet the effects of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) on hemoglobin among reproductive maternal (15-49 years) has been understudied. In this population-based study, we study the region-specific associations between prevalence of hemoglobin among reproductive women and PM2.5 in 43 countries of Africa from 2000-2019. Using generalized linear regression models, we found that after adjusting for key covariates, PM2.5 had a slight negative association with hemoglobin among reproductive women. Other studies are needed in other low-income settings to expand our findings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d465caa8721c9168ef5ab307c7cf7407c3317f11d7e658883b8b6c8c91813eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
