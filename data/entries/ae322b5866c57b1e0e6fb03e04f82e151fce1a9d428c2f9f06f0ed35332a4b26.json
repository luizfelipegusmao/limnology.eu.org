N. Hounsfield in the early 1970’s [<a href=\"#ozae044.105-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.105-B2\">2</a>], X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has proven to be an important imaging tool for a variety of scientific disciplines. Three-dimensional (3D), spatially resolved images are acquired nondestructively and provide an inside view of the imaged object. With the development of X-ray optics, high-resolution cameras, and high precision motorized stages, XCT can be extended from its original macro-scale resolutions to micrometer (micro-XCT) and 10’s of nanometer (nano-XCT) resolutions. In addition to spanning several length scales, XCT can span several time scales: termed 4D XCT, this technique can be used to image very slow processes using a laboratory X-ray source or rather fast processes when using a bright X-ray source (i.e., synchrotron radiation).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ae322b5866c57b1e0e6fb03e04f82e151fce1a9d428c2f9f06f0ed35332a4b26","category":"Environment"}
