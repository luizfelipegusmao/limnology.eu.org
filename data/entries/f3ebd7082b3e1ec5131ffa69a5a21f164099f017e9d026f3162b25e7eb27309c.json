{"title":"Emergent Combining Factual Penile Girth Enhancement and Erection Restoration Based on Revolutionary Penile Fibro-vascular Assembly","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1377/v1","date":1718890817000,"content":"ABSTRACT\nIntroduction: Traditional penile venous surgery and enhancement have been controversial. Based on De Novo penile fibrovascular assembly, we report on penile venous stripping (PVS) and factual penile girth enhancement (FPGE). Methods: From 2013 to 2023, 18 men underwent PVS and FPGE, all confirmed with veno-occlusive dysfunction (VOD). PVS involves the stripping of erection-related veins. FPGE was performed along the tunica albuginea bilaterally; then, the two tunic defects were repaired with a 70.0x30.0 mm venous stripe and covered with either autologous venous walls (AVW, n=10) or Surgiform (SF, n=8). The penile girth was measured, and radio-opaque contrast was used. The abridged 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score and the Erection Hardness Scale (EHS) were used yearly during follow-up via the Internet. Results: The follow-up period was 5.3±1.5 years. Radiopacity was consistently enhanced. Although there was indifference between AVW and SF, there was a significant improvement (both P＜0.01) in IIEF-5 and EHS scores (9.7±2.8 vs. 20.8±2.3; 1.7±0.6 vs. 3.2±0.2, respectively). Both the diameters of the glans and penile shaft increased (28.0±2.3mm and 28.3±2.1mm vs 35.3±2.2mm and 36.3±2.1mm respectively). The satisfaction rate was 81.3% (13/16). Conclusions: This novel combination of PVS and FPGE is promising, although a larger sample size is needed for further validation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3ebd7082b3e1ec5131ffa69a5a21f164099f017e9d026f3162b25e7eb27309c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
