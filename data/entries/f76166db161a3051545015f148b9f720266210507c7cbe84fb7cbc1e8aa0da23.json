{"title":"Failure mechanism of directional roof cutting and design method optimization","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11629-024-8679-8","date":1728086400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                  <p>Directional roof cutting (DRC) is one of the key techniques in non-pillar coal mining with self-formed entries (NCMSE) mining method. Due to the inability to accurately measure the expansion coefficient of the goaf rock mass, the implementation of this technology often encounters design challenges, leading to suboptimal results and increased costs. This paper establishes a structural analysis model of the goaf working face roof, revealing the failure mechanism of DRC, and clarifies the positive role of DRC in improving the stress of the roadway surrounding rock and reducing the subsidence of the roof through numerical simulation experiments. On this basis, the paper further analyses the roadway pressure and roof settlement under different DRC design heights, and ultimately proposes an optimized design method for the DRC height. The results indicate that the implementation of DRC can significantly optimize the stress environment of the working face roadway surrounding rock. At the same time, during the application of DRC, three scenarios may arise: insufficient, reasonable, and excessive DRC height. Insufficient height will significantly reduce the effectiveness of the technology, while excessive height has little impact on the implementation effect but will greatly increase construction costs and difficulty. Engineering verification shows that the optimized DRC design method proposed in this paper reduces the peak stress of the protective coal pillar in the roadway by 27.2% and the central subsidence of the roof by 41.8%, demonstrating excellent application results. This method provides technical support for the further promotion of NCMSE mining method.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"f76166db161a3051545015f148b9f720266210507c7cbe84fb7cbc1e8aa0da23","category":"Environment"}
