{"title":"Exploration of Key Regulatory Factors in Mesenchymal Stem Cell Continuous Osteogenic Differentiation via Transcriptomic Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1444/v1","date":1729229994000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) possess the remarkable ability to dif-ferentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts. Understanding the molecular mecha-nisms governing MSC osteogenic differentiation is crucial for advancing clinical applications and our comprehension of complex disease processes. However, the key biological molecules regu-lating this process remain incompletely understood, necessitating further investigation. Methods: In this study, we employed high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing to identify and validate key biological molecules that dynamically regulate MSC osteogenic differentiation. Our approach involved comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns across human tissues, followed by rigorous experimental validation of identified candidates. Results: Through our integrated analytical and experimental approach, we pinpointed four critical regulators of MSC osteogenic differentiation: PTBP1, H2AFZ, BCL6, and TTPAL (C20ORF121). Notably, this study represents the first instance of utilizing high-throughput transcriptomics to uncover regulatory factors involved in MSC osteogenesis, marking a significant advancement in the field. Conclusions: Our findings substantially enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining MSC differentiation fate. This research holds significant implications for clinical ap-plications involving MSCs and provides valuable insights into complex disease processes. The identification of these key regulators opens new avenues for targeted interventions and therapies in bone-related disorders and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, this study establishes a robust framework for future investigations in stem cell biology, potentially leading to innovative ap-proaches in regenerative medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ae20bd3940b08e1f01caf4bb2123c4b2a9f2a35a1201d50e918059a6b09f49b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
