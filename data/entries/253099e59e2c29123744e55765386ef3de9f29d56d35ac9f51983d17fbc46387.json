{"title":"On the Salient Regularities of Strings of Assembly Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1581/v4","date":1729681556000,"content":"Using assembly theory of strings of any natural radix $b$ we find some of their salient regularities. In particular, we show that the upper bound of the assembly index depends quantitatively on the radix $b$ and the longest length $N$ of a string that has the assembly index of $N-k$ is given by $N_{(N-k)}=b^2+b+3k-2$ for $k=\\{1,2\\}$ and by $N_{(N-3)}=b^2+b+6$. We also provide particular forms of such strings. Knowing the latter bound we conjecture that the maximum assembly index of a string of length $N&gt;N_{(N-2)}$ is given by  $a_{\\text{max}}^{(N,b)} = \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor + b(b+1)/2$. For $k=1$ such odd length strings are nearly balanced and there are four such different strings if $b=2$ and seventy-two if $b=3$. We also show that a string containing $k$ copies of an $n$-plet has the assembly index of at most $N-1 - (n-1)k - a$, where $a$ is the assembly index of this $n$-plet. Finally, we show that the assembly depth of a minimum assembly index string is equal to the assembly index of this string, while the assembly depth of a maximum assembly index string has a value between $\\left\\lceil \\log_2(N) \\right\\rceil$ and the assembly index of this string. Since these results are also valid for $b=1$, assembly theory subsumes information theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"253099e59e2c29123744e55765386ef3de9f29d56d35ac9f51983d17fbc46387","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
