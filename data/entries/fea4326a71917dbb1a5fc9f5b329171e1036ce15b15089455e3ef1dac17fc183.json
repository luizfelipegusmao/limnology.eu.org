{"title":"The Impact of Cultural Differences on Global Procurement: A Qualitative Study of Multinational Supply Chains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0694/v1","date":1720501233000,"content":"This qualitative study explores the intricate impact of cultural differences on global procurement practices within multinational supply chains. Cultural dimensions profoundly influence communication dynamics, negotiation strategies, decision-making processes, and supplier relationship management in diverse global contexts. Effective cross-cultural communication is crucial for fostering trust and clarity across different cultural norms, while negotiation strategies vary based on cultural preferences for collaboration or competition. Decision-making processes are shaped by cultural attitudes towards risk tolerance, time orientation, and decision authority, influencing procurement agility and resilience. Strategic implications of cultural diversity include opportunities for innovation and localized adaptation in procurement practices, tempered by challenges such as adaptation costs and regulatory compliance. Emotional intelligence (EI) emerges as pivotal in navigating cultural complexities, enhancing stakeholder engagement, conflict resolution, and collaborative partnerships critical for sustainable procurement practices in multicultural settings. Economic factors, including stability, currency fluctuations, and market volatility, impact procurement strategies and supply chain resilience, necessitating proactive risk management and adaptive approaches. Barriers to growth in global procurement, such as regulatory complexities and geopolitical risks, require strategic planning, stakeholder collaboration, and infrastructural investments for operational continuity. By understanding and addressing cultural influences, multinational corporations can enhance cross-cultural competence, strategic decision-making, and capitalize on global market opportunities. This study contributes insights and recommendations to enhance procurement effectiveness and competitiveness in an interconnected global economy, supporting ongoing efforts to optimize global procurement practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fea4326a71917dbb1a5fc9f5b329171e1036ce15b15089455e3ef1dac17fc183","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
