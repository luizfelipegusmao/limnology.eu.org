{"title":"Enhancing Efficiency of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia by Fe and Co Nanoparticles Based Bimetallic Electrocatalyst","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1475/v1","date":1718946790000,"content":"Green and sustainable electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen-containing compounds to ammonia are currently in high demand in order to replace the eco-unfriendly Haber-Bosch process. Model catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction were obtained by electrodeposition of metal Co, Fe and bimetallic Fe/Co nanoparticles from aqueous solutions onto a graphite substrate. The samples were characterized by the following methods: SEM, XRD, XPS, UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Besides, the determination of electrochemically active surface was also performed for all electrocatalysts. The best electrocatalyst was a sample containing Fe-nanoparticles on the layer of Co-nanoparticles, which showed the Faradaic efficiency 58.2% (E=-0.785 V vs. RHE) at the ammonia yield rate of 14.6 Î¼mol h-1 cm-2. An opinion was expressed on elucidation of the mechanism of coordinated electrocatalytic action of a bimetallic electrocatalyst. This work can serve primarily as a starting point for future investigations on electrocatalytic conversion reactions to ammonia using model catalysts of the proposed type.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"830a3135151c0c00d6ac8fdebe7639dd0e9841cdc3efdd2a9d921f774adf21a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
