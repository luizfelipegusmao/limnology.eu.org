{"title":"Investigating demic versus cultural diffusion and sex bias in the spread of Austronesian languages in Vietnam","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304964","date":1718632800000,"content":"<p>by Dinh Huong Thao, Tran Huu Dinh, Shigeki Mitsunaga, La Duc Duy, Nguyen Thanh Phuong, Nguyen Phuong Anh, Nguyen Tho Anh, Bui Minh Duc, Huynh Thi Thu Hue, Nguyen Hai Ha, Nguyen Dang Ton, Alexander HÃ¼bner, Brigitte Pakendorf, Mark Stoneking, Ituro Inoue, Nguyen Thuy Duong, Nong Van Hai</p>\r\n\r\nAustronesian (AN) is the second-largest language family in the world, particularly widespread in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and Oceania. In Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), groups speaking these languages are concentrated in the highlands of Vietnam. However, our knowledge of the spread of AN-speaking populations in MSEA remains limited; in particular, it is not clear if AN languages were spread by demic or cultural diffusion. In this study, we present and analyze new data consisting of complete mitogenomes from 369 individuals and 847 Y-chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 170 individuals from all five Vietnamese Austronesian groups (VN-AN) and five neighboring Vietnamese Austroasiatic groups (VN-AA). We found genetic signals consistent with matrilocality in some, but not all, of the VN-AN groups. Population affinity analyses indicated connections between the AN-speaking Giarai and certain Taiwanese AN groups (Rukai, Paiwan, and Bunun). However, overall, there were closer genetic affinities between VN-AN groups and neighboring VN-AA groups, suggesting language shifts. Our study provides insights into the genetic structure of AN-speaking communities in MSEA, characterized by some contact with Taiwan and language shift in neighboring groups, indicating that the expansion of AN speakers in MSEA was a combination of cultural and demic diffusion.","author":"Dinh Huong Thao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"47d3f81b0db3ad9d373f91b494523683d087f0fdacdcdda6a638157286763217","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
