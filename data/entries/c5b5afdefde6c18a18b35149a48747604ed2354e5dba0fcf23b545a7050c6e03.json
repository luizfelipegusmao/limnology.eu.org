{"title":"The application of Life Cycle Assessment in Beer Production: A systematic review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0450/v1","date":1723111320000,"content":"This article examines the sustainability of beer production through a review of the available scientific literature. Beer production, a beverage of both cultural and industrial importance at a global level, significantly impacts the environment due to the use of natural resources and emissions generated during the various stages of the production process. This study adopts the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach to assess the environmental impact of beer production, from the extraction of raw materials to the disposal of the finished product. Only peer-reviewed studies published between 2001 and  July 2024 that address at least one stage of the beer production process were included in the review. The results highlight the critical points of the production cycle and suggest sustainable practices to reduce the environmental impact. This study provides a detailed overview of LCA methods applied to beer production, including defining objectives and scope, life cycle inventory, impact assessment and interpretation of results, and providing recommendations to improve sustainability in the brewing sector. The objectives of this study were to identify the critical point within the beer production cycle that significantly contributes to environmental impacts and to suggest sustainable practices and strategies that can be adopted to reduce the environmental footprint of beer production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5b5afdefde6c18a18b35149a48747604ed2354e5dba0fcf23b545a7050c6e03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
