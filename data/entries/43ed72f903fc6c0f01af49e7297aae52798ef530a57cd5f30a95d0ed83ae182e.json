{"title":"Revisiting the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of trypanosomes (Trypanosoma) infecting pelomedusid (Pelomedusidae) freshwater turtles in Southern Africa","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae107/7790487?rss=1","date":1727481600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Species of <span>Trypanosoma</span> infecting reptiles are poorly understood and understudied. The study of trypanosomes infecting turtles could lead to a greater understanding of the genus and its evolutionary history. The present study re-evaluates and classifies two previously described species of <span>Trypanosoma</span> in freshwater pelomedusid turtles, <span>Trypanosoma</span> (<span>Haematomonas</span>) <span>neitzi</span> and <span>Trypanosoma</span> (<span>Haematomonas</span>) <span>sheppardi</span>, and characterizes a new species, <span>Trypanosoma</span> (<span>Haematomonas</span>) <span>pienaari</span>, using morphological and molecular data. This study provides the first morphological descriptions and molecular data of South African turtle trypanosomes, setting a base for future research of the reptile trypanosomes of Africa.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"43ed72f903fc6c0f01af49e7297aae52798ef530a57cd5f30a95d0ed83ae182e","category":"Environment"}
