{"title":"The Role of Supplier Relationship Management in Ensuring E-Commerce Supply Chain Resilience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1136/v1","date":1721032437000,"content":"This qualitative study explores the pivotal role of Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) in enhancing resilience within e-commerce supply chains. In an era marked by rapid digital transformation and global interconnectedness, the resilience of supply chains has become a strategic imperative for organizations striving to maintain operational efficiency and meet customer expectations. Through semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers, procurement officers, and strategic sourcing specialists across diverse industries, this research investigates the strategies, challenges, and outcomes associated with SRM practices. Findings reveal that effective communication and collaboration are fundamental to successful SRM, fostering trust, transparency, and responsiveness in supplier relationships. Strategic risk management through proactive identification and mitigation strategies enables organizations to navigate uncertainties such as economic fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. SRM implementation yields significant organizational benefits, including improved supply chain efficiencies, enhanced product quality, and increased customer satisfaction. However, challenges such as technological complexities, cultural differences among global suppliers, and regulatory compliance issues underscore the need for adaptive strategies and digital investments. The integration of digital technologies such as AI and blockchain enhances SRM effectiveness by enabling real-time data exchange, predictive insights, and decision-making capabilities. Ultimately, SRM emerges as a cornerstone of sustainable growth and competitive advantage in e-commerce, empowering organizations to optimize supply chain performance and resilience amidst dynamic market conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f15925acab304b65f77245016bcbb4bf85afcca9e88995e4197ac6bc86d3db28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
