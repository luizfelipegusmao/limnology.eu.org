{"title":"Rapid headspace analysis of commercial spearmint and peppermint teas using volatile ‘fingerprints’ and an electronic nose","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13926?af=R","date":1727436315000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Spearmint and peppermint teas are widely consumed around the world for their flavor and therapeutic properties. Dynamic headspace sampling (HS) coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) with principal component analysis (PCA) of ‘fingerprint’ volatile profiles were used to investigate 27 spearmint and peppermint teas. Additionally, comparisons between mint teas were undertaken with an electronic nose (enose).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Twenty compounds, all previously known in the literature, were identified using HS–GC–MS. PCA found distinct differences between the fingerprint volatile profiles of spearmint, peppermint and spearmint/peppermint combination teas. HS–GC–MS analysis performed with an achiral column allowed faster processing time and yielded tighter clustering of PCA tea groups than the analysis which used a chiral column. Two spearmint outliers were detected. One showed a high degree of variation in volatile composition and a second wholly overlapped with the peppermint PCA grouping. Enose analysis separated all treatments with no overlaps.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Characterizing the volatile fingerprints of mint teas is critical to quality control for this valuable agricultural product. The results of this study show that fingerprint volatile profiles and enose analysis of mint teas are distinctive and could be used to rapidly identify unknown samples. With specific volatile profiles identified for each tea, samples could be tested in the laboratory, or potentially on a farm or along the supply chain, to confirm the provenance and authenticity of mint food or beverage commodities. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.
