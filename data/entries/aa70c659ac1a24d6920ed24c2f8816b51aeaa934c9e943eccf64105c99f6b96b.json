{"title":"Disturbances in the Skin Homeostasis: The Wound Healing, a Process Yet to Be Defined","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1837/v1","date":1714285748000,"content":"This review was written with the aim of examining the effects that caused an insult such as a wound to an organ such as the skin. Before examining the cellular mechanisms relating to wound healing, the reader is invited to read the structure of the skin as a necessary basis for understand-ing the final aim of this review. The structure of the skin as a basis for understanding the phe-nomena relating to wound healing is addressed taking into account updated literature that ad-dresses the numerous problems of the skin microenvironment. Starting from this awareness, the paragraph dedicated to wound healing becomes complicated when this phenomenon is not im-plemented and therefore the problems dedicated to chronic wounds, keloids and hypertrophic scars are addressed, pathologies that are still difficult to understand and treat today.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa70c659ac1a24d6920ed24c2f8816b51aeaa934c9e943eccf64105c99f6b96b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
