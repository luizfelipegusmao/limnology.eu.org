{"title":"A Review on the Use of Azolla Meal as a Feed Ingredient in Aquatic Animals’ Diets","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/2633412?af=R","date":1699081200000,"content":"<p>The aquaculture industry’s insatiable demand for fishmeal has led to a price surge, prompting the search for a sustainable alternative protein source. Enter Azolla meal, a plant protein that could be a viable substitute for fishmeal. This cost-effective supplemental feed could be a game-changer for small-scale producers looking to expand their aquaculture production. Numerous experiments have been conducted on replacing fishmeals with Azolla meals in fish diets, and the results have sparked further research. This review delves into Azolla’s composition, comparing it to fishmeal in terms of proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. It also explores the value of employing Azolla in fish feeds and the various methods to mitigate its adverse effects through feed additives during the feed formulation. This review discusses the essential effects of Azolla meal on the growth of various fish species, including tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>), catfish (<i>Clarias batrachus</i>), thai silver barb (<i>Barbonymus gonionotus</i>), common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>), rohu (<i>Labeo rohita</i>), and catla (<i>Catla catla</i>) and mrigal (<i>Cirrhinus cirrhosus</i>). Azolla’s potential extends beyond its use as a fish feed ingredient. It could also be utilized for bioremediation to remediate hazardous chemicals in water resulting from aquaculture, industrial, and household waste. Further research is needed to optimize the use of Azolla meal in fish feed and to develop cost-effective production methods. This review is a valuable resource for farmers looking to maximize profit when using Azolla in aquafeed and potentially sustainably enhance aquaculture production. With its promising potential, the Azolla meal could be the key to meeting the growing demand for fishmeals while reducing the industry’s environmental impact.</p>","author":"Mpwaga Alatwinusa Yohana, \nGyan Watson Ray, \nQihui Yang, \nBeiping Tan, \nShuyan Chi, \nAmos Asase, \nKou Shiyu, \nAsare Derrick, \nWing-Keong Ng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"73a4f94652ef3676b1a93d9e6193d96b95062b67b30bad1ec7cdefa504872ff1","category":"Environment"}
