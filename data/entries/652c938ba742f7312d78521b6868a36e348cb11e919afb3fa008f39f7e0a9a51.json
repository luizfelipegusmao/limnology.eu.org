{"title":"Design, Fabrication, Characterization and Simulation of AlN PMUT for Sonar Imaging Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1312/v1","date":1716295742000,"content":"To address the requirements of sonar imaging, such as high receiving sensitivity, wide bandwidth, wide receiving angle, an AlN PMUT with an optimized ratio of 0.6 for the piezoelectric layer diameter to backside cavity diameter is proposed in this paper. A sample AlN PMUT is designed and fabricated with SOI substrate-based bulk MEMS process. The characterization test result of the sample demonstrates a -6 dB bandwidth of approximately 500 kHz and a measured receiving sensitivity per unit area of at 1.37 V/μPa/mm2, which significantly surpasses the performance of previously reported PMUTs. The -6 dB horizontal angles of the AlN PMUT at 300 kHz and 500 kHz are measured 68.30° and 54.24°, respectively. To achieve an accurate prediction of its characteristics when being packaged and assembled in a receive array, numerical simulations with the consideration of film stress are conducted. The numerical result shows a maximum deviation of ±7% in the underwater receiving sensitivity across the frequency range of 200 kHz to 1000 kHz and a deviation of about 0.33% in the peak of underwater receiving sensitivity comparing to the experimental data. By such good agreement, the simulation method reveals its capability of providing theoretical foundation for enhancing the uniformity of the AlN PMUTs in future studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"652c938ba742f7312d78521b6868a36e348cb11e919afb3fa008f39f7e0a9a51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
