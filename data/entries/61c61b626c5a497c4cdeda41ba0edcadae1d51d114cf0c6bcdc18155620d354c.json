{"title":"Aged-Related Changes in Microglia and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Exploring the Connection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0722/v1","date":1715593418000,"content":"Microglial cells are brain macrophages that support and protect the central nervous system enviroment. Aging induces alterations in microglial polarization, resulting in a shift towards a neurotoxic phenotype characterized by increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers. Dysregulation of microglial cells regulatory pathways and interactions with neurons contribute to chronic activation and neurodegeneration. A better understanding the involvement of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, is a critical topic to studying the role of inflammatory responses in disease progression. Furthermore, the metabolic changes in aged microglia, including downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation are discussed in this review. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing better preventive and therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61c61b626c5a497c4cdeda41ba0edcadae1d51d114cf0c6bcdc18155620d354c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
