These files can be loaded into software wavetable synthesizers in order to create audible forms of data that can represent complex information. Some background about sonification will be discussed, and the simple method developed here will be applied to graphene optoelectronics. Some key illustrative examples will be used to demonstrate the method, including data sets from a previous publication that reported light emission from graphene field effect transistors (Angela Beltaos 2017). We use the sonification method to show how changes in observed phenomena (e.g. light emission intensity and spectral shape) result in changes of the resulting sound (such as the timbre). Demonstrations are included in video format to hear and illustrate the method and resulting effects.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
