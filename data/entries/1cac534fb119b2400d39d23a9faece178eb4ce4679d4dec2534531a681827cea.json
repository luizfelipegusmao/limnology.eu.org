{"title":"Delineating Ecological Functional Zones and Grades for Multi-Scale Ecosystem Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0777/v1","date":1725954133000,"content":"Integrating ecosystem services (ESs) to delineate ecological functional zones (EFZs) is a fundamental work in terrestrial spatial planning and ecosystem management. However, existing studies have largely overlooked the refinement of EFZs at local scales, which hinders targeted and multi-scale ecosystem management. This study introduced a \"two-step refinement zoning method\" to address this gap, first using the self-organizing feature mapping method to delineate EFZs based on ESs at a township scale, and then applying hotspot overlay analysis to identify hotspots of dominant ESs within EFZs at a village scale. By overlaying the outcomes of these two steps, EFZs\ncan be further graded by designating villages with hotspots of dominant ESs as level I\nand those without as level II. The proposed method was applied in Wuhan City, dividing it into five types of EFZs with different ESs combinations and land use compositions. Furthermore, 5.23% of villages were identified as Level I of EFZs, serving as advantageous areas of dominant ESs in the study area. On this basis, diversified management strategies and conservation priorities were proposed. This study provides a theoretical and methodological reference for terrestrial spatial planning and sustainable ecosystem management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cac534fb119b2400d39d23a9faece178eb4ce4679d4dec2534531a681827cea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
