Furthermore, we also introduce the work done on the unification of the gravitation and electromagnetic fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7530bd174b7bec89639af08b99f0b124154881f15f724b3dc76d19b5b06abc1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
