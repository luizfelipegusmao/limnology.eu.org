{"title":"Integrating RFID and Blockchain for Recycling Empty Medication Bottles in the Pharmaceutical Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0938/v1","date":1726149093000,"content":"The growing emphasis on sustainability and environmental stewardship in the pharmaceutical industry necessitates innovative solutions to manage pharmaceutical waste, particularly medication bottles. This research paper explores the potential of integrating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and blockchain technology to enhance the traceability, accountability, and efficiency of recycling empty medication bottles. By utilizing RFID for real-time tracking and blockchain for secure, immutable data storage, this proposed system improves transparency across the supply chain and incentivizes consumer participation in recycling programs. The solution provides benefits to pharmaceutical manufacturers, regulators, and consumers, contributing to sustainability, regulatory compliance, and environmental protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"badfc96b72c7378f002525c460b07def57c1d2c012ec7a80e506cfcc9d19ffc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
