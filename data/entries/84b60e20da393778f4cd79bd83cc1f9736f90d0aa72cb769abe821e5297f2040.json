Therefore, intelligent statistical models such as M5 tree decision-making algorithms should be used for estimation. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite images in estimating soil surface moisture between Gorgan and Aqqala. Data mining methods were used to achieve this, including the stepwise M5 tree decision-making algorithm and Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR). A total of 151 samples were taken from the soil surface in the study area, and their Soil Moisture (SM) content was calculated. Spectral reflectance information was also obtained from satellite images. A data matrix was then created by computing spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Multi-Band Drought Index (NMDI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) for data mining purposes. The MLR method can estimate SM with 60–79% accuracy. To improve the model accuracy and overcome algorithm greediness, the m5 model was implemented in a stepwise algorithm. As a result, SM can be estimated with 80–89% accuracy for Sentinel 2 satellite and Landsat 8. Landsat 8 showed the highest accuracy among the Landsat satellites. Given the wide coverage of satellite images, improving the accuracy of results can make these satellites a great tool for obtaining information and managing various sectors, including soil management in agriculture.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"84b60e20da393778f4cd79bd83cc1f9736f90d0aa72cb769abe821e5297f2040","category":"Environment"}
