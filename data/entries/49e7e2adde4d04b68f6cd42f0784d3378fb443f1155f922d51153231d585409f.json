{"title":"Stimulating or Inhibiting? The Impact of Physical Exercise on Chinese Residents&#039; Willingness for Additional Childbearing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0852/v1","date":1728612577000,"content":"In recent years, the decline of birth rate in China has made the enhancement of willingness to have additional children an urgent social issue. Utilizing data from the 2021 China General Social Survey (CGSS 2021) and employing Logit regression models, Poisson regression models, and Lewbel models, this study analyzes the impact of physical exercise on Chinese residents' willingness to have more children. The results indicate that: (1) Physical exercise has a significant positive effect on the willingness to have additional children, and this finding remains robust after controlling for other variables; (2) Among samples from high-income families and individuals with shorter working hours, physical exercise positively influences the willingness to have more children, suggesting that economic and time factors affect the relationship between physical exercise and fertility intentions. This research is the first to explore the impact of physical exercise on the fertility intentions of Chinese residents, aiming to provide theoretical reference and policy implication for enhancing the willingness to have additional children, effectively unleashing fertility potential, and promoting the construction of a fertility-friendly society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49e7e2adde4d04b68f6cd42f0784d3378fb443f1155f922d51153231d585409f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
