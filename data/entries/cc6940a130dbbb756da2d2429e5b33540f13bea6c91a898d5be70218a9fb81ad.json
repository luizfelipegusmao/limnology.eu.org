Daily tracking study of their homing behavior","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15824?af=R","date":1717034684000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Anguilla marmorata</i> collected in the Odana River lower reaches were passive integrated transponder-tagged displaced and released into the upper river reaches (54 up-transported eels), and eels collected in the upper reaches were tagged and released downstream (52 down-transported eels). Their movements were detected once per day for 10â€‰days using a portable radio-frequency identification (RFID) system. The homing rate of the down-transported eels was 38.9%, compared to 3.7% for the up-transported eels, suggesting that eels inhabiting upstream areas have relatively high fidelity to their habitats and downstream eels have less fidelity.</p>","author":"Tatsuhiko Maeda, \nSeishi Hagihara, \nRyoshiro Wakiya, \nShingo Kimura","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"cc6940a130dbbb756da2d2429e5b33540f13bea6c91a898d5be70218a9fb81ad","category":"Environment"}
