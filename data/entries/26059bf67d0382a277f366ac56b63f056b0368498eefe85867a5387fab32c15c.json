{"title":"Screening the Performance of a Reverse Osmosis Pilot-Scale Process that Treats a Blended Feedwater Containing Nanofiltration Concentrate and Brackish Groundwater","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1736/v1","date":1719300439000,"content":"A two-stage pilot plant study has been completed that evaluated the performance of a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane process for the treatment of a feedwater that consisted of a blend of nanofiltration (NF) concentrate and brackish groundwater. Membrane performance was assessed by monitoring the process operation, collecting water quality data, and documenting the blended feedwater’s impact on fouling due to a combination of, or solely caused by, plugging, scaling, microbiological, or organic means. Fluorescence and biological activity reaction tests were used to identify the types of organics and microorganisms present in the blended feedwater. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to analyze suspended matter that collected on the surfaces of cartridge filters used in the pilot’s pretreatment system. SEM and EDS were also used to evaluate solids collected on the surfaces of 0.45-µm silver filter pads after filtering known volumes of NF concentrate and RO feedwater blends. Water quality analyses confirmed that the blended feedwater contained little to no dissolved oxygen, and the blended feedwater was absent of a significant amount of particulate matter as defined by silt density index and turbidity measurements. However, water quality results suggested that the presence of sulfate, sulfide, iron, anaerobic bacteria, and humic acid organics likely contributed to the formation of pyrite observed on some of the membrane surfaces autopsied at the conclusion of pilot operations. It was determined that first-stage membrane productivity was impacted by the location of cartridge filter pretreatment; however, second-stage productivity was maintained with no observed flux decline during the entire pilot operation’s timeline. Study results indicated that the operation of an RO process treating a blend of NF concentrate and brackish groundwater could maintain a sustainable and productive operation that provided a practical zero-discharge process operation while the dilution of RO feedwater salinity would lower overall production costs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26059bf67d0382a277f366ac56b63f056b0368498eefe85867a5387fab32c15c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
