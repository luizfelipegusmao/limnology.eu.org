{"title":"Experimental and 3D numerical analysis of the impact of a tower shape on the performances of a solar chimney power plant","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14275?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This article presents both numerical and experimental analyses investigating the impact of tower shape on the performance of a solar chimney power plant (SCPP). The study explores several cases through experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Specifically, variations in the tower's outlet section and overall shape were examined under different solar radiation conditions. The shape of the tower was found to have a significant influence on various performance parameters of the studied SCPP. These include the mass flow rate, velocity, temperature rise in the collector, pressure in the tower, as well as power production, and overall efficiency. The obtained results indicate that when the tower's outlet section is twice the size of the inlet section, all of these parameters experience substantial improvements. For a configuration similar to that of the Manzanares prototype, the generated power increased from 50 to 56â€‰kW, representing an enhancement of about 12%. The findings underscore the importance of considering the tower shape when designing SCPPs. Optimizing the tower's geometry can lead to significant improvements in key performance metrics, resulting in enhanced power generation and overall efficiency.</p>","author":"Samir Djimli, \nTaqiy Eddine Boukelia, \nAbla Chaker, \nAmel Ghellab","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"6216774983dcc38c7b093d9544d4223ef810f628817fbc8fe80afa6acddf5b71","category":"Environment"}
