{"title":"Inhibition of Drp1-Filamin Protein Complex Prevents Hepatic Lipid Droplet Accumulation by Increasing Mitochondria-Lipid Droplet Contacts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0918/v1","date":1713160947000,"content":"Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in hepatocytes is one of the major symptoms associated with fatty liver disease. Mitochondria play a key role in catabolizing fatty acids for energy production through Î²-oxidation. The interplay between mitochondria and LD assumes a crucial role in lipid metabolism, while it is obscure how mitochondrial morphology affects systemic lipid metabolism in the liver. We previously reported that cilnidipine, an already existing anti-hypertensive drug, has potency to prevent pathological mitochondrial fission by inhibiting protein-protein interaction between dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and filamin, an actin-binding protein. Here, we found that cilnidipine and its new dihydropyridine (DHP) derivative, 1,4-DHP, which lacks Ca2+ channel blocking action of cilnidipine, prevent the palmitic ac-id-induced Drp1-filamin interaction, LD accumulation and cytotoxicity of human hepatic HepG2 cells. Cilnidipine and 1,4-DHP also suppressed the LD accumulation accompanied by reducing mitochondrial contact with LD in obese model and high fat diet-fed mouse livers. These results propose that targeting Drp1-filimin interaction becomes a new strategy for the prevention or treatment of fatty liver disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a6f8349d1cf66d253cd9b0844014e35d87ea7d9c6e226bab2daff0a050f086e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
