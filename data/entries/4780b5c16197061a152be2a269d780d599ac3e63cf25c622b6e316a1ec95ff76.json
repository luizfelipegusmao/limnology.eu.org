Bohren, Farah Babaey, Sedigheh Hantoushzadeh, Abdoljavad Khajavi, Abbas Rahimi Foroushani</p>\r\nBackground <p>Mistreatment of women during childbirth is a global health challenge. Maternity healthcare providers play a key role in influencing women’s birth experience. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of healthcare providers regarding mistreatment of women during labour and childbirth in public hospitals in Tehran, Iran.</p> Methods <p>This cross-sectional study was part of an implementation research project that was conducted from October to December 2021 at five public teaching hospitals in Tehran. All eligible maternity healthcare providers (obstetricians and midwives) and students were invited to participate in this study. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of four sections: socio-demographic characteristics (11 items), knowledge (11 items), attitudes (13 items), and practices (14 items) about mistreatment. Knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were determined using Bloom’s cut-off points. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the socio-demographic characteristics associated with knowledge and attitudes. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p> Results <p>Of the 270 participants, 255 (94.5%) participated in the study. Majority of the participants (82.7%) had poor knowledge regarding mistreatment of women during labour and childbirth. Poor knowledge was more apparent in the categories of physical abuse, verbal abuse, poor rapport between women and providers, and failure to meet professional standards of care. Most participants (69.4%) had poor attitudes towards mistreatment; they were alright with physical abuse, verbal abuse, and discrimination. Only 3.1% of the participants reported moderate mistreatment practices towards birthing women. Verbal and physical abuse were the most prevalent categories used by the participants. The number of night shifts was associated with attitudes regarding mistreatment (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22–0.89, p = 0.02).</p> Conclusion <p>The knowledge and attitude of our participants regarding maternity mistreatment were poor. A small percentage of the participants reported mistreatment practices. The findings of our study have important implications for program planners and decision-makers in developing effective interventions to reduce mistreatment of women during labour and childbirth in Iran.</p>","author":"Marjan Mirzania","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4780b5c16197061a152be2a269d780d599ac3e63cf25c622b6e316a1ec95ff76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
