{"title":"Cytoprotective Effect of Copaifera reticulata Ducke Oil-Resin Extracted from Amazon Flora on Neural Cells Exposed to Rotenone","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2510/v1","date":1722414229000,"content":"The use of pesticides such as rotenone can lead to toxicity, dysfunction and neuronal death in humans. The Copaifera Reticulata Ducke Oil-Resin (CPOR) is widely used by the natives of the Amazon, however, studies on its potential neuroprotective effect are lacking. This study investigated the cytoprotective effect of CPOR on total cell cultures of the ventral midbrain (VMC), hippocampus (HC) and cerebral cortex (CCC) exposed to rotenone at different concentrations. The total cell cultures of VMC, HC and CCC were exposed for 72 or 24 hours to rotenone, CPOR and rotenone + CPOR. Cell viability was measured using the MTT test and compared using one-way ANOVA. Exposure to rotenone reduced the cell viability of CMV, HC and CCC. Exposure to CPOR reduced the cell viability of CMV. The cell viability of CMV exposed simultaneously to rotenone and CPOR was higher compared to rotenone alone. The cell viability of HC exposed simultaneously to rotenone and CPOR was higher than that exposed to rotenone. CMVs are more vulnerable to rotenone toxicity and more sensitive to CPOR. Considering simultaneous exposure, CPOR revealed a possible neuroprotective effect against rotenone damage only for VMC and HC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e96edf748359737e90dd99ec028d471a2b39028630cd573b9aa4d027c37af47b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
