{"title":"How Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies are Redefining Immunity to Influenza","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0842/v2","date":1729152432000,"content":"Recent avian influenza outbreaks have heightened global concern over viral threats with the potential to significantly impact human health. Influenza is particularly alarming due to its history of causing pandemics and zoonotic reservoirs. In response, significant progress has been made toward the development of universal influenza vaccines, largely driven by the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). bnAbs have the potential to neutralize a broad range of influenza viruses, extending beyond the traditional strain-specific response. This could lead to longer-lasting immunity, reducing the need for seasonal vaccinations, and improve preparedness for future pandemics. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of these antibodies, their application in clinical studies, and both their potential and possible shortcomings in managing future influenza outbreaks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"922a471ac2c06efb715d0da4b826e5650ad12f97517706e7d8cf706fce8b7c09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
