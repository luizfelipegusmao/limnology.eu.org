{"title":"Carbon Cycle Response to Stratospheric Aerosol Injection With Multiple Temperature Stabilization Targets and Strategies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004474?af=R","date":1717151361000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We analyze the global carbon cycle response to a set of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) simulations performed by the CESM2(WACCM6-MA) model. The simulations are performed under the specified SSP2-4.5 CO<sub>2</sub> concentration pathway. It is found that both the temperature stabilization target and the SO<sub>2</sub> injection strategy have important effects on the global carbon sink. Relative to the SSP2-4.5 scenario, averaged over the last 20 years of our simulations (year 2050–2069), simultaneous multi-location SO<sub>2</sub> injection causes an increase in cumulative land carbon uptake of 45 and 23 PgC, and an increase in cumulative ocean carbon uptake of 6 and 2 PgC for temperature stabilization targets of 0.5°C and 1.5°C respectively. For a temperature stabilization target of 1.0°C, SO<sub>2</sub> injections increase land and ocean carbon sinks by 22–42 PgC and 4–7 PgC, respectively, depending on the strategies of SO<sub>2</sub> injections (low latitude, mid-to-high latitude, and multi-objective injection). Relative to SSP2-4.5, by year 2069, SAI increases diagnosed cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 25–53 PgC (3%–6%), implying a decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> if SO<sub>2</sub> injections were performed under a prescribed CO<sub>2</sub> emission pathway. Stratospheric SO<sub>2</sub> injections slow permafrost thaw, but do not restore permafrost to the previous extent at the same warming level for all injection strategies. An abrupt termination of SO<sub>2</sub> injection weakens both the ocean and land carbon sink, and causes a rapid decline of permafrost extent. A gradual phaseout of SO<sub>2</sub> injection slows sharp decline of permafrost and delays the rebound of carbon sink.</p>","author":"Mengying Zhao, \nLong Cao, \nDaniele Visioni, \nDouglas G.
