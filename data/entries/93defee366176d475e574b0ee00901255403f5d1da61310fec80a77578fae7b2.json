Nonetheless, interpreting the extensive data from APT, especially the intricate 3D microstructures, remains challenging. In this paper, we illustrate an unsupervised machine-learning technique to distinguish and segment out different material phases within APT data of a Fe-doped Sm-Co alloy, as depicted in Fig.1 (A and B). Further, individual precipitates are recognized in each segmented phase using a density-based clustering algorithm, as shown in Fig.1 (C). We have also developed a workflow using principal component analysis (PCA) to simplify the complex morphologies of secondary phase precipitates found in the given alloy into plate-like sub-structures, see Fig. 2 (A and B). This segmentation allows for automatic and systematic measurement of in-plane variations in composition and thickness, as well as the relative orientations of the precipitates. The data labeled by the PCA technique is utilized to train a U-Net model, which automates the process of pixel-wise segmentation of precipitates with complex geometry on different APT samples of the same alloy [<a href=\"#ozae044.029-B1\">1</a>]. The insights gained from analyzing the in-plane composition and thickness fluctuations are anticipated to enhance our understanding of how the second-phase precipitates influence the magnetic properties of the given alloy, guiding the design of future permanent hard magnets [<a href=\"#ozae044.029-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"93defee366176d475e574b0ee00901255403f5d1da61310fec80a77578fae7b2","category":"Environment"}
