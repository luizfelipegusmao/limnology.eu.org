{"title":"Effect of a novel alkaline protease from Bacillus licheniformis on growth performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal morphology of white feather broilers","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13337?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary novel alkaline protease from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> on the growth performance, meat quality, antioxidant status and intestinal morphology of broilers. In total, 4000 broilers were randomly assigned into five groups and treated with normal control, normal control + 100 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> protease, normal control + 200 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> protease, normal control + 300 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> protease and normal control + 400 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> protease.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Supplementing protease impacted final body weight (linear, <i>P</i> = 0.003; quadratic, <i>P</i> = 0.006) and decreased feed conversion rate (linear, <i>P</i> = 0.036) in broilers. Moreover, dietary protease significantly increased breast muscle rate (linear, <i>P</i> = 0.005; quadratic, <i>P</i> = 0.021) and decreased drip loss (linear, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; quadratic, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, dietary protease notably increased protein digestibility (linear, <i>P</i> = 0.001; quadratic, <i>P</i> = 0.006) and trypsin activity (linear, <i>P</i> = 0.002; quadratic, <i>P</i> = 0.009) in jejunum. Light microscopy revealed that the jejunum villi in the 300 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and 400 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> groups exhibited greater height and a denser arrangement compared to those in the control group. The addition of protease decreased malondialdehyde content (linear, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; quadratic, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and increased total antioxidant capacity (linear, <i>P</i> = 0.001; quadratic, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) in pectoral muscles.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results of the present study suggest that dietary novel alkaline protease from <i>B. licheniformis</i> improved growth performance by affecting trypsin activity, protein digestibility, antioxidant capacity and intestinal health. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wuzhou Yi, \nYanjie Liu, \nShijun Fu, \nJianshu Zhuo, \nWenye Zhang, \nShiqi Liu, \nYunang Tu, \nTizhong Shan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"e2ef9bf17ce7de7bc6a5903c010f8feee78351a969cb4037b18b1daff522848f","category":"Environment"}
