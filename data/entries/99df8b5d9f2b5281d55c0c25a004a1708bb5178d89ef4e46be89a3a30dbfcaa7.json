{"title":"The Global Epidemic of Bactrocera Pests: Mixed-Species Invasions and Risk Assessment","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ento-012723-102658?TRACK=RSS","date":1706140800000,"content":"<div><p>Throughout the past century, the global spread of <span>Bactrocera</span> pests has continued to pose a significant threat to the commercial fruit and vegetable industry, resulting in substantial costs associated with both control measures and quarantine restrictions. The increasing volume of transcontinental trade has contributed to an escalating rate of <span>Bactrocera</span> pest introductions to new regions. To address the worldwide threat posed by this group of pests, we first provide an overview of <span>Bactrocera</span>. We then describe the global epidemic, including border interceptions, species diagnosis, population genetics, geographical expansion, and invasion tracing of <span>Bactrocera</span> pests. We further consider the literature concerning the invasion co-occurrences, life-history flexibility, risk assessment, bridgehead effects, and ongoing implications of invasion recurrences, as well as a case study of <span>Bactrocera</span> invasions of California. Finally, we call for global collaboration to effectively monitor, prevent, and control the ongoing spread of <span>Bactrocera</span> pests and to share experience and knowledge to combat it.</p></div>","author":"Zihua Zhao, James R.
