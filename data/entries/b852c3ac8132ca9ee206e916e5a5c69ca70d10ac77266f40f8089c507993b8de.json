Methodologically, the review synthesizes empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses from the last 20 years, extracted from databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, to construct a comprehensive understanding of how team sports contribute to holistic student development. Our findings highlight team sports as a vital component of educational and wellness programs, significantly enhancing not just physical health but also emotional stability, cognitive performance, social skills, spiritual enrichment, and environmental awareness. The review underscores the necessity of integrating team sports into educational curricula to promote a balanced and comprehensive approach to student well-being. It also identifies existing gaps in literature, particularly the need for further research on enhancing inclusivity and accessibility in team sports, ensuring that all students can benefit from their wide-ranging impacts. This study advocates for strategic initiatives to incorporate team sports in educational settings, emphasizing their essential role in cultivating a well-rounded, healthy, and inclusive student body.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b852c3ac8132ca9ee206e916e5a5c69ca70d10ac77266f40f8089c507993b8de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
