{"title":"Methods using Marine Aquatic Photoautotrophs Along the Qatari Coastline to Remediate Oil and Gas Industrial Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1984/v1","date":1721859659000,"content":"Abstract: Qatar and other Gulf States have a diverse range of marine vegetation that is adapted to the stressful environmental conditions of seawater. The industrial wastewater produced by oil and gas activities adds further detrimental conditions for marine aquatic photosynthetic organ-isms on the Qatari coastlines. Thus, these organisms experience severe stress from both seawater and industrial wastewater. This review discusses the biodiversity in seawater around Qatar, as well as remediation methods and metabolic pathways to reduce the negative impacts of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons produced during these activities. These methods include phyto-stabilization phyto-accumulation, phyto-volatilization, and phyto-degradation. Phy-to-degradation in particular is discussed in detail, including metabolic pathways such as alkane and aromatic-compound degradation pathways. The role of microorganisms that are adjacent to or associated with these aquatic marine organisms is discussed, including rhizosphere biodeg-radation. In this type of biodegradation, exudates are released by plant roots and supply nutrients to microorganisms in the rhizosphere, which enhances their ability to degrade organic pollutants. Special attention is paid to mangrove forests and their roles in remediating shores polluted by industrial wastewater. Seagrasses (Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, and Thalassia hemprichii) and seaweeds (Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta, and Rhodophyta) around the peninsula of Qatar are also discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49659712a4a0f1198b796cfd81777a8bd4bbbbaa5a2cdaa1f7067a4f84e9343f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
