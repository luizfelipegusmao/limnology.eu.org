{"title":"The influence of environmental diplomacy, economic determinants and renewable energy consumption on environmental degradation: Empirical evidence of G20 countries","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300921","date":1711375200000,"content":"<p>by Muhammad Rizwanullah, Jian Shi, Muhammad Nasrullah, Xue Zhou</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examines how various environmental and economic variables contribute to environmental degradation. Industrialization, trade openness, and foreign direct investment are among the variables, as are environmental diplomacy, environmental diplomacy secure, and renewable energy consumption. Therefore, the data covers the years 1991–2020, and our sample includes all 19 countries and two groups (the European Union and the African Union). The research used the Pesaran CD test to determine cross-section dependency, CIPS and CADF test to determine stationarity, the Wald test for hetrodcedasasticity and the Wooldridge test for autocorrelation; therefore, VIF for multicollinearity, Durbin and Hausman to analyze the endogeneity. It also employed Westerlund’s cointegration test to ensure cross-sectional dependence, Wald test for group-wise heteroscedasticity, Wooldridge test for autocorrelation, VIF for multicollinearity, and Durbin and Hausman for endogeneity. The two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) is used to estimate the results and confirm the relationship between independent variables (Industrialization, trade openness, FDI, environmental diplomacy, secure environmental diplomacy, and renewable energy) and dependent variables (Environmental Degradation) in G20 countries. Therefore, Industrialization, trade openness, foreign direct investment, ecological diplomacy, and renewable energy consumption significantly impact ecological degradation. Environmental diplomacy is crucial to combat degradation and stimulate global collaboration. G20 nations enact strict environmental restrictions to tackle climate change and encourage economic growth.","author":"Muhammad Rizwanullah","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e94b48a3702c09d238a235c7f63e51705cffb7d0df4961f8d51aa5336842a190","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
