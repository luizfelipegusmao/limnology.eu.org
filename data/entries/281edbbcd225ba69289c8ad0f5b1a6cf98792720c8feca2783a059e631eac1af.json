{"title":"Teaching Innovation and Teaching&ndash;Learning Methods Integrated into Education for Sustainable Tourism Development in a Bach-Elor of Tourism Program","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0017/v1","date":1719826855000,"content":"Sustainable development has become the aspiration of many developing countries, including Ecuador. The introduction of Bachelor of Tourism studies at the Technical University of Manabí aligns with this interest, implying a challenge for teachers regarding the application of integrative and innovative teaching methods that promote the training of professionals with high scientific rigor, both in technical and professional senses. To achieve this, the pedagogical group started from three fundamental principles based on the application of teaching work methods and pro-cedures, as well as the determination of interactions between the various factors that directly and indirectly influence the training process of professionals in the tourism sector. The results of comprehensive evaluation processes considering both the academic performance of the teachers and the level of satisfaction of students taking the course support the application of these teaching–learning methods, as well as highlighting the convenience of extending the experiences and re-search results of the pedagogical team to other vocational training centers for tourism activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"281edbbcd225ba69289c8ad0f5b1a6cf98792720c8feca2783a059e631eac1af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
