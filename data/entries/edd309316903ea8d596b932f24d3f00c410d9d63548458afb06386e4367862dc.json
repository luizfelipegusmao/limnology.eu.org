{"title":"Impact of Thickness of Pd/Cu Membrane on Performance of Biogas Dry Reforming Membrane Reactor Utilizing Ni/Cr Catalyst","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0847/v1","date":1718229691000,"content":"This study focuses on a biogas dry reforming to produce H2. Biogas contains CO2 of 40 vol% approximately, indicating that the efficiency of the power generation is reduced because of the smaller heating value compared with a natural gas. The authors have proposed the combination system consisting of biogas dry reforming reactor and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Since a biogas dry reforming is an endothermic reaction, this study adopts a membrane reactor which can be operated by causing the non-equilibrium state with H2 separation from the reaction space. This study aims to clarify the impact of thickness of Pd/Cu membrane on the characteristics of the biogas dry reforming membrane reactor using Pd/Cu membrane and Ni/Cr catalyst. The impact of the operation temperature, the molar ratio of CH4:CO2 and the differential pressure between the reaction chamber and the sweep chamber on the characteristics of the biogas dry reforming membrane reactor using Pd/Cu membrane and Ni/Cr catalyst is examined changing the thickness of Pd/Cu membrane. As a result, the highest concentration of H2 is 122711 ppmV which is obtained in case of CH4:CO2 =1:1 at the reaction temperature of 600 ℃ and the differential pressure of 0 MPa using the Pd/Cu membrane whose thickness of 40 m.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"edd309316903ea8d596b932f24d3f00c410d9d63548458afb06386e4367862dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
