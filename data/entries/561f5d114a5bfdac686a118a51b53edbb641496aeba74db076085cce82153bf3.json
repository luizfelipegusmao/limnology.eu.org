{"title":"Suppression of the alpha, delta, and omicron variants of SARS-Cov-2 in Taiwan","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300303","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Hsiao-Hui Tsou, Fang-Jing Lee, Shiow-Ing Wu, Byron Fan, Hsiao-Yu Wu, Yu-Hsuan Lin, Ya-Ting Hsu, Chieh Cheng, Yu-Chieh Cheng, Wei-Ming Jiang, Hung-Yi Chiou, Wei J.

Hsiung, Pau-Chung Chen, Huey-Kang Sytwu</p>\r\nBackground <p>Taiwan was a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outlier, with an extraordinarily long transmission-free record: 253 days without locally transmitted infections while the rest of the world battled wave after wave of infection. The appearance of the alpha variant in May 2021, closely followed by the delta variant, disrupted this transmission-free streak. However, despite low vaccination coverage (&lt;1%), outbreaks were well-controlled.</p> Methods <p>This study analyzed the time to border closure and conducted one-sample t test to compare between Taiwan and Non-Taiwan countries prior to vaccine introduction. The study also collected case data to observe the dynamics of omicron transmission. Time-varying reproduction number,R<sub>t</sub>, was calculated and was used to reflect infection impact at specified time points and model trends of future incidence.</p> Results <p>The study analyzed and compare the time to border closure in Taiwan and non-Taiwan countries. The mean times to any border closure from the first domestic case within each country were -21 and 5.98 days, respectively (P &lt; .0001). The Taiwanese government invested in quick and effective contact tracing with a precise quarantine strategy in lieu of a strict lockdown. Residents followed recommendations based on self-discipline and unity. The self-discipline in action is evidenced in Google mobility reports. The central and local governments worked together to enact non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including universal masking, social distancing, limited unnecessary gatherings, systematic contact tracing, and enhanced quarantine measures. The people cooperated actively with pandemic-prevention regulations, including vaccination and preventive NPIs.</p> Conclusions <p>This article describes four key factors underlying Taiwanâ€™s success in controlling COVID-19 transmission: quick responses; effective control measures with new technologies and rolling knowledge updates; unity and cooperation among Taiwanese government agencies, private companies and organizations, and individual citizens; and Taiwanese self-discipline.</p>","author":"Hsiao-Hui Tsou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"561f5d114a5bfdac686a118a51b53edbb641496aeba74db076085cce82153bf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
