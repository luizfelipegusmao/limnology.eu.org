{"title":"Stigma and Discrimination among Adolescents Living with Perinatal HIV in Thailand: Reports from Their Caregivers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1101/v1","date":1721031474000,"content":"In Thailand, thousands of children living with perinatal HIV have been exposed to HIV-related stigma/discrimination but its frequency and expressions have been little studied. Our objective was to assess stigma/discrimination prevalence, associated risks factors and its expressions among adolescents. All caregivers of adolescents aged 12-19 years living with perinatal HIV and receiving antiretrovirals in 20 hospitals throughout Thailand were invited to complete a face-to-face questionnaire on their adolescentâ€™s life and medical history. Of the 572 adolescents living in family settings, 464 had their HIV-status known in the community. The overall stigma/discrimination prevalence was 46%. Factors associated included living in the north-east region (OR: 2.80, 95%CI: 1.19-4.96), having a low intellectual ability (OR:2.68, 95%CI: 1.45-5.16), a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) (OR BMI &amp;gt; 18.5: 0.61, 95%CI: 0.37-0.98), conflicts with caregivers (OR: 1.86, 95%CI: 1.26-2.76) and caregivers being members of a support group (OR: 2.34, 95%CI: 1.58-3.48). Expressions of stigma/discrimination included bullying, social isolation, behavioral discrimination and public disclosure. The prevalence of stigma/discrimination among adolescents living with perinatal HIV is high. Despite existing policies, stigma eradication remains necessary to normalize their life as they grow into adulthood.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ace20dad86556ececac876aa832351b6e92c3f7a962cb6387ac6019c8b99c1f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
