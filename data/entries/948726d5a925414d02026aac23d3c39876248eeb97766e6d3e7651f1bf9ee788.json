{"title":"Ultimate Sensitivity of Threat Detection by an Anisotropic Diffusion Mobility Analyser with an Individual Ion Counter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0495/v1","date":1712556843000,"content":"A novel concept of ion separation Anisotropic Diffusion Mobility Analyser (ADMA) with Individual Ion Counter (IIC) was shown by numerical modelling to be able to separate ions with high resolution and ultra-high sensitivity. An ADMA-IIC device has been developed and tested at sheath flow rates below 40 l/min with a number of chemicals relevant to airport security and military applications. The resolving power of the ADMA was observed to be in the range of 40 to 80. These data were close to the resolution obtained in numerical modelling predictions. It is greater than or comparable with the RP of currently available on-the-market devices for airport security and other applications. It was also confirmed that the ADMA technology enables very fast detection of analytes, at least 100 times faster than ion mobility spectrometers. It was shown that Brownian diffusion can be controlled and even overpowered by generating highly anisotropic diffusion in the ADMA device. The ultimate sensitivity of single-ion detection below the ppq range has been demonstrated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"948726d5a925414d02026aac23d3c39876248eeb97766e6d3e7651f1bf9ee788","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
