{"title":"The Effect of Delayed Cranioplasty in Patient with Long-Term Disorders of Consciousness: Case Report and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0589/v1","date":1723131143000,"content":"Cranioplasty (CP) is the main surgical procedure aimed at reproducing a structural or morphological defect of the skull. It has been shown that cranioplasty can be useful for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to achieve functional cognitive and motor improvements. Here, we describe a patient with long-term severe TBI who recovered consciousness following delayed CP. We found that a delayed CP may result in a meaningful functional recovery with emergence from a minimally conscious state and recovery of functional communication, even more than a year after decompressive craniectomy. Delayed intervention is equally successful in promoting functional recovery in long-term TBI patients, as early CP has already shown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8650a817b173a138c06eec299232e5dcab13fe851ca3213ca08c1ccf9c1d51e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
