{"title":"Electroencephalogram Criticality in Cognitive Impairment: A Monitoring Biomarker?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1643/v1","date":1711517942000,"content":"Background: Critical states present scale-free dynamics, optimizing neuronal complexity. We explored electroencephalogram (EEG) criticality in amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) patients with clinical improvement in working memory, verbal memory, verbal fluency and overall executive functions after the completion of a 6-month prospective memory training. (2) Methods: We compared “before” and “after” stationary resting-state EEG records of right-handed MCI patients (n = 17; 11 females), using the method of critical fluctuations and Haar wavelet analysis. (3) Results: Significant criticality enhancement was present in frontotemporal electrodes [mean dif: 0.10; Z = 7, p = .019] and isolated electrodes T6 [mean dif: 0.204; t (10) = - 2.3, p = .044] and F4 [mean dif: 0.0194; t (10) = - 2.82; p = .018]. (4) Conclusions: EEG criticality agreed with clinical improvement, consisting a possible monitoring biomarker in MCI and Alzheimer’s disease. Further evaluation is needed in patients under cognitive training or even drug-modifying therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba9edbcdfbf03cfbdeb847f450f4f251cd5c5fd1aefa281c12e61c17568a8219","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
