{"title":"Predictive Maintenance for Critical Infrastructure Security","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0413/v1","date":1725594532000,"content":"Predictive maintenance (PdM) represents a transformative approach to ensuring the security and reliability of critical infrastructure systems. This proactive maintenance strategy leverages advanced data analytics, machine learning, and sensor technology to anticipate and address potential failures before they occur. By continuously monitoring the health of infrastructure components and analyzing performance data, predictive maintenance enables timely interventions, minimizes unplanned downtimes, and enhances overall system resilience. This paper explores the application of predictive maintenance in safeguarding critical infrastructure, focusing on its impact on security, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Case studies demonstrate how PdM has been successfully implemented across various sectors, including transportation, energy, and utilities, highlighting its role in mitigating risks and extending the lifespan of essential assets. The findings underscore the importance of integrating predictive maintenance into security strategies to protect vital infrastructure from emerging threats and ensure uninterrupted service delivery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6aa1d457a289dae56494691100debe79a6d649d147cb1b26532a0b5c93c2daae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
