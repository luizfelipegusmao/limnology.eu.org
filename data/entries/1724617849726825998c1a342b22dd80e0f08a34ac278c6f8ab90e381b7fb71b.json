{"title":"High Prevalence of Myositis-Specific and Associated Antibodies in Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0959/v1","date":1715685013000,"content":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious condition linked to immune-system dysfunction. Myositis-specific/associated antibodies (MSA/MAA) play a role in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and interstitial lung disease (ILD), but their significance in PH remains unclear. We believe the presence of these antibodies, may be underestimated. This study analyzed adult PH patients without pre-existing IIM for MSA/MAA prevalence using a line-blot assay. We compared PH patients with and without ILD signs to a cohort clinically suspected of IIM/ILD (n=558). Our PH cohort (n=121) showed a significantly higher prevalence of overall weak positive MSA/MAAs and positive overlap syndrome-associated MAAs than the suspected IIM/ILD group (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1724617849726825998c1a342b22dd80e0f08a34ac278c6f8ab90e381b7fb71b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
