Gaertn) is a fruit tree of domestic and industrial importance in arid and semi-arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. Fruit set is largely dependent on insect pollination but recent studies have revealed a pollen deficit. The introduction of managed bees into orchards is an effective approach for enhanced pollination services in temperate climates. However, there is limited information to guide the adoption of this practice in agroforestry parklands.\n\nThis study investigated the effect of managed honey bee colonies (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) on fruit yield of shea in six parklands across three regions of Ghana.\n\nTree proximity to the apiary had a detectable effect on fruit set within a 500 m range of the apiary. Proximity of shea trees to apiary was significantly related to number of immature fruit set but not number of mature fruits. Fruit weight and size were not significantly related to distance from apiary or pollination treatment.\n\nThis implies that the introduction of beekeeping has the potential to address shea pollination deficit at least within a 500 m range of the apiary. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal hive density per acreage of shea parkland to maximise pollination services.\n</p>","author":"Latif Iddrisu Nasare, \nJane C.
