{"title":"Factors related to the intention of choosing shared E-scooters for metro transfer: A survey study integrating weather perception into satisfaction evaluation from Changsha","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309953","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Chenyue Lin, Xingjian Xue, Zhixuan Zhu, Yue Luo, Rui Song</p>\r\n\r\nShared E-scooter (SE) travel is a low-carbon transportation method that can be further enhanced by integrating with metro systems. This study aims to quantify the impact of the built environment, attitude preferences, weather perception, and other factors on the evaluation and intention to use the \"SE-metro transfer\" travel mode, as well as how to efficiently and concisely measure and model these effects. Empirical analysis was conducted using questionnaire data from Changsha, China, with 683 participants surveyed. Three satisfaction models were established and compared based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and an optimal M2 model was expanded to incorporate users’ subjective perceptions of weather, proposing a method to simplify questionnaire length. The study found that well-designed vehicles and infrastructure, along with necessary supporting facilities, play important roles in enhancing SE usage. However, there are still many areas for optimization in Changsha’s SE policies. Despite the advantages of SE in terrain and physical fitness, which have significantly expanded and changed their user base compared to traditional shared bicycles, there is still much potential to adapt to the middle-aged and older user groups. The results of this study can provide valuable insights for professionals and government officials in designing systems, constructing infrastructure, and formulating policies.","author":"Chenyue Lin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c7d771f0d4745cc989393f015c3c751c5bbe019c62da2f8540f013d6196d5fac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
