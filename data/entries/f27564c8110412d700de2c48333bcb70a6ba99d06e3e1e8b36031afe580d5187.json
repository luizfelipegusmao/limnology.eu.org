{"title":"Assessment of Pharmacological Adherence Using Mobile Applications in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1907/v1","date":1721816821000,"content":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition that significantly impacts both patients and healthcare systems. The management of COPD involves various pharmacological intervention strategies, and addressing the issue of low adherence to these strategies has become a subject of significant interest. In response to this concern, there has been a shift towards utilizing telemedicine and mobile applications. The primary objective of this scoping review is to delineate the usage of mobile applications to enhance pharmacological therapeutic adherence in adult patients with COPD. The study involved a search of databases such as Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrial.gov, focusing on literature published in English and Spanish over the last decade. The selected studies assessed interventions involving mobile applications (mobile apps) designed to improve pharmacological adherence. Four digital aids were identified, available on online platforms, mobile apps, or both: m-PAC, myCOPD, Wellinks mHealth, and Propeller Health. Pro-peller Health, in particular, is an app that directly measures pharmacological adherence through electronic medication monitors attached to participants' inhalers. Opening the app was associated with higher odds of using control medications compared to participants who did not open the app. The findings suggest that these digital interventions serve as valuable tools to enhance patient adherence to treatment. Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of different digital devices, such as digital inhalers and mobile applications, that directly measure pharmacological adherence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f27564c8110412d700de2c48333bcb70a6ba99d06e3e1e8b36031afe580d5187","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
