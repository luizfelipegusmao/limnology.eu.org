{"title":"Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone and Food-Intake in Mammals: An Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0538/v1","date":1715262516000,"content":"Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH; pGlu-His-Pro-NH2) is an intercellular signal produced mainly by neurons. Among the multiple pharmacological effects of TRH, that on food-intake is not well understood. We review data that show that peripheral injection of TRH generally produces a transient anorexic effect, discuss the pathways that might initiate this effect, and explain its short half-life. In addition, central administration of TRH can produce anorexic or orexigenic effects, depending on the site of injection, that are likely due to interaction with TRH receptor 1. Anorexic effects are most notable when TRH is injected into the hypothalamus and the nucleus accumbens, while the orexigenic effect has only been detected by injection into the brain stem. Functional evidence suggests that TRH neurons that are prime candidate vectors for TRH action on food-intake include the caudal raphe nuclei projecting to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and possibly TRH neurons from the tuberal lateral hypothalamus projecting to the tuberomammillary nuclei. For other TRH neurons, the anatomical or physiological context and impact of TRH in each synaptic domain are still poorly understood. The manipulation of TRH expression in well-defined neuron types will facilitate the discovery of its role in food-intake control in each anatomical scene.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7abf80af2495236c99d1e40bd88b4d8f5cc064925fb9869bc85bd6bedac144a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
