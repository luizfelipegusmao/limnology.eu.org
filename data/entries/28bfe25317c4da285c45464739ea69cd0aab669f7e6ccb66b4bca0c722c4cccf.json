{"title":"Production Planning for Manufacturing of Car Parts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2218/v1","date":1725009373000,"content":"Production planning managers need much information within the organization to create the best production plan. This information is scattered throughout the organization. The planning unit must gather data from sales orders and specified priorities, and use information from production capacity assessments, in-line inventory levels, and many other variables to develop a reliable production plan. This research aims to examine the production planning system at a car part manufacturing company, diagnose the current issues in this area, and endeavor to develop a hierarchical production planning model at the AP levels for the company through a mixed-integer linear programming model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28bfe25317c4da285c45464739ea69cd0aab669f7e6ccb66b4bca0c722c4cccf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
