{"title":"Serological Evidence of Antibodies to West Nile Virus in Wild Birds in Portugal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0286/v1","date":1714982278000,"content":"Emerging infectious diseases are a major threat to biodiversity and an important public health issue. West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging vector-borne zoonotic arbovirus that is currently broadening its distribution in Europe. The evidence of WNV circulating in resident and migratory species has implications for both animal and public health, and should therefore be studied in depth. An integrated surveillance program, namely in birds, is essential for reducing the risk of infection in human populations within the One Health principles. In the present study, wild birds admitted to wildlife rehabilitation centres in Portugal were sampled. Two-hundred and eight blood samples were assayed serologically to antibodies to WNV, by using a commercial ELISA kit. An overall seroprevalence of 19.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.7-26.7%) was observed. Antibodies to WNV were detected in 13 (35.1%) different species of wild birds. Accipitriformes (26.7%; 95% CI: 18.5-36.2%) and Strigiformes (26.7%; 95% CI: 14.6-42.0%) were the orders with the highest seroprevalence recorded. There were no statistically significant differences (p = 0.725) between the geographical regions (NUTS II) studied, but statistically significant difference (p = 0.017) was found between gender (male: 34.4%; female: 4.8%). A higher seroprevalence was found in adults (32.1%) compared to juvenile birds (9.3%) (p = 0.014), and age was considered a risk factor to WNV infection in wild birds (odds ratio 1.4; 95% CI: 0.5–4.0). More epidemiological studies are needed in Portugal, since the actual spread of the WNV throughout the country is unknown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3415db9f24ce39b20634a2180b545cd519b2ed56bb955b62e2c550d4a5d64a35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
