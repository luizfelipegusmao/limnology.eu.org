{"title":"Hyphae of the fungus <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> demonstrate chemotropism to nutrients and pH","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002726","date":1722348000000,"content":"<p>by Riho Yamamoto, Hinata Miki, Ayaka Itani, Norio Takeshita</p>\r\n\r\nThe importance of fungi in ecological systems and pathogenicity hinges on their ability to search for nutrients, substrates, and hosts. Despite this, the question of whether fungal hyphae exhibit chemotropism toward them remains largely unresolved and requires close examination at the cellular level. Here, we designed a microfluidic device to assess hyphal chemotropism of <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> in response to carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as pH. Within this device, hyphae could determine their growth direction in a two-layer flow with distinct compositions that were adjacent but non-mixing. Under conditions with and without a carbon source, hyphae changed growth direction to remain in the presence of a carbon source, but it was still difficult to distinguish between differences in growth and chemotropism. Although nitrogen sources such as ammonia and nitrate are important for growth, the hyphae indicated negative chemotropism to avoid them depending on the specific transporters. This fungus grows equally well at the colony level in the pH range of 4 to 9, but the hyphae exhibited chemotropism to acidic pH. The proton pump PmaA is vital for the chemotropism to acid pH, while the master regulatory for pH adaptation PacC is not involved, suggesting that chemotropism and adaptive growth via gene expression regulation are distinct regulatory mechanisms. Despite various plasma membrane transporters are distributed across membranes except at the hyphal tip, the control of growth direction occurs at the tip. Finally, we explored the mechanisms linking these two phenomena, tip growth and chemotropism.","author":"Riho Yamamoto","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"4aba955ecdd7ee1ee1d7badb63690f311aa06ca3219e144c89ecfbe9d3f82b61","category":"Environment"}
