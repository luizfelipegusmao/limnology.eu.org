{"title":"Palestinian university students’ perspectives on COVID-19 risk and remote learning during the pandemic: A qualitative photovoice study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311972","date":1728655200000,"content":"<p>by Mohammed B. A. Sarhan, Hanin Basha, Rita Giacaman, Masamine Jimba, Rika Fujiya</p>\r\nBackground <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered major changes worldwide, with repercussions on mental health and education. The present study primarily aimed to retrospectively explore undergraduate students’ risk perceptions of COVID-19 and their experiences with remote learning during the pandemic, with an emphasis on their high school years.</p> Methods <p>This qualitative photovoice study was conducted between 30 March and 4 May 2023. The target population of this study was first- and second-year undergraduate students who had been in high school during the pandemic. Maximum variation, snowball, and convenience sampling methods were used to recruit students. They were asked to share photos and provide comments in written or voice messages explaining their experiences during the pandemic. Voice messages were manually transcribed verbatim. A manual content analysis of these comments was performed to derive the codes and themes relevant to the study objectives.</p> Results <p>Forty-seven students initially agreed to participate and signed an informed consent form. However, the final sample included 16 students (nine men and seven women). The content analysis revealed four themes that were identified as the main factors contributing to high school students’ risk perceptions of COVID-19. The first theme was psychosocial factors related to the pandemic, including emotions, isolation and stress. The second focused on the mechanisms used to cope with the pandemic. The third theme included beliefs and behaviours that either increased or decreased COVID-19 risk. The final theme addressed schools’ responses to COVID-19, including factors such as maintaining connections with schools, preventive measures and the transition to remote learning.</p> Conclusion <p>This study highlighted the extensive impact of the pandemic on Palestinian high school students, demanding instantaneous adaptation to ensure their safety and well-being while maintaining the quality of education. Remote learning has become an important strategy with opportunities and challenges for high school students.</p>","author":"Mohammed B. A.
