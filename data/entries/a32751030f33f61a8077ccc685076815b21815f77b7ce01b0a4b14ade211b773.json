{"title":"Evolution and Trends in Digital Wallet Research: A Bibliometric Analysis in Scopus and Web Of Science","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1846/v1","date":1724749569000,"content":"A significant part of the global economy is focused on financial technologies, such as digital wallets, a rapidly growing sector. In 2020, 2.4 billion people used digital banking services globally, and this figure is projected to rise to 3.6 billion by 2026. This study aims to evaluate the current state and future trends in research on digital wallets using scientific databases. The methodology employed was a scoping review that analyzed 778 documents after the eligibility process. The terms used were “digital wallet,” “mobile wallet,” and “e-wallet.” Results indicate that India, the United States, and China lead in digital wallet research. Factors such as data security, ease of use, and integration with traditional payment systems significantly influence the adoption of digital wallets. Despite numerous studies, this article provides the first in-depth bibliometric analysis using Scopus and Web of Science. There has been an exponential research increase over the last decade, with a shift towards technological adoption and innovation. Less developed but key topics such as “digital wallets,” “blockchain,” and “block-chain” are fundamental yet have potential for further development. Driving themes like “electronic money,” “e-wallet,” and “electronic commerce” are central and highly developed, indicating their relevance and high research activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a32751030f33f61a8077ccc685076815b21815f77b7ce01b0a4b14ade211b773","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
