Although the incidence is decreasing in developed countries, treatment results are still unsatisfactory. The standard treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) is gastrectomy with perioperative chemotherapy.\nAim: \nAssessment of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) in chemoresistance in archival material from LAGC.\nMaterial and method: \nThe research group consisted of archival material from 10 patients with LAGC. Histological material from each patient was used from a biopsy performed during gastroscopy and after surgery preceded by 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) according to the FLOT or FLO regimen. The expression of selected miRNAs was assessed in the tissue material, such as miRNA-21-3p, miRNA-21-5p, miRNA-106a-5p, miRNA-122-3p, miRNA-122-5p, miRNA-143-3p, miRNA-143-5p, miRNA-203a-3p, miRNA-203-5p, miRNA-551b-3p, miRNA-551b-5p and miRNA-574-3p. miRNA expression was assessed by quantitative chain reaction polymerase reverse transcriptase (qRT-PCR). The response to NAC was assessed by computed tomography of the abdomen, chest and histopathology after gastrectomy. The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.The significance limit was set at p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9dd1e83de4e05ac30af3aa806210480dae51fb241a8311ecf4d3d51b23074f40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
