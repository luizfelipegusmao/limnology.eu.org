Additionally, <i>Engraulis poorawah</i> Bleeker, 1872, a nominal species previously regarded as a junior synonym of <i>T. mystax</i>, is recognized as a junior synonym of <i>Thrissina malabarica</i> (Bloch, 1795). Diagnoses and detailed color descriptions are given for all of the valid species, in addition to clarification of their taxonomic histories, and neotype designation for <i>T. porava.</i> The phylogenetic relationships among 15 species of <i>Thrissina</i> (including <i>T. porava</i> and <i>T. valenciennesi</i> but not <i>T. mystax</i>) were reconstructed from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. <i>T. porava</i> and <i>T. valenciennesi</i> were not recovered as a monophyletic group, instead being divergent from each other and the other species of <i>Thrissina</i> by 12.4% and &gt;11.7% mean uncorrected distances, respectively, confirming their reciprocal validity.</p>","author":"Harutaka Hata, \nSébastien Lavoué","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"e633bb453b4c3e408e74d4b6787e490282979662fb8cf6a215e1c30b9a9fafea","category":"Environment"}
