{"title":"Identification and Molecular Characterization of the Human GcMAF Receptor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0455/v1","date":1717741512000,"content":"This study proposes the first extracellular domain (residues 1-34) of the CCR1 protein as the Gc protein-derived Macrophage Activating Factor (GcMAF) receptor. The CCR1 gene, expressed in monocytes and 168 other cell types or tissues, encodes this transmembrane protein. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, along with hydrogen bonds mediate the molecular interactions between the TPT420-GalNAcELAK (or TPK420ELAK) sequences of GcMAF (or Gc2 protein variant) and the TTEDYDTTT sequence of its receptor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c89376559c1b8d213a463ef4e5d19dc2cb5388a521a4a3d31889305838b99572","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
