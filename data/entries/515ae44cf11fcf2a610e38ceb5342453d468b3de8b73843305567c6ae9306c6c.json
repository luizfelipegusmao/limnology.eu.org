K. Tine</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>In Senegal, the widespread use of vector control measures has resulted in a significant reduction in the malaria burden and led the country to consider the possibility of elimination. Given this shift and changing context, it is important to characterize the malaria burden across all age groups to guide decision-making on programmatic interventions to interrupt transmission and ultimately eradicate the disease. In Senegal, there is a lack of information on malaria prevalence among certain populations, particularly among adolescents and adults. This study sought to assess the magnitude of malaria infections in all age groups, as well as malaria associated factors in an area of persistent transmission in Senegal.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in four health posts (Khossanto, Mamakhona, Diakhaling and Sambrambougou), of the health district of Saraya, in November 2021, among individuals over 6 months of age. Households were selected using multistage sampling. Consented participants were screened for malaria parasites by microscopic examination of blood smears, and hemoglobin levels were measured using the Hemocue HB 301<sup>TM</sup> analyzer. Socio-demographic information of the participants, household heads, household assets, and information on ownership and use of preventive measures were collected using a structured questionnaire. Weighted generalized mixed effects logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with microscopically confirmed malaria infection.</p> Results <p>A total of 1759 participants were enrolled in the study. Overall, about 21% of participants were classified as having <i>Plasmodium</i> infection; children aged 5–10 years old (26.6%), adolescents aged 10–19 years old (24.7%), and children under five years of age (20.5%) had higher rates of infection compared to adults (13.5%). <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> accounted for 99.2% of the malaria infections, and most infections (69%) were asymptomatic. Around one-third of study participants had anemia (hemoglobin level &lt;11.0 g/dl), with under five children bearing the highest burden (67.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that the odds of having a malaria infection were around 2 times higher among participants in Khossanto compared to Diakhaling (aOR = 1.84, 95% CI:1.06–3.20). Participants aged 5–9 years were more likely to have malaria infection compared to under five children (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI:1.02–1.91). Factors associated with anemia were <i>P. falciparum</i> infection (aOR = 1.36, p = 0.027), females (aOR = 2.16, p = 0.000), under-five age group (aOR = 13.01, p = 0.000).</p> Conclusion <p>Malaria burden was considerable among adolescents and under ten children living in an area of persistent transmission, with adolescents more commonly presenting as asymptomatic. Interventions tailored to this specific group of the population are needed to better control the disease and reduce its burden.</p>","author":"Fassiatou Tairou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"515ae44cf11fcf2a610e38ceb5342453d468b3de8b73843305567c6ae9306c6c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
