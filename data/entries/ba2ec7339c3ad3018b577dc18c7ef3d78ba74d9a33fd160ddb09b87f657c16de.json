{"title":"Some Properties of Thermo-Treated Ash Wood","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1453/v1","date":1721219959000,"content":"The purpose of this work is to analyze heat-treated ash wood at temperature of 185 ÂºC, in order to analyze its dimensional stability. For comparison, native ash/ not thermally treated wood, was be used. In order to analyze heat-treated ash wood, some main properties such as water absorption, swelling in thickness, roughness, Brinell hardness, modulus of rupture and elasticity, color change toward black with CIELab space, and many others properties were determined and processed. The results obtained after processing the experimental data have showed that heat-treated ash wood had good physical properties as absorption and swelling in thickness, and the slight increase in elasticity offers new fields of use. As a general conclusion of the work, it was established that the ash wood can be properly thermally treated, the dimensional stability characteristics being very good, and the decrease in bending resistance being almost imperceptible.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba2ec7339c3ad3018b577dc18c7ef3d78ba74d9a33fd160ddb09b87f657c16de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
