{"title":"Enhancing Clinical Reasoning with Virtual Patients: A Hybrid Systematic Review Combining Human Reviewers and ChatGPT","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1589/v1","date":1726979500000,"content":"This study presents a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual patients in enhancing clinical reasoning skills in medical education, utilizing a hybrid methodology that combines human reviewers and ChatGPT. By analyzing various studies involving conversational virtual patients, the review examines the impact of these digital tools on student learning outcomes and satisfaction. Consistent with previous systematic reviews, our findings suggest that conversational virtual patients can improve clinical competencies, particularly in history-taking and clinical reasoning. Regarding student feedback, satisfaction tends to be higher when virtual patients’ interactions are more realistic, often due to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) in the simulators. Furthermore, the study compares the accuracy of AI-driven reviews with human assessments, revealing comparable results. This research highlights AI’s potential to complement human expertise in academic evaluations, contributing to more efficient and consistent systematic reviews in rapidly evolving educational fields.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe3aa87e2b9b46b98571b2a33bbbff0ce9a18d7ed744a8fcd184cd3d498719a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
