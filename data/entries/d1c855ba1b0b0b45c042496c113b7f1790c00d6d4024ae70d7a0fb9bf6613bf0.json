{"title":"Dioxin-Induced PAI-1 Expression: A Novel Pathway to Pancreatic &beta;-Cell Failure in Type 2 Diabetes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1175/v1","date":1728976028000,"content":"Exposure to environment polluting chemicals (EPCs), which are ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study explores the mechanisms by which AhR ligands contribute to β-cell failure in T2D. Incubation of rat RINm5F pancreatic β-cells with low-dose 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent AhR ligand, inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). A single injection of TCDD in wild type mice reduced the size of Langerhans islets, but not in AhR liver knock-out mice (AhR-LKO). RNA-seq database analysis identified Serpine1, encoding for plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) as a TCDD-mediated secretory protein that are synthesized in an AhR-dependent manner in the liver. Elevated PAI-1 levels were shown to induce caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis in RINm5F cells, suggesting a novel pathway through which EPCs exacerbate T2D. These findings support the hypothesis that chronic exposure to AhR ligands may directly inhibit GSIS in pan-creatic β-cells and indirectly induced β-cell apoptosis through increased PAI-1. This study provides new insights into the EPC-PAI-1 axis as a missing link between pancreatic β-cell failure and the progression of T2D and offers a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1c855ba1b0b0b45c042496c113b7f1790c00d6d4024ae70d7a0fb9bf6613bf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
