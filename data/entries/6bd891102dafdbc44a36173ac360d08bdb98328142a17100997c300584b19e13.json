{"title":"The Mother's Day Solar Storm of 11 May 2024 and Its Effect on Earth's Radiation Belts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1134/v1","date":1726303114000,"content":"The month of May 2024 was characterized by solar energetic particles events directed towards the Earth, especially the big event causing a strong terrestrial geomagnetic storm during the night from 10 to 11 May 2024, with auroras observed everywhere in Europe. This was the strongest storm for the last 20 years with a Dst &lt; -400 nT. In the present work, we show with observations of GOES, PROBA-V/EPT and MetOP/MEPED that this exceptional event was associated with the injection of energetic protons in the proton radiation belt, with important consequences for the South part of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). In addition, the geomagnetic storm caused by the solar eruption has had tremendous impacts on the electron radiation belts. Indeed, we show that for 0.3 to 1 MeV electrons, the storm led to a long lasting four belts configuration which was not observed before with EPT launched in 2013, until a smaller geomagnetic storm on June 15 took place. Moreover, for the first time since its launch, observations of the EPT show that ultra-relativistic electrons with E&gt;2 MeV have been injected into the inner belt until L=2.4, violating the impenetrable barrier previously estimated to be located at L=2.8.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bd891102dafdbc44a36173ac360d08bdb98328142a17100997c300584b19e13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
