However, blue-flowered Meconopsis (M. betonicifolia) is becoming increasingly scarce due to overharvesting. As a potential alternative, yellow-flowered Meconopsis (M. integrifolia) shows promise but requires comprehensive characterization. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the anti-inflammatory potential of yellow- and blue-flowered Meconopsis species.\nMethods: LC-MS was used to analyze the chemical profiles of yellow- and blue-flowered Meconopsis. Putative targets of shared constituents were subjected to GO and disease enrichment analysis. The LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage model was employed to assess anti-inflammatory effects. Metabolomics was applied to gain mechanistic insights.\nResults: LC-MS revealed over 70% chemical similarity between species. Enrichment analysis associated targets with inflammation-related pathways. In macrophage assays, both species demonstrated dose-dependent anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities, with yellow Meconopsis exhibiting superior efficacy. Metabolomics showed modulation of key inflammatory metabolic pathways.\nConclusions: This integrative study validated yellow-flowered Meconopsis as a credible alternative to its blue-flowered counterpart for anti-inflammatory applications. Metabolic profiling provided initial clues regarding their multi-targeted modes of action, highlighting clinical relevance and potential for sustainable utilization and biodiversity conservation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc177b7056cc02519c3ecf897cbe8341bf470810cacc7316d7caa6022d557f0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
