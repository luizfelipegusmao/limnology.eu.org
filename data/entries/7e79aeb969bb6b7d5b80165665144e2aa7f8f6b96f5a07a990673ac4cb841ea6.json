{"title":"Imaging lifespan brain structural growth: From region, to connectome, to gradient","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002669","date":1718978400000,"content":"<p>by Xing Qian, Juan Helen Zhou</p>\r\n\r\nThroughout human life, the brain undergoes intricate structural changes that support cognition. A study in PLOS Biology introduces new avenues for depicting the trajectory of the brain morphometric connectome and its underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms.\r\n\r\nDuring development and aging the brain undergoes intricate structural changes. This Primer explores the implications of a new study in PLOS Biology, which provides a detailed characterization of how the brainâ€™s morphometric organization changes throughout the human lifespan to support cognition.","author":"Xing Qian","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"7e79aeb969bb6b7d5b80165665144e2aa7f8f6b96f5a07a990673ac4cb841ea6","category":"Environment"}
