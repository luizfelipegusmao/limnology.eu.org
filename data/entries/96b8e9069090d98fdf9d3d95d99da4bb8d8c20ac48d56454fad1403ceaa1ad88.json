{"title":"Unraveling the Complexity: A Systematic Review of Atrial Fibrillation in Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1966/v1","date":1714457466000,"content":"In our exploration of percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR) alongside conditions like atrial fibrillation (AF), we uncover a fascinating and complex relationship that significantly impacts patient outcomes. Our journey through various studies, including patient registries, meta-analyses, and cohort investigations, reveals the intricate interplay between AF and PMVR. Despite the advancements in PMVR techniques, AF adds layers of complexity, influencing procedural success rates, long-term clinical outcomes, and post-operative complications. While some studies suggest that AF may not heavily affect short-term results, others highlight its association with increased risks of mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and post-PMVR adverse events. Our exploration also delves into the anatomical and remodeling changes induced by PMVR, shedding light on the importance of understanding how AF interacts with cardiac chamber remodeling. Along the way, we acknowledge the limitations inherent in such research, including data variability, publication bias, and potential confounding factors, urging a cautious approach to interpreting findings. Through this review, we offer valuable insights into the challenges and considerations surrounding AF in the context of PMVR. Our hope is that these insights will guide clinicians and researchers as they navigate this complex landscape, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes in the realm of mitral valve repair","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96b8e9069090d98fdf9d3d95d99da4bb8d8c20ac48d56454fad1403ceaa1ad88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
