The purpose of this study is to investigate the regulation of mmu-let-7a-5p on macrophages apoptosis and its effect on intracellular BCG clearance. After a series of in vitro experiments, we found that mmu-let-7a-5p could negatively regulate the apoptosis of macrophages by targeting Caspase-3. The extrinsic apoptosis signal axis TNFR1/FADD/Caspase-8/Caspase-3 was inhibited after BCG infection. Up-regulated the expression level of mmu-let-7a-5p increase the cell proliferation viability and inhibit apoptosis rate of macrophages, but down-regulated its level could apparently reduce the bacterial load of intracellular Mycobacteria and accelerate the clearance of residual Mycobacteria effectively. Mmu-let-7a-5p has great potential to be utilized as an optimal candidate exosomal loaded miRNA for anti-tuberculosis immunotherapy in our subsequent research.","author":"Xuehua Zhan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"642139a34d9cc89ce64924dec1ee0eaf7f54bbcd59e5082a84f6449750d58529","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
