We aimed to apply self-supervised learning using masked autoencoders (MAEs) to improve the performance of the 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) analysis model using limited ECG data. We pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) models by reconstructing the masked ECG data with MAE. We fine-tuned this MAE-based ECG pretrained model on ECG-echocardiography data from The University of Tokyo Hospital (UTokyo) for the detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and then evaluated it using multi-center external validation data from seven institutions, employing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for assessment. We included 38,245 ECG-echocardiography pairs from UTokyo and 229,439 pairs from all institutions. The performances of MAE-based ECG models pretrained using ECG data from UTokyo were significantly higher than that of other Deep Neural Network models across all external validation cohorts (AUROC, 0.913â€“0.962 for LVSD, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, we also found improvements for the MAE-based ECG analysis model depending on the model capacity and the amount of training data. Additionally, the MAE-based ECG analysis model maintained high performance even on the ECG benchmark dataset (PTB-XL). Our proposed method developed high performance MAE-based ECG analysis models using limited ECG data.","author":"Shinnosuke Sawano","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"256681f726e84b0ca93f66f5b7737d964789219629c1ba63d323a2e3ef7b2a34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
