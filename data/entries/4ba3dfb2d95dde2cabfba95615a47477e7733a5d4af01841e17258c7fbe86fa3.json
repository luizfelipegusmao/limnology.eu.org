{"title":"Investigating the Fatigue Response of Cathodically Charged Cold-Finished Mild Steel to Varied Hydrogen Concentrations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2231/v1","date":1722324349000,"content":"This study investigates the fatigue behavior of cold-finished mild steel subjected to electrochemical hydrogen charging under controlled conditions. Samples were hydrogenated at constant time in a fixed electrolyte pH after which they underwent fatigue testing under constant loading condition with fixed frequency. The primary objective was to assess the impact of varying hydrogen permeation levels on the number of cycles to failure. The experimental results revealed a complex relationship between hydrogen concentration and fatigue life. Initially, as hydrogen permeation increased, the number of cycles to failure substantially decreased, demonstrating a detrimental effect of diffused hydrogen on fatigue resistance of samples. This decline in fatigue life was attributed to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) phenomena, which collectively facilitate crack initiation and propagation. However, at high hydrogen concentrations, an unexpected increase in number of cycles to failure was observed suggesting the existence of a threshold hydrogen concentration beyond which the fatigue mechanisms may be altered, potentially due to saturation of hydrogen-related defects and mechanisms such as Hydrogen Enhance Localized Plasticity (HELP). The insights gained from this research have significant implications for the material's application in hydrogen-rich environments, such as those encountered in the energy and transportation industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ba3dfb2d95dde2cabfba95615a47477e7733a5d4af01841e17258c7fbe86fa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
