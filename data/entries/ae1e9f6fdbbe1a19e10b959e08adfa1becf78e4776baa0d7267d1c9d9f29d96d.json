Of all superconductors, it exhibits the highest lower critical field, H<sub>c1</sub>(0) ≈ 180 mT and the longest coherence length, ξ_Nb(0) ≈ 40 nm. Additionally, it is a highly ductile soft metal which makes machining and forming complex geometries for radio frequency (RF) resonators straightforward. These unique properties have made niobium an enabling material for superconducting accelerators and quantum applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.703-B2\">2-3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ae1e9f6fdbbe1a19e10b959e08adfa1becf78e4776baa0d7267d1c9d9f29d96d","category":"Environment"}
