{"title":"The fungicidal effectiveness of 2-Chloro-3-hydrazinylquinoxaline, a newly developed quinoxaline derivative, against Candida species","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303373","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Abdelbagi Alfadil, Karem A. Ibrahem, Mohammad W. Alrabia, Jawahir A. Mokhtar, Hafsa Ahmed</p>\r\nBackground <p>Candida represents a prevalent fungal infection, notable for its substantial implications on morbidity and mortality rates. In the landscape of prospective treatments, quinoxaline derivatives emerge as a category of compact compounds exhibiting notable potential in addressing infections. These derivatives showcase promising antimicrobial efficacy coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic and safety characteristics.</p> Aims <p>The central aim of this investigation was to examine the antifungal characteristics of 2-Chloro-3-hydrazinylquinoxaline against diverse strains of <i>Candida</i> and <i>Aspergillus in vitro</i>. Additionally, we endeavored to assess the <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of 2-Chloro-3-hydrazinylquinoxaline using a murine model for oral candidiasis induced by <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> cells ATCC 10231.</p> Results <p>2-Chloro-3-hydrazinylquinoxaline demonstrated noteworthy effectiveness when tested against various reference strains of <i>Candida</i> species. It exhibited heightened efficacy, particularly against <i>Candida krusei</i> isolates. However, its performance against <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Candida tropicalis</i>, <i>Candida glabrata</i>, <i>Candida parapsilosis</i>, and <i>Candida auris</i> isolates exhibited variability. Notably, 2-Chloro-3-hydrazinylquinoxaline manifests variable efficacy against <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> and <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> and no effect against <i>Aspergillus brasiliensis</i>. In a murine model, 2-Chloro-3-hydrazinylquinoxaline exhibited significant efficacy in combating the <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> cells ATCC 10231 strain, underscoring its potential as a viable treatment option.</p> Conclusion <p>2-Chloro-3-hydrazinylquinoxaline has demonstrated substantial potential in effectively addressing various <i>Candida</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i> species, showcasing dual attributes of antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. However, to attain a more comprehensive understanding of its therapeutic capabilities, further investigations, incorporating additional tests and experiments, are imperative.</p>","author":"Abdelbagi Alfadil","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"34e5f3120444390cb2985b804106bdd8db8a12f1cadbbf4562095d65de6731e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
