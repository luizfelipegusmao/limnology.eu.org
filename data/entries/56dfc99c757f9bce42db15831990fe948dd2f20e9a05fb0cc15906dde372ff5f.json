This research explores the development of the SWIF warehouse management system (WMS) using the Agile methodology, a departure from traditional software development approaches. Agile’s iterative and step-by-step approach facilitated a streamlined development process. It allowed for quick adjustments based on evolving needs and feedback from stakeholders. This resulted in a substantial decrease in development time and a noticeable improvement in the final product’s quality. The study emphasizes the positive effect of Agile on teamwork and customer satisfaction. Developers reported enhanced communication and collaboration, leading to a stronger sense of ownership and engagement. Customers expressed greater satisfaction with the features and functionalities delivered in stages. The successful implementation of Agile in SWIF’s development showcases its effectiveness in managing complex and ever-changing software development projects. The study encourages the adoption of Agile methodology for similar projects to boost responsiveness, quality, and overall project success.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56dfc99c757f9bce42db15831990fe948dd2f20e9a05fb0cc15906dde372ff5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
