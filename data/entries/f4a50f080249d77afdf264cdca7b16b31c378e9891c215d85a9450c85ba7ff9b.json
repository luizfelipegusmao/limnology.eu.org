The Goto Islands are located near Kyushu, a major island in the Japanese Archipelago. We have previously reported that the population of the Japanese Genji firefly, <span>Nipponoluciola cruciata</span>, inhabiting the Goto Islands displays a unique flashing pattern that is used for pre-mating communication between males and females, indicating the possibility of genetic isolation of the Goto Islands population from neighbouring <span>N. cruciata</span> populations. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the gene flow between the Goto Islands <span>N. cruciata</span> population and its neighbouring island populations by molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the mitochondrial DNA regions of cytochrome <span>c</span> oxidase subunit II and <span>ND5</span>, also coupled to genome-wide analysis of nuclear DNA single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our results suggested that the Goto Islands <span>N. cruciata</span> population is genetically isolated from other populations of this species. Nuclear DNA-based population analyses indicated gene flow between the populations inhabiting the Kyushu and Iki Islands, situated at a distance approximately equal to that between the Goto and Kyushu Islands. Therefore, the genetic isolation of the Goto Islands <span>N. cruciata</span> population is largely affected by flashing pattern behaviour, underlining an ongoing speciation process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"f4a50f080249d77afdf264cdca7b16b31c378e9891c215d85a9450c85ba7ff9b","category":"Environment"}
