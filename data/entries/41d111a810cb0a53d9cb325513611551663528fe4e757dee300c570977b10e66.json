The estimated largest displacements caused by the Mw 7.8 event are observed at station <em>ante</em> with an eastward component displacement of 31cm and at station <em>mly1</em> with a southward component displacement of 39cm. The displacements caused by the Mw 7.8 Pazarcik event show left-lateral displacements along the nodal plane, which is consistent with the focal mechanism. The largest displacements caused by the Mw 7.5 event are a westward component displacement of 450 cm and a northward component displacement of 97cm at the station <em>ekz1</em> which is only 6 km from the epicenter of the event. Based on high-rate GPS time series, the surface wave propagation of the Mw 7.8 Elbistan earthquake is preliminarily estimated at an overall speed of approximately 2.9 km/s, with a slightly higher speed of 3.1 km/s along the northeast direction and 3.0 km/s along the east direction. High-rate GPS measurements show a prominent advantage of temporal resolution for earthquake sequences with short intervals, and preliminary displacement estimates could be made with only a few hours of observations. The displacement estimation provides constraints for the inversion of the rupture process and seismic source mechanisms.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"41d111a810cb0a53d9cb325513611551663528fe4e757dee300c570977b10e66","category":"Environment"}
