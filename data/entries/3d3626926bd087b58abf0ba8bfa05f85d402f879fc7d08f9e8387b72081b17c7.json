{"title":"Molecular Targets for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2126/v1","date":1721991536000,"content":"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal forms of cancer, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10%. Despite advances in treatment modalities, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients remains poor, highlighting the urgent need for innovative approaches for early diagnosis and targeted therapies. In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer development and progression. This paper reviews the current knowledge of molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d3626926bd087b58abf0ba8bfa05f85d402f879fc7d08f9e8387b72081b17c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
