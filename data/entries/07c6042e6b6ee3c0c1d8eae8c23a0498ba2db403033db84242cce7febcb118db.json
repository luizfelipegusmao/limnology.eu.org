{"title":"The impact of multiple discrimination on labor misallocation of China: Based on fsQCA method","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308442","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Rongwang Guo, Jianxiu Wang, Yuntian You</p>\r\n\r\nDiscrimination in the labor market hinders efficient labor allocation, impeding socio-economic health. With the rapid population aging in China, addressing multifaceted discrimination to enhance labor allocation efficiency emerges as a crucial area of research. To explore the relationship between five types of discrimination (age, gender, hukou, educational background, and occupation) and labor misallocation, this paper based on intersectionality theory, employs the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) method to conduct a configurational analysis of data from China. The research findings indicate that none of the five forms of discrimination can be deemed a necessary condition for achieving high-level labor misallocation. The study identifies five distinct pathways of multiple discrimination to form high-level labor misallocation, which can be classified into four interaction modes: age-hukou, gender-hukou, gender-occupation, and age-gender-educational background. Meanwhile, there are four configuration paths for the absence of labor misallocation. This study reveals the intricate mechanisms by which multiple forms of discrimination contribute to labor misallocation in Chinaâ€™s labor market, and provides valuable insights for addressing employment discrimination and improving the efficiency of labor allocation.","author":"Rongwang Guo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"07c6042e6b6ee3c0c1d8eae8c23a0498ba2db403033db84242cce7febcb118db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
