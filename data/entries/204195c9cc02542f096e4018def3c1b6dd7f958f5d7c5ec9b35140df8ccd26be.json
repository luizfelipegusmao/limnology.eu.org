{"title":"Ethynylestradiol feminizes gene expression partly in testis developing as ovotestis and disrupts asymmetric Müllerian duct development by eliminating asymmetric gene expression in Japanese quail embryos","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/2/210/7634544?rss=1","date":1711324800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In avian embryos, xenoestrogens induce abnormalities in reproductive organs, particularly the testes and Müllerian ducts (MDs). However, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of ethynylestradiol (EE<sub>2</sub>) exposure on gene expression associated with reproductive organ development in Japanese quail embryos. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that the left testis containing ovary-like tissues following EE<sub>2</sub> exposure highly expressed the genes for steroidogenic enzymes (<span>P450scc</span>, <span>P45017α, lyase</span>, and <span>3β-HS</span>D) and estrogen receptor-β, compared to the right testis. No asymmetry was found in these gene expression without EE<sub>2</sub>. EE<sub>2</sub> induced hypertrophy in female MDs and suppressed atrophy in male MDs on both sides. RNA sequencing analysis of female MDs showed 1,366 differentially expressed genes between developing left MD and atrophied right MD in the absence of EE<sub>2</sub>, and these genes were enriched in Gene Ontology terms related to organogenesis, including cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, and angiogenesis. However, EE<sub>2</sub> reduced asymmetrically expressed genes to 21. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that genes promoting cell cycle progression and oncogenesis were more highly expressed in the left MD than in the right MD, but EE<sub>2</sub> eliminated such asymmetric gene expression by increasing levels on the right side. EE<sub>2</sub>-exposed males showed overexpression of these genes in both MDs. This study reveals part of the molecular basis of xenoestrogen-induced abnormalities in avian reproductive organs, where EE<sub>2</sub> may partly feminize gene expression in the left testis, developing as the ovotestis, and induce bilateral MD malformation by canceling asymmetric gene expression underlying MD development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"204195c9cc02542f096e4018def3c1b6dd7f958f5d7c5ec9b35140df8ccd26be","category":"Environment"}
