{"title":"Overcoming Waste Management Challenges in Costa Rica: Evaluating Practices, Government Initiatives, and Future Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0274/v5","date":1724378370000,"content":"Costa Rica, renowned for its environmental sustainability, faces a pressing waste management crisis that threatens its ecological and public health achievements. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of Costa Rica's waste management challenges, focusing on urban areas like San Jos√©, where nearly half of the nation's waste is generated. Key issues include insufficient landfill capacity, a low recycling rate of 9.6%, and significant regional disparities in waste practices. Employing a hybrid modeling approach with Linear Regression and ARIMA models, the study forecasts CO2e emissions and waste minimization trends from 2024 to 2050, highlighting the critical role of public participation and innovative waste management strategies.The introduction of a Waste Management Innovation Index allows for a comparative analysis, positioning Costa Rica against global leaders like Germany and South Korea, and identifying areas where significant improvements are needed. The study also incorporates stakeholder perspectives to reveal the complex interplay of cultural, economic, and regulatory factors influencing waste management policies.Findings indicate that despite government initiatives like the Environmental Health Route and the National Circular Economy Strategy, success has been limited, particularly in rural areas. The study underscores the necessity of enhancing infrastructure, launching targeted public education campaigns, and adopting advanced technologies such as AI and blockchain to achieve sustainable waste management. Strategic recommendations are provided to help Costa Rica align its waste management practices with global standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b4251588df2a66ca6375b91df44100483a1ba01869f8111ba2dbe04267114fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
