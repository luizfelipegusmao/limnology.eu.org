{"title":"Metabolic Reprogramming Induced by Aging Modifies the Tumor Microenvironment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1807/v1","date":1727097994000,"content":"Aging is the important risk factor for tumorigenesis. Metabolic reprogramming is hallmark of both aging and tumor initiation. However, how the crosstalk between aging and metabolic reprogramming affects the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote tumorigenesis was poorly explored. We utilized a computational approach proposed by our previous work, termed as MMP3C (Modeling Metabolic Plasticity by Pathway Pairwise Comparison), to depict age-related metabolic plasticity using pan-cancer bulk RNA-seq data. Through MMP3C analysis across 17 age-related cancer types, a high metabolic organized heterogeneity was found across those cancer types. Subsequent analysis revealed a higher degree of glycolysis and impaired oxidative phosphorylation in older patients. Similar phenomenon was also observed at the single cell resolution. Many energy generation pathways, i.e., TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation were weakened in activated T cells and macrophages, while it increased in exhausted T cells, immunosuppressive macrophages, and Tregs in older patients. It was suggested that aging-induced metabolic switches alter the utilization of glucose, thereby influencing immune function and resulting in the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. This study provides new insights into the associations between tumor metabolism and TME mediated by aging, linking with novel strategies for cancer therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7124869609ea0e684ff595dcd77b69026cc268366779350362b2065eb45efb17","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
