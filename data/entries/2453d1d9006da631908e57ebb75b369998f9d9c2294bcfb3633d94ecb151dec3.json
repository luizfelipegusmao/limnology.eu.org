{"title":"Neuroprotective Effects of Carotenoid Rich Verbesina encelioides Flower Extract in Scopolamine Induced Memory Impaired Rats Mimicking Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1767/v1","date":1711624551000,"content":"Neuron degeneration is the most common old age complications worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative condition with limited drug options and significant adverse effects. Hence, there is a growing interest in exploring natural products for their potential pharmacological activities against AD. This study investigates the efficacy of Verbesina encelioides flower extract (VFE) in alleviating neurobehavioral damage induced by Scopolamine in rat mimicking AD model. GC-MS analysis showed that V. encelioides flower extract is rich in carotenoids like spirilloxanthin. Various behavioural models were used to assess the rats' learning and memory capabilities. Additionally, biochemical tests were conducted on the AD rat models to evaluate oxidative stress in the brain, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), and anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme assays.  Findings from this study suggest that the VFE significantly improved the rats' cognitive aptitude and alleviated them from oxidative stress by reducing free radical generation. Based on the results obtained from GC-MS analysis, in silico interaction analysis of gingkolide A and spirilloxanthin with acetylcholinesterase was carried out. In summary, this study suggests that V. enceloides flower extract improves learning abilities and mitigates cognitive deficits caused by scopolamine. Thus V. enceloides could be potentially seen as  natural therapeutic intervention against neurodegenerative disorders likes Alzheimerâ€™s disease and dementia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2453d1d9006da631908e57ebb75b369998f9d9c2294bcfb3633d94ecb151dec3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
