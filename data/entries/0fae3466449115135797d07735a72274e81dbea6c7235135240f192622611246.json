The advent of 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) has opened up unprecedented opportunities for the enhanced characterization of defects. In this presentation, we will showcase two recent studies where we developed new 4D-STEM techniques to image point defects and planar defects in metals, uncovering the critical mechanisms of interaction between defects and extreme environments, such as metal under fatigue deformation and metal corrosion in molten salts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0fae3466449115135797d07735a72274e81dbea6c7235135240f192622611246","category":"Environment"}
