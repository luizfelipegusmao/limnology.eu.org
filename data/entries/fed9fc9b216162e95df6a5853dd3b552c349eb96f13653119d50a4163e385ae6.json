{"title":"Why Should Vaccines against Respiratory Diseases Go Mucosal? B Cell Epitope-Based Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0954/v1","date":1718282997000,"content":"Immunity against respiratory pathogens is often short-term, and consequently there is an unmet need for effective prevention of such infections. One such infectious disease is COVID-19, which is caused by the novel Beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that emerged around the end of 2019. The World Health Organization declared the illness a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and since then it has killed or sickened millions of people globally. The development of COVID-19 systemic vaccines, which impressively led to a significant reduction in disease severity, hospitalization, and mortality, con-tained the pandemic's expansion. However, these vaccines have not been able to stop the virus from spreading because of the restricted development of mucosal immunity. As a result, breakthrough infections have frequently occurred and new strains of the virus have been emerging. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 will likely continue to circulate and, like the influenza virus, co-exist with humans. The upper respiratory tract and nasal cavity are the primary sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus, a mucosal/nasal vaccination to induce a mucosal response and stop the virus transmission is warrant-ed. In this review, we present the status of the systemic vaccines, of the approved mucosal vaccines and those under evaluation in clinical trials. Furthermore, we present our approach of a B-cell pep-tide-based vaccination applied by prime-boost schedule for eliciting both systemic and mucosal immunity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fed9fc9b216162e95df6a5853dd3b552c349eb96f13653119d50a4163e385ae6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
