{"title":"Essential Oils as an Antifungal Alternative to Control Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Trichoderma spp. and Aspergillus spp.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1987/v1","date":1724834366000,"content":"Essential oils oregano (Origanum vulgare), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), thyme (Thymus), cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), basil (Ocimum basilicum), have antifungal properties. This study evaluated its ability to inhibit growth of isolated fungi and purified obtained from the rot of the banana peel, for the purpose of combating or inhibiting fungal growth in bananas (Musa paradisiaca). The methodology consists in preparing the dilutions to inoculate on PDA medium (Potato Dextrose Agar) amended with chloramphenicol to re-inoculate until obtaining the isolated and purified fungi of Trichoderma spp., Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp. and Fusarium spp., which are characterized macroscopically and microscopically, subsequently, the growth is analyzed in vivo and the inhibition percentage in vitro. The results of the analysis in vivo report that the fungi in order of severity from greatest to least, was Penicillium spp., Trichoderma spp, Fusarium spp. y Aspergillus spp., while that the analysis in vivo reports that the rosemary and the basil does not inhibit fungal growth, while that the clove inhibit a 800 ppm, the cinnamon to 400 ppm and the oregano to 200 ppm to the four fungi. -2077601433541Citation: To be added by editorial staff during production.
