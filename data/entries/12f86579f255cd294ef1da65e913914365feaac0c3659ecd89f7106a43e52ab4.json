{"title":"An introduction to key ecological concepts, financial opportunities, and risks underpinning aspirations for nature positive","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/7/450/7724749?rss=1","date":1722384000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Global biodiversity is in decline, and businesses and society are being required to urgently create new operating models to ameliorate the crisis. Among the strategies proposed to do this, implementing the concept of nature positive has captured worldwide attention. Critical to its success will be effective collaboration between ecologists and businesspeople, driven by a shared understanding of key nature positive terminology, concepts, and risks. To this end, we introduce three core aspects: the ecological concepts in the definition of <span>nature positive</span> (health, abundance, diversity, and resilience), a typology of financial instruments that may be applied to achieving nature positive, and an overview of risks to biodiversity and society. The pivotal findings include that ecological complexity and uncertainty belie the simplicity of the definition of <span>nature positive</span> and that managing risk requires embedding aspirations into existing and emerging biodiversity conservation and restoration science and policy. Although it is challenging, nature positive deserves pursuit.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"12f86579f255cd294ef1da65e913914365feaac0c3659ecd89f7106a43e52ab4","category":"Environment"}
