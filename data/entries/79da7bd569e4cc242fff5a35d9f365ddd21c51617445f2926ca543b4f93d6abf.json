{"title":"Advancing Vaccinology Capacity: Education and Efforts in Vaccine Development and Manufacturing across Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0444/v1","date":1717741505000,"content":"Africa, home to the world's second-largest population of approximately 1.3 billion, grapples with significant challenges in meeting its medical needs, particularly in accessing quality healthcare services and products. The continent faces a continuous onslaught of emerging infectious diseases, exacerbating the strain on its already fragile public health infrastructure. The emergence of SARS-Cov2 has further exposed the deficiencies in Africa's public health response, ranging from limited diagnostic capabilities to difficulties in vaccine distribution. Compounding these challenges is vaccine hesitancy, which is prevalent in many regions due to varying levels of understanding and trust regarding vaccines. The disparities in vaccine literacy across the continent stem from a complex interplay of factors, including low literacy rates and a history of medical exploitation and misinformation campaigns. These factors have led to a pervasive distrust in medical institutions and healthcare providers among certain African communities. Despite concerted efforts by national governments, private entities, and international partners to address these challenges and improve vaccine literacy, significant hurdles persist. This manuscript examines the current state of education in vaccinology and related sciences in Africa, as well as the continent's efforts to address educational needs in vaccine development and manufacturing. It evaluates initiatives aimed at strengthening vaccine education and literacy, highlighting successful approaches and ongoing challenges. By assessing the progress made and identifying remaining obstacles, this review offers insights into how Africa can enhance its capacity in vaccinology and accelerate its contributions to global health security.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79da7bd569e4cc242fff5a35d9f365ddd21c51617445f2926ca543b4f93d6abf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
