{"title":"PSX-4 Exploring the impact of age and body condition score on the genetic analysis of mature cow weight in American Angus cattle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/454/7757565?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Selecting sires with optimal genetic merit for mature weight (MWT) is crucial for profitability of beef producers, ensuring cost-effective production and increased economic returns per animal. The main objective of this study was to determine how different statistical approaches [e.g., including the fixed effects (FE) of age and body condition score (BCS) in the statistical model and/or pre-adjusting the weights for these effects] affect variance components estimation and genetic parameters for MWT, and their impact in the posterior selection decisions. The dataset provided by the American Angus Association (AAA) comprised 80,296 MWT records from 37,934 cows aged 2 to 15 yr. Contemporary groups (CG) were defined by concatenating herd, year, and season of measurement. Model 1 analyzed unadjusted MWT with CG and BCS as categorical FE and age as a covariable (quadratic). Model 2 was model 1 without BCS, model 3 was model 1 without age, and model 4 considered CG as the only FE. In model 5, MWT was pre-adjusted for 6 yr of age and BCS of 6, and CG was the only FE included in the statistical model. Additive genetic and permanent environment (pe) random effects were included in all statistical models except model 5, which did not include pe (only one adjusted record per animal). Variance components were calculated using REML implemented in the BLUPf90+ family of programs. Sires with at least 10 offspring (n = 1,483) were ranked according to their breeding values (EBVs) predicted for MWT, and all and the top 10% sires were used to estimate the rank correlation across models. The heritability (± SE) estimated for MWT was 0.43 (± 0.011), 0.42 (± 0.011), 0.70 (± 0.008), 0.72 (± 0.082), and 0.37 (± 0.013) for models 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Repeatability values were 0.64, 0.67, 0.72, and 0.76 for models 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The EBV ranks were highly correlated between models 1 and 2 (Top 10%: 0.96; All: 0.99), and models 3 and 4 (Top 10%: 0.99; All: 0.99). Inflated heritabilities in models 3 and 4 suggest that the effect of age is confounded with the additive genetic effect, which will not translate to greater genetic progress. Therefore, disregarding age in the genetic evaluation of MWT is not recommended. Similarities between models 1 and 2 suggest that BCS has a relatively small impact on MWT, probably related to the relatively low genetic correlation between these traits. Models 1 and 5 cannot be directly compared, as they use slightly different response variables (body weight vs. pre-adjusted weight) and may lead to slightly different selection decisions (correlation between Top 10%: 0.85; All: 0.95). Further investigations in this field are warranted.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"817453ff5aa89415d051a050983fae8bca26980353eeac4269705272c1f61ef0","category":"Environment"}
