{"title":"Size Uniformity of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dots via Manganese-Doping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0749/v1","date":1720534712000,"content":"The achievement of size uniformity and monodispersity in perovskite quantum dots (QDs) requires the implementation of precise temperature control and the establishment of optimal reaction conditions. Nevertheless, the accurate control of a range of reaction variables represents a considerable challenge. This study addresses the aforementioned challenge by employing manganese (Mn) doping to achieve size uniformity in CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs without the necessity for precise control of the reaction conditions. By optimizing the Mn:Pb ratio, it is possible to successfully dope CsPbBr3 QDs with appropriate concentrations of Mn²⁺ and achieve a uniform size distribution. The spectroscopic measurements on single QDs indicate that the appropriate Mn²⁺ concentrations can result in a narrower spectral linewidth, a longer photoluminescence (PL) lifetime, and a reduced biexciton Auger recombination rate, thus positively affecting the PL properties. This study not only simplifies the size control of perovskite QDs, but also demonstrates the potential of Mn-doped CsPbBr3 QDs for narrow linewidth light-emitting diode applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92331cd8b0cbba963f603af95104747890a5d9b5d2549f7fe9f81e43e95ffe3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
