{"title":"The Effects of the Modern Architecture Style on the Evolution of Mosques: A Case Study of Contemporary Mosques in Sulaymaniyah Governorate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1634/v1","date":1726841659000,"content":"Following the economic and political transformations after 1991, including the autonomy of the Kurdistan Region and the establishment of Iraq's new federal government in 2003, extensive construction, including mosques, has reshaped the region. This requires examinations of evolving architectural features in new mosques and questioning their alignment with religious and aesthetic design objectives. This research focuses on the transformative impact of modern architectural styles on mosque evolution in Sulaymaniyah Governorate. Acknowledging the interplay of cultural evolution, technology, and artistic innovation, the study employs an in-depth case study approach to analyze selected mosques in Sulaymaniyah Governorate that blend traditional Islamic architecture with modern design principles. This synthesis of traditional and modern elements raises questions about religious legitimacy, historical symbolism, and architecture's role in reflecting and shaping religious values. Using quantitative methods including indicator-based impact assessment, the study identifies modern architectural indicators, determines religious objectives of mosque design through Islamic legitimacy references, and analyzes the case study data. By employing person coefficient correlation, the research aims to identify the causal relationship between modern architectural indicators and achieved design objectives. The results reveal that the overall influence of the modern architecture style tends to be more negative on the evolÂ¬ution of mosques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7249cfe53351047d368a93dab9d85699a4e9471c679e041987c6bc0326804253","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
