{"title":"Analysis of the swine movement network in Mexico: A perspective for disease prevention and control","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309369","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Alejandro Zaldivar-Gomez, Jose Pablo Gomez-Vazquez, Beatriz Martínez-López, Gerardo Suzán, Oscar Rico-Chávez</p>\r\n\r\nPig farming in Mexico is critical to the economy and food supply. Mexico has achieved advancements in swine health and established an electronic database that records swine movements (Sistema Nacional de Avisos de Movilización, SNAM). In this study, we characterized swine movement patterns in México between 2017 and 2019 to identify specific areas and periods that require concentrated efforts for effective epidemiological surveillance and disease control. We employed a Social Network Analysis (SNA) methodology to comprehensively describe and analyze the intricate patterns of pig movement. In addition, we sought to integrate swine population density into the analysis. We used metrics to characterize the network structure and identify the most critical nodes in the movement network. Cohesion metrics were used to identify commercial communities characterized by a high level of interconnectivity in swine movements between groups of nodes. Of a cumulative count of 662,255 pig shipments, 95.9% were attributed to slaughterhouse shipments. We observed that 54% of all Mexican municipalities were part of the network; however, the density of the movement network was less than 0.14%. We identified four Swine Production Centers in Mexico with high interconnectivity in the movement network. We detected moderate positive correlations (ρ ≥0.4 and &lt;0.6, p &lt; 0.001) between node metrics and swine population indicators, whereas the number of commercial swine facilities showed weak correlations with the node metrics. We identified six large, geographically clustered commercial communities that aligned with the Swine Production Centers. This study provides a comprehensive overview of swine movement patterns in Mexico and their close association with swine production centers, which play a dual role as producers and traders within the swine industry of Mexico. Our research offers valuable insights for policymakers in developing disease prevention and control strategies.","author":"Alejandro Zaldivar-Gomez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f33d5cba61c2cb5e4c39b6e6fb810cbc44da7be4ccf99e45853fa11665637664","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
