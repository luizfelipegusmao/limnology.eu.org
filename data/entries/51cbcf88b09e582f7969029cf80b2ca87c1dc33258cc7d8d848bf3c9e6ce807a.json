{"title":"Metabolic Response to Cropping Pattern in Saffron (Crocus sativus L.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0018/v1","date":1725276524000,"content":"Considering the prevalence of cropping pattern in many Saffron cultivation regions, the continuous cropping obstacle caused the decline in growth and development. These effects justify the necessity of studying agronomic strategies to promote plant quality and production. Herein, the mono cropping, intercrop of Paulownia and Saffron, and intercrop of Soybean and Saffron patterns have been performed. The metabolites of Saffron under three cropping patterns were determined and identified using by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. Uni and multivariate statistical analysis were applied to examine the difference between groups and select the significant differential accumulated metabolites. The results showed that a total of 315 compounds were significantly changed in three comparison groups. Phenylalanine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway has been greatly enriched by the changed metabolites. The phenyl lactate, trans-2-Hydroxy-cinnamate, Î³-Linolenate, 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid, 13-0xo-0ctadecadienoic acid, 9,12,13-TriHOME of those metabolites showed significant differential accumulation in Saffron under three cropping patterns. And the accumulation of safranal and picrocrocin related compounds, such as Crocetin, Crocin showed a similar variation regularity. These indicate that there may be a close internal relationship between the cropping pattern and the biosynthesis of metabolites related to endogenous substances and Saffron quality formation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51cbcf88b09e582f7969029cf80b2ca87c1dc33258cc7d8d848bf3c9e6ce807a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
