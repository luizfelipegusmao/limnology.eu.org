{"title":"The Secret to Fixing Incorrect Canonical Quantizations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1397/v2","date":1726216877000,"content":"Covariant scalar field quantization, nicknamed $(\\vp^r)_n$, where $r$ denotes the power of the interaction term and $n=s+1$ where $s$ is the spatial dimension and $1$ adds time. Models such that $r&lt;2n/(n-2)$ can be treated by canonical quantization, while models such that $r&gt;2n/(n-2)$ are trivial, or, if treated as a unit, emerge as `free theories'. Models such as $r=2n/(n-2)$, e.g., $r=n=4$, again using canonical quantization also become `free theories', which must be considered quantum failures. However, there exists a different approach called affine quantization that promotes a different set of classical variables to become the basic quantum operators and it offers different results. It is well-known that the canonical quantization of $\\varphi^4_4$ fails. Here is how to fix it along with many other problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f92ff8c34fe5ca4200938f67657218b35ad8b3247e7fb9d1d535877c36abc0d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
