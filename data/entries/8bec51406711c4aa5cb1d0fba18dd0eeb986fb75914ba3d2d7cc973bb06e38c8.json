{"title":"Gene regulatory networks underlying sulfate deficiency responses in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/10/2781/7609140?rss=1","date":1710547200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Sulfur (S) is an essential macronutrient for plants and its availability in soils is an important determinant for growth and development. Current regulatory policies aimed at reducing industrial S emissions together with changes in agronomical practices have led to a decline in S contents in soils worldwide. Deficiency of sulfate—the primary form of S accessible to plants in soil—has adverse effects on both crop yield and nutritional quality. Hence, recent research has increasingly focused on unraveling the molecular mechanisms through which plants detect and adapt to a limiting supply of sulfate. A significant part of these studies involves the use of omics technologies and has generated comprehensive catalogs of sulfate deficiency-responsive genes and processes, principally in Arabidopsis together with a few studies centering on crop species such as wheat, rice, or members of the <span>Brassica</span> genus. Although we know that sulfate deficiency elicits an important reprogramming of the transcriptome, the transcriptional regulators orchestrating this response are not yet well understood. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of gene expression responses to sulfate deficiency and recent efforts towards the identification of the transcription factors that are involved in controlling these responses. We further compare the transcriptional response and putative regulators between Arabidopsis and two important crop species, rice and tomato, to gain insights into common mechanisms of the response to sulfate deficiency.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8bec51406711c4aa5cb1d0fba18dd0eeb986fb75914ba3d2d7cc973bb06e38c8","category":"Environment"}
