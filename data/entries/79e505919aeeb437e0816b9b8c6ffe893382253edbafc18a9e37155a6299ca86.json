{"title":"Ascorbic Acid Ameliorates Molecular and Developmental Defects in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell and Cerebral Organoid Models of Fragile X Syndrome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0330/v1","date":1728048240000,"content":"Fragile X Syndrome (FX) is the most common form of inherited cognitive impairment and falls under the broader category of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). FX is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the non-coding region of the X-linked Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, leading to its hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing. Animal models of FX rely on the deletion of the Fmr1 gene which fail to replicate the epigenetic silencing mechanism of the FMR1 gene seen in human patients. Human stem cells carrying FX repeat expansions have provided a better understanding of the basis of the epigenetic silencing of FMR1. Previous studies have found that 5-Azacytidine (5Azac) can reverse this methylation; however, 5Azac can be toxic and may limit its therapeutic potential. Here, we show that the dietary factor Ascorbic Acid (AsA) can reduce DNA methylation in the FMR1 locus and lead to an increase in FMR1 gene expression in FX iPSCs and cerebral organoids. In addition, AsA treatment rescued neuronal gene expression and the morphological defects observed in FX iPSC-derived cerebral organoids. Hence, we demonstrate that the dietary co-factor AsA can partially revert molecular and morphological defects seen in human FX models in vitro. Our findings have implications for the development of novel therapies for FX in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79e505919aeeb437e0816b9b8c6ffe893382253edbafc18a9e37155a6299ca86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
