{"title":"Enhancing early autism diagnosis through machine learning: Exploring raw motion data for classification","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302238","date":1713794400000,"content":"<p>by Maria Luongo, Roberta Simeoli, Davide Marocco, Nicola Milano, Michela Ponticorvo</p>\r\n\r\nIn recent years, research has been demonstrating that movement analysis, utilizing machine learning methods, can be a promising aid for clinicians in supporting autism diagnostic process. Within this field of research, we aim to explore new models and delve into the detailed observation of certain features that previous literature has identified as prominent in the classification process. Our study employs a game-based tablet application to collect motor data. We use artificial neural networks to analyze raw trajectories in a \"drag and drop\" task. We compare a two-features model (utilizing only raw coordinates) with a four-features model (including velocities and accelerations). The aim is to assess the effectiveness of raw data analysis and determine the impact of acceleration on autism classification. Our results revealed that both models demonstrate promising accuracy in classifying motor trajectories. The four-features model consistently outperforms the two-features model, as evidenced by accuracy values (0.90 vs. 0.76). However, our findings support the potential of raw data analysis in objectively assessing motor behaviors related to autism. While the four-features model excels, the two-features model still achieves reasonable accuracy. Addressing limitations related to sample size and noise is essential for future research. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating intelligent solutions to enhance and assist autism traditional diagnostic process and intervention, paving the way for more effective tools in assessing motor skills.","author":"Maria Luongo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3046ed3151206b9edf3387301f8185def091cd7c4deb871703b7d930307ccefe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
