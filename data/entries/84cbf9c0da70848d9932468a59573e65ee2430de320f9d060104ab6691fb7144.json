{"title":"Proportion of active tuberculosis among HIV-infected children after antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003528","date":1722607200000,"content":"<p>by Fassikaw Kebede Bizuneh, Dejen Tsegaye, Belete Negese Gemeda, Tsehay Kebede Bizuneh</p>\r\n\r\nDespite effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in reducing mortality of opportunistic infections among HIV infected children, however tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant cause for morbidity and attributed for one in every three deaths. HIV-infected children face disproportionate death risk during co-infection of TB due to their young age and miniatures immunity makes them more vulnerable. In Ethiopia, there is lack of aggregated data TB and HIV mortality in HIV infected children. We conducted an extensive systematic review of literature using Preferred Reporting of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Five electronic databases were used mainly Scopus, PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Google scholar for articles searching. The pooled proportion of TB was estimated using a weighted inverse variance random-effects meta-regression using STATA version-17. Heterogeneity of the articles was evaluated using Cochran’s Q test and I2 statistic. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity test, and Egger’s regression were conducted for publication bias. This met-analysis is registered in Prospero-CRD42024502038. In the final met-analysis report, 13 out of 1221 articles were included and presented. During screening of 6668 HIV-infected children for active TB occurrence, 834 cases were reported after ART was initiated. The pooled proportion of active TB among HIV infected children was found 12.07% (95% CI: 10.71–13.41). In subgroup analysis, the Oromia region had 15.6% (95%CI: 10.2–20.6) TB burden, followed by southern Ethiopia 12.8% (95%CI: 10.03–15.67). During meta-regression, missed isoniazid Preventive therapy (IPT) (OR: 2.28), missed contrimoxazole preventive therapy (OR: 4.26), WHO stage III&amp;IV (OR: 2.27), and level of Hgb ≤ 10gm/dl (OR = 3.11.7) were predictors for active TB. The systematic review found a higher proportion of active TB in HIV-infected children in Ethiopia compared to estimated rates in end TB strategy. To prevent premature death during co-infection, implement effective TB screening and cases tracing strategies in each follow up is needed.","author":"Fassikaw Kebede Bizuneh","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"84cbf9c0da70848d9932468a59573e65ee2430de320f9d060104ab6691fb7144","category":"Environment"}
