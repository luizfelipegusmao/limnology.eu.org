In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, polyP is produced by the polyP kinase (PPK) and is thought to play a protective role during the response to cellular stress. However, the molecular pathways impacted by PPK activity and polyP accumulation remain poorly characterized. In this work, we used label-free mass spectrometry to study the response of bacteria that cannot produce polyP (Δ<i>ppk</i>) during starvation to identify novel pathways regulated by PPK. In response to starvation, we found 92 proteins significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and Δ<i>ppk</i> mutant cells. Wild-type cells were enriched for proteins related to amino acid biosynthesis and transport, while Δ<i>ppk</i> mutants were enriched for proteins related to translation and ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that without PPK, cells remain inappropriately primed for growth even in the absence of the required building blocks. From our data set, we were particularly interested in Arn and EptA proteins, which were down-regulated in Δ<i>ppk</i> mutants compared to wild-type controls, because they play a role in lipid A modifications linked to polymyxin resistance. Using western blotting, we confirm differential expression of these and related proteins in K-12 strains and a uropathogenic isolate, and provide evidence that this mis-regulation in Δ<i>ppk</i> cells stems from a failure to induce the BasRS two-component system during starvation. We also show that Δ<i>ppk</i> mutants unable to up-regulate Arn and EptA expression lack the respective L-Ara4N and pEtN modifications on lipid A. In line with this observation, loss of <i>ppk</i> restores polymyxin sensitivity in resistant strains carrying a constitutively active <i>basR</i> allele. Overall, we show a new role for PPK in lipid A modification during starvation and provide a rationale for targeting PPK to sensitize bacteria towards polymyxin treatment. We further anticipate that our proteomics work will provide an important resource for researchers interested in the diverse pathways impacted by PPK.","author":"Kanchi Baijal","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"54a84f28a575a7eaee9689be8c8c12b87c719950beb142e1e3581b62847d3e72","category":"Environment"}
