{"title":"Mitochondrial Genomes of Mammals from the Brazilian Cerrado and Phylogenetic Considerations for the Orders Artiodactyla, Carnivora, and Chiroptera (Chordata: Mammalia)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0316/v1","date":1728033523000,"content":"We assembled and annotated the complete mitochondrial genomes of Lycalopex vetulus (hoary fox), Cerdocyon thous (bush dog), Tayassu pecari (white-lipped peccary), and Tadarida brasiliensis (Brazilian free-tailed bat). The mitogenomes exhibited typical vertebrate structures, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a D-loop region. Phylogenetic reconstruction using the 13 protein-coding genes revealed robust relationships among species within Carnivora, Chiroptera, and Artiodactyla, corroborating previous studies. Secondary structure analysis of tRNAs and ribosomal genes showed slight variations among species of the same order. This research highlights the importance of mitochondrial genomics in understanding the evolutionary relationships and genetic diversity of Cerrado mammals, contributing to conservation efforts for this unique ecosystem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffebe86acba08cfb6eb717f567f3d1a4de88a2db822e16d1f05688c177d70bca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
