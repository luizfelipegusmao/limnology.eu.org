{"title":"Surface Roughness Analysis of Low-cost Metal Material Extrusion Fabricated Parts and Prediction by Machine Learning Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1232/v1","date":1729017428000,"content":"Additive Manufacturing (AM), also know as 3D Printing (3DP), is a widely used layer-by-layer manufacturing process, it is evolving rapidly both in research and industry. Among all AM methods, Material Extrusion (ME) is one of the most popular techniques. Based on ME, another new AM method is developed, which is Low-cost Metal Material Extrusion (LCMME). In this newly developed process, pure metallic parts could be fabricated after sintering the metal infused additively manufactured parts. Both AM and sintering process parameters will have influence on the quality of the final pure metallic parts. In this research, several statistics methods were used to analyze the data gotten from the experiment. Then two Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to predict the Surface Roughness (SR) of the final specimens. Additionally, the results show that the neural network (NN) is more accurate than the support vector regression (SVR) on prediction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc8ed97050357b5a77602136ce27d8fe3a0990000e694fa9d2849f36b52fa18b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
