{"title":"A Decentralized Multi-authority Attribute-Based Encryption in eHealthcare","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1938/v1","date":1724750217000,"content":"With the large-scale application of Internet of Things (IoT) in the medical field, eHealthcare has attracted wide attention. With the help of IoT devices, eHealthcare allows doctors to monitor patients’ health conditions and make recommendations accordingly. The addition of cloud computing greatly saves Healthcare Center’s (HC) computing resources. In order to provide privacy and fine-grained access control, Attribute-b ased encryption (ABE) is widely favored. HC usually operates multiple medical institutions in different regions, and each medical institution can be regarded as a attribute authority. Therefor, multi-authority (MA) ABE is usually concerned to encrypt the patient data. However for existing MA-ABE algorithms, the ciphertext is long and the efficiency of encryption and decryption is low. These problems will greatly increase the computing burden of patients and seriously affect the efficiency of data transmission. Hence we propose a decentralized key-policy MA-ABE in eHealthcare. The proposed algorithm can achieve decentralization, that is, it does not need central authority. Meanwhile, compared with existing MA-ABE algorithms, the length of ciphertext generated by our algorithm is shorter, and the efficiency of encryption and decryption is significantly improved. With the help of Java Pairing Based Cryptography, we carried out the experiments which show that our algorithm can effectively reduce the time required for encryption and decryption.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad931e9dfcc969f43da29b1357d8ab2b8f60967f001975bda574820585daf289","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
