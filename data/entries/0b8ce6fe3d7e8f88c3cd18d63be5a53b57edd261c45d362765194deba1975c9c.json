{"title":"Quasispecies Theory and Emerging Viruses: Challenges and Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0559/v2","date":1727600458000,"content":"The dawn of quasispecies theory revolutionized our understanding of viral evolution and pathogenesis. This theory conceptualises viruses as dynamic populations of closely related but genetically diverse variants that constantly mutate and adapt to environmental pressures. Quasispecies dynamics govern key aspects of virus-host interactions, such as adaptive evolution, immune evasion, drug resistance, and host tropism. In this article, we discuss the fundamental role of quasispecies theory in elucidating viral fitness landscapes, shaping antiviral strategies, and predicting viral emergence and evolution. We provide a concise overview of the original quasispecies model and its latest advancements, which enable the study of the connection between viral dynamics and the significant genetic diversity exhibited by viruses. We then point out some key features of virus dynamics that need to be incorporated into quasispecies theory. We continue with examples of convergence between theory and real viruses by discussing theoretical results supported by RNA virus data and vice versa. Next, we discuss the need to extend the concept of sequence space beyond the classical hypercube towards more complex, multidimensional connected sequence spaces that we have called ultracubes. Finally, we highlight the necessity of developing multi-scale models to understand how viral evolutionary dynamics within a host can affect epidemiological patterns. We also examine the limitations of quasispecies theory in predicting virus evolution and emergence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b8ce6fe3d7e8f88c3cd18d63be5a53b57edd261c45d362765194deba1975c9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
