{"title":"Effect of microwave‐assisted treatment on proximate, techno‐functional, thermal, structural, and storage properties of TGN (Cyperus esculentus L.) flour","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13473?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The use of the emerging technique of microwave-assisted roasting on TGN (TGN) flour was investigated. Tiger nuts were subjected to microwave irradiation at 450, 600, and 900 W each at 5, 10, and 15 min, and milled to flour. The flours were analyzed for proximate, bioactive, techno-functional, morphological, thermal, and storage effects on their composition. An untreated sample was the control.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results revealed that microwave treatment significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) elicited various modifications in the proximate composition and techno-functional properties. The treatment improved the bioactive composition of phenolic content together with the antioxidant activity of the flour. Progressive microwave treatment of TGNs resulted in flours with darker colors and reduced pasting parameters. Structural modification of starch granules, protein denaturation, and starch-protein complexes occasioned by microwave treatment were evidenced in the functional group analysis, including morphological agglomeration, increased particle size, and thermal properties. Treatment also enhanced the microbiological qualities of flour after 8 weeks of storage.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study shows that microwave treatment produces excellent physical modifications that lead to improvements in the nutritional, functional, sensory, and color properties, and safety attributes of TGN flour for food application. This is a development that could present opportunities for novel food formulation by the food industry and related industries. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Adebola O.
