However, what drives BEF relationships in natural ecosystems under globally changing conditions remains poorly understood.\n\nTo address this knowledge gap, we applied a trait-based approach to data from coastal dune plant communities distributed along a natural environmental stress gradient. Specifically, we compared the relative importance of below-ground and above-ground traits in predicting productivity, decomposition, water regulation, carbon stock and nutrient pools, and tested how these BEF relationships were modulated by environmental stress and the presence of rare species that are typically excluded from experimental systems.\n\nBelow-ground traits were just as important as above-ground traits in driving ecosystem functioning. Moreover, despite having low abundances, rare species positively influenced ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). However, most biodiversity effects became weaker as environmental stress increased.\n\nOur study shows that to understand variation in ecosystem functioning we must consider below-ground traits as much as above-ground ones. Moreover, it highlights the importance of conserving rare species for maintaining EMF. However, our findings also suggest that rapid global change could dampen the positive effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/21/how-roots-rare-species-and-environmental-stress-regulate-the-biodiversity-ecosystem-function-bef-relationship/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Greta La Bella, \nAlicia T.
