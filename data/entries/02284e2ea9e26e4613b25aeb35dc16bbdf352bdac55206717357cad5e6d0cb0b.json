In this study, we set up 10 sampling sites categorized into four areas based on different stressors and defined three stages based on the timeline of dam construction. Our findings revealed significant changes in community composition before and after dam impoundment. While certain original dominant taxa, such as <i>Rivularia globosa</i> and <i>Lithoglyphopsis ovatus</i>, remained dominant throughout the stages, mayflies and caddisflies nearly vanished in the downstream reaches of the dams. This trend was accompanied by the disappearance of taxa with low adaptability and the emergence of tolerant taxa downstream of the dams. Additionally, typical limnological taxa colonized the inundated reaches. Dam impoundment affected not only macroinvertebrate community composition but also diversity. In this study, the recovery effect of communities downstream of dams was not observed due to the limited distance, but the presence of Wujiangdu Dam upstream of the two dams for over 20 years makes us believe that in a large river system, macroinvertebrate communities downstream of high-head dams may fully recover if the distance from the dams is long enough. The original and vulnerable species <i>R. globosa</i>, which demonstrated remarkable adaptability and thrived downstream of dams, should be further studied in the future.</p>","author":"Shiyun Chi, \nJuxiang Hu, \nXianfu Zhao, \nJun Hu, \nSixin Li, \nHongjun Wang, \nLianfeng Zhou, \nDewang Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"02284e2ea9e26e4613b25aeb35dc16bbdf352bdac55206717357cad5e6d0cb0b","category":"Environment"}
