{"title":"Optimization of Supply-Demand Balance Dispatching and Economic Benefit Improvement in the Multi-Energy Virtual Power Plant within the Jiangxi Power Market","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0859/v1","date":1723619721000,"content":"This paper proposes an optimization method for the scheduling of a multi-energy virtual power plant supply-demand balance in the power market environment of Jiangxi Province. The objective of this method is to enhance the operational efficiency of the power grid, reduce energy costs, and facilitate economical and efficient energy distribution in the power market. The method comprehensively considers the characteristics and uncertainties of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and incorporates advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms. Additionally, real-time market price feedback is integrated to achieve accurate allocation of power supply and demand. Through a case study of a multi-energy virtual power plant in Jiangxi Province, this paper examines the optimal combination model for various energy sources within VPP, and analyzes the impact of different market environments on supply-demand balance. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling optimization method significantly improves economic benefits while ensuring grid stability. Compared with traditional power supply models, it reduces average electricity costs by 15% and increases renewable energy utilization efficiency by 20%.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"54e23ef87167755fe4f4e906bd1d27b8c868cc9cadbdb5993cc1d846876cfdcb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
