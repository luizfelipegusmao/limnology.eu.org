{"title":"Guardians of the Web: The Evolution and Future of Website Information Security","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0108/v1","date":1719833359000,"content":"Website information security has become a critical concern in the digital age. This article explores the evolution of website information security, examining its historical development, current practices, and future directions. The early beginnings from the 1960s to the 1980s laid the groundwork for modern cybersecurity, with the development of ARPANET, TCP/IP, public-key cryptography, and the first antivirus programs. The 1990s marked a transformative era, driven by the commercialization of the Internet and the emergence of web-based services. As the Internet grew, so did the range and sophistication of cyber threats, leading to advancements in security technologies such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, password protection, and firewalls. Current practices in website information security involve a multi-layered approach, including encryption, secure coding practices, regular security audits, and user education. The future of website information security is expected to be shaped by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing, as well as the increasing importance of international cooperation and standardization efforts. As cyber threats continue to evolve, ongoing research and innovation in website information security will be essential to protect sensitive information and maintain trust in the digital world.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e591ae25c4dadb6a01e50f88ced89bff723e0bad877d5770640601201776ee2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
