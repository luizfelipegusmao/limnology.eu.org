{"title":"The Correlation between Cycling Infrastructure and the Fatal Accident Rate of Cyclists &ndash; Comparison of Slovakia, Poland and the Netherlands","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1889/v1","date":1719404063000,"content":"Bicycle transport stands at the forefront of sustainable mobility initiatives, a cornerstone of European Union policy. While support for cycling is crucial, its advancement hinges upon the presence of high-quality, secure infrastructure for cyclists. Safety emerges as a paramount concern, influencing the viability of cycling as a mode of transportation, yet its perception varies among user demographics. Considering this, this article endeavours to examine and contrast cycling infrastructure across various European nations, alongside analysing statistics pertaining to fatal traffic accidents involving cyclists. In our paper, we have chosen the Netherlands as a representative of building quality cycling infrastructure with many years of experience, and two countries that are developing conditions for cyclists, Slovakia and Poland. We have applied a correlation between the length of the transport infrastructure and the number of cyclists killed. The findings point to the substantial correlation between the quality of cycling infrastructure and the incidence of accidents. This correlation underscores the pressing need for robust infrastructure development and safety measures to bolster cycling as a safe and viable transportation option. We have employed the Shapiro-Wilk test for normal distribution to verify the input data and process the Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between cycling infrastructure and road accident fatalities of cyclists.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"28e14af656af3f304fd00efef3e77dcebb6dbf4fd920d54843d58c3ada9342d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
