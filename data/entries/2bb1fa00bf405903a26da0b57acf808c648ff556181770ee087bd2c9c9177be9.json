One of the compounds causing oxidative stress is diazinon. In the present project, the protective role of gallic acid compound in reducing oxidative stress in brain tissue of mice exposed to diazinon was investigated.\nMethod: In this study, eight groups of six series of mice including the first group (control) of normal saline, the second group of diazinon (40 kg/mg) as IP, three groups of diazinon with gallic acid (50, 100, 200 kg/mg), was prescribed as a single dose and for 24 hours. The atropine + pralidoxime group was also evaluated as a standard treatment group. At 24 hours after the last dose, the animals were sacrificed and brain tissue was examined to assess oxidative stress parameters, including glutathione content, protein carbonyl content, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from brain tissue.\nResults: The results of this research showed that oxidative stress biomarkers increased significantly (P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bb1fa00bf405903a26da0b57acf808c648ff556181770ee087bd2c9c9177be9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
