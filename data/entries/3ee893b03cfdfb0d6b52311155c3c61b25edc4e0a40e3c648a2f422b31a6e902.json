{"title":"CoGTEx: Unscaled system-level coexpression estimation from GTEx data forecast novel functional gene partners","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309961","date":1728050400000,"content":"<p>by Miguel-Angel Cortes-Guzman, Víctor Treviño</p>\r\nMotivation <p>Coexpression estimations are helpful for analysis of pathways, cofactors, regulators, targets, and human health and disease. Ideally, coexpression estimations should consider as many diverse cell types as possible and consider that available data is not uniform across tissues. Importantly, the coexpression estimations accessible today are performed on a “tissue level”, which is based on cell type standardized formulations. Little or no attention is paid to overall gene expression levels. The tissue-level estimation assumes that variance expression levels are more important than mean expression levels. Here, we challenge this assumption by estimating a coexpression calculation at the “system level”, which is estimated without standardization by tissue, and show that it provides valuable information. We made available a resource to view, download, and analyze both, tissue- and system-level coexpression estimations from GTEx human data.</p> Methods <p>GTEx v8 expression data was globally normalized, batch-processed, and filtered. Then, PCA, clustering, and tSNE stringent procedures were applied to generate 42 distinct and curated tissue clusters. Coexpression was estimated from these 42 tissue clusters computing the correlation of 33,445 genes by sampling 70 samples per tissue cluster to avoid tissue overrepresentation. This process was repeated 20 times, extracting the minimum value provided as a robust estimation. Three metrics were calculated (<i>Pearson</i>, <i>Spearman</i>, and <i>G-statistic</i>) in two data processing modes, at the system-level (TPM scale) and tissue levels (z-score scale).</p> Results <p>We first validate our tissue-level estimations compared with other databases. Then, by specific analyses in several examples and literature validations of predictions, we show that system-level coexpression estimation differs from tissue-level estimations and that both contain valuable information reflected in biological pathways. We also show that coexpression estimations are associated to transcriptional regulation. Finally, we present CoGTEx, a valuable resource for viewing and analyzing coexpressed genes in human adult tissues from GTEx v8 data. We introduce our web resource to list, view and explore the coexpressed genes from GTEx data.</p> Conclusion <p>We conclude that system-level coexpression is a novel and interesting coexpression metric capable of generating plausible predictions and biological hypotheses; and that CoGTEx is a valuable resource to view, compare, and download system- and tissue- level coexpression estimations from GTEx data.</p> Availability <p>The web resource is available at http://bioinformatics.mx/cogtex.</p>","author":"Miguel-Angel Cortes-Guzman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3ee893b03cfdfb0d6b52311155c3c61b25edc4e0a40e3c648a2f422b31a6e902","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
