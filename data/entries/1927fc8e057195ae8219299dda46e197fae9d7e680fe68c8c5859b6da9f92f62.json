However, the status of the Y chromosome in cancer tissue is not fully known due to technical limitations, such as difficulties in labelling and sequencing DNA from the Y chromosome. We have developed a system to quantify Y chromosome gain or loss in patient-derived prostate cancer organoids. Using our system, we observed Y chromosome loss in 4 of the 13 (31%) patient-derived metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) organoids; interestingly, loss of Yq (long arm of the Y chromosome) was seen in 38% of patient-derived organoids. Additionally, potential associations were observed between mCRPC and Y chromosome nullisomy. The prevalence of Y chromosome loss was similar in primary and metastatic tissue, suggesting that Y chromosome loss is an early event in prostate cancer evolution and may not a result of drug resistance or organoid derivation. This study reports quantification of Y chromosome loss and gain in primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissue and lays the groundwork for further studies investigating the clinical relevance of Y chromosome loss or gain in mCRPC.","author":"Sai Harisha Rajanala","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1927fc8e057195ae8219299dda46e197fae9d7e680fe68c8c5859b6da9f92f62","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
