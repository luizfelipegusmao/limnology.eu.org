{"title":"Color Standardization and Stain Intensity Calibration for Whole Slide Image-Based Immunohistochemistry Assessment","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/1/118/7503554?rss=1","date":1703808000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Automated quantification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) using whole slide imaging (WSI) is expected to eliminate subjectivity in visual assessment. However, the color intensity in WSI varies depending on the staining process and scanner device. Such variations affect the image analysis results. This paper presents methods to diminish the influence of color variation produced in the staining process using a calibrator slide consisting of peptide-coated microbeads. The calibrator slide is stained along with tissue sample slides, and the 3,3â€²-diaminobenzidine (DAB) color intensities of the microbeads are used for calibrating the color variation of the sample slides. An off-the-shelf image analysis tool is employed for the automated assessment, in which cells are classified by the thresholds for the membrane staining. We have adopted two methods for calibrating the color variation based on the DAB color intensities obtained from the calibrator slide: (1) thresholds for classifying the DAB membranous intensity are adjusted, and (2) the color intensity of WSI is corrected. In the experiment, the calibrator slides and tissue of breast cancer slides were stained together on different days and used to test our protocol. With the proposed protocol, the discordance in the HER2 evaluation was reduced to one slide out of 120 slides.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0130c78418097788eef64746c6d677ebdd28727e8b72ef36455dc32956a3d676","category":"Environment"}
