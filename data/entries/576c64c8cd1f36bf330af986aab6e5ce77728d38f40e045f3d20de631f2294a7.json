{"title":"Mechanism and Synergy Effect of the Hybrid Water Disinfection Process Using Electric Discharges Combined with Chlorination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1713/v1","date":1719292428000,"content":"An analysis of the physical and chemical phenomena accompanying the electrical discharges was carried out, principal factors inactivating microorganisms is studied. Characteristic factors of an electric discharge in cavitation mode providing a synergistic effect when disinfecting water with a discharge and chemical reagents are identified in order of importance. As a result of the integral action of cavitation, the inactivation of bacteria is intensified both due to the emergence of chem-ically active particles and due to local shock waves, acoustic currents and ultraviolet radiation in the area of cavitating bubbles. The similarity of cavitation processes in water systems implemented by underwater electric discharges and with the ultrasound has been experimentally proved. The main advantage of electric discharge cavitation in comparison with ultrasonic one is the wide band of ultrasonic frequencies of radiation inherent in electric discharge, high intensity and power of cav-itation processes, and, accordingly, the possibility of a significant increase in the volume of the disinfected liquid. The study enable better understanding and prediction of the effects that occur during a high-voltage underwater electrical discharge and have a bactericidal effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"576c64c8cd1f36bf330af986aab6e5ce77728d38f40e045f3d20de631f2294a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
