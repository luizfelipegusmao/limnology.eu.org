An important underreporting of cases was observed in many places during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. To estimate this underreporting in the COVID-19 outbreak of Borriana (Valencia Community, Spain), during “Falles” mass gathering events in March 2020, a cross-sectional study was performed in June 2020 querying public health register. Logistic regression models were used. From a total of 468 symptomatic COVID-19 cases diagnosed in the outbreak by anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology, 36 cases were reported (7.7%), thus an underreporting of 92.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 89.5%-94.6%), 13 unreported cases for every reported case. Only positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction cases were predominantly reported due to a limited testing capacity and following a national protocol. Significant factors associated with underreporting were no medical assistance for COVID-19 disease, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.83 (95% CI 2.49-47.11), no chronic illness, aOR=2.81 (95% CI 1.28-6.17), middle and lower social classes, aOR=3.12 (95% CI 1.42-6.85), younger age, aOR=0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99), shorter duration of illness, aOR=0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99). To improve surveillance, studies of representative population samples are necessary to estimate the magnitude of future epidemics, and novel approaches are recommended.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99ac4dc746befa533eb0d21112ed8b168caa8a6e494740cc6e3df59010169a99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
