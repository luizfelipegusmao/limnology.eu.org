{"title":"Optimization of Fuel Consumption by Controlling the Load Distribution between Engines in an LNG Ship Electric Propulsion Plant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0199/v1","date":1714978039000,"content":"Due to growing environmental concerns and stringent emissions regulations, optimizing the fuel consumption of marine propulsion systems is crucial. This work deals with the potential in an LNG ship propulsion system to reduce fuel consumption through controlled load distribution between engines in Dual Fuel Diesel Electric (DFDE) plant. Based on cyclical data acquisitioning measured on board and using an optimization model, the study evaluates different load distribution strategies between set up according to the optimization model results and automatic (equal) operation to determine their effectiveness in improving fuel efficiency. The analysis includes scenarios with different fuel types, including LNG, MDO and HFO, at different engine loads. The results indicate that load distribution adjustment based on the optimization model results significantly improves fuel efficiency compared to conventional methods of uniform load distribution controlled by power management systems almost in all load intervals. This research contributes to the maritime industry by demonstrating that strategic load management can achieve significant fuel savings and reduce environmental impact, which is in line with global sustainability goals. This work not only provides a framework for the implementation of more efficient energy management systems on LNG vessels, but also sets a benchmark for future innovations in maritime energy optimization as well as in the view of exhaust emission reduction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be69a722a7bf99944be72aa4560250c7c7a61c8a787b42e05cc1fbb7eca1e0df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
