{"title":"Spatial and temporal differences and convergence analysis of multidimensional relative poverty in ethnic areas","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301679","date":1712152800000,"content":"<p>by Jing Cheng, Xiaobin Yu</p>\r\n\r\nReducing multidimensional relative poverty is one of the important issues in the current global poverty governance field. This article takes 12 ethnic regions in China as the research object and constructs a multidimensional relative poverty measurement system. The calculated multidimensional relative poverty index is decomposed according to provinces, cities, dimensions, and indicators. Then, the Dagum Gini coefficient and convergence analysis are used to analyze spatiotemporal heterogeneity and convergence characteristics. The results show that the multi-dimensional relative poverty situation of various provinces in ethnic minority areas has improved from 2012 to 2021, among which Tibet province is the most serious and Shaanxi is the best. According to the analysis of convergence, it was observed that there is no σ-convergence of multidimensional relative poverty in ethnic areas in general, and there is absolute β-convergence in general and in the southwest and northwest regions, and there is no absolute β-convergence in the northeast region. Based on this, policy recommendations for reducing multidimensional relative poverty are proposed at the end of the article. Compared with previous studies, this article focuses on ethnic regions that are easily overlooked. Starting from the dimensions of economy, social development, and ecological environment, the poverty measurement system has been enriched.","author":"Jing Cheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"484086923963fc782aadfe36b3e54e844f71507f4fa4e2f4a3e4141964638625","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
