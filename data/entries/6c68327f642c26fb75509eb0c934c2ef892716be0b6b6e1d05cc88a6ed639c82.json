{"title":"Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV): A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0501/v1","date":1718087261000,"content":"Rice (Oryza spp.) is mostly grown directly from seed and sown on wet or dry seed beds or usually used as transplants on nursery bed. With all the economically important viral diseases in the world, Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), is only prevalent in rice-growing countries in Africa. RYMV had turned out to be the main rice production constraint in Africa, throughout the last 20â€“25 years, causing yield loss of 10 to 100%, depending on age of the plant at the time of infection, degree of varietal susceptibility and the exiting climatic conditions. Good agricultural practices and utilization of biotechnological tools in the development of improved resistant cultivars have been extensively active in controlling the disease. This review focused on RYMV, its epidemiology, serological and molecular typing, disease management and the way forward for sustainable rice production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c68327f642c26fb75509eb0c934c2ef892716be0b6b6e1d05cc88a6ed639c82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
