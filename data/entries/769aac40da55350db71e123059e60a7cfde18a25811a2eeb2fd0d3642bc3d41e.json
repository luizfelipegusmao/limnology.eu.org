{"title":"Computerized Penetrometry Methodology Assisted by Advanced Algorithms Applied in the Multi-dimensional Analysis of the Rheology of Mold-Ripened Cheeses and Its Impact on Food Product Quality","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1149/v1","date":1723769939000,"content":"The main objective of our study was to understand the rheological behavior of various types of cheeses with mold subjected to multiple stresses during processing/handling, transport, or storage, aiming to maintain or even improve product quality, using computer-assisted penetration methods, and advanced regression algorithms. Uniaxial penetration tests with a cone at a constant speed were conducted using a universal Hounsfield HK1S testing equipment connected to a computer to analyze the texture behavior (tangential stress, flow index, apparent viscosity) of four of the most common types of cheese with mold, depending on the cone's tip angle (9, 19, and 90°) and penetration speed (12, 30, and 60 mm/min). From the results obtained for the four categories of mold cheeses (Brie, Camembert, Dorblue, or Roquefort), the amplitude of the speed and angle of penetration were considered as the main influencing factors for the shear deformation (τc), flow index (Kf), and apparent viscosity (ηa). The moisture and firmness of the mold cheeses are closely linked and depend on the type of mold, the maturation process, or storage conditions. Careful control of these factors is essential to achieve the desired texture and taste characteristics in cheeses with mold.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"769aac40da55350db71e123059e60a7cfde18a25811a2eeb2fd0d3642bc3d41e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
