{"title":"The Role of Macrophages in Airway Disease Focusing on Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome Virus and the Potential Therapeutic Effects of Nanomaterial Treatment on Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1900/v1","date":1724752107000,"content":"Lung macrophage cells play a critical role in various lung disease, and their state can change depending on the progression of the disease by inducing either an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory state. In this review, we investigate the potential therapeutic effects of treatment with antioxidant nanoparticles in airway disease focusing on porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV), considering Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) as one of the factors that regulate M1 and M2 macrophages in the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states, respectively. In addition, we examine the status of protein structure research on CD163 (one of the markers of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages) in human and veterinary lung diseases and suggest directions for future applicable research areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32daf0fda56ba8c999de1da215c1fec2c4fb9dbdb4fdeedc325fd79a1c4519dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
