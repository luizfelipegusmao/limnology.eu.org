Without dung beetles, dung decomposition slows, nutrient cycling is impaired, and water infiltration decreases.\n\nDung beetles face various threats, including climate change, anthropogenic chemicals and habitat degradation. However, there is limited information on the restoration of dung beetles in areas where they have been lost.\n\nThe restoration framework utilized in this review considers three primary facets: environmental conditions, which encompass crucial abiotic features; biotic characteristics, which involve all other species; and focal species, which denote all native functional groups of species that require reintroduction or re-establishment.\n\nThis review aims to examine the ecosystem services provided by dung beetles, highlight the threats they face and conceptualize a restoration framework for these crucial organisms.\n</p>","author":"Shiva Torabian, \nA.
