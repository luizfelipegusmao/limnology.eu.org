{"title":"Exosome-Derived microRNAs in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1798/v1","date":1727147554000,"content":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) poses a significant health burden worldwide, characterized by myocardial hypertrophy and increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of exosome-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of HCM, shedding light on novel regulatory mechanisms in cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. This literature review synthesizes current evidence on the role of exosome-derived miRNAs in HCM. It discusses key miRNAs identified from diverse cellular origins, including cardiomyocytes, stem cells, and conduction cells, elucidating their contributions to hypertrophic signaling pathways, fibrosis, and changes in cellular metabolism. Notable miRNAs highly expressed in exosomes such as miR-1, miR-133, and miR-208 are highlighted for their implications in HCM pathophysiology. Moreover, the review explores the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of exosome-derived miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCM management. The studies summarized in this review demonstrate that exosome-derived miRNAs play a crucial role in orchestrating the molecular events underlying HCM, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic avenues. Understanding the intricate interplay between exosome-mediated miRNA communication and HCM pathophysiology holds promise for the development of personalized diagnostic tools and targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes in HCM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b805a8182edf351be6c61e4851464cf5af5476a9e20da523f6a33b5882465d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
