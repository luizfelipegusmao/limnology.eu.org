{"title":"Hybrid PVP/Battery/Fuel Cell Wireless Charging Station Using High-Frequency Optimized Inverter Technology for Electric Vehicles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0195/v1","date":1717499134000,"content":"The design and integration of intelligent energy management systems in hybrid Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, leveraging Industry 4.0 and renewable energy sources, is crucial for advancing sustainability, efficiency, and technological development. This paper introduces a pioneering hybrid EV charging station that employs hybrid power sources, combining photovoltaic panels, a battery, and a fuel cell, each operating at 240V and 14A. Utilizing wireless power transfer technology, the system comprises five integral blocks: a power source, a boost converter, a High-Frequency (HF) inverter, transfer coils, and EV batteries. The optimization process involves two key stages: i) maximum power point tracking optimization of the boost converter, ensuring maximum power generation by varying the duty cycle between 10% and 90%, and ii) the HF phase employing a class-Ï•2 inverter at 30 MHz, synchronized with the resonant frequency of wireless power transfer coils. Control is executed through a digital signal processor card utilizing zero-voltage switching for efficient operations. This design enhances sustainability in EV charging solutions by optimizing power transfer through the use of hybrid sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bea652309c408739ddfa51ed6347bb4a187e93e800bd2f90c3070a0ac4093db3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
