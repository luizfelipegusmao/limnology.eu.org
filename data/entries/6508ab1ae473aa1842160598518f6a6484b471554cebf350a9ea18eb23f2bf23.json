{"title":"Summary, Overview, and Insights from the 3rd U.S. National Marine Environmental DNA Workshop (2024)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0592/v1","date":1720422305000,"content":"The Third U.S. National Marine Environmental DNA Workshop on June 2–5, 2024 brought together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to overview and discuss: (1) environmental (e)DNA – defined as “DNA in the environment” – as a strategic U.S. national priority, (2) eDNA tool readiness and approaches to support decision-making, (3) emerging eDNA technologies, and (4) plans for implementation and adoption for environmental monitoring and ecosystem assessment “from microbes through whales”. Uses and applications of eDNA have been revolutionizing exploration, measurement, and monitoring of biodiversity across ecosystems, including the marine and freshwater aquatic environments emphasized in the Workshop, as well as terrestrial and aerial systems. The Workshop featured the launch of the new U.S. National Aquatic Environmental DNA Strategy from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (2024), with aquatic defined as freshwater to ocean waters, across all salinities; the Strategy was developed using outputs and a taskforce from the 2022 Second Workshop. The 2.5-day Third Workshop included speaker presentations, panel discussions, and networking on eDNA tools, applications, use, upscaling, and their future. The Workshop led into Capitol Hill Ocean Week (CHOW) events (June 5–6, 2024), during World Ocean Week.
