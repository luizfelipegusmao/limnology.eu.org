For years now, Netflix has not accepted new \nsubscribers or rejoined members who want to use Apple to pay their \nbills. If you already had an active account, though, that paid \nthrough Apple you could continue to do so. Now, though, that seems \nto be coming to an end. </p>\n\n<p>Today, Netflix started to inform customers that Apple will no \nlonger be accepting Apple Pay through iTunes Subscriptions, for \nexample. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Netflix stopped accepting new subscriptions from in-app purchases five years ago, but until now had allowed existing in-app subscriptions to keep going — and for many of those users, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meganNwalsh/status/1761565345658089752\">at lower prices than they currently offer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix and Apple used to be partners; now they’re rivals. Dropping support for the remaining legacy iTunes accounts isn’t nearly as big a deal as Netflix eschewing a native VisionOS app, but still, it’s a sign of how far apart the two companies are today. Apple TV didn’t have an App Store until the fourth-gen models (a.k.a. “Apple TV HD”) were introduced in 2015. But back in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2010/09/01Apple-Premieres-New-Apple-TV-for-Breakthrough-Price-of-99/\">Apple included a Netflix “app” in the second-gen Apple TV</a>, along with YouTube and Flickr. Those services were integrated right into the system software. That seems like forever ago.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/27/netflix-app-store-billing\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d8e13f4c1f9c188acb5d9fea3d5931402ddb71f4320402bbea4e58cedaff0670","category":"Tech"}
