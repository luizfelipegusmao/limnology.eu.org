{"title":"PSIX-8 A multistrain probiotic modifies fecal microbial populations of healthy adult cats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/570/7757609?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Probiotics can modulate the intestinal microbiota and benefit the hostâ€™s health, whereas environmental stressors can negatively impact the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), most commonly <span>Lactobacillus</span> and <span>Bifidobacterium</span> species, are well-known organisms with probiotic potential. The objective of this study was to determine the impact on the fecal microbial population of healthy Cats, after ingestion of a probiotic blend of <span>Lactobacillus acidophilus-286</span>, <span>Bifidobacterium animalis</span> subs. Lactis-689, and <span>Enterococcus faecium</span>-202. Thirty adult cats (15 male, 15 female; mean BW=3.39 kg; mean age=3.3 y) were enrolled in this placebo-controlled and blinded study. After a 7-d washout period, cats were allocated into two groups similar in terms of body weight, age, and sex. Cats were fed a complete dry extruded diet and at time 0 h on d-0 received orally 4 g of a placebo paste or probiotic paste corresponding to the target dose of 4x107 total CFU. Administration of the placebo or probiotic was repeated 12 h and 24 h after the first dose. Afterward, fecal scores were evaluated daily for 7 days. Fresh fecal samples were collected on days 0, 3, and 7 for microbial enumerations and fecal metabolite measurements. Fecal microbial count data did not conform to the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances, consequently, non-parametric tests were performed for comparisons. Fecal scores, dry matter, and metabolites were not different between groups. Fecal counts of <span>Lactobacillus spp</span>., <span>Bifidobacterium spp</span>., and <span>Enterococcus spp</span>. were greater on both d-3 and d-7 (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) in cats that consumed probiotics. Fecal counts of both Escherichia coli and <span>Clostridium perfringens</span> were fewer (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in cats that consumed probiotics. In conclusion, the consumption by cats on d-0 of a probiotic blend of <span>Lactobacillus acidophilus-286</span>, <span>Bifidobacterium animalis</span> subs. <span>Lactis-689</span>, and <span>Enterococcus faecium</span>-202 modified the intestinal microbiota up to 7 days after consumption, as evidenced by the increase of lactic acid bacteria and the decrease of <span>Escherichia coli</span> and <span>Clostridium perfringens</span> in feces.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"d9c86dcb3816cf67932b0c291540519422397bc94882334627bd9bf046d1fb74","category":"Environment"}
