{"title":"The Dentist&#039;s Role in Cultivating Environmental Awareness for Sustainability and promotion of Climate Consciousness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1372/v1","date":1716339599000,"content":"This study examines the attitudes and practices of dentists and dental students towards envi-ronmental issues within their professional context. Data was selected based on their responses on a Google Forms e-questionnaire, designed specifically for the study. The sample consisted of 78 professional dentists and 75 dental students in Greece and their attitudes towards environmental protection, awareness of the environmental impact of dental practices, and factors influencing the adoption of environmentally friendly practices were assessed. Results reveal generally positive attitudes towards environmental protection, with students demonstrating higher levels of proper waste management practices. Dentists express awareness of their environmental impact but ex-hibit varying levels of engagement in eco-friendly practices. Factors such as moral consciousness and believing in the severity of climate change significantly influence environmental awareness in dental practice. Notably, dental students exhibit greater environmental awareness compared to practicing dentists. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating environmental edu-cation into dental curricula and continuing education programs to foster sustainable practices in dental care. Future research could explore interventions to enhance environmental consciousness among practicing dentists and assess the long-term impact of environmental education initiatives on dental care sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a62d515b2513b475c0e626b410952764deb179f613071c4a8f7dbcb7cc9df2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
