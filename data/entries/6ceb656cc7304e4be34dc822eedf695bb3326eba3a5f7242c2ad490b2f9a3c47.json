{"title":"Utilizing Olive By-Products in the Diet of Bísaro Pigs: Enhancing the Value of the Breed&#039;s Dry-Cured Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0206/v1","date":1719908773000,"content":"This study aimed to evaluate the influence of olive cake on the diet of autochthonous Bísaro pigs in processed products. To this purpose, loins and “cachaços” were used and subjected to a manufacturing flowchart to obtain a dry-cured product. Both products were subjected to the same formulation, ingredients, and curing steps. Regarding the physicochemical composition, there were significant differences between the two products for the parameters of aw (p&amp;lt;0.001), moisture (p&amp;lt;0.001), total fat (p&amp;lt;0.001), protein (p&amp;lt;0.001), and haem pigments (p&amp;lt;0.001). As for the diet, it only significantly influences the NaCl content (p&amp;lt;0.05). Neither the product nor the diet had any influence (p&amp;gt;0.05) on the fraction of saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). However, there is a significant difference when it comes to omega 3 (p&amp;lt;0.05). These fatty acids increased with the addition of olive cake, and the diet with olive cake centrifuged by 25% had the highest value for both products. The increase in this omega 3 resulted in a decrease in the PUFA n-6/n-3 ratio (p&amp;lt;0.01) in the diets with olive cake, compared to the control diets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ceb656cc7304e4be34dc822eedf695bb3326eba3a5f7242c2ad490b2f9a3c47","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
