{"title":"Maize requires Embryo defective27 for embryogenesis and seedling development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/430/7514057?rss=1","date":1704844800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The essential role of plastid translation in embryogenesis has been established in many plants, but a retrograde signal triggered by defective plastid translation machinery that may leads to embryogenesis arrest remains unknown. In this study, we characterized an <span>embryo defective27</span> (<span>emb27</span>) mutant in maize (<span>Zea mays</span>), and cloning indicates that <span>Emb27</span> encodes the plastid ribosomal protein S13. The null mutant <span>emb27-1</span> conditions an <span>emb</span> phenotype with arrested embryogenesis; however, the leaky mutant <span>emb27-2</span> exhibits normal embryogenesis but an albino seedling-lethal phenotype. The <span>emb27-1/emb27-2</span> trans-heterozygotes display varying phenotypes from <span>emb</span> to normal seeds but albino seedlings. Analysis of the <span>Emb27</span> transcription levels in these mutants revealed that the <span>Emb27</span> expression level in the embryo corresponds with the phenotypic expression of the <span>emb27</span> mutants. In the W22 genetic background, an <span>Emb27</span> transcription level higher than 6% of the wild-type level renders normal embryogenesis, whereas lower than that arrests embryogenesis. Mutation of <span>Emb27</span> reduces the level of plastid 16S rRNA and the accumulation of the plastid-encoded proteins. As a secondary effect, splicing of several plastid introns was impaired in <span>emb27-1</span> and 2 other plastid translation-defective mutants, <span>emb15</span> and <span>emb16</span>, suggesting that plastome-encoded factors are required for the splicing of these introns, such as Maturase K (MatK). Our results indicate that EMB27 is essential for plastid protein translation, embryogenesis, and seedling development in maize and reveal an expression threshold of <span>Emb27</span> for maize embryogenesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"838d31f513144a288f993260dc751ac47b2b77b9ae14302d1f01db11fade72ce","category":"Environment"}
