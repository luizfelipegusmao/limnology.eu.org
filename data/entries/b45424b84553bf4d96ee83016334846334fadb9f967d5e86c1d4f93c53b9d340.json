Using some analysis technique, we are able to predict the number of limit cycles around the equilibrium and to develop a theoretical ap- proach to chaos transition in damped driven systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b45424b84553bf4d96ee83016334846334fadb9f967d5e86c1d4f93c53b9d340","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
