{"title":"Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders in Transplant Waitlist, VAD, and Heart Transplant Patients: A TriNetX Database Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1608/v1","date":1713960891000,"content":"Background/ObjectivesMental health and substance use disorders (MHD, SUD) affect cardiac allograft and VAD recipients and impact their quality of life and compliance. Limited research on MHDs and SUDs in transplant and MCS candidates and recipients. This study compares the incidence of MHDs and SUDs in transplant list, VAD, and post-transplant patients with that in heart failure patients. MethodsStudy cohorts were derived from the TriNetX using ICD-10 codes. Differences in incidence were examined using the log-rank test. Adults with mental health disorders before the window of time were excluded. Propensity score matching was performed using TriNetX to balance demographic and medical comorbidities. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. All comparisons were made between propensity-matched cohorts.  ResultsTransplant waitlist patients showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of anxiety, panic disorder, adjustment disorder, depression, mood disorder, alcohol use disorder, and eating disorder. Post-transplant patients showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of depression and opioid use compared to the heart failure population. VAD patients showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of depression and a statistically significant decrease in panic disorder and anxiety. ConclusionsThe results pave the pathway for further investigations on prevention and coping strategies because deterioration of mental health will significantly impact compliance with medications as well as patient survival and quality of life. The use of opioids for pain management in the early postoperative period should be further investigated to assess its impact on long-term substance use and addiction. .","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0570db01088ea9757afe62ee37b93bccac288395ae6b2e99046a27e57ce3d83d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
