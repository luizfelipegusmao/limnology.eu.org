{"title":"Metabolomic and Transcriptomic Analyses Revealed Lipid Differentiation Mechanisms in Agaricus bisporus at Ambient Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0547/v1","date":1718087851000,"content":"Agaricus bisporus is one of the most popular mushroom species in the world; however, mushrooms are highly susceptible to browning due to the absence of a protective cuticle layer and high respiration rate. The molecular mechanism underlying the process of mushroom browningneeds to be explored. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomic and metabolomic data from A. bisporusat ambient temperature. Specifically, a total of 263 significantly changed metabolites and 4492 differentially expressed genes were identified. Lipid metabolites associated with cell membrane degradation were predominantly up-regulated during ambient storage. Transcriptomic data further revealed the alterations of the expression of membrane lipid metabolism-related enzymes. Additionally, energy metabolic processes and products such as glycolysis and linoleic acid changed significantly during ambient storage, indicating their potential roles in the quality deterioration of A. bisporus. These findings provide new insights into the underlyingl ipidmetabolic mechanism of A. bisporus during postharvest ambient storage and will provide values for mushroom preservation techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78955ba2b6c7afeda43e078e928cf98fac8b994f5e31c9d592703d6a98b92674","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
