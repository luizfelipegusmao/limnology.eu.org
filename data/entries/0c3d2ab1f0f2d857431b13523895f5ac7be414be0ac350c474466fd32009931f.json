Restoration thinning is a potential management action to accelerate tree growth and promote large tree development in forests, yet trials have been limited and results have been mixed.\n\nWe conducted a large-scale trial to determine whether restoration thinning could accelerate the development of large trees in river red gum forests in Australia that had experienced widespread woody thickening and a decline of large trees due to long-term commercial timber harvesting and river regulation.\n\nThinning was conducted on 44 9-ha plots by removing trees &lt;40 cm diameter from around retained trees at a range of spacings. Initial tree densities ranged from ~260 to ~1860 trees per ha and 8%–86% of trees were removed by thinning. We monitored 1980 trees prior to thinning, and annually for 5 years post-thinning. We tested the effects of thinning intensity on diameter growth of different sized trees and explored whether long- and short-term water availability affected outcomes.\n\nThinning promoted the growth of small trees &lt;56 cm diameter, especially in drier sites during wet years. Higher thinning intensities reduced the growth rates of large trees (no smaller than 79.5 cm diameter) in wetter sites.\n\nFor medium- and large-sized trees, long- and short-term water availability were stronger drivers of tree growth than competition due to tree density.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Restoration thinning may accelerate tree growth in young river red gum forests where all trees are small. But restoration thinning may be ineffective or detrimental in multi-aged forests where the goal is to promote the growth rates of trees that are already medium to large in size.\n</p>","author":"Emma Gorrod, \nLaura White, \nMichael Bedward, \nBen Hope, \nNicholas Chu, \nDanielle McAllister","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"0c3d2ab1f0f2d857431b13523895f5ac7be414be0ac350c474466fd32009931f","category":"Environment"}
