The recruitment of carnivore insects in response to egg deposition is considered an indirect defence strategy that is widespread in the plant kingdom. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence showing that microbial colonization can influence the strength of plant responses to insect herbivory, yet no information is available on how beneficial microbes modulate indirect defences induced by insect egg deposition.\n\nIn this work, we evaluated the effects of inoculation with the beneficial soil fungus <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> strain T22 on a tritrophic system consisting of tomato, the southern green stink bug <i>Nezara viridula</i> and its associated egg parasitoid <i>Trissolcus basalis</i>. We used Y-tube olfactometer assays to evaluate the behavioural responses of the parasitoids to OIPVs emitted by plants colonized with beneficial soil microbes. We also used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to investigate whether and how root inoculation with <i>T. harzianum</i> T22 affects the chemical composition of induced plant volatiles.\n\nIn olfactometer assays, we found that root inoculation with <i>T. harzianum</i> T22 enhanced the attraction of the egg parasitoid towards tomato plants induced by <i>N. viridula</i> feeding and oviposition activities. In particular, the egg parasitoid preferred OIPVs emitted by tomato plants previously inoculated with <i>T. harzianum</i> T22 over OIPVs emitted by non-inoculated plants. Furthermore, chemical analysis showed that root inoculation with <i>T. harzianum</i> T22 resulted in changes in the composition of OIPVs, which was consistent with the behavioural observations. Among the compounds that strongly contribute to the chemical differences between OIPVs from non-inoculated and inoculated plants, chemical analysis identified green leaf volatiles ((<i>Z</i>)-3-hepten-1-ol, (<i>E</i>,<i>E</i>)-2,4-hexadienal), along with terpenoids (terpinen 4-ol, α-tujene and δ-elemene).\n\nTaken together our results indicate that beneficial soil microbes enhance indirect plant defences induced by feeding and oviposition, broadening our understanding of plant responses to insect eggs. Our results underscore the importance of taking into account the role of microorganisms to fully comprehend the intricate interactions among plants, herbivore eggs and their associated egg parasitoids.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/05/10/root-inoculation-with-beneficial-soil-microbes-enhances-indirect-plant-defenses-induced-by-insect-feeding-and-egg-deposition/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Tuğcan Alınç, \nEzio Peri, \nLivio Torta, \nSalvatore Guarino, \nStefano Colazza, \nBart Lievens, \nAntonino Cusumano","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"9f01fda8d5e030483f455986d5aebb643c299ec714428c706acec6761d3a2f69","category":"Environment"}
