{"title":"Determining the Urgency of Greening by Estimating the Amount of Greenery Resources in the Place of Residence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1598/v1","date":1716538628000,"content":"Areas covered with vegetation play a key role for life on Earth and should be inventoried in a clear and complete manner in order to improve the process of its protection and development. Data showing the amount of greenery in areas most deformed by humans, i.e. urbanized areas, are particularly important. Local governments need to know how to invest theirs limited sources in the quality of life of residents by supplementing the urban fabric with additional vegetation. The article presents a proposal for how to calculate the degree of greenness of cities based on remote sensing data. Additionally, a novel method was proposed to help in planning the development of areas covered with vegetation, taking into account the spatial distribution of the local population. The result was a comprehensive method presenting the actual natural situation in a specific city.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"857136729184dc4b95cf6c8245aee60f7f7e7b64af8107933b8bcac4b5ec532f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
