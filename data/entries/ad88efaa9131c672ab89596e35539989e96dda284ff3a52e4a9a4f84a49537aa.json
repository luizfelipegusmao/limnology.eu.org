{"title":"Targeted vibratory therapy as a treatment for proprioceptive dysfunction: Clinical trial in older patients with chronic low back pain","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306898","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Yoshihito Sakai, Yoshifumi Morita, Keitaro Kawai, Jo Fukuhara, Tadashi Ito, Kazunori Yamazaki, Tsuyoshi Watanabe, Norimitsu Wakao, Hiroki Matsui</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Proprioceptive function declines with age, leading to falls, pain, and difficulties in performing activities of daily living among older adults. Although individuals with low back pain (LBP) exhibit decreased lumbosacral proprioception in various postures, the mechanism by which reduced proprioceptive function causes LBP remains uncertain. Vibratory stimulation may enhance proprioceptive function; however, its efficacy in treating LBP has not been investigated. Thus, we investigated the feasibility of improving proprioceptive function and its effect on alleviating chronic LBP in older patients through targeted vibratory therapy (TVT) administration.</p> Methods <p>This single arm designed trial included older patients aged &gt;65 years with non-specific chronic LBP. TVT involved applying vibratory stimulation, matching the frequency of dysfunctional receptors, for 1 min daily over 14 days to activate proprioceptors; patients performed TVT three times daily at home. In cases of reduced proprioceptive function at multiple sites, TVT was aimed at the lowest frequency band value. LBP and proprioceptive function were evaluated at 2 weeks after TVT and at 2 weeks after the end of TVT in patients with declined proprioception in the trunk or lower extremities.</p> Results <p>Overall, 56 patients with chronic LBP were enrolled; 32 patients were recruited for treatment based on a proprioceptive dysfunction diagnosis and 24 patients were recruited with a normal diagnosis with no significant differences observed between the two sets of patients in sarcopenia-related factors and clinical proprioception-related characteristics. No patient had any adverse events. Two weeks after TVT, the numerical pain rating scale score improved to &lt;3 points in 78.1% of patients, with 73.1% of patients achieving a score of â‰¤ 3 points. Proprioceptive function improved in 81.3% of cases, and engagement in activities of daily living improved significantly.</p> Conclusions <p>TVT demonstrated efficacy in improving proprioception and alleviating LBP in older patients with impaired proprioceptive function without affecting non-targeted proprioceptors.</p>","author":"Yoshihito Sakai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ad88efaa9131c672ab89596e35539989e96dda284ff3a52e4a9a4f84a49537aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
