Vlachos</p>\r\nBackground <p>4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow MRI) can assess and measure the complex flow patterns of the right ventricle (RV) in congenital heart diseases, but its limited availability makes the broad application of intracardiac flow assessment challenging. Color Doppler imaging velocity reconstruction from conventional echocardiography is an emerging alternative, but its validity against 4D flow MRI needs to be established.</p> Objective <p>To compare intracardiac flow parameters measured by color Doppler velocity reconstruction (DoVeR) against parameters measured from 4D flow MRI.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed 20 subjects, including 7 normal RVs and 13 abnormal RVs (10 with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot, and 3 with atrial-level shunts). Intracardiac flow parameters such as relative pressure difference, vortex strength, total kinetic energy, and viscous energy loss were quantified using DoVeR and 4D flow MRI. The agreement between the two methods was determined by comparing the spatial fields and quantifying the cross-correlation and normalized difference between time-series measurements.</p> Results <p>The hemodynamic parameters obtained from DoVeR and 4D flow MRI showed similar flow characteristics and spatial distributions. The time evolutions of the parameters were also in good agreement between the two methods. The median correlation coefficient between the time-series of any parameter was between 0.87 and 0.92, and the median L2-norm deviation was between 10% to 14%.</p> Conclusions <p>Our study shows that DoVeR is a reliable alternative to 4D flow MRI for quantifying intracardiac hemodynamic parameters in the RV.</p>","author":"Brett A.
