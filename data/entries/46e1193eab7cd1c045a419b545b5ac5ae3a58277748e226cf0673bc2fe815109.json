{"title":"Suitability Analysis of Solar Energy Plant Sites in Yemen Using AHP and GIS Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0692/v1","date":1715563327000,"content":"This research aimed to determine the most viable locations for establishing solar energy facilities in Yemen through the utilization of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Best-Worst Method (BWM), and Geographic Information System (GIS). A total of twelve key criteria were meticulously selected and evaluated based on their impact on the appropriateness of sites for solar power plants. These criteria were amalgamated using a weighted overlay tool, resulting in a map that classified regions as either optimal, highly suitable, or suitable. The findings of the study indicated that the eastern, southern, and northern parts of Yemen are prime candidates for solar energy installations due to their moderate climate and flat topography. On the other hand, the western regions were deemed less favorable. The breakdown of site classifications revealed that 38% of areas were optimal, 61% were highly suitable, and only 1% were considered suitable, based on the assigned weights from the AHP and BWM methodologies. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the impact of adjusting the weights of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and slope on site classifications. A minor increase in the weights of GHI (from 30% to 31%) and slope (from 10% to 11%) resulted in a significant alteration in the suitability categories, highlighting the importance of weight adjustments in multi-criteria decision-making processes. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the effectiveness of AHP, BWM, and GIS in assessing site suitability for solar energy facilities, as well as the significance of sensitivity analyses. These approaches provide valuable insights for decision-makers, aiding in strategic planning and fostering sustainable energy development in Yemen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46e1193eab7cd1c045a419b545b5ac5ae3a58277748e226cf0673bc2fe815109","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
