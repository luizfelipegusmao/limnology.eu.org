{"title":"Analysis of Azure Zero Trust Architecture Implementation for Mid-size Organizations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1454/v1","date":1721283831000,"content":"The Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) security system follows the \"never trust, always verify\" principle. The process constantly verifies users and devices trying to access resources. This paper describes how Microsoft Azure uses ZTA to enforce strict identity verification and access rules across the cloud environment to improve security. Implementation is time-consuming and difficult. Azure's extensive services and customizations require careful design and implementation. Azure administrators struggle to navigate and change configurations due to its complex user interface (UI). Each Azure ecosystem component must meet ZTA criteria. ZTA's comprehensive policy definitions, multi-factor and pass-wordless authentication, and other advanced features are tested in a mid-size business scenario. These configuration changes require a solid grasp of Azure's architecture and Zero Trust. Implementing an Azure ZTA reduces vulnerabilities and restricts authorized users' access to critical resources. Implementation is time-consuming and expensive, requires a significant commitment to changing IT procedures, and can be confusing because the same features are available in multiple places. Azure ZTA has shown great potential for both hybrid and cloud-native companies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59adea1237d3e203d2410bb75bac4572c511c96ec0442d1d36b5c8458589987a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
