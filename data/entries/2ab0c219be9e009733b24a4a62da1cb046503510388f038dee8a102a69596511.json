{"title":"Is There a Link between the Microbiome and Autoimmune Aspects of Long COVID-19?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0616/v1","date":1718113760000,"content":"Long COVID-19 affects a significant percentage of survivors and is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including weariness and mental fog as well as emotional symptoms like worry and sadness. COVID-19 is closely linked to the autoimmune disorders that are becoming more prevalent worldwide and are linked to the immune system hyperactivation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) development, and molecular mimicry pathways. Long-term COVID-related autoimmune responses include a watchful immune system, altered innate and adaptive immune cells, autoantigens secreted by living or dead neutrophils, and high concentrations of autoantibodies directed against different proteins. The microbiome, which consists of billions of bacteria living in the human body, is essential for controlling immune responses and supporting overall health. The microbiome can affect the course of long-term COVID-associated autoimmunity, including the degree of illness, the rate of recovery, and the onset of autoimmune reactions. Although the precise role of the microbiome in long COVID autoimmunity is still being investigated, new studies indicate that probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary changes—interventions that target the microbiome—may be able to reduce autoimmune reactions and enhance long-term outcomes for COVID-19 survivors. It is clear that more research is required to precisely understand how the microbiome affects COVID-19-related autoimmunity and to create tailored treatment plans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ab0c219be9e009733b24a4a62da1cb046503510388f038dee8a102a69596511","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
