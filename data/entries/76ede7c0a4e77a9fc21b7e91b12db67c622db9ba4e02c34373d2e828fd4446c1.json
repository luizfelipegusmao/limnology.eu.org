{"title":"Formation and prediction of heterocyclic amines and N‐nitrosamines in smoked sausages using back propagation artificial neural network","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13291?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Heterocyclic amines (HAs) and <i>N</i>-nitrosamines (NAs) are formed easily during the thermal processing of food, and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that consuming HAs and NAs increases the risk of cancer. However, there are few studies on the application of back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) models to simultaneously predict the content of HAs and NAs in sausages. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cooking time and temperature, smoking time and temperature, and fat-to-lean ratio on the formation of HAs and NAs in smoked sausages, and to predict their total content based on the BP-ANN model.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>With an increase in processing time, processing temperature and fat ratio, the content of HAs and NAs in smoked sausages increased significantly, while the content of HA precursors and nitrite residues decreased significantly. The optimal network topology of the BP-ANN model was 5–11–2, the correlation coefficient values for training, validation, testing and all datasets were 0.99228, 0.99785, 0.99520 and 0.99369, respectively, and the mean squared error value of the best validation performance was 0.11326. The bias factor and the accuracy factor were within acceptable limits, and the predicted values approximated the true values, indicating that the model has good predictive performance.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The contents of HAs and NAs in smoked sausages were significantly influenced by the cooking conditions, smoking conditions and fat ratio. The BP-ANN model has high application value in predicting the contents of HAs and NAs in sausages, which provides a theoretical basis for the suppression of carcinogen formation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yajun Zhou, \nShimin Zhai, \nGuangming Yao, \nJihong Li, \nZongping Li, \nZhiyuan Ma, \nQingshu Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"76ede7c0a4e77a9fc21b7e91b12db67c622db9ba4e02c34373d2e828fd4446c1","category":"Environment"}
