{"title":"Effect of Temperature and Molarity on the Evaluation of Antimicrobial, Cytotoxic, and Antioxidant Activities of the Bio-Oil from A&ccedil;a&iacute; Seed (Euterpe oleracea, Mart.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0184/v1","date":1722609885000,"content":"Açaí, a fruit from the Amazon, is valuable both economically and nutritionally. Its seeds, often discarded, can be transformed into bio-oil through pyrolysis (a thermochemical degradation process of residual biomass), providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. This study investigates how temperature and molarity influence the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities of the produced bio-oil. Tests were conducted using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and assays to evaluate antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities at different temperatures (350, 400, and 450 °C) and molarities (0.5 M, 1.0 M, and 2.0 M). Phenolic compounds were the most abundant in the bio-oil (55.70%), followed by cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons (11.89%) and linear hydrocarbons (9.64%). Despite a reduction in oxygenated compounds, the bio-oil maintained bacteriostatic activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus across various temperature ranges, particularly at 350 °C. Antioxidant activity was highest at 350 °C and at lower molarities. Additionally, lower concentrations of acid impregnation exhibited cytotoxic effects at higher temperatures. Thus, bio-oil from açaí seeds produced via pyrolysis demonstrates potential for antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, suggesting viability for further testing at dilutions with lower cytotoxicity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"acca5d60bbc28969e561aea62c1df2b6656948d495e7b23bc278060f033c94d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
