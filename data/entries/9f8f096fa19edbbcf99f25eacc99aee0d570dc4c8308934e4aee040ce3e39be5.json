{"title":"Robotic versus Alternative Approaches for Thymoma Resection: A Comparative Analysis of Short-Term Results","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0393/v1","date":1722920158000,"content":"OBJECTIVE\nThe optimal surgical approach for thymoma resection is still an object of debate. The increasing experience in robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) has led to the progressive affirmation of this technique as a valid alternative to Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS), sternotomy and thoracotomy in this setting. The present study aims to compare the post-operative and short-term results of RATS Thymectomy for thymoma with those of other main surgical approaches (sternotomy, thoracotomy, and VATS) from a high-volume single center.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBetween May 2021 - September 2023, 40 consecutive patients underwent RATS Thymectomy for I to limited-stage III thymoma in our center. Three homogenous groups of consecutive patients who received thymic surgery by main alternative approaches (sternotomy, thoracotomy, VATS) over the last 5 years, were identified in order to perform a comparative analysis. Data of operative technique, time of surgery, associated resections, conversion rate, overall morbidity, tumor size, radicality, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and cosmetic results were recorded and compared between each control group and the RATS group. \n\nRESULTS\nTumor size was higher in the sternotomy group, but not significantly. The mean operative time of RATS interventions was significantly lower than that of sternotomy and VATS. It was significantly shorter compared to thoracotomy if excluding docking-undocking time. Higher rate of associated adjacent structures resection was reported in the sternotomy group (p=0.005). Conversion rate was significantly higher in VATS group (p= 0.026) compared to RATS. Postoperative pain at 24 and 48 hours was significantly lower in RATS group compared to the others. Improved cosmetics results were reported after RATS compared to sternotomy (p= 0.0001) and thoracotomy (p= 0.001) groups, with a trend towards better results compared to VATS (p=0.05). Length of hospital stay was shorter in the RATS group with a significant difference vs. the sternotomy group (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f8f096fa19edbbcf99f25eacc99aee0d570dc4c8308934e4aee040ce3e39be5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
