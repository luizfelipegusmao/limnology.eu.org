{"title":"Acoustic Transmission Measurements for the Mechanical Properties Extraction of Complex 3D MEMS Transducers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0183/v1","date":1722827477000,"content":"Recent publications on acoustic MEMS transducers present a new three-dimensional folded diaphragm that utilizes buried in-plane vibrating structures to increase the active area from a small chip volume. Characterization of the mechanical properties plays a key role in the development of new MEMS transducers, whereby established measurement methods are usually tailored to structures close to the sample surface. In order to access the lateral vibrations, extensive and destructive sample preparation is required. This work presents a new passive measurement technique that combines acoustic transmission measurements and Lumped-element modelling. For diaphragms of different lengths, compliances between 0.08 ∙ 10-15 and 1.04 ∙ 10-15 m³/Pa are determined without using destructive or complex preparations. In particular, for lengths above 1000 µm, the results differ from numerical simulations only by 4% or less.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"beb8476451d20b13c8c74a8d38351bd2990915c5fa7228e39855cea8f09255de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
