{"title":"Managerial Myopia and Enterprise ESG Performance &ndash; Based on the Co-inhibiting Effect of Green Investment and Continuous Innovation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0301/v1","date":1722905898000,"content":"Under the new pattern of “double carbon” development, good ESG performance is the best way to promote the sustainable development of enterprises, and the ESG investment strategies are directly affected by the strategic vision of managers. Based on the upper echelons theory and stakeholder theory, this paper takes Chinese A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2022 as samples to empirically analyze the impact of managerial myopia on corporate ESG performance. The results show that managerial myopia significantly inhibits corporate ESG performance, mainly by inhibiting corporate green investment and green innovation sustainability. Furthermore, for state-owned enterprises (SOE), heavy polluting enterprises (HPE) and non-high-tech enterprises, the inhibitory effect of manager myopia on ESG performance is stronger. When the enterprise is in the growth stage, the above inhibition effect is more severe. For external governance, the greater the analyst attention and public environmental attention are, the more conducive they are to alleviating the restraining effect of managerial myopia on enterprise ESG performance. Therefore, effectively improving the time cognition level of managers and strengthening external supervision have become important measures for comprehensively optimizing the ESG performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d81f9a1e0bffe457d9d7db7de71aca794e7fd8c7088d26fc35df0f2ef1e903f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
