In addition, a specimen representing the first record of <i>Dysommina orientalis</i> in Vietnamese water is documented.</p>","author":"Van Quang Vo, \nHsuan‐Ching Ho, \nHa Viet Dao, \nThinh Cong Tran","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"ea708cde008bc0138a46d55058f1f96fc127afbdb5e533d0fbd70eeae4cb732a","category":"Environment"}
