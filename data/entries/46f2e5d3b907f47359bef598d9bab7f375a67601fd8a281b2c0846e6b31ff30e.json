{"title":"Cannabidiol and Beta-Caryophyllene Combination Attenuates Diabetic Neuropathy by Inhibiting NLRP3 Inflammasome/NF&kappa;B through the AMPK/SIRT3/Nrf2 Axis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1827/v1","date":1714281218000,"content":"Background In this study we investigated in detail the role of cannabidiol (CBD), Beta-caryophyllene (BC), or their combinations in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DN). The key factors that contribute to DN include mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Methods Briefly, Streptozotocin (STZ) (55 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to induce DN in Sprague Dawley rats and performed procedures including Randall Sellito Calipers, Von Frey Aesthesiometer, hot plate, and cold plate methods to determine mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in vivo. The blood flow to the nerves was assessed by using the Laser Doppler device. Schwann cells were exposed to high glucose (HG) at a dose of 30 mM to induce hyperglycemia and DCFDA, JC1 &amp; Mitosox staining were done to determine mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxides in-vitro. The rats were administered i.p with BC (30mg/kg), CBD (15mg/kg), or combination while Schwann cells were treated with 3.65 µM CBD, 75 µM BC, or combination to assess their role in DN amelioration. Results Our results revealed that exposure to BC and CBD diminished HG-induced hyperglycemia in Schwann cells, in part, through reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxides. Further, BC and CBD combination treatment in-vivo could prevent the deterioration of mitochondrial quality control system by promoting autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis while improving blood flow. CBD and BC treatments also reduced pain hypersensitivity to hyperalgesia and allodynia with increased antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action in diabetic rats. These in vivo effects were attributed to significant upregulation of AMPK, SIRT3, Nrf2, PINK1, PARKIN, LC3B, Beclin1 and TFAM functions while downregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome, NFκB, COX2 and p62 activity was noted as determined by western blotting. Conclusion the present studies demonstrated that STZ &amp; HG induced oxidative and nitrosative stress play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. We find, for the first time, that CBD and BC combination ameliorate DN via modulating the mitochondrial quality control system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46f2e5d3b907f47359bef598d9bab7f375a67601fd8a281b2c0846e6b31ff30e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
