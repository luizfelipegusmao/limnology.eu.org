{"title":"Periodic and Quasi periodic Orbits in the Collinear Four-Body Problem: A Variational Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1015/v1","date":1720771965000,"content":"This paper investigates the periodic and quasi-periodic orbits in the symmetric collinear four-body problem through a variational approach. In Section 3, we analyze the conditions under which homographic solutions minimize the action functional. We demonstrate that these solutions for four equal masses arranged in a linear configuration are indeed the minimizers of the action functional and compute the minimum value of the action functional for these solutions. Additionally, we employ numerical experiments using Poincar√© sections to explore the existence and stability of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions within this dynamical system. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the variational principles in celestial mechanics and reveal complex dynamical behaviors that are crucial for further studies in multi-body problems. The findings have significant implications for theoretical research and practical applications in astrodynamics and space mission planning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23d98a46f62a3ead1f890f4c51bab26fde3b9b903dad6d77f0dd7285faaafe3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
