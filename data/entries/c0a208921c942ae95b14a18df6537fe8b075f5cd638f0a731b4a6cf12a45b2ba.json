{"title":"Exploring the Synergy of Advanced Lighting Controls, Building Information Modeling and Internet of Things for Sustainable and Energy Efficient Buildings: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0572/v1","date":1725878009000,"content":"Buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of global energy consumption, putting pressure on the construction industry to mitigate its environmental impact. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions to reduce power consumption, particularly in lighting systems. The studyâ€™s primary objective was to investigate novel integrated lighting solutions that significantly reduce energy use and they explore their enhancement through Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to further improve energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint in buildings. Hence, this literature review aimed to examine energy-saving actions, retrofitting practices and interventions across a range of multi-use buildings worldwide over the past six years. The objective was to diagnose the goals being undertaken and ultimately validate new actions and contributions to minimise energy consumption. First, daylight harvesting and retrofitting solutions were examined in conjunction with the latest technologies, also referred to the external shadings. In consequence of this matter, comes the lack or unappropriated coordination, and so waste of energy, between daylight and electrical lighting. Secondly, how the integration of BIM facilitates the design process, providing a complete overview of all the variables of the building, thus improving indoor daylight performance and proper lighting with energy analysis. Lastly, the review addresses the role of IoT in providing real-time data from sensor networks, allowing for continuous monitoring of building conditions. This systematic literature review explores the integration of the fields to address the urgent need for innovative strategies and sustainability in the built environment. Furthermore, it thoroughly analyses the current state of the art, identifying best practices, emerging trends and concrete insight for architects, engineers, and researchers. The goal is to promote the widespread adoption of low-carbon systems and encourage collaboration among industry professionals and researchers to advance sustainable building design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0a208921c942ae95b14a18df6537fe8b075f5cd638f0a731b4a6cf12a45b2ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
