{"title":"Changes in blood serum parameters in farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during a piscine lactococcosis outbreak","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13994?af=R","date":1719908302000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The aquaculture sector plays a vital role in global food security, yet it grapples with significant challenges posed by infectious diseases. Piscine lactococcosis is one of the significant threats in rainbow trout aquaculture due to its potential to cause severe economic losses through mortalities, reduced growth rates, and increased susceptibility to other pathogens. It poses challenges in disease management strategies, impacting the sustainability and profitability of rainbow trout farming. The current study focuses on the variations in serum blood parameters of farmed rainbow trout <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i> during a lactococcosis outbreak caused by <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>. Blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, fish were examined for parasites and bacteria, and DNA from bacterial colonies was PCR-amplified and sequenced for identification. Overall, 13 biochemical parameters, including proteins, enzymes, lipids, chemicals, and minerals, were measured in serum blood samples from both diseased and healthy fish. The results indicate significant alterations in the levels of these parameters during the outbreak, highlighting the impact of infections on the blood profile of farmed rainbow trout. Urea levels were significantly higher in diseased fish compared to controls, and creatinine, phosphorus, and magnesium also showed similar trends. Alanine aminotransferase and total protein levels were higher in control fish. Chloride levels differed significantly between groups. Iron levels were higher in controls and lower in diseased fish. No significant differences were found in other parameters. This study reveals significant changes in serum blood parameters of rainbow trout during a lactococcosis outbreak caused by <i>L. garvieae</i>. These changes highlight the potential of these parameters as tools for monitoring health status, stress, and aquaculture management. Continuous monitoring can provide valuable insights into disease severity and overall fish health, aiding in the development of improved management practices. The presented data contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of piscine lactococcosis and developing effective mitigation strategies for farmed rainbow trout.</p>","author":"Giuseppe Esposito, \nStefania Bergagna, \nSilvia Colussi, \nKhalid Shahin, \nRoberta Rosa, \nDonatella Volpatti, \nCaterina Faggio, \nCamilla Mossotto, \nAlice Gabetti, \nAlessandra Maganza, \nElena Bozzetta, \nMarino Prearo, \nPaolo Pastorino","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"a715e03f693494e8fe4554bcf1fc978ff1caa2112f834f000ea1681ead4afc1f","category":"Environment"}
