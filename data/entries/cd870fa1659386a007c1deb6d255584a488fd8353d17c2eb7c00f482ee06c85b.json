{"title":"Exploring Cervical Cancer Screening Uptake Among Women in the United States: Impact of Social Determinants of Health and Psychosocial Determinants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0584/v1","date":1723099751000,"content":"We assessed the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) and psychosocial factors on screening behavior in a nationally representative sample of women in the US. A retrospective population-level cross-sectional sample was extracted from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey. Descriptive statistics were conducted for demographic characteristics and covariates. Population-based estimates with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were produced for Pap testing behaviors across study years. We used logistic regression models to assess Pap testing differences based on SDOH and psychosocial factors, adjusting for covariates, with a significance level of 0.05 for hypothesis testing. Women (n=2,224) with a mean age of 46.96 participated in the study. Our study found that 90% of women were interested in cervical cancer screening, with an 80% actual screening rate. Screening rates differed by age group and rurality. SDOH and psychosocial factors were associated with participantsâ€™ interest in screening and in actual screening behavior. The impacts of SDOH and psychosocial factors on screening behavior were 3% and 1%, respectively. The SDOH and psychosocial factors are associated with the uptake of cervical cancer screening among women in the United States. Policies must be directed at bridging the gap created by these SDOHs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd870fa1659386a007c1deb6d255584a488fd8353d17c2eb7c00f482ee06c85b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
