{"title":"The Recent Advancement of Graphene‐Based Cathode Material for Rechargeable Zinc‐Air Batteries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1607/v1","date":1721383365000,"content":"Graphene-based materials (GBMs) are a prospective material of choice for rechargeable battery electrodes because of their unique set of qualities, which include tunable interlayer channels, high specific surface area, and strong electrical conductivity characteristics. The market for commercial rechargeable batteries is now dominated by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), however issues with organic electrolyte safety, high lithium pricing, and limited lithium resources have hindered LIB development. Zinc-based rechargeable batteries have emerged as a viable substitute for rechargeable batteries due to their affordability, safety, and improved performance. This review article explores recent developments in the synthesis and advancement of GBMs for rechargeable zinc‐air batteries (ZABs), and common graphene-based electrocatalyst types. An outlook on the difficulties and probable future paths of this extremely promising field of study is provided at the end.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3bc3bc674627ef010fa0729f4c87432f49dd4ccb19687ace72929bc67c93d5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
