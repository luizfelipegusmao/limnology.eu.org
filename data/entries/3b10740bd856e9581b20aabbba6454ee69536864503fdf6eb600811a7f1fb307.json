{"title":"Teaching at the intersection of science and society: An activity on healthcare disparities","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/doi/10.1093/biomethods/bpad041/7511848?rss=1","date":1704412800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding the relationship between science and society is an objective of science education and is included as a core competency in the AAAS <span>Vision and Change</span> guidelines for biology education. However, traditional undergraduate biology instruction emphasizes scientific practice and generally avoids potentially controversial issues at the intersection of biology and society. By including these topics in biology coursework, instructors can challenge damaging ideologies and systemic inequalities that have influenced science, such as biological essentialism and health disparities. Specifically, an <span>ideologically aware curriculum</span> highlights how ideologies and paradigms shape our biological knowledge base and the application of that knowledge. Ideologically aware lessons emphasize the relationship between science and society with an aim to create more transparent, scientifically accurate, and inclusive postsecondary biology classrooms. Here we expand upon our ideologically aware curriculum with a new activity that challenges undergraduate biology students to consider the impacts of healthcare disparities. This lesson allows instructors to directly address systemic inequalities and allows students to connect biomedical sciences to real-world issues. Implementing an ideologically aware curriculum enables students to challenge prevailing worldviews and better address societal problems that lead to exclusion and oppression.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"3b10740bd856e9581b20aabbba6454ee69536864503fdf6eb600811a7f1fb307","category":"Environment"}
