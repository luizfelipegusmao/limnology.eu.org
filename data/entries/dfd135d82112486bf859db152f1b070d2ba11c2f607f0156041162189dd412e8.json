{"title":"Experimental Investigation on Shear Behavior of Non-stirrup Uhpc Beams under Larger Shear Span-Depth Ratios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1459/v1","date":1711351388000,"content":"Due to the extraordinary mechanical properties of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), the shear stirrups in UHPC beams could potentially be removed. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of beam height and steel fiber volume content on the shear behavior of non-stirrup UHPC beams under a larger shear span-depth ratio (up to 2.8). Eight beams were designed and fabricated, including six non-stirrup UHPC beams and two comparing stirrup-reinforced normal concrete (NC) beams. The experimental results demonstrated that the volume content of steel fiber could be a crucial factor affecting the ductility, cracking strength, and shear strength of non-stirrup UHPC beams and altering their failure modes. Additionally, the height of the beam had a considerable effect on its shear resistance. This study revealed that the French standard formulae were more accurate for the UHPC beams with larger shear span-depth ratios and PCI-2021 formulae greatly overestimate the shear capacity of UHPC beams with larger shear span-depth ratios. Xuâ€™s formulae were more accurate for the steel fiber-reinforced UHPC beams with larger shear span-depth ratios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dfd135d82112486bf859db152f1b070d2ba11c2f607f0156041162189dd412e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
