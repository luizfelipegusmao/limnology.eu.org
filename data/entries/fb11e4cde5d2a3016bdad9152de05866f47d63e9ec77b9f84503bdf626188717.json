{"title":"Hiding in the mists: molecular phylogenetic position and description of a new genus and species of snake (Dipsadidae: Xenodontinae) from the remote cloud forest of the Lost World","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/200/2/505/7243361?rss=1","date":1692144000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pantepui <span>s.l.</span> is a remote, biodiverse region of ~400 000 km<sup>2</sup> containing at least five endemic reptile genera and a number of ancient vertebrate lineages. Here, we describe an additional endemic snake genus and species, <span>Paikwaophis kruki</span><strong>gen. nov., sp. nov.</strong> (Dipsadidae: Xenodontinae), recently collected in the Pantepui cloud forest that sits at the base of the steep cliffs of Roraima-tepui and Wei-Assipu-tepui (table mountains of the Eastern Tepui Chain) in Guyana, South America. Multilocus molecular data strongly support <strong><span>Paikwaophis</span></strong><strong>gen. nov.</strong> to be most closely related to <span>Xenopholis</span> Peters, 1869, although both genera are strikingly different morphologically. Osteological and other phenotypic data suggest that <span>Paikwaophis</span> is semi-fossorial; its diet includes minute lizards. <span>Paikwaophis</span> is currently the only known Pantepui endemic snake genus. The immature female holotype is the only known specimen.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"fb11e4cde5d2a3016bdad9152de05866f47d63e9ec77b9f84503bdf626188717","category":"Environment"}
