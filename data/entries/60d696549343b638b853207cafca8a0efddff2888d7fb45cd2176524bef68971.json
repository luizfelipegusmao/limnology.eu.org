{"title":"A Fibration of Fermat Surface in Characteristic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2180/v1","date":1722056558000,"content":"Let S be a Fermat surface of degree 5 and let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p = 2. We give a fibration ƒ: S → {P}_k^1 and investigate the geometric properties of fiber of ƒ. Furthermore, we investigate the fibration-preserving automorphisms group Aut_{{P}_k^1}(S) of ƒ. We obtain that Aut_{{P}_k^1}(S) is a p-group of order 256.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60d696549343b638b853207cafca8a0efddff2888d7fb45cd2176524bef68971","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
