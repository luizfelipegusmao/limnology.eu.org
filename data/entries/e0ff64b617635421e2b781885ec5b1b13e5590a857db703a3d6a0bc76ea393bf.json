{"title":"A Review of LSAMP in Tumorigenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0085/v1","date":1727794970000,"content":"This review aims to describe the role of Limbic System-Associated Membrane Protein (LSAMP) in normal and pathophysiology and its potential implications in oncogenesis. We have summarized research articles reporting the role of LSAMP in the development of a variety of malignancies such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and epithelial ovarian cancer. We also examine current understandings of how defects in LSAMP gene function may contribute to oncogenesis. Finally, this review discuss-es the implications of future LSAMP research and clinical applications.\nRecent Findings LSAMP has been originally described as a surface adhesion glycoprotein expressed on cortical and subcortical neuronal somas and dendrites during the development of the limbic system. It is categorized as part of the IgLON immunoglobulin superfamily of cell-adhesion molecules and is involved in regulating neurite outgrowth and neural synapse generation. LSAMP is both aberrantly expressed and implicated in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders due to its role in the formation of specific neuronal connections within the brain. Additionally, LSAMP has been shown to support brain plasticity via the formation of neuronal synapses and is involved in modulating the hypothalamus in anxiogenic environments. In murine studies, loss of LSAMP expression was associated with decreased sensitivity to amphetamine, increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines, increased hyperactivity in new environments, abnormal social behavior, decreased aggressive behavior, and decreased anxiety. Findings have suggest-ed that LSAMP plays a role in attuning serotonergic activity as well as GABA activity. Given its importance to limbic system development, LSAMP has also been studied in the context of suicide.\nIn malignancies, LSAMP plays a significant role as a putative tumor suppressor, the loss of which leads to more aggressive phenotypes and mortality from metastatic disease. Loss of the LSAMP gene facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or EMT, where epithelial cells lose adhesion and gain the motile properties associated with mesenchymal cells. Additionally, LSAMP and the function of the RTK pathway have been implicated in tumorigenesis through the modulation of RTK expression in cell membranes and the activation of second messenger pathways and Î²-catenin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0ff64b617635421e2b781885ec5b1b13e5590a857db703a3d6a0bc76ea393bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
