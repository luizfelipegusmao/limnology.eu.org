{"title":"Automated extraction and LC–MS-MS analysis of 11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol isomers and prevalence in authentic urine specimens","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/4/197/7641815?rss=1","date":1712361600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>11-Nor-9-carboxy-Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCCOOH) is the most frequently detected illicit drug metabolite in the military drug testing program. An increasing number of specimens containing unresolved Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCCOOH prompted the addition of this analyte to the Department of Defense drug testing panel. A method was developed and validated for the quantitative confirmation of the carboxylated metabolites of Δ<sup>8</sup>- and Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC in urine samples utilizing automated pipette tip dispersive solid-phase extraction and analysis by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS). Analytes were separated isocratically over an 8.5-min runtime and detected on an MS-MS equipped with an electrospray ionization source operated in negative mode. A single point calibrator (15 ng/mL) forced through zero demonstrated linearity from 3 to 1,000 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precision were ≤9.1%, and bias was within ±14.1% for Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCCOOH and Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCCOOH. No interferences were found after challenging the method with different over-the-counter drugs, prescription pharmaceuticals, drugs of abuse and several cannabinoids and cannabinoid metabolites, including Δ<sup>10</sup>-THCCOOH. Urine specimens presumptively positive by immunoassay (<span>n</span> = 2,939; 50 ng/mL Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCCOOH cutoff) were confirmed with this analytical method. Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCCOOH and Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCCOOH were present together above the 15 ng/mL cutoff in 33% of specimens. However, nearly one-third of the specimens analyzed were positive for Δ<sup>8</sup>-THCCOOH only. This manuscript describes the first validated automated extraction and confirmation method for Δ<sup>8</sup>- and Δ<sup>9</sup>-THCCOOH in urine that provides adequate analyte separation in urine specimens with extreme isomer abundance ratios.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"5ff450782d6c1f4f266094272ee12a51e7377ae3a11e7bd41b1a681137f51cd3","category":"Environment"}
