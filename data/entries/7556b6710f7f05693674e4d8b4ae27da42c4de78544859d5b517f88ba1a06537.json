{"title":"The unwanted cadmium: Uncovering the genetic factors for cadmium accumulation in wheat","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/684/7700341?rss=1","date":1719446400000,"content":"<span>Cadmium (Cd) is a nonbeneficial heavy metal that is toxic to living organisms. Nevertheless, it enters our food chain. Common staple cereals, such as wheat and rice, accumulate Cd in their grains as a “hidden toxicant” and can cause organ damage in humans (<a href=\"#kiae360-B2\">Clemens et al. 2013</a>). Although Cd is naturally present in trace quantities, its contamination in agricultural farmland caused by mining, industrial emissions, and fertilizer provides abundant Cd available for uptake by crops (<a href=\"#kiae360-B4\">Liang et al. 2024</a>). Most plants do not have specialized transporters for Cd. Instead, because it is present as a divalent cation, it gets into roots through other transporters, for example, those optimized for iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) or manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) ions (<a href=\"#kiae360-B3\">Huang et al. 2024</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7556b6710f7f05693674e4d8b4ae27da42c4de78544859d5b517f88ba1a06537","category":"Environment"}
