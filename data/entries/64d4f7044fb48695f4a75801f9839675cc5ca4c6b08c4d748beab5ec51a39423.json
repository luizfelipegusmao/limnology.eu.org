{"title":"A decrease in ciliary motility induced by a CO2/HCO3--free solution characteristic of ciliated human nasal epithelial cells: acceleration of HCO3- transport by carbonic anhydrase IV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2013/v1","date":1719547632000,"content":"An application of CO2/HCO3--free solution (Zero-CO2) did not increase intracellular pH (pHi) in ciliated human nasal epithelial cells (c-hNECs), leading to no increase in the beating frequency (CBF) or bend distance (CBD, an index of amplitude). This study demonstrated that the pHi of the c-hNECs expressing carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) is high (7.64), while that of the ciliated human bronchial epithelial cells (c-hBECs) expressing no CAIV is low (7.10). Upon applying Zero-CO2, an extremely high level of pHi caused the pHi, CBF and CBD to decrease, while a low level of pHi caused them to increase. The high pHi was generated by a high rate of HCO3- influx via interac-tions between CAIV and Na+/HCO3- cotransport (NBC) in c-hNECs. An NBC inhibitor (S0859) decreased the pHi and CBF, and Zero-CO2 application increased the CBF in S0859-treated c-hNECs. In conclusion, the interactions of CAIV and NBC maximize the HCO3- influx to increase the pHi in c-hNECs. This novel mechanism causes the pHi to decrease, leading to no increase in CBF and CBD in c-hNECs upon Zero-CO2 application, and appears to play a crucial role in maintaining pHi, CBF and CBD in c-hNECs periodically exposed to air (0.04% CO2) with respiration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64d4f7044fb48695f4a75801f9839675cc5ca4c6b08c4d748beab5ec51a39423","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
