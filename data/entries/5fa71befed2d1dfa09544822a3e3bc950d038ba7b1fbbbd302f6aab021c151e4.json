{"title":"Novel PCR-Based Technology for the Detection of Sunflower in Edible and Used Cooking Oils","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2270/v1","date":1727685648000,"content":"Reliable detection of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) in edible and used cooking oil (UCO) is crucial for the sustainable production of food and biodiesel. In this study, a variety of sunflower oils (crude, cold pressed, extra virgin, refined, and UCO) were examined using different methods of DNA extraction and PCR amplification to develop an efficient technology for the identification of sunflower in oils. DNA extraction kits such as NucleoSpin Food, DNeasy mericon Food, and Olive Oil DNA Isolation as well as modified CTAB method were found to be able to isolate amplifiable genomic DNA from highly processed oils. Novel uniplex, double, and nested PCR systems targeting the sunflower-specific helianthinin gene were developed for efficient identification of sunflower. New sunflower DNA markers were revealed by uniplex PCRs. The combination of modified CTAB and nested PCR was demonstrated as a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective technology for detecting traces of sunflower in 700 Î¼l of highly processed oil, including refined and used cooking oil. The study will contribute to both the food industry and the energy sector as developed methods can be used for oil authenticity testing in food and biodiesel production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fa71befed2d1dfa09544822a3e3bc950d038ba7b1fbbbd302f6aab021c151e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
