{"title":"Environmental Protection Tax (EPT) and Its Influence on Firms&#039; Financial Health and Innovation Capabilities: Evidence from Chinese Listed Companies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1846/v1","date":1729706584000,"content":"This study examines the impact of the environmental protection tax (EPT) on the liquidity and green technological innovation of listed companies in China from 2013 to 2023. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, we analyze the short-term financial consequences of the EPT, focusing on liquidity ratios and at the same time its effects on innovation through investments in research and development are examined. The results suggest that the EPT significantly reduces corporate liquidity, particularly in industries with high environmental compliance costs, thereby placing financial pressure on firms. Although the EPT stimulates innovation, the inherent time lag in realizing financial returns from R&amp;amp;D investments exacerbates short-term liquidity problems. This research offers important insights for policymakers seeking to balance sustainability goals with corporate financial health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67aa6a7b000cc5d8eb20a1dfcd61108ef2c54e3fc802dc1eba6b4910cdcb8660","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
