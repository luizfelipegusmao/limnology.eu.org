{"title":"Predicting suitable areas for Metcalfa pruinosa (Hemiptera: Flatidae) under climate change and implications for management","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae053/7667062?rss=1","date":1715126400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Climate change is a prominent factor reshaping the distribution of invasive species. <span>Metcalfa pruinosa</span> (Say 1830) (Hemiptera: Flatidae), native to North America, has invaded other continents and poses a serious threat to various agricultural crops and the human residential environment. Understanding the distribution of <span>M. pruinosa</span> based on climatic conditions is a critical first step to prevent its further invasion. Therefore, based on its occurrence records and associated environmental variables, a Maxent model was developed to predict suitable areas for this species in the present and future on a global scale. The model exhibited outstanding performance, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and true skill statistic values of 0.9329 and 0.926, respectively. The model also indicated that annual precipitation (Bio12) and max temperature of the warmest month (Bio5) were the key environmental variables limiting the distribution of <span>M. pruinosa</span>. Moreover, the model revealed that the current suitable area is 1.01 × 10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>2</sup> worldwide, with southern China, southern Europe, and the eastern United States predicted to be the primary and highly suitable areas in the latter 2 regions. This area is expected to increase under future climate scenarios, mainly in the northern direction. The study’s findings contribute to our understanding of climate change’s impact on <span>M. pruinosa</span> distribution, and they will aid governments in developing appropriate pest management strategies, including global monitoring and strict quarantine measures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"86dbf0cb3f639c82dca48698e4c5f1ab296b0acbaba524145278f5b50c1f4060","category":"Environment"}
