{"title":"Dietary Sodium and Potassium Intakes and Prevalent Kidney Stone: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2018","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1741/v1","date":1719300455000,"content":"The associations between dietary sodium intake (DSI), dietary potassium intake (DPI), and kidney stone disease (KSD) are not clear. We examined The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2018 to determine the independent associations between daily DSI, DPI, DSI/DPI and prevalent KSD. 19,405 participants were included for analysis, of which 1,895 had KSD. Higher DSI was not associated with increased odds of KSD in regression analysis when DSI was modeled as a continuous variable (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00, p=0.2), or when comparing highest quartile of DSI to lowest quartile (OR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.68–1.04, p=0.1). Unlike DSI, higher DPI associated strongly with reduced odds of KSD in regression analysis when DPI was modeled as a continuous variable (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-0.99, p=0.02), or when comparing highest quartile of DPI to lowest quartile (OR =0.75, 95% CI: 0.60–0.94, p=0.01). Lastly, higher DSI/DPI also associated strongly with increased odds of KSD in regression analysis when DSI/DPI was modeled as a continuous variable (OR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20, p=0.03), or when comparing highest quartile of DPI to lowest quartile (OR =1.30, 95% CI: 1.10–1.70, p=0.008). All the observed relationships were independent of total calorie intake. In conclusion, both lower DPI and higher DSI/DPI associate with an increased risk of KSD. Future prospective studies are needed to clarify these causal relationships.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"add47b70c0feb5d9ad7c35992fc9c0d75f955fb64ec418f50f3695480f6eeea0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
