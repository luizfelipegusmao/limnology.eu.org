{"title":"Oculomotor outcomes of cranial nerve palsy in patients with skull base tumors","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309686","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Yeji Moon, Byung Joo Lee</p>\r\nObjectives <p>Skull base tumors, can cause oculomotor dysfunction, presenting a management challenge given their proximity to cranial nerves. This study investigated the oculomotor outcomes in patients with skull base tumors presenting cranial nerve palsy due to tumor compression and aimed to identify associated factors.</p> Methods <p>This retrospective observational cohort study enrolled patients diagnosed with primary skull base tumors who exhibited cranial nerve palsy due to tumor compression, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging treated at Asan Medical Center between January 2011 and December 2022. Patients were assessed for oculomotor function pre- and post-treatment, and categorized into recovery and non-recovery groups based on outcomes. Factors associated with oculomotor outcomes were also analyzed.</p> Results <p>Fifty-six patients were enrolled, with the majority (n = 37, 66.1%) demonstrating recovery in oculomotor function post-treatment. The duration from symptom onset to treatment initiation was short in the recovery group, suggesting that early treatment may contribute to improved oculomotor outcomes. The type of tumor was significantly associated with oculomotor outcomes, with patients with pituitary adenoma exhibiting better outcomes. In the recovery group, 19/37 (51.4%) patients underwent surgical resection alone. In contrast, in the non-recovery group, 17/19 (89.5%) patients received primary or adjuvant radiosurgery or radiation therapy.</p> Conclusion <p>Approximately 70% of patients with skull base tumors experienced recovery in oculomotor function post-treatment. The duration before treatment and the type of tumor were significantly associated with the oculomotor outcome. These findings aid neuro-ophthalmologists in predicting oculomotor outcomes for patients with skull base tumors, guiding management strategies for oculomotor dysfunction.</p>","author":"Yeji Moon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee4caa88beaae8fb37a6f525f6ab1881c26aee81270d1cd96feabb856cbc8b41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
