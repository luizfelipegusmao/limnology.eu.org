{"title":"Interface Design For Autism In An Ever-Updating World","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1101/v1","date":1718606035000,"content":"Users with Autism Spectrum Disorder may find human-computer interaction (HCI) challenging due to a number of symptoms experienced, one of which is difficulty coping with change. Through capturing, comparing and statistically analysing the reactions of autistic and neurotypical users to seven individual design changes, it has been possible to identify the changes that cause significant difficulty in autistic users. These difficulty points were then used to form heuristics that can followed by HCI practitioners in the industry to reduce the negative impact of software interface design change on autistic users, hence making software updates more accessible.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"829d778b587fdc2d5acdbff1e5f077cb4cf2185ae0408d3f6b1d57ec40d8a695","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
