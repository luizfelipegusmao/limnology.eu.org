{"title":"The Role of Sustainable Attitudes to Achieve Energy Efficiency Targets through Industry 4.0 Adoption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0254/v1","date":1714980854000,"content":"The adoption of Industry 4.0 technology is essential for achieving energy efficiency, a critical aspect of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) no. 12 aimed at addressing climate change. Understanding the impact of Sustainable Attitudes, Digital Trust, and Uncertainty Avoidance is crucial in the decision-making process regarding the implementation of Industry 4.0 technology. The slow adoption of Industry 4.0 technology is attributed to non-technological factors or people, while the need to achieve energy efficiency targets necessitates examining the influence of Sustainable Attitudes and Digital Trust as supporting variables, along with Uncertainty Avoidance, on technology adoption. The study employed a quantitative explanatory research approach to investigate the relationships and impacts of variables. It centered on employees of Schneider Electric Indonesia, a global Industry 4.0 technology provider, with a sample of 189 employees selected through random sampling, incorporating a 5% margin error from Slovin formula. The analysis involved the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS version 26. Industry 4.0 technology is essential for fostering innovation and business expansion, leading to a sustainable environment by offering principles, guidance, and energy-efficient technologies for companies. The involvement of Sustainable Attitude, moderated by Uncertainty Avoidance, is vital in reaching energy efficiency goals through Industry 4.0 implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9d9b7c59ae4d89d3706049623f22c87edca617c0243eb321385d2cce930c4c55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
