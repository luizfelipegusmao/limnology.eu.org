{"title":"Growth, Evapotranspiration, Gas Exchange and Ch a Fluorescence of Ip&ecirc;‐Rosa Seedlings at Different Levels of Water Replacement","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1580/v1","date":1724321712000,"content":"This paper aimed to evaluate the growth, gas exchange and Chl a fluorescence in ipê-rosa seedlings, subjected to levels of 100, 75, 50 and 25% of water replacement (LWR), in a greenhouse. The morphometric variables of plant height, diameter at stem height, number of leaves and leaflets, root length and volume, plant dry mass and leaf area were evaluated. The potential evapotranspiration of seedlings (ETc) was obtained using direct weighing, considering as a reference the water replacement of 100% of the mass variation between subsequent days; the cultivation coefficients (kc) were obtained by the ratio between ETc and the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) obtained by the Penman-Montheit FAO-56 method. Biomass and evapotranspiration data were combined to determine water sensitivity. Diurnal fluxes of gas exchange (net photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, internal and atmospheric carbon ratio, water use efficiency and leaf temperature) and Chl a fluorescence (Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, ETR, Fv’/Fm’, NPQ and qL) were evaluated. Water restriction caused reductions of 90.9 and 84.7% in the increase in height and diameter of seedlings subjected to 25% water replacement when compared to seedlings with 100% water replacement, while biomass accumulation reduced by 96.9%. The kc values increased throughout the seedling production cycle, ranging from 0.59 to 2.86. Maximum water sensitivity occurred at 50% water replacement, with Ky = 1.62. Maximum carbon assimilation rates occurred in the morning, ranging from 6.11 to 12.50 µmol m-2 s-1. Ipê-rosa seedlings regulate the physiology of growth, gas exchange, and Chl a fluorescence depending on the amount of water available, and only 25% of the water re-placement in the substrate allows the seedlings to survive.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c68cfad8e99b2962c5066d829cac0a5708254dbc4806d4c95437640698ba6899","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
