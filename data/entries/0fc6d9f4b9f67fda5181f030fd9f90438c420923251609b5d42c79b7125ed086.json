Although larger individuals typically dominate smaller ones, size is not the sole determining factor, as the competitors' motivation, aggressiveness, resource value, physiological characteristics, and strength also play crucial roles in fighting outcomes. In this study, we evaluated the influence of body size on dominance hierarchy and contest success during intra- and inter-specific contests in two fish species: the native mojarra of the Balsas basin <i>Amphilophus istlanus</i> and the invasive convict cichlid <i>Amatitlania nigrofasciata</i>. We used size-asymmetric males to carry out experimental contests. The number and type of aggressive behaviors, time to contest outcome, and dominant individual at the end of the contest were determined. In contests between two native mojarra, the smaller individual always lost. In contests between convict cichlids, the smaller contestants lost in all contests where size asymmetry was greater than 20%. In interspecific contests, the native mojarra performed more aggressive behaviors than the invasive convict cichlid and dominated convict cichlids despite a size disadvantage. This suggests that in terms of competition via interference, the native mojarra can counter the arrival of the invasive convict cichlid.</p>","author":"Dejanira Aranda, \nElsah Arce, \nNorman Mercado‐Silva, \nLuis M.
