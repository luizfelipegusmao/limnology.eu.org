One uses a tailor-made infrastructure for data transfer between the facility and digital twin, the other uses edge computing. The digital twin objective should determine the required simulation frequency and, thus, sets boundaries on suitable implementation methods.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Digital twins have been gaining an immense interest in various fields over the last decade. Bringing conventional process simulation models into (near) real time are thought to provide valuable insights for operators, decision makers, and stakeholders in many industries. The objective of this paper is to describe two methods for implementing digital twins at water resource recovery facilities and highlight and discuss their differences and preferable use situations, with focus on the automated data transfer from the real process. Case 1 uses a tailor-made infrastructure for automated data transfer between the facility and the digital twin. Case 2 uses edge computing for rapid automated data transfer. The data transfer lag from process to digital twin is low compared to the simulation frequency in both systems. The presented digital twin objectives can be achieved using either of the presented methods. The method of Case 1 is better suited for automatic recalibration of model parameters, although workarounds exist for the method in Case 2. The method of Case 2 is well suited for objectives such as soft sensors due to its integration with the SCADA system and low latency. The objective of the digital twin, and the required latency of the system, should guide the choice of method.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nVarious methods can be used for automated data transfer between the physical system and a digital twin.\nDelays in the data transfer differ depending on implementation method.\nThe digital twin objective determines the required simulation frequency.\nImplementation method should be chosen based on the required simulation frequency.\n</p>","author":"Hanna Molin, \nChristoffer Wärff, \nErik Lindblom, \nMagnus Arnell, \nBengt Carlsson, \nPer Mattsson, \nJonas Bäckman, \nUlf Jeppsson","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"33c2782191b64368f45db499e9d658b29c0f88316e56ba49f40bbfa41a69f4b3","category":"Environment"}
