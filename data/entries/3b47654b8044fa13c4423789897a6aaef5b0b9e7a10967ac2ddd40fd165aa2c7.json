{"title":"Different Responses of Histology, Antioxidant, and Inflammation in Gill and Kidney of Yellow Catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco under Three Dietary Fat Levels","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/5513585?af=R","date":1713164400000,"content":"<p>This experiment investigated the influences of different dietary fat levels on histology, oxidative status, and immune response in gill and kidney of yellow catfish (<i>Pelteobagrus fulvidraco</i>). Three diets with different fat levels of 63.1 g/kg (low-fat, LF), 93.3 g/kg (medium-fat, MF), and 153.2 g/kg (high-fat, HF) were prepared to feed yellow catfish. The experiment continued for 56 days, and at the end of the experiment, gill and kidney tissues were sampled. As a result, both gill and kidney showed different degrees of tissue damage in HF group in terms of histology observation. HF increased the malondialdehyde content in gill but showed no effect on kidney, indicating that gill is more susceptible to injury than kidney under high-energy intake conditions. Additionally, HF diet significantly increased the activities of total-superoxide dismutase and catalase to eliminate excess peroxides both in gill and kidney. Moreover, HF diet significantly upregulated the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<i>il6</i> and <i>tnfα</i>) and downregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<i>il10</i>), indicating that HF-diet-induced inflammatory response both in gill and kidney. These findings reveal the potential regulatory approach for fish gill and kidney health by dietary fat level, which will help to understand the adverse impacts of dietary lipid imbalance on the health of fish.</p>","author":"Jiali Jiang, \nYu Zhu, \nYuanhang Lian, \nJun Chen, \nMeiqin Zhuo, \nMohamed Abdelsalam","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"3b47654b8044fa13c4423789897a6aaef5b0b9e7a10967ac2ddd40fd165aa2c7","category":"Environment"}
