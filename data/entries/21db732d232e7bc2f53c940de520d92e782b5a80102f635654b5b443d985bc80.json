{"title":"Tobacco price elasticity by socioeconomic characteristics in Ecuador","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302293","date":1713535200000,"content":"<p>by Ana Cristina Mena, Guillermo Paraje</p>\r\n\r\nSmoking is a worldwide epidemic and increased prices are one of the most cost-effective measures to reduce tobacco consumption. This article aims to estimate the price and income elasticity of cigarettes for different population groups in Ecuador. The National Survey of Urban and Rural Household Income and Expenditures (ENIGHUR) 2011–2012 was used, which has information on household cigarette consumption and its sociodemographic characteristics. Deaton’s Almost Ideal Demand System, which decouples the effect of quality on the price of the good, was applied. The elasticities were calculated for several groups: urban/rural, income levels (tertiles), education level, sex and age ranges of the household head, and frequency of cigarette purchases in households. The estimated price elasticity nationwide is -0.89 and the income elasticity is 0.41, both statistically significant. Households headed by women (-2.22) are more sensitive to an increase in cigarette prices than those headed by men (-0.65) and households headed by people between 20 and 40 years of age (-2.32) have a higher price elasticity compared to country-level estimations. Differences within other groups are not statistically significant.","author":"Ana Cristina Mena","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"21db732d232e7bc2f53c940de520d92e782b5a80102f635654b5b443d985bc80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
