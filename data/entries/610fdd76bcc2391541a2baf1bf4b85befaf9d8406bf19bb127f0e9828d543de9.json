{"title":"Investigating the Future Intention to Use Computer-Based Test Among Secondary School Students in Lagos, Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0707/v1","date":1728550016000,"content":"This brief report detailed the investigation of secondary school students' future intention to use Computer-Based Testing (CBT) in Lagos, Nigeria. A sample of 531 students, which is made-up of new and returning users of CBT, responded to a questionnaire based on a four-point Likert scale. The study aimed to explore whether ease of use, gender, computer self-efficacy, and prior experience influence the future intention to use CBT. Findings show that students who find CBT easier to use have a significantly higher intention to use it again. This association remains significant even when controlling for gender, computer self-efficacy, and experience. New users demonstrated a slightly higher mean intention to use CBT than returning users, possibly due to the novelty effect. This report recommends improving CBT's ease of use to accommodate varying levels of computer literacy and self-efficacy. Limitations of the investigation include the nominal nature of the data and the self-reported responses, which could impact the accuracy of the analysis. Future studies should adopt more robust methodologies, such as Structural Equation Modeling, to better explore these relationships.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"610fdd76bcc2391541a2baf1bf4b85befaf9d8406bf19bb127f0e9828d543de9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
