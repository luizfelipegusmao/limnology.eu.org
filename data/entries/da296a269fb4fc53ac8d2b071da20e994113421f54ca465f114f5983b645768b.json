{"title":"RNA m6A modification facilitates DNA methylation during maize kernel development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2165/7444906?rss=1","date":1700697600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in mRNA and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA have critical functions for regulating gene expression and modulating plant growth and development. However, the interplay between m<sup>6</sup>A and 5mC is an elusive territory and remains unclear mechanistically in plants. We reported an occurrence of crosstalk between m<sup>6</sup>A and 5mC in maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) via the interaction between mRNA adenosine methylase (ZmMTA), the core component of the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, and decrease in DNA methylation 1 (ZmDDM1), a key chromatin-remodeling factor that regulates DNA methylation. Genes with m<sup>6</sup>A modification were coordinated with a much higher level of DNA methylation than genes without m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Dysfunction of <span>ZmMTA</span> caused severe arrest during maize embryogenesis and endosperm development, leading to a significant decrease in CHH methylation in the 5â€² region of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes. Instead, loss of function of <span>ZmDDM1</span> had no noteworthy effects on ZmMTA-related activity. This study establishes a direct link between m<sup>6</sup>A and 5mC during maize kernel development and provides insights into the interplay between RNA modification and DNA methylation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"da296a269fb4fc53ac8d2b071da20e994113421f54ca465f114f5983b645768b","category":"Environment"}
