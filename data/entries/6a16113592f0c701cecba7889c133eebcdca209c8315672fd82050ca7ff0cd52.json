{"title":"A Proposed Algorithm Based on Variance to Effectively Estimate Crack Source Localization in Solids","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0708/v1","date":1725893195000,"content":"Acoustic emissions (AE) are produced by elastic waves generated by damage in solid materials. AE sensors have been widely used in several fields as a promising tool to analyze damage mechanisms such as cracking, dislocation movement, etc. However, accurately determining the location of damage in solids in a non-destructive manner is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a crack wave arrival time determination algorithm that can identify crack waves with low SNR(signal-to-noise ratios) generated in rocks. The basic idea comes from that the variances of the crack wave and noise have different characteristics depending on the size of the moving window. The results can be used to accurately determine the crack source location. The source location is determined by observing where the variance in the crack wave velocities of the true and imaginary crack location reach a minimum. By performing a pencil lead break test using rock samples, it was confirmed that the proposed method could successfully find wave arrival time and crack localization. The results using the proposed algorithm to detect crack wave source localization suggest use for evaluating and real-time monitoring of damage in tunnels or other underground facilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a16113592f0c701cecba7889c133eebcdca209c8315672fd82050ca7ff0cd52","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
