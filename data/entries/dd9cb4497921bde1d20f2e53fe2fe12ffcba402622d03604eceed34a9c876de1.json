{"title":"Methodological Approaches and Literature Analysis in the Study of Soil Carbon in Urban Green Spaces: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1318/v1","date":1716268881000,"content":"This review examines methodologies studying soil carbon in urban green spaces, a field requiring higher attention as their ecosystem services are valued and urban mitigation plans against climate change are developed. In the growing global urbanization, urban green spaces play a crucial role as nature-based solutions to address climate challenges, demanding efficient carbon accounting and reduction strategies. In this research, a systematic review was conducted assessing publications from 2021 to 2023 in the databases Web of Science and Scopus. Findings expose the lack of standardization in the methodologies used to study soil carbon in urban green spaces, evidencing in situ measurements at different sampling depths and studies without longitudinal monitoring over time. In addition, studies originated primarily in universities from China, United States and Spain, which focused on carbon in the form of Soil Organic Carbon and Total Carbon. Based on these findings, recommendations are made advocating for the combination and standardizing methodologies. This review offers valuable insights that shed light on an ignore and often overseen issue. Further studies and standardized methodology are needed, to help cities efforts in their pursuit of carbon neutrality by acknowledging the influential role of urban soils, especially green spaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd9cb4497921bde1d20f2e53fe2fe12ffcba402622d03604eceed34a9c876de1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
