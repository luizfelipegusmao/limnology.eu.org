{"title":"Performance Analysis of New One-Piece Iron Roughneck and Its Spinning Mechanism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1440/v1","date":1721212580000,"content":"The iron roughneck is an automated equipment utilized for the connection and removal of drilling tools. This paper presents the design of an integrated iron roughneck, providing a detailed introduction to its clamp body structure, along with an analysis of its structural characteristics and performance requirements. The study delves into the integration mode and working characteristics of the clamping mechanism and spin buckle mechanism for the integrated upper clamp body structure of the iron roughneck. Additionally, this paper conducts an in-depth theoretical study on the spin buckle mechanism. Firstly, it analyzes the actual working condition of the spin buckle roller from two perspectives: contact theory and rolling friction theory, determining the structural form of the spin buckle roller. Secondly, it investigates the relative displacement between the spin buckle mechanism and the drilling tool, proposing a design method for the floating device mounted on the spin buckle roller and establishing the kinematic equation of the spin buckle roller under the influence of the floating device. Furthermore, the kinematic equations of the spin buckle roller under the influence of the floating device are established. Finally, a dynamics simulation experiment is performed to simulate the working process of the spin buckle mechanism under actual working conditions, analyzing the dynamics and kinematics of the spin buckle mechanism and obtaining the relevant parameter curves of the spin buckle mechanism and drilling tools. Through data comparison and analysis, the correctness of the theoretical analysis results and the rationality of the performance and structure of the spin buckle mechanism are verified.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7121e61fa34d722019b59ba93d9f9d5812b71ee7beeca4e7cc9e2dbe1917576b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
