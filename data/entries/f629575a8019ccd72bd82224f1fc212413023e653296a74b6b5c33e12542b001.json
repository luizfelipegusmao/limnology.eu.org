{"title":"Differences between atrial fibrillation diagnosed before and after stroke: A large real-world cohort study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308507","date":1723644000000,"content":"<p>by Yu-Kang Chang, Chih-Cheng Hsu, Chi-Ting Huang, Chi-Hsun Lien, Hung-Yi Hsu</p>\r\n\r\nThe clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) and atrial fibrillation detected after stroke (AFDAS) have not been clearly established. Previous studies evaluating patients with AFDAS were limited by the low prescription rates of anticoagulants and short follow-up periods. Consecutive patients hospitalized for IS between 2014 and 2017 were identified from a National Health Insurance Research Database. The included patients were categorized into three groups: (1) known diagnosis of AF (KAF) before the index stroke, (2) AFDAS, and (3) without AF (non-AF). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for independent variables and recurrent IS, hemorrhagic stroke, or all-cause mortality. We identified 158,909 patients with IS of whom 16,699 (10.5%) had KAF and 7,826 (4.9%) had AFDAS. The patients with AFDAS were younger, more often male, and had lower CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores (3.8 ± 1.9 versus 4.9 ± 1.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than the patients with KAF. Anticoagulant treatment significantly reduced the risks of all outcomes. The standardized mortality rates were 40.4, 28.6, and 18.4 (per 100 person-years) for the patients with KAF, AFDAS, and non-AF, respectively. Compared with AFDAS, KAF was associated with lower risks of recurrent IS [hazard ratio (HR): 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86–0.97, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01] and hemorrhagic stroke (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79–0.99, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07–1.16, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The risks of recurrent IS and hemorrhagic stroke were higher and of all-cause mortality was lower for patients with AFDAS than with KAF. There is a strong need to refine treatment modalities to reduce the high mortality in patients with KAF and AFDAS.","author":"Yu-Kang Chang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f629575a8019ccd72bd82224f1fc212413023e653296a74b6b5c33e12542b001","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
