{"title":"Possible Mechanisms and Strategies for Immune Therapy Resistance in Gastric Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1478/v2","date":1728387857000,"content":"Gastric cancer has become the cancer with the highest incidence rate in the world.Immunotherapy, especially immune point inhibitors targeting programmed cell death 1（PD-1） or its ligand programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), has become an indispensable part of the clinical treatment of GC. But, only a few of sufferers experience persistent clinical responses during immunotherapy. In this article, we discuss the current mainstream immunotherapy methods for gastric cancer, introduce the mechanisms that lead to immunotherapy resistance, potential biomarkers that can forecast the occurrence of immunotherapy resistance, and measures to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd35b06147732c8d0f6a82f82ac9389c8dd3793a46e56985ddde2c3293c0249b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
