{"title":"A Review of Pakistan&#039;s National Spatial Data Infrastructure Using Multiple Assessment Frameworks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0784/v1","date":1720613033000,"content":"This article aims to assess Pakistan's National Spatial Data Infrastructure implementation efforts through well-established approaches including the SDI readiness model, organizational aspects, and state of play. The findings underscored challenges related to human resources, SDI education/culture, long-term vision, GI awareness, sustainable funding, metadata availability, online geospatial services, and geospatial standards hindering the NSDI development in Pakistan. However, certain factors, such as the legal framework for NSDI establishment, web connectivity, geospatial software availability, core spatial dataset availability, and institutional leadership, exhibit favorable standings. Thus, to enhance the development of NSDI for Pakistan, recommendations include bolstering financial and human resources, improving online geospatial presence, and fostering a long-term vision for NSDI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee145d7b9ebe124c8f13552b7e62c4b52fd1a460add4183e7c64cf3e5180b0b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
