{"title":"Statistical analysis of Gravimetric Composition of Municipal Solid Household Waste in the City of Belém-Pará-Brazil: A Systematic Study for Decision Making and Public Policies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1155/v2","date":1712822737000,"content":"This article aimed to evaluate, using statistical tools, the generation and composition of urban solid waste (MSW) in the city of Belém, Pará, from nine urban collection sectors in the municipality, and the average nominal income of the population. Approximately 900kg of urban solid waste were col-lected from the municipality in the period from 2021 to 2022. Statistical tests  were carried out on hypotheses with 5% significance in comparative evaluations, and their respective average nominal incomes. The results indicated that the organic fraction corresponds to 55.57% of the waste generated in the municipality, 14.26% is inert waste (potentially contaminating) and 0.67% is miscellaneous waste. It was observed that the waste generated by families with high purchasing power tends to contain higher percentages of recyclables, while in families with lower purchasing power the highest percentages tend to be organic. Knowledge of the generation of MSW is fundamental for the choice and dimensioning of operations and processes involved in the management chain at the municipal level. The decentralization of services offered based on solid waste management would enable greater success in serving the population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"585d64922422e0cdcc86abc4a498d2be042566768c2524568d8d6806488ca5ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
