{"title":"Antioxidant Activity of Zingiber Officinale R. Extract Using Pressurized Liquid Extraction Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1051/v1","date":1726194234000,"content":"Global demand for food shows an increasing trend, which implies that volumes of food waste also increase. These wastes contain bioactive compounds that are not properly utilized or valorized. It was reported that ginger waste contains phenolic compounds with high antioxidant activity. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature, time, and particle size on the total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AA) of ginger (Zingiber officinale R.) waste aqueous extract using the Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE) method with water as the sole solvent. Box-Behnken design was used. The sample was 1.60 kg of dried ginger peel powder. Data analysis was performed with Minitab ® 19.1 (64-bit). TPC ranged from 10.42 to 14.1 mg GAE/g, and AA (DPPH method) ranged from 72.9 to 111.9 μmol TE/g. The model explained 81.07% of AA’s total variability. Positive correlation was found between TPC and AA (Pearson's ρ = 0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Response optimization values were 126 °C and 38 min. Temperature was a significant factor (p &amp;lt; 0.05) influencing AA, while time and particle size were not significant. Higher temperatures, longer extraction times and smaller particle sizes increase TPC and AA of the ginger waste aqueous extract.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b226982b704a01665e0f207f1449f8ad9e51ae38f50f5426e691bd9896dc98d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
