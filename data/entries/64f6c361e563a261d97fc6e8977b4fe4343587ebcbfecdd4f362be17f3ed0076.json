{"title":"Examining Psychosocial Risks and Their Impact on Nurses&#039; Safety Attitudes and Medication Error Rates: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1592/v1","date":1724287754000,"content":"The exposure of employees to specific risks is usually due to increasing levels of work-related stress, which negatively affects their skills and effectiveness in their job duties, lead-ing to the onset of physical/mental illnesses, mistakes, or even accidents. The aim of this study is to investigate the psychosocial risks experienced by nurses in tertiary hospitals in Greece and their association with their attitudes towards safety and the occurrence of medication errors. The research was conducted in four tertiary hospitals in Greece, with the participation of 514 nurses of all educational levels. Questionnaires were used to collect data on work-related stress, professional burnout, and medication errors. The results highlighted that psychosocial risks, such as high work pressure and lack of support, are directly linked to professional burnout and an increased likelihood of medication errors. The necessity of social support, job autonomy, and work-life balance are underscored as critical factors for reducing stress and improving the quality of care. Specific strategies are proposed to enhance the mental health of nurses and improve working conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64f6c361e563a261d97fc6e8977b4fe4343587ebcbfecdd4f362be17f3ed0076","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
