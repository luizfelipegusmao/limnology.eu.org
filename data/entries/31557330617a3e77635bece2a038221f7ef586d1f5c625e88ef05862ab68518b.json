{"title":"Crossing Age Boundaries: The Unifying Potential of Presepsin in Sepsis Diagnosis Across Diverse Age Groups","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2011/v1","date":1727259133000,"content":"Sepsis is a pervasive condition that affects individuals of all ages, with significant social and economic consequences. Early diagnosis of sepsis is fundamental for establishing appropriate treatment and is based on warning scores and clinical characteristics, with positive microbiological cultures being the gold standard. Research has yet to identify a single biomarker to meet this diagnostic demand. Presepsin is a molecule that has the potential as a biomarker for diagnosing sepsis. In this paper, we present a narrative review of the diagnostic and prognostic performance of presepsin in different age groups. Given its particularities, it is identified that presepsin is a potential biomarker for sepsis at all stages of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31557330617a3e77635bece2a038221f7ef586d1f5c625e88ef05862ab68518b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
