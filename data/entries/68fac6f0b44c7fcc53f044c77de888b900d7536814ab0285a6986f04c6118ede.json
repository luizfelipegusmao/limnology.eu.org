{"title":"Transcription factors Pbr3RAV2 and PbrTTG1 regulate pear resistance to Botryosphaeria dothidea via the autophagy pathway","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/3024/7663356?rss=1","date":1714608000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pear ring rot, caused by <span>Botryosphaeria dothidea</span>, is the most serious disease of pear (<span>Pyrus</span> spp.) trees. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pear resistance to <span>B. dothidea</span> remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that the pear <span>AuTophagy-related Gene 1a</span> (<span>PbrATG1a</span>) plays a key role in autophagic activity and resistance to <span>B. dothidea</span>. Stable overexpression of <span>PbrATG1a</span> enhanced resistance to <span>B. dothidea</span> in pear calli. Autophagy activity was greater in <span>PbrATG1a</span>-overexpressing calli than in wild-type calli. We used yeast 1-hybrid screening to identify a transcription factor, related to ABI3 and VP1 (Pbr3RAV2), that binds the promoter of <span>PbrATG1a</span> and enhances pear resistance to <span>B. dothidea</span> by regulating autophagic activity. Specifically, the overexpression of <span>Pbr3RAV2</span> enhanced resistance to <span>B. dothidea</span> in pear calli, while transient silencing of <span>Pbr3RAV2</span> resulted in compromised resistance to <span>B. dothidea</span> in <span>Pyrus betulifolia</span>. In addition, we identified Transparent Testa Glabra 1 (PbrTTG1), which interacts with Pbr3RAV2. Pathogen infection enhanced the interaction between Pbr3RAV2 and PbrTTG1. The Pbr3RAV2â€“PbrTTG1 complex increased the binding capacity of Pbr3RAV2 and transcription of <span>PbrATG1a</span>. In addition to providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pear disease resistance, these findings suggest potential genetic targets for enhancing disease resistance in pear.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"68fac6f0b44c7fcc53f044c77de888b900d7536814ab0285a6986f04c6118ede","category":"Environment"}
