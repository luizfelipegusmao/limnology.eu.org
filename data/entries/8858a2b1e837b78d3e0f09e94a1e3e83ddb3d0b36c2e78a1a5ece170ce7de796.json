Plants are able to take up and utilize sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup>), the most oxidized inorganic form of S compounds on Earth, through the reductive S assimilatory pathway that couples with photosynthetic energy conversion. Organic S compounds are subsequently synthesized in plants and made accessible to animals, primarily as the amino acid methionine. Thus, plant S metabolism clearly has nutritional importance in the global food chain. S metabolites may be part of redox regulation and drivers of essential metabolic pathways as cofactors and prosthetic groups, such as Fe–S centers, CoA, thiamine, and lipoic acid. The evolution of the S metabolic pathways and enzymes reflects the critical importance of functional innovation and diversifications. Here we review the major evolutionary alterations that took place in S metabolism across different scales and outline research directions that may take advantage of understanding the evolutionary adaptations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8858a2b1e837b78d3e0f09e94a1e3e83ddb3d0b36c2e78a1a5ece170ce7de796","category":"Environment"}
