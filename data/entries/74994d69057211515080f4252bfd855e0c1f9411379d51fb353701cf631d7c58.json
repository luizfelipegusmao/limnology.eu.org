{"title":"Uses of the Popov Stability Criterion for Analyzing Global Asymptotic Stability in Power System Dynamic Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0809/v1","date":1728566535000,"content":"Stability studies remain a crucial aspect of power systems dynamic analysis, and are typically explored in three main categories: numerical methods, linearization techniques, or direct methods, which utilize Lyapunov energy functions. This paper belongs to the third category, and highlights the usefulness of the Popov stability criterion in the analysis of nonlinear power system models. The main advantage of this criterion is that it provides conditions for global asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point, for a nonlinear dynamic system. We show a general method to apply this stability criterion, and examine its uses in several specific applications and case-studies. The results are demonstrated by analyzing the stability of a system that includes a grid-connected storage device and a renewable energy source.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74994d69057211515080f4252bfd855e0c1f9411379d51fb353701cf631d7c58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
