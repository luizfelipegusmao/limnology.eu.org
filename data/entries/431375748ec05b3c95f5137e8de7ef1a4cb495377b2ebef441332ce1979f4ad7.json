{"title":"FASD: The Living Experience of People with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder &ndash; Results of an Anonymous Survey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0509/v3","date":1711611819000,"content":"Abstract: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is considered a lifelong disability that has been framed by neurobiological descriptions focused on the brain. These are important features but fail to tell the story of living with FASD. By surveying those with FASD, this work expands upon prior survey work which illustrated a multitude of early onset physiological issues occurring at rates much higher than typical of the general population. The current project, again using an anonymous survey methodology, seeks to open up other direct experiences to better understand the complexity of living with FASD. An anonymous online survey was used to gather data on advresity in childhood, schooling, employment, housing and finances, involvement with the criminal justice system as well as relationships and parenting. Results inform how supports can be enhanced and targeted with a goal of improving the quality of life. The survey was developed by adults living with FASD who have served as a long-standing advocacy and educational group influencing policy and practice in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"431375748ec05b3c95f5137e8de7ef1a4cb495377b2ebef441332ce1979f4ad7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
