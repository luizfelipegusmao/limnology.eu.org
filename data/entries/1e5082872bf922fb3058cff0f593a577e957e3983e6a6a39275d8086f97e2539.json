{"title":"Elevated Immunoglobulin E Serum Levels: Possible Underlying Factors That Can Cause an Inborn Error of Immunity in the Pediatric Population with Recurrent Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1895/v1","date":1714377739000,"content":"Elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are commonly associated with allergies. However, high IgE levels are also found in several other infectious and non-infectious disorders. Elevated IgE levels typically suggest allergies, eczema, or recurrent skin infections. Very high IgE levels are uncommon in patients with active eczema but typically reflect a monogenic atopic condition or inborn immune defects with an atopic phenotype. The aim of our research is to identify if the possible cause of high IgE levels is also dependent on external factors, age, or associated recurrent pathologies such as infections. To answer this question, we performed a one-year retrospective study that included 200 hospitalized children who had at least two viral or bacterial infections in the six months preceding hospitalization. Measurements of IgE and allergen panels (respiratory and digestive) using blood samples revealed that individuals who tested positive for the bodyâ€™s synthesis of hyperimmunoglobulin E were not observably allergic to any potential allergens despite having higher total serum IgE. According to the results, there was a strong correlation between elevated IgE serum levels and a history of infectious diseases among the patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e5082872bf922fb3058cff0f593a577e957e3983e6a6a39275d8086f97e2539","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
