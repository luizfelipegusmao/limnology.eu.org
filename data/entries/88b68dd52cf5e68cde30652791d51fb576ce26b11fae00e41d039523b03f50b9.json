{"title":"Comparison of methods for DMSP measurements in dinoflagellate cultures","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10618?af=R","date":1718352021000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A comparison of three analytical methods (the indirect GC-FPD and MIMS, and direct LC-MS/MS) for dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) measurements was conducted to assess their accuracy and reliability. The three methods showed a linear response but are distinguished by their linearity range, the largest being for MIMS. All three methods showed good precision on <i>Alexandrium minutum</i> samples (2–12%). The variability between the three methods when comparing analyses of <i>A. minutum</i> replicates was 11%, with the DMSP measurements by LC-MS/MS being the highest. This result also confirms that indirect DMSP measurement after hydrolysis for GC or MIMS methods does not lead to an overestimation of DMSP values in <i>A. minutum</i>. A special focus was made on the more recent LC-MS/MS method including further assays in sample preparation and storage from cultures of the dinoflagellate <i>A. minutum</i>. Dinoflagellate cells should be harvested by gentle filtration (&lt; 5 cm Hg) or slow centrifugation (500 × <i>g</i>) to retrieve the largest DMSP pool. For the LC-MS/MS method, MeOH used for cell extraction should be added prior to freezing (to prevent DMSP degradation). Samples will then be stable in frozen storage for at least 2 months. Finally, direct and indirect methods are complementary for identifying the exact DMSP fraction among dimethylsulfide-producing compounds that compose total and particulate DMSP pools issued from newly screened organisms or environmental samples.</p>","author":"Amandine M.
