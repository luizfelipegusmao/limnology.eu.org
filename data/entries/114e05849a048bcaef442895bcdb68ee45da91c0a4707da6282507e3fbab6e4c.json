{"title":"Single Solution Based Metaheuristics With Graph Network Based Machine Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0187/v1","date":1727936694000,"content":"Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu Search (TS), and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) are well-established single-solution-based metaheuristics known for their efficiency. In this paper, we explore the application of these techniques to enhance the performance of graph network models, specifically Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By leveraging these metaheuristics, we aim to optimize key aspects of graph-based learning, such as hyperparameter tuning, architecture design, feature selection, and graph structure learning. Our approach demonstrates how these metaheuristics can improve the generalization, efficiency, and robustness of GNNs/GCNs, facilitating their use in large-scale graph-based tasks. The proposed framework illustrates the potential of combining advanced optimization techniques with state-of-the-art graph machine learning models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"114e05849a048bcaef442895bcdb68ee45da91c0a4707da6282507e3fbab6e4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
