{"title":"The Photochemical Isomerization in Pyridazine-N-oxide Derivatives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2011/v1","date":1717049550000,"content":"DFT calculations on the photoisomerization reactions of pyridazine N-oxide derivatives are presented. The irradiation of 3,6-diphenylpyridazine N-oxide allowed to obtain the first excited singlet state that underwent to a ring opening reaction induced to the oxygen migration to the adjacent carbon atom, with the formation of a diazo derivative. This intermediate can give a ring closure reaction to give a pyrazole derivative, or, with a higher transition energy, it can lose nitrogen allowing the formation of 2,5-diphenylfuran. The irradiation of 3-phenylpyridazine N-oxide allowed the formation only of 2-phenylfuran. In this case, calculations allowed to explain this behavior. The first excited singlet state gave a photoisomerization reaction with the formation of the corresponding diazo intermediate. This intermediate could not be converted into the corresponding pyrazole derivative because it was converted into a N-formyl pyrazole never reported in literature. The only possible reaction is the loss of nitrogen and the formation of 2-phenylfuran.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82efdace87d071666071b29715ca147ac6c3472c0c388ec786ee9d393713b62b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
