{"title":"Revolutionizing Patient Care: A Comprehensive Review of Recent Advances in Flexible Printed Heaters for Wearable Medical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1750/v1","date":1724419039000,"content":"Recent developments in flexible printed heaters (FPH) for wearable thermal applications, driven by the advancement of printed electronics, show great promise in revolutionizing patient care through the development of wearable flexible heaters for medical applications. Wearable heaters with high thermal stability, heat uniformity, safety, flexibility, comfort, biocompatibility, and power efficiency are desirable for stand-alone medical thermotherapy applications. This paper reviews recent advancements in the design of FPHs for wearable thermal applications. Materials for FPHs, fabrication methods, designs, temperature control mechanisms, medical applications, and performance analysis of specific FPHs are all thoroughly discussed. Materials for FPHs, such as conductive and substrate materials, have received special attention, along with the heater design parameters. Finally, the challenges and future directions for developing FPHs for wearable medical applications are addressed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"715097fdce0786de75cba4772587cc07c990379268a37116ac5d6aa10d5a0b79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
