No single method can improve the assessment and monitoring of fungal diversity by itself. To capture those fungi that are underrepresented in aerial eDNA sampling and are not easily detectable, eDNA sampling directly from the substrate (e.g., soil or wood) may still be crucial.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><b>Research Highlight discussing</b>: Runnel, K., Lõhmus, P., Küngas, K., Marmor-Ohtla, L., Palo, A., Pütsepp, G., Tamm, H., Tammekänd, I., &amp; Lõhmus, A.

Aerial eDNA contributes vital information for fungal biodiversity assessment. <i>Journal of Applied Ecology</i>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14691\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14691</a>. Fungi play key roles in ecosystems, yet it is not clear how best to capture their diversity or monitor their presence, especially for those species of particular conservation concern. In this issue of the <i>Journal of Applied Ecology</i> Runnel et al. address this problem by comparing different methodologies to estimate the diversity of lichen-forming fungi and wood-inhabiting basidiomycetes at a forest stand scale. Pairing aerial eDNA sampling with visual observation-based surveys better captured the full spectrum of fungal diversity, including cryptic species and those of particular conservation interest. Certain fungal groups that are underrepresented in air samples might be better captured by sampling eDNA directly from wood or soil, but visual surveys should be considered as a more cost-effective complementary method at least at a local scale. Their results highlight the importance of using multiple methods simultaneously in biodiversity assessments and the need for standardized methods to study and monitor fungal diversity.</p>","author":"Nahuel Policelli","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"f933de855d723d96a9153028cbecdd70aa00f615e4ddbfa99d271406886d1e60","category":"Environment"}
