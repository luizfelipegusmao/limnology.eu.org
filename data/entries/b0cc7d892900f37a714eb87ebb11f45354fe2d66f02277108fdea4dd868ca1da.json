{"title":"Leveraging Pumped Storage Power Plants for Innovative Stability Enhancement of Weakly Interconnected Power Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1011/v1","date":1720769949000,"content":"The hybrid AC/DC grid, based on a significant share of renewable energy sources, is gradually becoming an essential configuration of the modern energy system. The integration of intermittent renewable generators into contemporary energy systems is accompanied by the decommissioning of power plants containing synchronous generators. Consequently, this leads to a reduction in system inertia and an increase in the risks of stability disruption. The abrupt disconnection of the primary generator or power line can result in an unanticipated mismatch between power generation and consumption. This discrepancy can trigger substantial and swiftly evolving alterations in power distribution, angular speed, load flow, and the frequency of generators. The risks of an energy system collapse can be mitigated through automation, enabling rapid adjustments to generation and load capacities as well as power flows in the electrical network. This article justifies the utilisation of a power control method for high-voltage power line interconnections. The technology of hydro storage power plants and measurements of voltage phasors are employed. The potential for easing power flow restrictions and realising substantial economic benefits is supported by the results obtained using simplified dynamic model of the Baltic power system and Nord Pool electricity market model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0cc7d892900f37a714eb87ebb11f45354fe2d66f02277108fdea4dd868ca1da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
