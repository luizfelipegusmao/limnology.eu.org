{"title":"Affective polarization is uniformly distributed across American States","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae310/7821173?rss=1","date":1728950400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>US partisans view each other with increasing negativity. While many attribute the growth of such affective polarization to nationally cross-cutting forces, such as ideological partisan sorting or access to partisan media, others emphasize the effects of contextual and institutional forces. For the first time, we introduce and explore data sufficiently granular to fully map the extent of partisan animosity across the US states. With a massive, nationally representative survey we find that, counter to expectations, variation in affective polarization across states is relatively small, and is instead largely a function of individual-level attitudinal (but not demographic) characteristics. While elections pit regions of the country against others, our results suggest affective polarization is a national, not regional, problem, requiring national interventions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"f62d13da5b493c1f626a4352b00871b40e3959c13ecf0d6dfa0812c00580d4f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
