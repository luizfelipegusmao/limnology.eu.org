{"title":"Comparative Review of Thermal Management System for BESS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0391/v1","date":1715089142000,"content":"To support the integration of renewable energy sources and preserve grid stability, this study examines several approaches for controlling the temperature of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in modern energy settings. Specifically, the usage of BESS in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) is the focus of this study. The effectiveness, safety features, dependability, affordability, and suitability for VPP applications of these systems are examined. Among the various hybrid cooling alternatives, two particularly promising combinations emerge. Firstly, the integration of heat pipes and phase change materials leverages their ability to conduct heat efficiently away from heat sources with minimal temperature differences, making them excellent for rapid heat transfer. Secondly, an approach employing heat pipes and liquid passive cooling a combination that capitalizes on the efficient heat transfer capabilities of heat pipes and the consistent cooling offered by liquid passive systems. The study underscores the importance of improving BESS performance and sustainability within VPPs by providing useful recommendations for choosing the best thermal management system depending on climate conditions and geographic location.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"703840726f8612939ca093f802c547410ad482bf7b93a73314cf0ef99d1b565e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
