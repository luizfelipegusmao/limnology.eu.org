{"title":"Association of Serum Inflammatory Factors With Prognosis After Revascularization Therapy in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1885/v1","date":1714360073000,"content":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of serum inflammatory factor levels in acute ischemic stroke patients after revascularization therapy in assessing acute prognosis. METHODS: 94 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent revascularization therapy admitted to our hospital from January 01, 2022 to January 01, 2024 were studied. The main evaluation index was modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) after 3 months, and patients with mRS score &gt;2 were categorized into the poor prognosis group, and the rest were the good prognosis group. As well as the treatment of revascularization in all patients was used as a division into a thrombus extraction group and an intravenous thrombolysis group. Logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the independent risk factors for the prognosis of patients treated with recanalization for acute ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Two groups with good (59 cases) and poor (35 cases) prognosis were divided according to the mRS score. There were some differences in age, gender, emergency GLU, INR, whether they had diabetes or hypertension and other contents between the two groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. The NIHSS score, hospitalization days, previous cardiac history, hospitalization days, LDL, fasting glucose, IL-6, and TNF-a at the time of admission were lower than those in the poor prognosis group, and the difference was statistically significant. In the patients in the embolization group, there were some differences in age, gender, emergency GLU, INR, whether they had diabetes or hypertension and other contents between the two groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. The pre-hospital NHISS score, IL-6, and TNF-a of patients in the good prognosis group were lower than those in the poor prognosis group, and the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: IL-6 and TNF-Î± may be used as predictors of prognosis after revascularization therapy for acute ischemic stroke, and this conclusion also applies to patients in the embolization group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa76a85aaadd2ebaaad464d34428743090a98794b41bc779d87879d59c080539","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
