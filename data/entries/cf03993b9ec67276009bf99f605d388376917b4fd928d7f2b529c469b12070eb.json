{"title":"Efficient Bio-Based Insulation Panels Produced from Eucalyptus Bark Waste","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0874/v1","date":1723541913000,"content":"Traditional thermal insulation panels consume large amounts of energy during production and emits pollutants into the environment. To mitigate this impact, the development of bio-based materials is an attractive alternative. In this context, the characteristics of the Eucalyptus fiber bark (EGFB) make it a candidate for insulation applications. However, more knowledge about the manufacturing process and in-service performance is needed. The present study characterized the properties that determinate the in-service behaviour of the EGFB insulation panel. The assessment involved two different manufacturing process. The results indicated that the hot plates and the saturated steam injection manufacturing system can produce panels with similar theoretical and bulk density. The thermal conductivity fluctuated between 0.064 and 0.077 W/m.K, which indicated good insulation. Furthermore, the values obtained for thermal diffusivity and water vapor transmission properties are comparable with other commercially available panels. To guarantee a good in-service performance, the panels need to be treated with flame retardant and antifungal additive. The good performance of the panel is relevant because bio-based Eucalyptus bark panels generate less CO2 eq and require less energy consumption compared to traditional alternatives, contributing to the sustainability of the forestry and the construction industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf03993b9ec67276009bf99f605d388376917b4fd928d7f2b529c469b12070eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
