{"title":"WHO ICOPE Screening Tool in Brazilian Elderly People: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1774/v1","date":1721721412000,"content":"Objectives: Evaluate the performance of diagnostic measures (sensitivity and specificity) of the intrinsic capacity (IC) construct recommended by the WHO ICOPE guidelines by domain and by age group. Study design: This cross-sectional study included 164 community-dwelling elderly (95 women and 69 men). The participants completed the assessment of the 5 domains of IC (cognition, psychological, vitality, locomotion and sensory). In addition, they were assessed for activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), frailty and urinary incontinence. Main outcomes measures: Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the intrinsic capacity and identify which domains were compromised. Comparisons between three or more samples were made by 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test and those with two samples by the t-test or Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables. Chi-square test was used for qualitative variables. The sensitivity and specificity of each domain and each domain by age group were evaluated using the ROC curve. Results: Participants with a decline in IC were older, worse ADL, IADL and mental function, low gait speed, and higher depression scores. In addition, people with a decline in IC had frailty, urinary incontinence. Other issues related to the decline in CI were self-reported non-practice of physical activities and level of schooling.The evaluation of each domain did not prove to be a good screening tool (sensitivity or specificity &amp;lt; 80%, but both values &amp;gt; 50%). When the analyses were separated by domain and age group, good performance was found in the psychological (69-69 years and ≥80 years), vitality (≥80 years) and sensory (≥80 years) domains. Conclusions: The ICOPE screening tool performed well in terms of diagnostic measures when applied by domain and age group.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e9f7447132a7317a171a95dc01ba1dd50b5acfed7b973e36b94819ffb8339108","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
