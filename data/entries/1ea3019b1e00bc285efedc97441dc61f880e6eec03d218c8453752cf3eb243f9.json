{"title":"Quantum Temporal Resonator: Temporal Displacement Using Quantum Entanglement and Metamaterials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0794/v1","date":1720577340000,"content":"This paper discusses the Quantum Temporal Resonator (QTR), a theoretical device leveraging quantum entanglement and metamaterials with negative refraction indices to achieve controlled temporal displacement. By establishing a network of entangled particles within a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) and utilizing a resonant cavity made of advanced metamaterials, the QTR creates localized distortions in space-time. The frequency and amplitude of temporal harmonics within this cavity are finely tuned to allow for precise temporal displacement of matter and information. Numerical simulations demonstrate the coupling between the quantum wave function and electromagnetic fields, validating the theoretical model. The results show distinctive patterns in the wave function and perturbations in the electric field, supporting the feasibility of achieving controlled temporal displacement. This study explores the theoretical framework, mathematical modeling, experimental setup, and potential applications of the QTR, providing a comprehensive analysis of its feasibility and implications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ea3019b1e00bc285efedc97441dc61f880e6eec03d218c8453752cf3eb243f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
