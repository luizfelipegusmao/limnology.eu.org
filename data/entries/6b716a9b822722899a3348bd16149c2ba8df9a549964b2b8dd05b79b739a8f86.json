{"title":"The trajectories of CD4 T lymphocytes over time in patients who have defaulted on treatment for tuberculosis in a cohort of people living with HIV, Recife/PE","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299244","date":1710338400000,"content":"<p>by Rossana Cunha, Demócrito de B.

Ximenes</p>\r\nBackground <p>The CD4 T lymphocyte count in people living with HIV (PLHIV) is a predictor for the progression of the disease (AIDS), survival and response to antiretroviral treatment (ART). A CD4 T lymphocyte count of less than 200 cells/mm3 is indicative of a greater risk for the onset of opportunistic diseases and death. Defaulting on treatment for tuberculosis (TB) may impact immune recovery in PLHIV who are taking ART. The aim of this study was to investigate an association of the CD4 lymphocyte with TB treatment Trajectory and with death.</p> Methods <p>A cohort of PLHIV over eighteen years of age and who were taking ART and who had defaulted on pulmonary TB treatment. Latent Class analysis was used to identify different trajectories of CD4 T lymphocyte counts over time.</p> Results <p>Latent class 1 (High CD4 trajectory) grouped individuals together who were characterized as maintaining a low probability (0 to 29%) of a CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>over time, while latent class 2 (Low CD4 trajectory) grouped individuals together with a high probability (93% to 60%), and latent class 3 (Fluctuating CD4 trajectory), grouped individuals with a fluctuating probability (66% to 0%). The chance of defaulting on treatment earlier (≤ 90 days) was four times higher in latent class 2 (Low CD4 trajectory). Although there was no statistical significance, there was a higher frequency of deaths in this same latent class.</p> Conclusion <p>Individuals with a high probability of a CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/ mm<sup>3</sup> should be monitored in order to avoid treatment default and thereby prevent death. New studies should be conducted with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up time in PLHIV who initiated ART treatment early so as to support clinical decisions for a better understanding of immune behavior.</p>","author":"Rossana Cunha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6b716a9b822722899a3348bd16149c2ba8df9a549964b2b8dd05b79b739a8f86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
