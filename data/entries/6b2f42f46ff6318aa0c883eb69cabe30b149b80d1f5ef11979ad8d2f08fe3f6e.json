{"title":"Impact of Replacing Fish Meal With Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) Meal on Diet Acceptability in Juvenile Nile Tilapia: Palatability and Nutritional and Health Considerations for Dietary Preference","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/3409955?af=R","date":1729259400000,"content":"<p>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two protein sources (black soldier fly [<i>Hermetia illucens</i>] meal [BSFM] vs. fish meal [FM]) on intake target “diet preference” in juvenile Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>) by a self-feeding method (trial 1). Growth, body composition, blood parameters, and immunity genes expression were also evaluated to be correlated with behavioral data (trial 2). Four experimental diets were prepared containing 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% BSFM as a substitute for FM protein, which were considered treatments T0 (control), T33, T66, and T100, respectively. In trial 1 (32 days), 60 juveniles (77.97 ± 8.5 g, standard error of the mean [SEM]) were randomly distributed in 60 aquariums (40 L). Fish were challenged to select among A, T0 vs. T33; B, T0 vs. T66; C, T0 vs. T100; D, T33 vs. T66; E, T33 vs. T100; and F, T66 vs. T100 using two floating food halls per aquarium to provide different diets. In trial 2, 240 juveniles (2.80 ± 0.25 g) were distributed in 16 tanks (40 L). The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments (T0, T33, T66, and T100) and four replies. Fish were fed (5% body weight [BW]) experimental diets for 2 months. For the trial 1 results, no difference was observed in A, T0 vs. T33 (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Fish were allowed to select conditions B, C, D, E, and F and preferred the diets containing no or low BSFM content: B = T0, C = T0, D = T33, E = T33, and F = T66 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In trial 2, final weight and daily weight gain had lower values when animals were fed 100% FM replacement with BSFM (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The fish fed T0 showed lower viscerosomatic indices (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moisture and total protein were higher in the fish fed T0, but protein content did not differ from T33 (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Ethereal extract increased with rising BSFM (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in glucose, creatinine, total protein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and albumin lowered in fish when increase dietary BSFM (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>gpx</i>, <i>il-8</i>, <i>il-10</i>, <i>tnf-α</i>, <i>sod</i>, <i>cat</i>, <i>tlr-1</i>, <i>myd</i>, and <i>nf-κb</i> did not differ among treatments (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). However, il-1<i>β</i> expression increased in T0 and T100 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Diets with up to 66% BSFM did not affect performance of juvenile tilapia. However, fish showed a preference for diet containing 33% BSFM.</p>","author":"Camila Gomes de Oliveira, \nDébora de Almeida Freitas, \nPaula Adriane Perez Ribeiro, \nRafael Rusth Costa Teixeira, \nRodrigo Fortes da Silva, \nPedro Gomes Gamarano, \nRenato Duarte de Araújo, \nVerônica Guimarães Landa Prado, \nHelder de Oliveira Guilherme, \nRenan Rosa Paulino, \nLeandro Santos Costa, \nChristyn Bailey","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"6b2f42f46ff6318aa0c883eb69cabe30b149b80d1f5ef11979ad8d2f08fe3f6e","category":"Environment"}
