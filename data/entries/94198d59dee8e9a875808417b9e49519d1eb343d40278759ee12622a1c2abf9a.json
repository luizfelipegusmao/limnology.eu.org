For example, small males characteristically lose contests with larger males and may be metabolically constrained from sustaining energetically demanding reproductive behaviors. Small males thus often utilize alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) to maximize their reproductive success. How variation in body size among behavioral phenotypes arises can provide important insight into the maintenance of ARTs. For instance, smaller body sizes for males adopting ARTs may simply be a function of age, suggesting that the tactic is maintained by the periodic recruitment of young males into the population. Alternatively, body size differences among behavioral phenotypes that are unrelated to age suggest disparate growth rates that potentially arise as a consequence of variation in environmental conditions during development or genotypic differences between the phenotypes. Here we examine these alternative scenarios in the green treefrog, <i>Dryophytes cinereus</i>, using skeletochronological analysis combined with body size measures. As with many other anuran amphibians, male green treefrogs conditionally adopt a noncalling satellite mating tactic and attempt to intercept females attracted to the vocalizations of calling “host” males. We show that males adopting satellite behavior in natural choruses are smaller than calling males but do not represent a class of younger individuals, indicating that satellite males have lower growth rates than calling males. We also show that satellite males are in poorer condition than larger calling males, implicating energetic constraints in size-related variation in mating tactic expression. Our work suggests that environmental conditions during development, genetic differences between phenotypes, or both, give rise to size discrepancies in behavioral phenotypes, neither of which have been previously explored in anurans. We discuss body size and condition differences between behavioral phenotypes in the context of energetic constraints and endocrine mediation of tactic expression in this species.</p>","author":"Christopher J.
