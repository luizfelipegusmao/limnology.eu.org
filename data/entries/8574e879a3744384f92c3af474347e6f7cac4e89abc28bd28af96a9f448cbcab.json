{"title":"Design and Evaluation of a Memory Recalling Virtual Reality Application for Elderly Users","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0606/v1","date":1710189350000,"content":"Virtual Reality (VR) can be useful in efforts that aim to improve wellbeing of older members of the society. Within this context, the work presented in this paper aims to provide to elderly a user-friendly and enjoyable Virtual Reality (VR) application incorporating memory recalling and storytelling activities that can promote mental awareness, so that negative side effects related to brain inactivity are prevented. An important aspect of the proposed VR application is the presence of a virtual audience that listens to the stories presented by elderly users, and interacts with the user. In an effort to maximize the impact of the VR application, research was conducted to study whether the elderly are willing to use the VR application and whether they believe it can help to improve well-being and reduce the effects of loneliness and social isolation. The results show that elderly users are positive towards the use of such an application in everyday life, as a means of improving their overall well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8574e879a3744384f92c3af474347e6f7cac4e89abc28bd28af96a9f448cbcab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
