{"title":"Retrospective Study of Maxillary Sinus Augmentation Using Demineralized Tooth Block Bone for Dental Implant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0048/v1","date":1717462386000,"content":"(1) Background : When placing implants in the maxillary posterior region with insufficient alveolar bone, a maxillary sinus elevation is necessary. Autogenous bone, though biologically ideal, poses risks and discomfort due to donor site harvesting. Block-type autogenous tooth bone graft material, made from the patientâ€™s own extracted tooth, offers similar biological stability without these drawbacks; (2) Methods : This study observed the progress of 19 implant patients who were treated with maxillary sinus elevation procedures using block-type autogenous tooth bone graft material at the Daegu Catholic University Medical Center. Extracted teeth were processed into demineralized tooth block bone. After elevating the sinus membrane, implants and the tooth bone graft material were placed in the space, and the bony window was repositioned. Postoperative evaluations through clinical observation and radiographic imaging assessed sinus membrane elevation, alveolar bone height increase, and implant osseointegration; (3) Results : Results showed proportional increases in alveolar bone height to the graft material size, with long-term stability. No postoperative complications occurred, even with sinus membrane perforation, and implants remained stable; (4) Conclusions : The study concludes that maxillary sinus lifts using block-type autogenous tooth bone graft material provide excellent bone induction and biocompatibility, making it a highly beneficial method for both dentists and patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa63fdea00f27aaa301c69f5881104d83be30473c4aa42a736ba4fcdc908315f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
