{"title":"An Open Frame Loading Stage for High-Resolution Microtomography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1905/v1","date":1727179518000,"content":"High-resolution in-situ CT measurements in the (sub-)$\\upmu$m range are typically only feasible in synchrotron facilities, as the use of a conventional loading stage in laboratory CTs with a cone beam source does not permit a corresponding geometric magnification. This publication presents a CT system with a novel concept that allows spatial resolutions down to 0.5 $\\upmu$m on the one hand, and on the other hand is able to apply loads up to 5 kN in compression and tension direction to the sample during the measurement. This leads to a challenging design of the system with regard to the required precision of the mechanical setup, if measurements close to the theoretically possible magnification can be carried out successfully. The components utilized are presented, along with the requisite considerations and methodologies. It can be demonstrated that the intended specifications with regard to precision and quality are met. Finally, a complex measurement problem in materials science is presented as an illustrative example that demonstrates the potential of the system described.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1508b9543e5dbd599e08f45061827aefb5186419a91a0cbcbc87f2f6e99874fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
