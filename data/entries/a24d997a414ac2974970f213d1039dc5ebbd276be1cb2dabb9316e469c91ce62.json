{"title":"Biotic homogenisation and differentiation of fish assemblages in subtropical agroecosystems located in southern China","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05502-9","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Anthropogenic land use has caused a major crisis to the biodiversity of stream fishes in recent decades, especially with regard to biotic homogenisation. Understanding the response of stream fishes to anthropogenic land use will help to promptly implement effective conservation measures. In this study, we investigated the effects of agriculture on fish diversity in streams in the Wannan Mountains, China. We predicted that agriculture would influence fish diversity by affecting local habitat conditions. The results showed that habitat conditions (e.g. water temperature, water width, water depth) differed significantly between disturbed and reference sites. The disturbed sites had high species richness due to the addition of translocated species outpacing the loss of endemic species. Moreover, fish assemblages showed taxonomic differentiation accompanied by functional homogenisation, which mainly resulted from the addition of translocated species with redundant functional traits. However, the emergence of homogenisation shows a time delay. The biotic differentiation of fish assemblages in agroecosystems is temporary in the Wannan Mountains, and homogenisation may eventually develop as stress intensifies. Thus, it is urgent and necessary to take effective conservation measures to delay or prevent fish assemblages from worsening in agroecosystems before homogenisation develops.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"a24d997a414ac2974970f213d1039dc5ebbd276be1cb2dabb9316e469c91ce62","category":"Environment"}
