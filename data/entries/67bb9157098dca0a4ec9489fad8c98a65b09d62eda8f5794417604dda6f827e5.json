{"title":"A Hybrid Analytical Framework for Enhancing Cybersecurity in Underdeveloped Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1442/v1","date":1729225740000,"content":"This paper presents an approach to assess and improve the cybersecurity infras- tructure of developing countries. We have highlighted and addressed the critical gaps through a hybrid approach encompassing SWOT analysis, benchmarking using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and, Root Cause Analysis (RCA). This approach has provided a strong basis for evaluating cybersecurity performance by combining qualitative insights with quantitative metrics. As a case study, we have compared an underdeveloped countryâ€™s (Pakistan) cybersecurity pos- ture to five highly developed countries (Lithuania, Estonia, Singapore, Spain,and Norway). Our analysis has identified cybersecurity shortcomings and pro- vided actionable recommendations within a flexible framework, applicable for all developing countries to identify and address vulnerabilities, and align their cybersecurity infrastructure with international standards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67bb9157098dca0a4ec9489fad8c98a65b09d62eda8f5794417604dda6f827e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
