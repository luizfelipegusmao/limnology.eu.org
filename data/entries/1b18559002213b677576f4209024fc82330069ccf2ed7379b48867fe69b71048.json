Soil organic carbon (C) sequestration and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) burial were measured in soils of two floodplain wetlands of the West Fork of the White River watershed (Indiana, USA) whose catchments differed in land use.

The catchment of one floodplain, Upper West Fork, is dominated by row crop agriculture (61%) whereas the second catchment, Beanblossom Creek, is mostly forested (85%). Soils (0–30 cm) of the two floodplain wetlands had similar bulk density (1.23 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Soil organic C and N were low in both floodplains but the percent organic C and N was two times greater (3.3% C, 0.22% N) in the agricultural floodplain than in the floodplain in the forested catchment (1.5% C, 0.14% N). Soil P was three times greater in the agricultural (1100 μg/g) than in the forested floodplain (350 μg/g). Recent soil accretion based on <sup>137</sup>Cs which provides a historical record since 1964 (60 years), was two times greater in the agricultural floodplain (2.2 mm/year) than in the forested catchment (1.0 mm/year). Sediment deposition (2500 g/m<sup>2</sup>/year), C sequestration (90 g/m<sup>2</sup>/year), and N burial (7.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>/year) were three times greater in the agricultural floodplain and P burial was seven times greater (3.0 vs. 0.41 g/m<sup>2</sup>/year). Long-term measurements (100 years) based on <sup>210</sup>Pb did not show large differences in C sequestration and N burial between the two floodplains though soil accretion and sediment deposition were greater in the forested floodplain. We attribute these higher rates to greater erosion in the watershed before 1950 when the catchment had more agricultural land and before instruction on best management practices to reduce soil erosion. These findings confirm previously published studies that show that P enrichment and accumulation in floodplain soils represent legacy effects of agricultural land use in the catchment.</p>","author":"Christopher Craft, \nShanze Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"1b18559002213b677576f4209024fc82330069ccf2ed7379b48867fe69b71048","category":"Environment"}
