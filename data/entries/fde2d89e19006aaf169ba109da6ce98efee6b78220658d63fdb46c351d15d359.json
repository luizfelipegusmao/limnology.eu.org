{"title":"Evaluation of High Stocking Densities on the Water Quality and Growth Performance of Pacific White Shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei Reared in a Mixotrophic Biofloc Nursery System","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/1765366?af=R","date":1700467200000,"content":"<p>The present study aimed to explore the effects of intensive culture densities on the water quality and growth performance of the Pacific white shrimp <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> reared in a mixotrophic biofloc system (heterotrophic/chemoautotrophic) at three stocking rates of 5,000, 4,000, and 3,000 PL/m<sup>3</sup> (namely G5000, G4000, and G3000, respectively) for 21 days. At the end of the study, the mean values of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen saturation level, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, free carbon dioxide, alkalinity, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite-nitrogen (NO<sub>2</sub>-N), nitrate-nitrogen, and settleable solids did not substantially differ among study groups (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). In addition, the highest mean levels of TAN and NO<sub>2</sub>-N recorded were 1.27 mg/l (G4000) and 9.23 mg/l (G3000), respectively. The results of growth performance revealed that final body weight, weight gain, weekly growth rate, and specific growth rate were not affected by the studied densities (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Although no significant differences were observed (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05), the G3000 treatment exhibited the highest survival rate (80.66% ± 8.56%), followed by G4000 (75.05% ± 0.31%) and G5000 (71.63% ± 2.11%). However, the shrimp yield was meaningfully higher for G5000 treatment (1.72 ± 0.0.09 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, 0.69 ± 0.03 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared with G3000 group (1.27 ± 0.0.12 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, 0.48 ± 0.04 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Our results indicate <i>L. vannamei</i> can be reared at intensive nursery densities of up to 5,000 PL/m<sup>3</sup> (2,000 PL/m<sup>2</sup>) until reaching 0.5 g without significant retardation in water quality, growth, and survival.</p>","author":"Ghasem Mohammadi, \nMohammad Seddiq Mortazavi, \nMahmoud Hafezieh, \nLiqiao Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"fde2d89e19006aaf169ba109da6ce98efee6b78220658d63fdb46c351d15d359","category":"Environment"}
