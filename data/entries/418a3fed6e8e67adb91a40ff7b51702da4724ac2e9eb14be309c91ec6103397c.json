{"title":"The identities of Pinnotheres villosulus Guérin-Méneville, 1832, P. edwardsi De Man, 1887, and P. trichopus Tesch, 1918, with description of a new Indo-West Pacific genus of pinnotherid crab (Decapoda: Brachyura: Pinnotheridae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae047/7734075?rss=1","date":1723766400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Nepinnotheres villosulus</span> (Guérin-Méneville, 1832) [<a href=\"#CIT0019\">Guérin-Méneville, 1829–1837</a>] [type locality: Timor] and <span>Nepinnotheres edwardsi</span> (<a href=\"#CIT0015\">De Man, 1887</a>) [type locality: Mergui Archipelago], as currently understood, are both reportedly widespread in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, and unique in the genus in having females densely covered by a setal tomentum that completely obscures the surfaces of the carapace and pereiopods. Based on the limited information contained in the type accounts, <span>N. edwardsi</span> and <span>N. villosulus</span> appear indistinguishable, but this cannot currently be confirmed by comparing type material because the holotype of <span>N. villosulus</span>, the senior name, is lost. A neotype is therefore designated for <span>N. villosulus</span> to fix its identity and taxonomic status as a senior synonym of <span>N. edwardsi.</span> In addition to the unique setation pattern of female <span>N. villosulus</span>, males of the species also present important differences from those of male <span>Nepinnotheres</span> sensu stricto. <span>Pinnotheres trichopus</span><a href=\"#CIT0041\">Tesch, 1918</a> [type locality: Elat, Great Kei Island, Indonesia], is also shown to be a junior synonym of <span>P. villosulus</span>. Moreover, recent molecular phylogenetic analyses determined that <span>N. villosulus</span> is phylogenetically distant from <span>Nepinnotheres</span> sensu stricto. As such, we establish a new genus for <span>N. villosulus</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"418a3fed6e8e67adb91a40ff7b51702da4724ac2e9eb14be309c91ec6103397c","category":"Environment"}
