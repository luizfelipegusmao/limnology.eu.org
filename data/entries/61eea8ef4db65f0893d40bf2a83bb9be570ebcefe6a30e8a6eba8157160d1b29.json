An experimental platform for image processing was constructed to accurately track the position of a moving ball, enabling experimental verification of the pendulum’s motion under specific operating conditions. The experimental data demonstrated excellent agreement with simulated numerical results, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Furthermore, we performed simulations of a double obstacle pendulum system, investigating the effects of different parameters, including obstacle pin positions, quantities, and initial release angles, on the pendulum’s motion through numerical simulations. This research provides novel insights into addressing the challenges associated with abrupt and continuous changes in pendulum length.","author":"Yang Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"61eea8ef4db65f0893d40bf2a83bb9be570ebcefe6a30e8a6eba8157160d1b29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
