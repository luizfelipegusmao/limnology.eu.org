{"title":"Domains and Categories of Needs in Long-term Follow-up of Adult Cancer Survivors: A Scoping Review of Systematic Reviews","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0175/v1","date":1712043713000,"content":"The number of long-term cancer survivors increases continually. Understanding their needs is crucial to ensure an adequate follow-up. The aim of our study was to summarize the current literature concerning needs and what in-fluences these needs. A Scoping review of systematic reviews was conducted according to the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Four electronic databases were searched. Of 414 retrieved papers, 11 met the eligi-bility criteria. Needs were aggregated into six domains (health-related information, health system, mental, practical, relationship and physical) and 15 categories. The lack of adequate information and the lack of access and/or conti-nuity of supportive care were the most prominent needs. Female gender, younger age, a low level of family and/or social support, and higher educational level were identified as risk factors. Employment and relationship status can affect the needs both in a positive or negative way. The weeks or months after the end of the treatments are partic-ularly critical and needs can be emphasized during this period. Cancer survivors could also leave positive changes. The variety of needs affects the quality of life of cancer survivors. The current Swiss healthcare system is not de-signed to support these people. Needs assessments should be systematically provided to ensure a better awareness on the part of health professionals and to allow an individual, holistic, and integrated follow-up.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2980f8d59db81c794581bcb13ecfbd7d25e5073bbf9ac9065e92ca2c838a9acd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
