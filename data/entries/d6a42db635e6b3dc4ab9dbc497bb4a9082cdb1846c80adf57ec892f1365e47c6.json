The ecological network can ensure the ecological function of the region through linearly connecting ecological corridors and effectively solving the problem of landscape fragmentation that occurs in the evolution of landscape patterns. Based on MSPA and MCR models, the article analyses the distribution and changes of landscape types in the Haihe River basin and constructs an ecological network in the study area by combining the local ecological characteristics of the basin. The network structure is optimized in the end by selecting three large stepping stones, constructing 69 internal ecological stepping stones, identifying 212 fracture points, and adding seven ecological corridors to build a pointâ€“line surface network structure with an internal and external double-loop structure. The connectivity of the network structure is evaluated by using complex network method. It is calculated that the network connectivity performance is improved by 13.95% after optimization, which means the species exchange in the study area is closer.</p>","author":"Fawen Li, \nYuyao Zhao, \nYong Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"d6a42db635e6b3dc4ab9dbc497bb4a9082cdb1846c80adf57ec892f1365e47c6","category":"Environment"}
