Atomic TEM has been demonstrated near absolute zero with an in-situ cooling holder using liquid helium and a flow cryostat optimized for mechanical stability [<a href=\"#ozae044.917-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.917-B2\">2</a>]. However, the space of possible experiments in the electron microscope is large, and stability requirements depend on acquisition parameters. To capture high quality data under liquid helium cooling for the gamut of imaging, spectroscopy, and scanned diffraction modalities it is therefore desirable to understand stability needs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"75f4e9cffc43c32cd800bde6130ee9996e8fdfd170d143b3f8f962436b26f1e3","category":"Environment"}
