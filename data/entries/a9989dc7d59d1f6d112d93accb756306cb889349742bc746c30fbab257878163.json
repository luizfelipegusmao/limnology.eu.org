{"title":"Diversity, Regeneration Potential, and Natural Restoration of Miombo along an Anthropization Gradient in the Rural Area of Lubumbashi (Upper-Katanga, D.R. Congo)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0754/v1","date":1718160084000,"content":"Increased anthropogenic pressure on forest resources leads to deforestation and forest degradation, significantly limiting the regeneration capacity of native woody species and consequently the restoration of miombo woodlands in anthropized habitats within the rural area of Lubumbashi. This study assessed the diversity and natural regeneration capacity of miombo species through floristic inventories in three different habitats (unexploited forests, degraded forests, and post-cultivation fallows). The results reveal that for the adult’s stratum unexploited and degraded forests exhibit higher dendrometric (density, mean square diameter, basal area) and floristic parameter (taxa, genera, families) values compared to post-cultivation fallows. Furthermore, the regeneration of miombo woody species is higher in degraded forests (21 taxa; 105 juveniles/plot). However, regarding the sapling’s stratum (1 cm ≤ dbh &amp;lt; 10 cm), the three habitats display nearly similar situations. Additionally, the floristic composition and diversity of unexploited and degraded forests show a significantly higher similarity (76.50%) among them compared to these habitats and the post-cultivation fallows (56.00%). These findings indicate that miombo woodlands have the potential to regenerate and maintain floristic diversity. To sustain this natural regeneration capacity of miombo woody species and promote the restoration of forest mass and its floristic diversity, it is imperative to determine the rotation period after habitat exploitation and regulate anthropogenic activities and late bush fires, particularly in anthropized habitats at the village level.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9989dc7d59d1f6d112d93accb756306cb889349742bc746c30fbab257878163","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
