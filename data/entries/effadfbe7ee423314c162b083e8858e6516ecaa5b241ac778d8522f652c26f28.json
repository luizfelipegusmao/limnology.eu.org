{"title":"Methodology for the Development of Blended Learning Support Virtual Courses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1927/v1","date":1727179333000,"content":"The article addresses the problem of course development in virtual teaching and learning spaces by teachers to support blended learning in the Ecuadorian unified baccalaureate. For this purpose, a documentary analysis of 465 papers selected by a search in Scopus and Google Scholar about blended learning and 145 papers selected by a search in Scopus and Google Scholar about development of virtual courses was carried out. The definition of the first concept is qualitatively different from the previous ones by analysing it as a form of organisation and assessing the configuration of face-to-face and distance learning depending on the educational objective. The second concept defined presents the unrepeatable and unique character of each course given by the configuration of its digital resources, the characteristics of these resources and the new qualities that are conferred on them. Subsequently, based on them, the methodology that contributed to the development of courses in virtual spaces as a support to blended learning is proposed. Unlike other methodologies, the proposal explicitly states its conceptual apparatus and the necessary requirements for its introduction in an educational organization. It incorporates important actions that do not appear in other methodologies such as cross-cutting processes including quality assurance with its corresponding metrics, maintenance, recall and evaluation of previous actions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"effadfbe7ee423314c162b083e8858e6516ecaa5b241ac778d8522f652c26f28","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
