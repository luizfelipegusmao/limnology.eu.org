{"title":"A cry for kelp: Evidence for polyphenolic inhibition of Oxford Nanopore sequencing of brown algae","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13513?af=R","date":1729589450000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Genomic resources have yielded unprecedented insights into ecological and evolutionary processes, not to mention their importance in economic and conservation management of specific organisms. However, the field of macroalgal genomics is hampered by difficulties in the isolation of suitable DNA. Even when DNA that appears high quality by standard metrics has been isolated, such samples may not perform well during the sequencing process. We here have compared Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing results for three species of macroalgae to those of nonmacroalgal species and determined that when using macroalgal samples, sequencing activity declined rapidly, resulting in reduced sequencing yield. Chemical analysis of macroalgal DNA that would be considered suitable for sequencing revealed that DNA derived from dried macroalgae was enriched for polyphenol–DNA adducts (DNA with large polyphenols chemically attached to it), which may have led to sequencing inhibition. Of note, we observed the strongest evidence of sequencing inhibition and reduced sequence output when using samples dried using silica gel—suggesting that such storage approaches may not be appropriate for samples destined for Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Our findings have wide-ranging implications for the generation of genomic resources from macroalgae and suggest a need to develop new storage methods that are more amenable to Oxford Nanopore sequencing or to use fresh flash-frozen tissue wherever possible for genome sequencing.</p>","author":"William S.
