{"title":"Performance of the VITEK MS System for the Identification of Filamentous Fungi in a Routine Microbiological Laboratory in Chile","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0457/v1","date":1723083519000,"content":"Background: Filamentous fungi are an emergent cause of severe infections in immunocompromised patients. Timely and accurate identification is crucial to initiate appropriate therapy. Traditional identification methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and operator-dependent. Ma-trix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid and easy-to-perform identification method. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a commercial MALDI-TOF MS platform to identify filamentous fungi in a routine laboratory. Material and Methods: We included 67 fungal isolates from 35 species/species complexes within 15 genera, confirmed in mycology reference laboratories. 33 were from clinical samples and 34 from strain collections. The study used the VITEK MS system (v3.2.0 database), after sample extraction by VITEK MS Mould Kit. Results were classified into categories: ‘correct species’, ‘correct species complex’, ‘correct genus’, ‘incorrect identification’, and ‘no identification’. We also evaluated the practicality of the kit. Results: VITEK MS correctly identified 91.0% of isolates (58.2% to species, 29.9% to species complex, and 1.5% to genus level). In 82%, the result matched the species/species complex identified by reference methods. No misidentifications were observed. The kit was rapid and easy to use. Conclusion: The VITEK MS system showed a high capability to accurately identify filamentous fungi in a routine laboratory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c3f513952ac589775a420b8453bd0e7abf11ed9146e6c4da2823d9992fb3ad4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
