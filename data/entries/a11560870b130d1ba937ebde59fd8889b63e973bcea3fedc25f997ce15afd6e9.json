{"title":"What Is A Disease for Doctors? A Realist Thematic Analysis and Implications for Medical Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1908/v1","date":1714379597000,"content":"Given the long-standing debate about the nature of the concept of disease, the objective of this study was to understand how doctors categorize a condition as a disease or not and what kind of information they use. A survey with a set of clinical vignettes was designed, and a group of physicians were asked to interpret those situations as a disease or not and to motivate their choice with a short written text. Thematic analysis of the answers resulted in four themes: the temporal dimension of a disease, reification of disease, disease as an existential condition, and disease as a motivation to action. The respondentsâ€™ interpretations were very heterogeneous, supporting the idea that physicians do not share a common prototypical concept of disease. An interpretation of these results according to a critical realist and systemic approach suggested that the doctor-patient relationship is the context able to influence the interpretation of a condition as a disease or not as the final outcome of a process in which both objective, subjective, and socially mediated elements are taken into consideration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a11560870b130d1ba937ebde59fd8889b63e973bcea3fedc25f997ce15afd6e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
