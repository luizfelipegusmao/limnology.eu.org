{"title":"Maternal investment and early thermal conditions affect performance and antipredator responses","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae035/7658585?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Exposure to increased temperatures during early development can lead to phenotypic plasticity in morphology, physiology, and behavior across a range of ectothermic animals. In addition, maternal effects are known to be important contributors to phenotypic variation in offspring. Whether the 2 factors interact to shape offspring morphology and behavior is rarely explored. This is critical because climate change is expected to impact both incubation temperature and maternal stress and resource allocation. Using a fully factorial design, and Bayesian multivariate mixed models, we explored how the manipulation of early thermal environment and yolk-quantity in eggs affected the morphology, performance, and antipredator behavior of 2 sympatric Australian skink species (<span>Lampropholis delicata</span> and <span>L. guichenoti</span>). We found that juveniles from the hot treatment were larger than those on the cold treatment in <span>L. guichenoti</span> but not <span>L. delicata</span>. Using repeated behavioral measures for individual lizards, we found an interaction between incubation temperature and maternal investment in performance, with running speed being affected in a species-specific way by the treatment. We predicted that changes in performance should influence antipredator responses. In support of this prediction, we found that maternal investment impacted antipredator behavior, with animals from the yolk-reduced and cold treatment resuming activity faster after a simulated predatory attack in <span>L. delicata</span>. However, the prediction was not supported in <span>L. guichenoti</span>. Our results highlight the importance of exploring the multifaceted role that environments play across generations to understand how different anthropogenic factors will impact wildlife in the future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"1ba7f0398561f2f352034cddf6d287ba5ebf215460b7f6199ea3d4f12d561174","category":"Environment"}
