{"title":"Precision Ice Detection on Power Transmission Lines: A Novel Approach with Multi-Scale Retinex and Advanced Morphological Edge Detection Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1396/v1","date":1724138590000,"content":"Background: Ice formation on power transmission lines presents significant risks, including structural damage and power outages. Traditional methods for detecting ice on these lines have limitations, particularly in challenging environmental conditions. This study aims to enhance ice detection accuracy by introducing a novel image segmentation and edge detection methodology using improved multi-scale Retinex and advanced morphological operations. Method: The proposed method integrates multi-stage image processing techniques, including image enhancement, grayscale conversion, thresholding, segmentation, object isolation, and edge detection. High-resolution binocular cameras were used to capture images of ice formations on transmission lines. The effectiveness of the method was assessed through a series of metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, and compared with existing methodologies. Results: The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in both ice detection and thickness measurement. The method effectively identified and isolated ice formations under various conditions with an average accuracy of 98.35%, sensitivity of 91.63%, specificity of 99.42%, and precision of 96.03%. Additionally, the analysis of ice thickness measurements further highlighted the methodâ€™s accuracy, with a notably low root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.20 mm and mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.10 mm, along with a strong R-squared value of 0.95. These statistical metrics show that the proposed method not only outperforms previous methods in consistency and alignment with manual measurements but also stands out as the most reliable option for tasks requiring precise measurements, offering significant advancements in accuracy and reliability over existing methodologies. Conclusions: The enhanced image segmentation and edge detection approach provides a more accurate and reliable method for monitoring ice formations on power transmission lines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfdbe9c6b6cb046cfc5178cea87c39d146fef13acbdf543ba6a743fe266e3c84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
