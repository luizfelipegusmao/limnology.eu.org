{"title":"Emotional Intelligence May Be Associated with Some forms of Creative Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1920/v1","date":1724727653000,"content":"The current study examined the relationship between creative potential, estimated with tests of divergent thinking (DT) and emotional intelligence (EI). Two DT tests were used, one commonly used to estimate creative potential (Titles Game) and the other focusing on social problems (Social Games). The youth version of the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory ( EQ-i: YV) was used to measure EI. The sample comprised 244 male and female gifted (N = 125) and nongifted (N = 119) high school students in Saudi Arabia. The first objective was to examine whether the EI-DT relationship differs based on the nature of the task of the two DT tests used in the current study (Social Games vs Titles Game). The second objective was to test whether the Interpersonal and Intrapersonal subscales of EI are more associated with DT than the Adaptability and Stress Management EI subscales. Canonical correlation analysis showed that the relationship between the Social Games test and EI was stronger than the relationship between the Titles Game test and EI. Two path analyses were run: one for the total sample and the second for the gifted sample. The likelihood ratio test showed that the Social Games test was more strongly associated with EQ-i subscales than the Titles Game test for both samples. As expected, the Inter and the Intrapersonal subscales of the EQ-i were highly related to Social Games fluency and originality scores compared with Stress Management and Adaptability subscales. Limitations and future directions are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1a9f6ed415a1a16c1e52c50aa540f24219fa5952ed555378f6c7f75becd830b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
