{"title":"Sex- and strain-dependent effects of ageing on sleep and activity patterns in <i>Drosophila</i>","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308652","date":1723816800000,"content":"<p>by Nathan Woodling</p>\r\n\r\nThe fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i> is a major discovery platform in the biology of ageing due to its balance of relatively short lifespan and relatively complex physiology and behaviour. Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to <i>Drosophila</i> and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in <i>Drosophila</i> show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of <i>Drosophila</i> to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes–including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation–depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of <i>Drosophila</i>. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.","author":"Nathan Woodling","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bec0c8f4f99ef27420387f7a948f2f2bee7938ac6fee0bc0d65f8e11ea82b90d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
