{"title":"Depressive Symptoms and Gut Microbiota after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy: A Pre-post Intervention Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0551/v1","date":1710146731000,"content":"Objective: Mechanical bowel preparation is essential for the visualisation of the colon during colonoscopy, and previous studies have identified changes in gut microbiota composition after bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Considering the gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in mood, we aimed to explore the potential impact of this intervention on mood and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Methods: We conducted a pre-post intervention study, with timepoints of one week before and one month after bowel preparation and colonoscopy, in community-dwelling adults referred for colonoscopy. Our primary outcome was change in average Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression sub-scores using generalised estimating equations. We also examined changes in average anxiety, stress, and quality of life scores, and faecal microbiota composition and potential function using 16S rRNA sequencing. We further explored associations between changes in depressive symptoms and the gut microbiota and conducted post-hoc analyses to explore potential effect modifiers. Key Results: 59 participants were included in the analyses. Depressive symptoms decreased one-month post-procedure compared to baseline (adjusted β=−0.64; 95%CI: −1.18, −0.11). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) appeared to moderate this relationship (1.78; 0.292, 3.26); depressive symptoms increased in those with, and decreased in those without, IBS. Changes in gut microbiome composition included reduced alpha diversity, modest effects on beta-diversity, and increases in genera associated with potential health benefits, one-month post-procedure compared to baseline. Increases in the CLR-transformed abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG-009 were associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence of a potential mental health effect of bowel preparation and colonoscopy, which may be associated with changes to the gut microbiota. There may also be a differential mental health impact of this procedure for those with and without IBS. Considering the limitations of our study, further research is required to confirm these findings and their clinical relevance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7660cc24295761574a7018686c84eec216a95de0d5dc6e9b15a8f0c52cee2d30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
