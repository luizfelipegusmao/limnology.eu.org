We conducted a randomized clinical trial to analyze the impact of MAOA genetic variations on the severity of BQ craving. This was measured using DSM-5 criteria and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for betel-quid (Y-BOCS-BQ). Participants were grouped according to the severity of BUD and MAOA gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs5953210 genotypes. Y-BOCS-BQ were assessed at baseline (week 0) and during follow-up at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. The AA genotype group showed significantly greater reductions in Y-BOCS-BQ at weeks 2 (p=0.0194), 4 (p=0.0078), 6 (p=0.0277), and 8 (p=0.0376) compared to the GG genotype group. Additionally, within the antidepressant group, the AA genotype showed significant reductions in Y-BOCS-BQ at weeks 2 (p=0.0313), 4 (p=0.0134), 6 (p=0.0061), and 8 (p=0.0241) compared to the GG genotype. Statistical analysis revealed a significant interaction between the treatment and placebo groups based on MAOA genotypes, with the AA genotype in the treatment group exhibiting a more pronounced decrease in Y-BOCS-BQ (p interaction","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e6d277f3a84d8d206b291dd86b07a0234fe53accc220e94dc9678d4722c7d5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
