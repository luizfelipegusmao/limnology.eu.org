{"title":"Comparative molecular and conventional cytogenetic analyses of three species of <i>Rhinella</i> (Anura; Bufonidae)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308785","date":1723730400000,"content":"<p>by David Santos da Silva, Rodrigo Petry Corrêa de Sousa, Marcelo Vallinoto, Marlon Ramires da Costa Lima, Renato Araújo da Costa, Ivanete de Oliveira Furo, Anderson José Baia Gomes, Edivaldo Herculano Corrêa de Oliveira</p>\r\n\r\nThe genus <i>Rhinella</i> corresponds to a group of anurans characterized by numerous taxonomic and systemic challenges, leading to their organization into species complexes. Cytogenetic data for this genus thus far are limited to the diploid number and chromosome morphology, which remain highly conserved among the species. In this study, we analyse the karyotypes of three species of the genus <i>Rhinella</i> (<i>Rhinella granulosa</i>, <i>Rhinella margaritifera</i>, and <i>Rhinella marina</i>) using both classical (conventional staining and C-banding) and molecular (FISH-fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization with 18S rDNA, telomeric sequences, and microsatellite probes) cytogenetic approaches. The aim of this study is to provide data that can reveal variations in the distribution of repetitive sequences that can contribute to understanding karyotypic diversification in these species. The results revealed a conserved karyotype across the species, with 2n = 22 and FN = 44, with metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes. C-banding revealed heterochromatic blocks in the pericentromeric region for all species, with a proximal block on the long arms of pairs 3 and 6 in <i>R</i>. <i>marina</i> and on the short arms of pairs 4 and 6 in <i>R</i>. <i>margaritifera</i>. Additionally, 18S rDNA probes hybridized to pair 5 in <i>R</i>. <i>granulosa</i>, to pair 7 in <i>R</i>. <i>marina</i>, and to pair 10 in <i>R</i>. <i>margaritifera</i>. Telomeric sequence probes displayed signals exclusively in the distal region of the chromosomes, while microsatellite DNA probes showed species-specific patterns. These findings indicate that despite a conserved karyotypical macrostructure, chromosomal differences exist among the species due to the accumulation of repetitive sequences. This variation may be attributed to chromosome rearrangements or differential accumulation of these sequences, highlighting the dynamic role of repetitive sequences in the chromosomal evolution of <i>Rhinella</i> species. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the importance of the role of repetitive DNAs in chromosomal rearrangements to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms leading to independent diversification in the distinct phylogenetic groups of <i>Rhinella</i>.","author":"David Santos da Silva","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c6ede4fd4d6197f05ed9aaa437d06162d0f05240752c60369eccd2ea47e95bb3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
