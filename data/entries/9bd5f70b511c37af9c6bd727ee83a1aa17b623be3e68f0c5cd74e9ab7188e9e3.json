{"title":"Inference on an interacting diffusion system with application to in vitro glioblastoma migration (publication template)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article/41/3/250/7732137?rss=1","date":1724025600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer, with a median survival time for diagnosed patients of 15 months. Treatment of this cancer is typically a combination of radiation, chemotherapy and surgical removal of the tumour. However, the highly invasive and diffuse nature of glioblastoma makes surgical intrusions difficult, and the diffusive properties of glioblastoma are poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic interacting particle system as a model of <span>in vitro</span> glioblastoma migration, along with a maximum likelihood-algorithm designed for inference using microscopy imaging data. The inference method is evaluated on <span>in silico</span> simulation of cancer cell migration, and then applied to a real data set. We find that the inference method performs with a high degree of accuracy on the <span>in silico</span> data, and achieve promising results given the <span>in vitro</span> data set.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA Current Issue","siteHash":"8e41cf2ed671fc83106bccd712981630d68940d521d41091ba0f730fc4a24554","entryHash":"9bd5f70b511c37af9c6bd727ee83a1aa17b623be3e68f0c5cd74e9ab7188e9e3","category":"Environment"}
