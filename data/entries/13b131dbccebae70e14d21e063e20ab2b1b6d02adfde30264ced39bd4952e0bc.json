This study shows that pretreated with hydrogen peroxide in alkaline medium had the highest methane productivity. However, only thermal pretreatment at 80°C demonstrates an energy return on investment greater than 1, highlighting the importance of energy analysis in validating pretreatment processes for industrial application.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Anaerobic digestion processes for biogas generation using alperujo have been the subject of intensive studies suggesting that phenolic compounds act as microbial inhibitors in anaerobic digestion. Pretreatments are needed to reduce the effects of phenolic compounds and improve biogas production, especially for dry anaerobic digestion. However, industrial-scale implementation of these pretreatments is challenging, and it is unclear whether the improvement in biogas production justifies the energy expended on pretreatment. This study examines the energy analysis of dry anaerobic digestion and three alternative pretreatments: alkaline, oxidative and thermal. Results indicate that thermal pretreatment at <i>80°C</i> with added water reduces phenolic compounds in alperujo by <i>35.4%</i>. Meanwhile, pretreated with hydrogen peroxide in alkaline medium had the highest methane productivity (<i>205 mL CH</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>4</i>\n</sub>\n<i>/g</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>VS</i>\n</sub>). Even so, thermal pretreatment was only one with an energy return on investment greater than <i>1</i>, signifying the necessity for energy analysis to ensure the viability of pretreatment processes.</p>","author":"Rocio M.
