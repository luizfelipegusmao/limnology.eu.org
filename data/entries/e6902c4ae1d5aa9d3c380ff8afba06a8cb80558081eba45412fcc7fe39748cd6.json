{"title":"Floral Diversity and Pollination Syndromes in Agave subgenus Manfreda","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1376/7261725?rss=1","date":1693958400000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The genus <span>Agave</span> is an ecological keystone of American deserts and both culturally and economically important in Mexico. <span>Agave</span> is a large genus of about 250 species. The radiation of <span>Agave</span> is marked by an initial adaptation to desert environments and then a secondary diversification of species associated with pollinator groups, such as hummingbirds and nocturnal moths. Phylogenetic analyses place <span>Agave</span> subgenus <span>Manfreda</span>, or the “herbaceous agaves,” in a monophyletic clade that likely evolved in part as an adaptation to novel pollination vectors. Here, we present a morphological and observational study assessing the evolution of floral form in response to pollinator specialization within this understudied group. We found significant visitation by hummingbirds and nocturnal moths to several species within the <span>Agave</span> subgenus <span>Manfreda</span>. These observations also align with our morphological analyses of floral organs and support the evolution of distinct pollination syndromes. We found that not all floral morphology is consistent within a pollination syndrome, suggesting hidden diversity in the evolution of floral phenotypes in <span>Agave</span>. We also characterize the morphological variation between herbarium and live specimens, demonstrating that special consideration needs to be made when combining these types of data. This work identifies the potential for studying the functional evolution of diverse floral forms within <span>Agave</span> and demonstrates the need to further explore ecological and evolutionary relationships to understand pollinator influence on diversification in the genus.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"e6902c4ae1d5aa9d3c380ff8afba06a8cb80558081eba45412fcc7fe39748cd6","category":"Environment"}
