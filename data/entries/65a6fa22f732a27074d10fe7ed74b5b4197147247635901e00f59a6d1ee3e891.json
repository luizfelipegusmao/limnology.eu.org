In this work, it is shown that using a relatively limited set of parameter, it is possible to estimate key factors involved in such process. On the basis of 16 formulations containing different concentrations of photoinitiator and UV filter, attempt was made to rationalize the photonic parameters used in the 3D printing process, that is, the depth of penetration <i>Dp</i> and the critical energy <i>Ec</i>. It is shown that the experimental <i>Dp</i> values can be correlated with calculated ones from Bouguer–Beer–Lambert law. Real-time Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR) experiments were performed under similar conditions as in 3D printing. The conversion profiles were used to estimate the <i>Ec</i> values. The limits of this approach was discussed as a function of the UV filter concentration. Finally, the RT-FTIR curves are exploited to predict the in-depth conversion of the different 3D printed layers and compared to experimental results obtained by confocal Raman microscopy.</p>","author":"Xavier Allonas, \nBen Hammouda, \nBoris Métral, \nEmile Goldbach, \nAnne‐Sophie Schuller, \nChristian Ley, \nC.Céline Croutxé‐Barghorn","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"65a6fa22f732a27074d10fe7ed74b5b4197147247635901e00f59a6d1ee3e891","category":"Environment"}
