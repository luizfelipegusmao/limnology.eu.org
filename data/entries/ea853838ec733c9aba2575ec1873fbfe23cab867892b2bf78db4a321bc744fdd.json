{"title":"Obstetric Outcomes of Endometriosis Treatment or Surgery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0240/v1","date":1728266069000,"content":"Endometriosis is a prevalent chronic gynecological disorder. It tends to affect approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of signs and symptoms of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. It often leads to significant pain, inflammation, and infertility. This systematic review aims to explore the obstetric outcomes associated with various treatments for endometriosis including hormonal therapies and surgical interventions. Background/Objectives: Find out relationships, harms and benefit of a pregnancy after endometriosis treatment by surgery. Methods: The analysis involved a comprehensive search of electronic databases adhering to PRISMA standards, focusing on the impact of these treatments on conception, pregnancy, and childbirth outcomes.. Results: The findings indicate that while hormonal treatments like GnRH agonists can modulate ovarian response and pain, they do not significantly improve pregnancy rates compared to placebos. Conversely, laparoscopic surgery shows promising results in enhancing fertility, particularly within the first year post-operation. Conclusions: The review underscores the importance of individualized treatment plans, considering factors such as age, infertility duration, and disease severity, to optimize obstetric outcomes for women with endometriosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea853838ec733c9aba2575ec1873fbfe23cab867892b2bf78db4a321bc744fdd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
