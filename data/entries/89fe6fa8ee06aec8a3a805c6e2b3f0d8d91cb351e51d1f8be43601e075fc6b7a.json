{"title":"Synthesis, Characterization, and Docking Study of a Novel Indole Derivative Containing a Tosyl Moiety as Anti-oxidant Agent","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0909/v1","date":1720694471000,"content":"Indole derivatives are key components of natural products and possesses a wide range of biological and pharmaceutical applications. Here we present the synthesis of a new indole derivative namely 2-(1-ethyl-5-nitro-1H-indole-7-carbonyl) butyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (5). The structural elucidation of 5 was accomplished through comprehensive spectroscopic analysis, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Our molecular docking study revealed that compound 5 exhibits strong affinity towards Tyrosinase, making it a promising candidate as an antioxidant agent. Keywords: Indole derivative; Tosyl group; Molecular docking; Antioxidant agent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"89fe6fa8ee06aec8a3a805c6e2b3f0d8d91cb351e51d1f8be43601e075fc6b7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
