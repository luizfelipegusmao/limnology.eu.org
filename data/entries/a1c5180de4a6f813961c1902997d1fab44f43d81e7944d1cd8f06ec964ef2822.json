{"title":"Comparative Study of Rheological Properties of Fly Ash-Based Geopolymer Reinforced With PP Fiber For 3D Printing: An Experimental and Numerical Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1948/v1","date":1716977868000,"content":"The present study drops the line for the flow characteristics of fly ash-based (FA) geopolymers reinforced with polypropylene (PP) fibers undergoing the extrusion process during three-dimensional printing. Applying to the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model the research is ready with the sound theoretical basis which is used to understand the flow behavior of these materials under various conditions. A combination of experimental and numerical techniques that are based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL has been used in this study. The results of both the experimental and simulation approaches are then compared and the behavior of the material during extrusion is then examined. The experimental results proved PP fiber content has significant effects on rheological properties. The experiments on mixes which are either devoid of fibers or possess a high content of fiber, encountered problems like a high static yield stress and material segregation. Mixes with fibers of moderate content showed smoother extrusion processes, which means that a suitable range of fiber addition exists for the fibers that optimally balance the mechanical properties and extrudability. Numerical simulations typically agreed with experimental data for fiber contents up until it reached a certain level but not above, suggesting the existence of more complex interactions inside the fibers and the necessity for the subsequent model refinements. The investigation outlines a 0.25% and 0.5% fiber content range that leads to enhanced performance without bringing the extrusion process to greater complications and further making the production of proper, architecturally printed structures possible.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a1c5180de4a6f813961c1902997d1fab44f43d81e7944d1cd8f06ec964ef2822","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
