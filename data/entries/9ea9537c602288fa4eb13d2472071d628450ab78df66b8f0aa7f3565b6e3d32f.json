Magidson</p>\r\n\r\nSouth Africa has one of the highest rates of HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infection, and poor engagement in HIV/TB care contributes to morbidity and mortality. In South Africa, community health workers (CHWs) are tasked with re-engaging patients who have dropped out of HIV/TB care. CHWs have described substantial challenges with substance use (SU) and depression among their patients, while patients have described CHW stigma towards SU and depression as barriers to re-engagement in care. Yet, CHWs receive little-to-no training on SU or depression. Therefore, we piloted <i>Siyakhana</i>, a brief CHW training to reduce stigma related to SU and depression while improving skills for re-engaging these patients in HIV and/or TB care. This study evaluated the preliminary effectiveness (stigma towards SU and depression; clinical competence assessed via roleplay) and implementation (quantitative ratings of feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, adoption; semi-structured written qualitative feedback) of <i>Siyakhana</i> among CHWs and supervisors (<i>N</i> = 17) at pre- and post-training assessments. SU stigma significantly decreased (<i>F</i>(1,16) = 18.94, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.54). Depression stigma was lower than SU stigma at both timepoints and did not significantly decrease after training. CHW clinical competency towards patients with SU/depression significantly improved (<i>t</i>(11) = -3.35, <i>p</i> = 0.007, d = 1.00). The training was rated as feasible, acceptable, appropriate, and likely to be adopted by CHWs and their supervisors. Nonjudgmental communication was commonly described as the most useful training component. Based on this pilot, the training is being refined and evaluated in a larger randomized stepped-wedge clinical trial.","author":"Kristen S.
