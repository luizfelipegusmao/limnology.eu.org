{"title":"Mass Density and Energy Densities in Schrodinger&rsquo;s Equation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1792/v1","date":1714143864000,"content":"Defining integrals over volume element in curved spacetime together with the mass and energy densities within that region of spacetime is apparently equivalent to the given energy and mass of that body or particle. With this in mind equations involving energies and mass can be rewritten in terms of their densities and the integral over the volume element. The idea find its place in the Hamiltonian formulations, and can be carried over into quantum mechanical frameworks systematically accounting for the effect of spacetime volume structures and gravity on dynamics of quantum systems. This article briefly explores this concept and runs through various frameworks and equations relevant to this idea, particularly the schrodinger-Newton equation and discusses the cosmological constant as a vacuum energy density.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bdf37a993f2de8fc54b16d689bee984e969168420b2d91397c3e50bf23975ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
