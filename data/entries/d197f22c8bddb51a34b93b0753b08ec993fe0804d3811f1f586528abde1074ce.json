It is actually a supplement to the decoherence theory. We introduce the effective potential between eigenstates and show that a wave function in a superposition of several eigenstates reduces to a single eigenstate due to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking-like kinetic effect.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d197f22c8bddb51a34b93b0753b08ec993fe0804d3811f1f586528abde1074ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
