{"title":"Daily age, growth rate, and pelagic larval duration of commercially important snapper species in Abrolhos National Marine Park","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15654?af=R","date":1707890670000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The age and daily growth of fish are registered through the deposition of increments in their otoliths, which are concretions formed by the precipitation of substances present in the endolymphatic fluid, mainly calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Faced with the need to fill some of the gaps in the knowledge on the occurrence and duration of the initial stages of snapper species' life cycles in the Abrolhos Bank, this study aimed to describe the growth rates, age, and period of pelagic larval duration (PLD) of three snapper species during the larval pre-settlement phase, in the Abrolhos Bank region. The post-larvae were captured using light traps. Otoliths were removed from 117 samples of snapper species; however, only 69 were viable for age estimation, of which 15 were <i>Lutjanus analis</i>, 25 were <i>Lutjanus jocu</i>, and 29 were <i>Lutjanus synagris</i>. Together, the samples presented individuals with total lengths ranging from 16.14 to 24.76 mm and ages from 21 to 39 days. Settlement marks were found for all three species, and the average PLD was ~25 days. The somatic growth of the snapper species was positively correlated with otolith growth. <i>L. jocu</i> presented the greatest daily growth compared to the other species. The three species use the Abrolhos Bank as a larval settlement site, demonstrating plasticity by using different habitats throughout their lives.</p>","author":"Jeane Campos Silva, \nMarcelo Soeth, \nCarlos Werner Hackradt, \nAndre Lima, \nFabiana Cézar Félix‐Hackradt","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"ce589f73cc7c7f2b7346d6b2b6eeb6cab3bcb4282503ea702ea89a8a847348b3","category":"Environment"}
