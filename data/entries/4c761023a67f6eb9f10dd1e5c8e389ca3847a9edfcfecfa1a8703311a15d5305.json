{"title":"Digital Forensics Readiness in Big Data Wireless Networks: A Novel Framework and Incident Response Script for Linux-Hadoop Environments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1803/v1","date":1721743366000,"content":"The surge in big data and analytics has catalysed the proliferation of cybercrime, largely driven by organisations' intensified focus on gathering and processing personal data for profit, often overlooking security considerations. Hadoop and its derivatives are prominent platforms for managing big data, however, investigating security incidents within Hadoop environments poses intricate challenges due to scale, distribution, data diversity, replication, component complexity, and dynamicity. This paper proposes a digital forensics readiness framework and an incident response script for Linux-Hadoop systems, streamlining preliminary investigations. The framework offers a novel approach to digital forensics in the domains of big data and Hadoop environments. A prototype implementing important aspects of the DFR framework was developed and evaluated through comprehensive functionality and usability testing. The results demonstrated robust performance and efficacy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c761023a67f6eb9f10dd1e5c8e389ca3847a9edfcfecfa1a8703311a15d5305","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
