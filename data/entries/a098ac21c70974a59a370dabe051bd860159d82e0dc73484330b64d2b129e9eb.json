{"title":"Analysis of Habitability and Stellar Habitable Zones from Observed Exoplanets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1501/v1","date":1724220468000,"content":"The investigation of exoplanetary habitability is integral to advancing our knowledge of extraterrestrial life potential and detailing the environmental conditions of distant worlds. In this analysis, we explore the properties of exoplanets situated with respect to circumstellar habitable zones by implementing a sophisticated filtering methodology on data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This research encompasses a thorough examination of 5,595 confirmed exoplanets listed in the Archive as of March 10th, 2024, systematically evaluated according to their calculated surface temperatures and stellar classifications of their host stars, taking into account the biases implicit in the methodologies used for their discovery. Our findings elucidate distinctive patterns in exoplanetary attributes, which are significantly shaped by the spectral classifications and mass of the host stars. The insights garnered from our study not only enhance the existing models for managing burgeoning exoplanetary datasets, but also lay foundational groundwork for future explorations into the dynamic relationships between exoplanets and their stellar environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a098ac21c70974a59a370dabe051bd860159d82e0dc73484330b64d2b129e9eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
