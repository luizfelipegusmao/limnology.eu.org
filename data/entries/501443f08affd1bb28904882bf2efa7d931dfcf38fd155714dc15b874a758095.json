{"title":"Nanocurcumin: A Promising Therapeutic Candidate for Experimental Trichinellosis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/2/368/7602084?rss=1","date":1707264000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In our pursuit of an alternative drug against <span>Trichinella spiralis</span>, we assessed the effectiveness of nanocurcumin in alleviating pathogenesis, parasitological factors, MMP-9 levels, and its expression in the enteral and parenteral phases of infection. The nanocurcumin particles, with a spherical shape and a size of 100 ± 20 nm, were used in the study. Eighty mice were divided into four groups: the control group, the untreated infected group, the nanocurcumin-treated group, and the albendazole-treated group. The nanocurcumin-treated group exhibited a statistically significant increase in the percentage of lymphocytes, along with a reduction in neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils compared to the untreated, infected group. Both the nanocurcumin (87.2 and 97.3%) and the albendazole-treated groups (99.8 and 98.2%) showed a significant reduction in the mean number of intestinal worms and encysted larvae, respectively. The treated groups exhibited normal intestinal villi, suppression of the inflammatory process, and fewer instances of degenerated larvae in the diaphragm and muscle compared to the untreated, infected group. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA analyses revealed a significant downregulation of MMP-9 levels in the intestines and muscles of the treated groups. Our data demonstrate that nanocurcumin contains highly versatile molecules capable of modulating biological activity against inflammation and its pathway markers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"501443f08affd1bb28904882bf2efa7d931dfcf38fd155714dc15b874a758095","category":"Environment"}
