{"title":"Internal Structure of Dietary Habits as a Restriction on Healthy Eating Policy in Japan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1409/v1","date":1718869349000,"content":"Although promoting healthy eating is a policy objective, the controllability of dietary habits remains uncertain. The personal dietary patterns reflect many factors, of which some are relatively controllable for individual, and others are not. In this article, assuming that some sort of information about controllability of dietary habits is contained in the observed pattern of food consumptions, we focused on dietary pattern on its own. We introduced a statistical descriptive model for data on food frequency questionnaire, estimated strength of pairwise linkage between foodstuffs, and grouped foodstuffs by applying community detection to the networks of the estimated inter-food linkages. Those linkages represent co-movement of pairs of foods consumption. Furthermore, we demonstrated an analysis on the relationship between health of mind and dietary habits considering the aspect of controllability of dietary habits. Using an observational study in Japan, we obtained the following results: 115 foodstuffs were divided into 3 groups for both of genders, but the compositions were different by gender; in the analysis of mental health, some stress response items were associated with the dependence on some of those food groupings. As the grouping of foodstuffs based on our estimation depicted the internal structure of dietary habit that a healthy eating policy should regard as constraint, it follows that we should design the policy along the line with that grouping.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eee820e4f9bbcc65b950bf4f67fb9e2f12d33ca0e8489d05b523c4257ff29248","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
