{"title":"Broodstock development, breeding and larval rearing of Acanthopagrus berda (Forsskal, 1775), a suitable species for farming in tropical waters","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16114?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Standardization of seed production of the Picnic seabream, <i>Acanthopagrus berda</i>, was taken up in captivity. Broodstock development of <i>A. berda</i> was done in 6 m diameter galvanized iron cages during September 2020 to March 2021 using commercial feed (40% protein) supplemented with vitamins and minerals. Males with oozing milt were available consistently throughout the period while asynchronized maturation of female was observed. A pair of mature male and a female (oocyte diameter of 440 ± 12 μm) were induced using a dose of (0.25 ml kg<sup>−1</sup>) gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue and female was given a similar second dose after 6 h. Spawning occurred after 42 h of induction. Eggs were incubated in fibre glass tanks (100 L) in seawater (34 ppt) with gentle aeration. Number of eggs spawned was 0. 25 million with a fertilization rate of 88% and hatching rate of 80%. Planktonic larvae measured total length (TL) 1.7 ± 0.14 mm at 0 day post-hatch (dph), started exogenous feeding from 3 dph (TL 2.7 ± 0.48 mm) when the mouth size was 180 ± 2.8 μm. Yolk sac was completely exhausted by 3 dph. Co-feeding of rotifer <i>Brachionus rotundiformis</i> at 5 numbers (nos) ml<sup>−1</sup> and nauplii of copepod (<i>Parvocalanus crassirostris</i>) at 3 nos ml<sup>−1</sup> yielded better initial larval survival. Metamorphosis of the larvae started at 25 dph (TL12 ± 0.68 mm) and juveniles emerged from 35 dph (TL 22 ± 0.76 mm). This is the first holistic report about seed production of <i>A. berda</i>.</p>","author":"Padinhate Purayil Suresh Babu, \nAnirudhan Anuraj, \nMadathampady Thomas Shilta, \nPillaru Kandiyil Asokan, \nKavungal Vinod, \nNarayan Dube Praveen, \nKodi Srinivasa Rao, \nNarayan Gopalkrishna Vaidya, \nSuresh Mhaddolkar Sonali, \nMahendra Pal, \nJayasree Loka, \nBhaskaran Pillai Santhosh, \nNikarthil Sidhick Jeena, \nJoseph Imelda, \nIgnatius Boby, \nAchamveetil Gopalakrishnan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"1da156c9a92afea0f45ea532713e49e5e2b14156a2bc6484985ddef863c1be4d","category":"Environment"}
