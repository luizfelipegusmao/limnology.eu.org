{"title":"Acute cardiovascular responses of postmenopausal women to resistance training sessions differing in set configuration: A study protocol for a crossover trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311524","date":1728914400000,"content":"<p>by Iván Nine, Alexis Padrón-Cabo, Eduardo Carballeira, Jessica Rial-Vázquez, María Rúa-Alonso, Juan Fariñas, Manuel Giráldez-García, Eliseo Iglesias-Soler</p>\r\nBackground <p>Resistance training is hardly recommended for postmenopausal women to counteract negative effects of hormonal changes. However, some concern exists about the marked hemodynamic responses caused by high-load resistance exercises. In this regard, studies on young, healthy, physically active individuals suggest that set configuration can modulate acute cardiovascular, metabolic, and cardiac autonomic responses caused by resistance training sessions, but this has not yet been explored in postmenopausal women.</p> Methods <p>A sample of 60 physically active postmenopausal women (30 normotensive, 30 hypertensive) will participate in this crossover study. After a medical exam, ergometry, familiarization session, and two testing sessions, participants will complete three experimental sessions and one control session in a randomized order. Each experimental session includes 36 repetitions of four exercises (horizontal leg press, bench press, prone leg curl, and lat pull-down) differing in set configuration: 9 sets of 4 repetitions (i.e., 33% intensity of effort) with 45 s of inter-set recovery, 6 sets of 6 repetitions (50% intensity of effort) with 72 s, and 4 sets of 9 repetitions (75% intensity of effort) with 120 s; with 4 min rest between exercises. Before and immediately after each session, arterial stiffness, hemodynamic variables, cardiac autonomic modulation, baroreflex sensitivity, sympathetic vasomotor tone, and resting oxygen uptake will be evaluated. Furthermore, perceived effort, mechanical performance (e.g., power, velocity), heart rate, and lactatemia will be collected throughout sessions. The impact of set configuration on these variables will be analyzed, along with comparisons between normotensive and hypertensive women.</p> Discussion <p>Cardiovascular responses to resistance exercise have been scarcely studied in females, particularly postmenopausal women. The results of this study will provide information about the modulating role of set structure on metabolic and cardiovascular responses of normotensive and hypertensive postmenopausal women to resistance training.</p> Clinical trial registration <p>NCT05544357 on 7 December 2022.</p>","author":"Iván Nine","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"08e4c0f7c5c45e77479a757ea1f06b798b31157447b5f43c4fc3c8717ef73410","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
