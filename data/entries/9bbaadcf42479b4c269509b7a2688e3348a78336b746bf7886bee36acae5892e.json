{"title":"Five-Axis Finish Milling Machining for an Inconel 718 Alloy Monolithic Blisk","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0113/v1","date":1712020106000,"content":"Blisks subjected to rough machining for channel creation must undergo finishing processes, and such processes must achieve the required tolerance limits. A high-quality surface finish and predictable long tool life are critical for the finish milling of blisks. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to optimize parameters for the finish machining of an Inconel 718 alloy monolithic blisk. Ball-cone mills were used to machine the blade surface at a constant depth. A sensory tool holder was used to collect cutting force signals during machining, and a digital microscope was used to examine tool wear. The surface texture measuring instrument was used to measure blisk blade surface roughness to evaluate processing quality. This study manipulated two cutting parameters, namely cutting speed and feed per tooth, and investigated their effects. The relationship between cutting conditions and machining efficiency was analyzed. According to the experimental results, we identified a set of optimal parameters for marginal tool wear and fast cutting speeds and then estimated the corresponding tool life by using the derived parameters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9bbaadcf42479b4c269509b7a2688e3348a78336b746bf7886bee36acae5892e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
