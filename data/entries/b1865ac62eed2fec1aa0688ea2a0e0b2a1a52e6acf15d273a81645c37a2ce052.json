These will have wide-ranging applications, from ultraviolet (UV) light sources (e.g., sterilization, water purification, phototherapy), UV (solar-blind) detectors, and high-power/high-frequency electronics. The development of such materials requires suitable characterization tools, and multiple modes of scanning electron microscopy fit this bill. We present an overview of our recent work in this area, in which we exploit various combinations of such techniques to correlate the optical, compositional, structural, and electrical properties of deep-UV materials on a microscopic scale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b1865ac62eed2fec1aa0688ea2a0e0b2a1a52e6acf15d273a81645c37a2ce052","category":"Environment"}
