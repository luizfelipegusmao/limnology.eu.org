EM labs may provide TEM, SEM, and increasingly one or more types of 3D volume EM (vEM), such as serial block face, array tomography, or focused-ion-beam SEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.1103-B1\">1-3</a>]. In 2023 vEM, which provides TEM-like molecular resolution but of near-millimeter 3D volumes, was described as “a quiet revolution” [<a href=\"#ozae044.1103-B2\">2</a>] and was the subject of a <span>Methods in Cell Biology</span> volume [<a href=\"#ozae044.1103-B3\">3</a>].
