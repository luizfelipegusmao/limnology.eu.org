{"title":"Effect of deacetylated konjac glucomannan on the 3D printing properties of minced pork","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13372?af=R","date":1718348660000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The influences of deacetylated konjac glucomannan (DKGM) at different condition levels (0.0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%) on the 3D printing feasibility, printing properties, and the final gel characteristics of minced pork were investigated.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>As the DKGM content increased, the printing accuracy and stability initially increased and then declined, and the printing stability and accuracy increased to their highest levels (98.16% and 98.85%) with a 1.5% addition of DKGM. Furthermore, the addition of DKGM significantly enhanced the texture of 3D-printed meat after heat treatments. When the DKGM content reached 1.5%, the hardness and springiness were 1.19 and 1.06 times higher than those of the control group. The results of low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectra revealed that DKGM enhanced the amount of bound water in 3D-printed meat and encouraged changes in protein structure. After the addition of DKGM at 1.5%, the contents of bound water and β-sheets were 7.67% and 12.89% higher than those of the control group, respectively, facilitating the development of a better gel network of minced meat during heating.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results indicate that a concentration of 1.5% DKGM is the ideal setting for obtaining the desired rheological properties and textural characteristics (printability) of 3D-printed minced meat products compared to other samples. In addition, the results showed that the addition of DKGM at 1.5% promotes the transition from α-helix to β-folding of proteins during heating, which facilitates the formation of gels. The results of the study contribute to the application potential of minced meat in the field of 3D food printing. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Junguang Li, \nXiaonan Yue, \nXuyue Zhang, \nBo Chen, \nYing Han, \nJiansheng Zhao, \nYanhong Bai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"777954da98afbcd1503582e3f2a679aca890a84e953163e0762a55618af4a2bb","category":"Environment"}
