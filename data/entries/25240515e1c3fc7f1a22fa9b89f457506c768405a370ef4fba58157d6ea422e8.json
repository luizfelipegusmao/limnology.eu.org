However, the industry faces substantial challenges, notably the presence of harmful algal blooms (HABs), which can cause serious economic consequences. The proliferation of major species of phytoflagellates leading to massive fish mortality is on the rise, possibly attributed to increasing global temperatures and eutrophication. This underscores the critical need for robust detection, prevention, and mitigation strategies to safeguard the aquaculture industry. This contribution offers valuable insights into comprehending and addressing the challenges posed by HABs in the fish aquaculture sector in an era of global change.</p>","author":"Malihe Mehdizadeh Allaf, \nKevin J.
