An important cause of this is oxidative stress. <i>Rubi fructus</i>, a traditional medicinal and edible plant, has shown therapeutic effects against gynecological diseases. Vanillic acid, isoquercitrin, kaempferol-3-<i>O</i>-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-<i>O</i>-sophoroside, oleanolic acid, tormentic acid, tiliroside, and ellagic acid are the major bioactive components in <i>R. fructus</i>. However, studies involved in the effectiveness and mechanism of these components in oxidative stress-induced ovarian dysfunction are scarce.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, the protective mechanisms of the bioactive components were evaluated in human ovarian granulosa cells. Isoquercitrin was significantly superior to other bioactive components in relieving damage in human ovarian granulosa cells induced by 2,2-azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride, considering enhanced cell viability, reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation, and improved mitochondrial membrane potential level. Isoquercitrin protected human ovarian granulosa cells from oxidative stress by regulating the enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase, inhibiting cell apoptosis, improving the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, and ameliorating heme oxygenase 1 protein expression.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Isoquercitrin, a bioactive component in <i>R. fructus</i>, has a significant protective effect on oxidative damage induced by 2,2-azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride in human ovarian granulosa cells, providing evidence for its potential application in protecting ovarian function. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yulin Zhang, \nXusheng Li, \nRuijing Liu, \nXin Huang, \nYiting Yang, \nJingquan Yuan, \nYing Zhang, \nJianxia Sun, \nWeibin Bai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"da7103f55128918ca738375d9a521c370b520cffcc7dc4cba6bca09aac970664","category":"Environment"}
