{"title":"Life‐history parameters of adult females of Merluccius capensis (Gadidae) off the south coast of South Africa","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15837?af=R","date":1719360961000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study explores the life-history parameters of female <i>Merluccius capensis</i> off South Africa (<i>N</i> = 1819) during 2014–2016, including gonadosomatic index (GSI), length-at-maturity, length–weight relationships, and condition indices (relative condition [<i>k</i>] and Fulton's condition factor [<i>K</i>]). We detected weak indications of two peaks of spawning within the year, the first in austral autumn from March to May, whereas the other in austral spring around August. GSI was slightly higher in spring and autumn, though still low at all maturity stages (≤7%), though the opposite was true for the actively spawning stage (≥7%) as well as access to less such data during winter- and summertime. The length (<i>L</i>) at 50% maturity was around 38 cm (<i>L</i>\n<sub>50</sub>), though differences occurred between the two applied staging methods, histology and visual (macroscopic) classification, when <i>L</i> approached infinity. The latter method presented underestimated length at maturity values at the 75 and 95 percentiles (48 and 60 cm) compared to the corresponding percentiles given by histology (50 and 65 cm). There were trivial across-method differences in <i>L</i>\n<sub>50</sub>. However, we found a clear reduction in <i>L</i>\n<sub>50</sub> in view of published information in prior years when this estimate was 48 (1985), 42 (2008), 53 (2011), and 24.8 (2015) cm. Overall, <i>L</i> explained 90% of the variation in whole body weight (<i>W</i>). As the bootstrapped, grand mean growth coefficient was <i>b</i> = 2.98, indicating a slight allometric growth function, there were no significant variations between years, though an isometric growth existed for 2016 with <i>b</i> = 3.0, whereas for 2014 and 2015 this <i>b</i> was 2.98 and 2.93, respectively. In terms of demography, females &lt;60 cm generally showed isometric growth (<i>b</i> = 3) as opposed to allometric growth (<i>b</i> = 2.95) at &gt;60 cm. The relative condition index (<i>k</i> = 1) exhibited higher values than Fulton's <i>K,</i> which was 0.80. Overall, the maternal stock of <i>M. capensis</i> along the south coast seems to be in good condition and likely spawns throughout the year, but we found that the macroscopic data tend to give biased maturity ogives.</p>","author":"Lungelwa C.
