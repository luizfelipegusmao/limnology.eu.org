{"title":"Big data empowerment: Digital transformation and governance of minority shareholders: Evidence from China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302268","date":1713276000000,"content":"<p>by Xinhao Hou, Yao Tang</p>\r\n\r\nBased on the analysis of data from listed enterprises in China between 2011 and 2022, we investigate the influence of digital transformation on the governance efficiency for minority shareholders. The results show that the extent of digital transformation exert a negative effect on the agency costs incurred from related-party transactions. The mechanism examination elucidates that digital transformation augments the governance efficiency for minority shareholders by boosting attendance at shareholdersâ€™ meetings and enhancing the exit threat for minority shareholders. Subsequent analysis reveals that non-state-owned enterprises, compared to state-owned enterprises, exhibit a more pronounced effect in diminishing the second type of agency costs through digital transformation. Furthermore, the impact of digital transformation in curtailing agency costs is more significant in the eastern regions than central and western regions. The better the equity checks and balances in listed enterprises, the more effective digital transformation is in reducing agency costs. This study offers valuable insights for bolstering the governance capacity of minority shareholders in the context of digital transformation.","author":"Xinhao Hou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d1962bf15eb9fedfdbfddda9e17eb7081773c89d679dd479195ada0fb9ed480f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
