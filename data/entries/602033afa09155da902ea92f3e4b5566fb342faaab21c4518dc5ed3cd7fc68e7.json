{"title":"The Emerging Role of Long Noncoding RNAs&rsquo; in Sorafenib Resistance within Hepatocellular Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0951/v1","date":1726193879000,"content":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a liver cancer that originates from hepatocytes. It is a primary health issue and one of the most common malignant tumors. The US FDA approved Sorafenib as the first-line anti-cancer drug for advanced HCC patients. A few patients with advanced HCC may benefit from Sorafenib treatment, but most of the patients eventually develop resistance to Sorafenib, which leads to its poor prognosis. Long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have been found to play a critical role in tumorigenesis and the development of HCC, as well as various cancers. It also plays a vital role in tumor drug resistance, while the mechanisms of LncRNAs in HCC sorafenib resistance have not been characterized yet. In this review article, we summarized the molecular mechanisms, such as the involvement of transporters, receptors, cell death regulation, and other factors impacting sorafenib resistance in HCC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"602033afa09155da902ea92f3e4b5566fb342faaab21c4518dc5ed3cd7fc68e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
