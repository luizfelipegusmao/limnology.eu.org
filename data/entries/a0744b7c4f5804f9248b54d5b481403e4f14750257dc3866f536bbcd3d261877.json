{"title":"Amino Acid-based Protein-mimic Hydrogel Incorporating Pro-regenerative Lipid Mediator and Microvascular Fragments Promotes the Healing of Deep Burn Wounds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1242/v1","date":1726485811000,"content":"Pro-regenerative lipid mediator 1 (PreM1) is a specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator capable of promoting wound healing and regenerative functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), en-dothelial cells, and macrophages. The third-degree (3o) burn healing and regenerative functions of MSCs are also enhanced by ACgel1, an arginine and chitosan-based protein-mimic hybrid hy-drogel. Adipose-tissue derived microvascular fragments (MVFs) are native vascularization units and a rich source of MSCs, endothelial cells, and perivascular cells for tissue regeneration. Here we describe an innovative PreM1-MVFs-ACgel1 construct that incorporates PreM1 and MVFs into ACgel1 via optimal design and fabrication is capable of delivering PreM1 to 3o burn wounds at least up to 7 days post-burn (dpb), and of scaffolding and delivering MVFs, which promoted 3o burn the healing in mice, including vascularization and collagen formation. The re-epithelization and closure of 3o burn wounds were promoted by ACgel1, MVFs, PreM1, MVFs-ACgel1, PreM1-ACgel1, or PreM1-MVFs-ACgel1 at certain time-point(s) while PreM1-MVFs-ACgel1 was most effective. The PreM1-ACgel1 and MVFs-ACgel1 also promoted blood vessel regeneration of the 3o burns. These PreM1- and/or MVFs- functionalized ACgel1 have nonexistent or minimal graft-donor requirements and are promising adjuvant therapies for overcoming the drawbacks of current skin grafting or substituting for treating severe deep burns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0744b7c4f5804f9248b54d5b481403e4f14750257dc3866f536bbcd3d261877","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
