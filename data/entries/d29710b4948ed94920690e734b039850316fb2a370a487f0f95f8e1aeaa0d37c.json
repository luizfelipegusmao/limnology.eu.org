{"title":"Embroidered Interdigitated Electrodes (IDTs) with Wireless Readout for Continuous Biomarker Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1010/v1","date":1718365274000,"content":"Non-invasive continuous health monitoring has become feasible with the advancement of biosensors. While monitoring certain biomarkers such as heart rate or skin temperature are now at certain maturity, monitoring molecular biomarkers is still challenging. Progress has been shown in sampling, measurement and interpretation of data towards non-invasive molecular sensors that can be integrated in daily wearable items. Towards this goal, this paper explores the potential of embroidered interdigitated transducer (IDT)-based sensors for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of human biomarkers, particularly glucose levels, in human sweat. The study employs innovative embroidery techniques to create flexible fabric-based sensors with gold-coated IDTs. In controlled experiments, we have shown the variation of glucose concentration in water can be wirelessly detected by tracking the resonant frequency of the embroidered sensors. The current sensors operate at 1.8GHzâ€“2GHz and respond to the change of glucose concentration with a sensitivity of 0.17 MHz/(mg/dl). The embroidered IDT-based sensors with wireless sensing will be a new measurement modality for molecular wearable sensors. The establishment of a wireless sensing mechanism for embroidered IDT-based sensors will be followed by investigation of sweat for molecular detection. This will require adding functionalities for sampling and interpretation of acquired data. We envisage the embroidered IDT-based sensors offer a unique approach for seamless integration into clothing, paving the way for personalised, continuous health data capture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d29710b4948ed94920690e734b039850316fb2a370a487f0f95f8e1aeaa0d37c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
