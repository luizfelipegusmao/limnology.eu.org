{"title":"Evaluation of in Vitro Serotonin-Induced Electrochemical Fouling Performance of Boron Doped Diamond Microelectrode using Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0037/v1","date":1719818437000,"content":"Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is an electrochemical sensing technique that can be used for neurochemical sensing with high spatiotemporal resolution. Carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs) are traditionally used as FSCV sensors. However, CFMEs are prone to electrochemical fouling caused by oxidative byproducts of repeated serotonin (5-HT) exposure, which makes them less suitable as a chronic 5-HT sensor. Our team is developing a boron-doped diamond microelectrode (BDDME) that has previously been shown to be relatively resistant to fouling caused by protein adsorption (biofouling). We sought to determine if the BDDME exhibits resistance to electrochemical fouling, which we explored on electrodes fabricated with either femtosecond laser cutting or physical cleaving. We recorded the oxidation current response after 25 repeated injections of 5-HT in a flow-injection-cell and compared the current drop from the first to the last injection. The 5-HT responses were compared to dopamine (DA), a neurochemical that is known to produce minimal fouling oxidative byproducts and have a stable repeated response. Physical cleaving of the BDDME yielded a reduction in fouling due to 5-HT compared to the CFME and the femtosecond laser cut BDDME. However, the femtosecond laser cut BDDME exhibited a large increase in sensitivity over the cleaved BDDME. An extended stability analysis was conducted for all device types following 5-HT fouling tests. This analysis demonstrated an improvement in the long-term stability of boron doped diamond over CFMEs, as well as a diminishing sensitivity of the laser cut BDDME over time. This work reports the electrochemical fouling performance of the BDDME when it is repeatedly exposed to DA or 5-HT, which informs the development of a chronic, diamond-based electrochemical sensor for long-term neurotransmitter measurements in vivo.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4dcee6594d738a85cd76b9d46f4affdb8cc5c23bc43a2fed55a1d12f9da8afd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
