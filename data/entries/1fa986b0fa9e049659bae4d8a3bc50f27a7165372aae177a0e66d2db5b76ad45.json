Aquaculture farmers prioritise early diagnosis for timely treatment to achieve better productive and economic performance. Aquatic animal health experts still employ traditional diagnostic methods using visual diagnosis, cell culture, media culture, histopathology and serology. However, the developments of technologies in aquamedicine, such as sequencing, biosensors and CRISPR, have enabled rapid disease detection within minutes. Furthermore, integrating sensors, drones, artificial intelligence and the internet in aquaculture farm monitoring has helped farmers take decisive actions to improve production. Advancements in diagnostic techniques have significantly enhanced the efficient detection of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal diseases in aquatic animals. Moreover, monitoring water quality, aquatic animal health and animal behaviour on farms has become exceptionally streamlined with cutting-edge tools like drones, sensors and artificial intelligence. Summarising research and development in aquatic animal health and monitoring aids efficient technology adoption in aquaculture. With these advanced technologies' continued development and adoption in developed countries, the aquaculture industry is experiencing growth and increased efficiency, benefiting farmers and consumers in these regions. However, farmers and educators in developing countries lack information about these technologies. Training of agricultural educators and efficient dissemination of knowledge and technologies through advertising and publication in collaboration with companies is essential. This review delves into emerging technologies capable of replacing the conventional diagnostic and monitoring methods utilised in aquaculture. We also explore their strengths, limitations and potential future applications within aquaculture settings.</p>","author":"Kailash Bohara, \nPabitra Joshi, \nKrishna Prasad Acharya, \nGrace Ramena","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"1fa986b0fa9e049659bae4d8a3bc50f27a7165372aae177a0e66d2db5b76ad45","category":"Environment"}
