{"title":"Impact of uncertain demand and channel power on dual channel supply chain decisions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300386","date":1710511200000,"content":"<p>by Liu-wei Zhao, Yin Zhao</p>\r\n\r\nThe paper aims to conduct an analysis of pricing strategies in a dual channel supply chain under external uncertainty, utilizing Interval numbers theory and Game theory as the theoretical basis. The focus is on maximizing the expected profits of manufacturers and retailers. Four models are considered: centralized decision-making, manufacturer’s Stackelberg, retailer’s Stackelberg strategy, and vertical Nash model, with the decision variable being the product price. By solving the game model, the paper compares the optimal decisions under the four models and conducts sensitivity analysis to reflect the influence of key parameters and analyze their relationships. The ultimate goal is to optimize profits under various circumstances by adjusting market potential and price parameters to determine the best price level. The findings suggest that decision-maker’s risk indicators have a greater impact on decision results when market demand is less sensitive to price, and that the size of the market has a negative correlation with the impact of decision-maker’s risk indicators on decision results.","author":"Liu-wei Zhao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"674d7ce1cccbc37b462039ea3e7d5e98f05589c46ab7cc1d58d8772b0898690d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
