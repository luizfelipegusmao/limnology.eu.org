{"title":"Conventional Machining of Metal Matrix Composites towards Sustainable Manufacturing &ndash; Present Scenario and Future Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1798/v1","date":1716882085000,"content":"This study provides an in-depth review of the available literature on metal composite material machining, focusing on traditional machining operations such as turning, milling, shaping, drilling, and grinding. The motivation for the study is that this composite type has emerged as a vital material in applications requiring functionality, resilience, cost-effective operation, low consumption of energy and lightweight. Despite its superior characteristics, the manufacturing complexity and poor machinability of metal matrix composites have been the primary barriers to its adoption. Nevertheless, there is a reduction of exceptional efficiency, increase in surface roughness, tool wear and so on in metal matrix composites throughout machining. As a result, this review gives a comprehensive investigation of metal matrix composite machining and effect on process parameters and procedures. Furthermore, this study distinguishes metal matrix composites towards sustainable manufacturing and the metals employed by the researchers, as well as the gaps discovered for future recommendations in metal-based composites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63e42e3270c24fca457e95f9afa909caa0e78d9b6b90b2b335c8796a0d1a37dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
