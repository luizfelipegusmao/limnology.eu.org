{"title":"Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with ischemic stroke","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302227","date":1713967200000,"content":"<p>by Lingyan Fang, Menglu Zhou, Fengkai Mao, Mengyuan Diao, Wei Hu, Guangyong Jin</p>\r\nBackground/aim <p>We aimed to construct a validated nomogram model for predicting short-term (28-day) ischemic stroke mortality among critically ill populations.</p> Materials and methods <p>We collected raw data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database, a comprehensive repository renowned for its depth and breadth in critical care information. Subsequently, a rigorous analytical framework was employed, incorporating a 10-fold cross-validation procedure to ensure robustness and reliability. Leveraging advanced statistical methodologies, specifically the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, variables pertinent to 28-day mortality in ischemic stroke were meticulously screened. Next, binary logistic regression was utilized to establish nomogram, then applied concordance index to evaluate discrimination of the prediction models. Predictive performance of the nomogram was assessed by integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index (NRI). Additionally, we generated calibration curves to assess calibrating ability. Finally, we evaluated the nomogramâ€™s net clinical benefit using decision curve analysis (DCA), in comparison with scoring systems clinically applied under common conditions.</p> Results <p>A total of 2089 individuals were identified and assigned into training (n = 1443) or validation (n = 646) cohorts. Various identified risk factors, including age, ethnicity, marital status, underlying metastatic solid tumor, Charlson comorbidity index, heart rate, Glasgow coma scale, glucose concentrations, white blood cells, sodium concentrations, potassium concentrations, mechanical ventilation, use of heparin and mannitol, were associated with short-term (28-day) mortality in ischemic stroke individuals. A concordance index of 0.834 was obtained in the training dataset, indicating that our nomogram had good discriminating ability. Results of IDI and NRI in both cohorts proved that our nomogram had positive improvement of predictive performance, compared to other scoring systems. The actual and predicted incidence of mortality showed favorable concordance on calibration curves (P &gt; 0.05). DCA curves revealed that, compared with scoring systems clinically used under common conditions, the constructed nomogram yielded a greater net clinical benefit.</p> Conclusions <p>Utilizing a comprehensive array of fourteen readily accessible variables, a prognostic nomogram was meticulously formulated and rigorously validated to provide precise prognostication of short-term mortality within the ischemic stroke cohort.</p>","author":"Lingyan Fang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6a80c897ade06501f6cbb67f5b697c4799ab4b05bfc18a7b20ab86c9922418e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
