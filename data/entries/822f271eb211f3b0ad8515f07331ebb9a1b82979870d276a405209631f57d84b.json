{"title":"Investigating Antiprotozoal Chemotherapies with Novel Proteomic Tools &ndash; Chances and Limitations. A Critical Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2130/v1","date":1717144562000,"content":"Identification of drug targets and biochemical investigations on mechanisms of action is a are major issues in modern drug development. The present article reviews the classical “one drug” – “one target” paradigm. Novel methods for target deconvolution and for investigation of resistant strains based on protein mass spectrometry have shown that multiple gene products and adapta-tion mechanisms are involved in responses of pathogens to xenobiotics. This review is focused on protozoan pathogens. The conclusions can, however, be extended to chemotherapies against other pathogens or cancer.
