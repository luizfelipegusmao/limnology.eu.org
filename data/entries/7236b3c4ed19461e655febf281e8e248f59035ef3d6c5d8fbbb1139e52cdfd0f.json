{"title":"Encapsulation of Human IgG Antibody in PLGA Microparticles Fabricated by Coaxial Electrospray","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1354/v1","date":1716275560000,"content":"Advances in the treatment of cancer with immunotherapy necessitate a locally administered sustained-delivery system to improve treatment efficacy and reduce toxicity. Towards this end, the encapsulation and release characteristics of human antibody immunoglobulin-G (IgG-FITC) were investigated with the coaxial electrospray technique. The antibody solution was exchanged for a solution at the antibodyâ€™s isoelectric pH. The shell solution consisted of PLGA in ethyl acetate. The impact of shell flow rates was investigated in the fabrication of IgG-FITC-loaded PLGA microparticles and the release-profile of IgG-FITC from the PLGA microparticles was characterized. Encapsulation efficiency ranged from 0.04-1.52%. Fluorescence images suggest core localization in the formulation with a lower shell flow rate and shell localization in the formulation with the higher shell flow rate. SEM image analysis revealed that lower shell flow rate resulted in the smaller average particle size with minimal difference in zeta potential between formulations. The lower shell flow rate exhibited a release profile with a t1/2 of 36 hours whereas the higher shell flow rate had a t1/2 &amp;lt; 3 hours. Antibody-fluorescence signals were measured for 28 days and indicated a biphasic release profile with a burst-release followed by a sustained-release in both formulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7236b3c4ed19461e655febf281e8e248f59035ef3d6c5d8fbbb1139e52cdfd0f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
