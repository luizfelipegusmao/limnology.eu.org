{"title":"Corticosterone Contributes to Diet-Induced Reprogramming of Post-Metamorphic Behavior in Spadefoot Toads","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae012/7657796?rss=1","date":1713916800000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Stressful experiences in early life can have phenotypic effects that persist into, or manifest during, adulthood. In vertebrates, such carryover effects can be driven by stress-induced secretion of glucocorticoid hormones, such as corticosterone, which can lead to developmental reprogramming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal axis activity and behavior. Nutritional stress in the form of early life nutrient restriction is well known to modify later life behaviors and stress activity through corticosterone-related mechanisms. However, it is not known whether corticosterone is also mechanistically involved in carryover effects induced by a different form of nutritional variation: the use of alternate or entirely novel types of dietary resources. The plains spadefoot (<span>Spea bombifrons</span>) presents an excellent system for testing this question, since larvae of this species have evolved to use 2 alternate diet types: an ancestral detritus-based diet and a more novel diet of live shrimp. While previous work has shown that feeding on the novel shrimp diet influences juvenile (i.e., post-metamorphic) behavior and corticosterone levels, it is unclear whether these diet-induced carryover effects are mediated by diet-induced corticosterone itself. To test for the mechanistic role of corticosterone in diet-induced carryover effects, we experimentally treated <span>S. bombifrons</span> larvae with exogenous corticosterone and measured subsequent effects on juvenile behavior and corticosterone levels. We found that while shrimp-fed larvae had elevated corticosterone levels, treatment of larvae with corticosterone itself had effects on juvenile behavior that partially resembled those carryover effects induced by the shrimp diet, such as altered food seeking and higher locomotor activity. However, unlike carryover effects caused by the shrimp diet, larval corticosterone exposure did not affect juvenile corticosterone levels. Overall, our study shows that corticosterone-related mechanisms are likely involved in carryover effects induced by a novel diet, yet such diet-induced carryover effects are not driven by corticosterone alone.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"16177e84e116083f5ba80bda2c1dbf6aa25dc0e7bd12fe95fe9e1d97275eac83","category":"Environment"}
