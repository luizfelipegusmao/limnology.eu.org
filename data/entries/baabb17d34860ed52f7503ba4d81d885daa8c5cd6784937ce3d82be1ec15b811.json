{"title":"On proving an Inequality of Ramanujan using Explicit Order Estimates for the Mertens Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0759/v3","date":1724191685000,"content":"This research article provides an unconditional proof of an inequality proposed by \\textit{Srinivasa Ramanujan} involving the Prime Counting Function $\\pi(x)$, \\begin{align*} (\\pi(x))^{2}&lt;\\frac{ex}{\\log x}\\pi\\left(\\frac{x}{e}\\right) \\end{align*} for every real $x\\geq \\exp(547)$, using specific order estimates of the \\textit{Mertens Function}, $M(x)$. The proof primarily hinges upon investigating the underlying relation between $M(x)$ and the \\textit{Second Chebyshev Function}, $\\psi(x)$, in addition to applying the meromorphic properties of the \\textit{Riemann Zeta Function}, $\\zeta(s)$ with an intention of deriving an improved approximation for $\\pi(x)$.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"baabb17d34860ed52f7503ba4d81d885daa8c5cd6784937ce3d82be1ec15b811","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
