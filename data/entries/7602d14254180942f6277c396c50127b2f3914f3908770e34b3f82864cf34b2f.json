{"title":"Human-aided dispersal and population bottlenecks facilitate parasitism escape in the most invasive mosquito species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae175/7660089?rss=1","date":1714435200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>During biological invasion process, species encounter new environments and partially escape some ecological constraints they faced in their native range, while they face new ones. The Asian tiger mosquito <span>Aedes albopictus</span> is one of the most iconic invasive species introduced in every inhabited continent due to international trade. It has also been shown to be infected by a prevalent yet disregarded microbial entomoparasite <span>Ascogregarina taiwanensis</span>. In this study, we aimed at deciphering the factors that shape the global dynamics of <span>A. taiwanensis</span> infection in natural <span>A. albopictus</span> populations. We showed that <span>A. albopictus</span> populations are highly colonized by several parasite genotypes but recently introduced ones are escaping it. We further performed experiments based on the invasion process to explain such pattern. To that end, we hypothesized that (i) mosquito passive dispersal (i.e. human-aided egg transportation) may affect the parasite infectiveness, (ii) founder effects (i.e. population establishment by a small number of mosquitoes) may influence the parasite dynamics, and (iii) unparasitized mosquitoes are more prompt to found new populations through active flight dispersal. The two first hypotheses were supported as we showed that parasite infection decreases over time when dry eggs are stored and that experimental increase in mosquitoesâ€™ density improves the parasite horizontal transmission to larvae. Surprisingly, parasitized mosquitoes tend to be more active than their unparasitized relatives. Finally, this study highlights the importance of global trade as a driver of biological invasion of the most invasive arthropod vector species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"7602d14254180942f6277c396c50127b2f3914f3908770e34b3f82864cf34b2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
