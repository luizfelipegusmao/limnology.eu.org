{"title":"Assessing the Perceived Benefits of Mega-Events during COVID-19: The Case of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1072/v1","date":1723632330000,"content":"Mega sporting events play a pivotal role in enabling host cities to stimulate urban regeneration and improvement. Numerous studies have examined the impact of mega sporting events from various perspectives; however, studies regarding residentsâ€™ perceptions of such events, particularly in the context of a global pandemic, are lacking. Therefore, this study examined the perceived benefits of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games on city image, satisfaction, and loyalty. Data were collected from 868 local residents of Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the venues for the 2022 Beijing Olympics. For data analysis, structural equation modelling was conducted using IBM SPSS 29.0 and AMOS 29.0. The findings revealed a significant impact of economic, environmental, and tourism benefits on city image, in contrast to no impact from perceived sociocultural benefits. Additionally, city image significantly influenced city satisfaction and loyalty. Therefore, in exceptional situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, host cities should focus on developing economic, environmental, and tourism resources from a long-term perspective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"423833250fe3e4ae422f6b9853099525852df2023720dbbd3c38ae0f0f2eba2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
