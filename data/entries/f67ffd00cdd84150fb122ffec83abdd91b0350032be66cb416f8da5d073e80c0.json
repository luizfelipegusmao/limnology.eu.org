{"title":"Linearized Expressions of 3D Rotational Motion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0982/v1","date":1715691380000,"content":"Rotation motion in a three-dimensional physical world refers to an angular displacement of an object around a specific axis in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. It is typically formulated as a non-linear and non-convex process due to the nonlinearity and nonconvexity of $\\mathbb{SO}(3)$. However, this paper proposes a new perspective that the 3D rotation motion can be expressed by the linear equation without dropping any constraints and increasing any singularities. Moreover, two frequent cases, i.e., $\\angle\\left(\\mathbf{R}\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}\\right)=0(\\pi)$ and $\\angle\\left(\\mathbf{R}\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, in computer vision and robotics that can be expressed linearly are deeply discussed in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f67ffd00cdd84150fb122ffec83abdd91b0350032be66cb416f8da5d073e80c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
