The promise of such technology could, however, be argued to potentially risk the public, industry or governments not curtailing their environmentally damaging behavior or even worse exploit the possibility of this technology to do further damage. In such cases, there is the risk of a worse outcome than if the technology was not deployed. This risk is often couched as an objection to new technologies, that the technology produces a moral hazard. This paper describes how to navigate a moral hazard argument and mitigate the possibility of a moral hazard. Navigating moral hazard arguments and mitigating the possibility of a moral hazard will improve the public and environmental impact of synthetic biology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Synthetic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"41b19f195cf64174f01d8c36945485e6398e3496f8a7213d6905a0e36713ba3c","entryHash":"03b32231fc87aa25f09d7e57a77d4c10d7119417bf629bb737948a7dffe8b153","category":"Environment"}
