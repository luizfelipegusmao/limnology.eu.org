{"title":"A phased small interfering RNA-derived pathway mediates lead stress tolerance in maize","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1163/7723625?rss=1","date":1722211200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) are a distinct class of endogenous small interfering RNAs, which regulate plant growth, development, and environmental stress response. To determine the effect of phasiRNAs on maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.) tolerance to lead (Pb) stress, the roots of 305 maize lines under Pb treatment were subjected to generation of individual databases of small RNAs. We identified 55 high-confidence phasiRNAs derived from 13 <span>PHAS</span> genes (genes producing phasiRNAs) in this maize panel, of which 41 derived from 9 <span>PHAS</span> loci were negatively correlated with Pb content in the roots. The potential targets of the 41 phasiRNAs were enriched in ion transport and import. Only the expression of <span>PHAS_1</span> (<span>ZmTAS3j</span>, Trans-Acting Short Interference RNA3) was regulated by its cis-expression quantitative trait locus and thus affected the Pb content in the roots. Using the <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> transient expression system, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and Arabidopsis heterologously expressed, we verified that <span>ZmTAS3j</span> was cleaved by zma-miR390 and thus generated tasiRNA targeting <span>ARF</span> genes (tasiARFs), and that the 5′ and 3′ zma-miR390 target sites of <span>ZmTAS3j</span> were both necessary for efficient biosynthesis and functional integrity of tasiARFs. We validated the involvement of the zma-miR390–<span>ZmTAS3j</span>–tasiARF–<span>ZmARF3</span>–<span>ZmHMA3</span> pathway in Pb accumulation in maize seedlings using genetic, molecular, and cytological methods. Moreover, the increased Pb tolerance in <span>ZmTAS3j</span>-overexpressed lines was likely attributed to the zma-miR390–<span>ZmTAS3j</span>–tasiARF–<span>ZmARF3</span>–<span>SAURs</span> pathway, which elevated indole acetic acid levels and thus reactive oxygen species-scavenging capacity in maize roots. Our study reveals the importance of the <span>TAS3</span>-derived tasiRNA pathway in plant adaptation to Pb stress.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"defd4c4b7e00162a541137f9dcb2bf6dcbb9cf17e737584d23042681008670ae","category":"Environment"}
