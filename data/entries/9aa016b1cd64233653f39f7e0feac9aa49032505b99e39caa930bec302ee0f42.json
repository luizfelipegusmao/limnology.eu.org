{"title":"Quantifying the Impact of Internal Variability on the CESM2 Control Algorithm for Stratospheric Aerosol Injection","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004300?af=R","date":1718866800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Earth system models are powerful tools to simulate the climate response to hypothetical climate intervention strategies, such as stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). Recent simulations of SAI implement a tool from control theory, called a controller, to determine the quantity of aerosol to inject into the stratosphere to reach or maintain specified global temperature targets, such as limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial temperatures. This work explores how internal (unforced) climate variability can impact controller-determined injection amounts using the Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the Earth system with Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (ARISE-SAI) simulations. Since the ARISE-SAI controller determines injection amounts by comparing global annual-mean surface temperature to predetermined temperature targets, internal variability that impacts temperature can impact the total injection amount as well. Using an offline version of the ARISE-SAI controller and data from Earth system model simulations, we quantify how internal climate variability and volcanic eruptions impact injection amounts. While idealized, this approach allows for the investigation of a large variety of climate states without additional simulations and can be used to attribute controller sensitivities to specific modes of internal variability.</p>","author":"Charlotte Connolly, \nEmily Prewett, \nElizabeth A.
