{"title":"Exploring the Use of Natural Ingredients for Textured Hair UV Protection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0048/v1","date":1714541405000,"content":"Human hair is characterized by significant diversity, which is dictated by the individual genetic makeup. It is estimated that up to 70% of the worldâ€™s population has textured hair, with a signif-icant proportion also living in areas with high exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This highlights the unique requirements for textured hair care products that can protect hair shafts from the harmful effects of the environment whilst enhancing the natural features of the fibre. In this study, we investigated the UV-protective effects of hair conditioner formulated from active ingredients, mangiferin, ferulic acid and naringin. The analysis of UV-irradiated straight and textured hair was performed by measurements of hair thickness and darkness, the uptake of the fluorescent dye, spectral absorbance of keratin extracts, ATR-FTIR and SEM. We found that tex-tured hair was more sensitive to UVR-induced changes than straight hair, with the primary mo-lecular targets represented by chemical groups in keratins. Pre-treatment of the hair with condi-tioner had protective effects against structural damage and oxidative stress caused by UVR. These data indicate the importance of the personalized approach to hair research and the formu-lation of hair care products tailored to the individual demands of textured hair types.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec71da68c26d5e5c93a90fc8bb4a440e71e0c1cccc6efdd4f255712070fd7347","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
