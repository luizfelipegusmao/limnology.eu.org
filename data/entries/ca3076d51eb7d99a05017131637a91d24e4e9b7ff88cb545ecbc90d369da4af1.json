{"title":"Importance of a solid, neutral object as a measuring device for the unification of quantum theory and general relativity via polynomials P(2π)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0294/v1","date":1725434542000,"content":"For each measurement, at least three objects are needed: a solid, neutral object as a measuring instrument and two objects for comparison. This system of three spatial dimensions per object has a common time. All measurements are based on orbits relative to the firmament and coincidences of the spatial coordinates of the objects after rotations with π and provide the energy of the system. These results in the most suitable coordinate system with dimensions of powers of π in which the radius is curved, as are the longitude and latitude. Polynomials P(2π) correspond to neutral objects, in addition to P(π) for charge, spin, isospin. In addition, it is assumed that the cosmos consists of a single type of particle with a speed of light c. Normalizing to the rest mass of the electron, the neutrinos are ντ=π, νμ=1, and νe=1/π. The energy of an electron is: Ee=gfreq(π)+1−1/π. An algorithm is derived from a Christoffel symbol and similar to a lattice gauge calculation. It provides exact residual masses for neutrons, protons, muons, tauons, quarks u, d, and pions. The theory can be applied to the inner planetary system and the cosmos and explains the hierarchy problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca3076d51eb7d99a05017131637a91d24e4e9b7ff88cb545ecbc90d369da4af1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
