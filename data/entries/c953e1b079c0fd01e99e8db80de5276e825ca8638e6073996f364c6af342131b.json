{"title":"Is Celiac Trunk Revascularization Necessary after High-Flow Pancreaticoduodenal Arterial Arcades Aneurysm Retrograde Embolization?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1127/v1","date":1728978333000,"content":"Background: High-flow pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysms secondary to celiac trunk occlusion or stenosis have a high risk of rupture. Embolization offers a less invasive alternative to surgery. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of retrograde embolization via the superior mesenteric artery of high-flow PDA aneurysms without celiac trunk revascularization. Methods: This retrospective bicentric study included patients who underwent embolization of high-flow PDA aneurysms due to significant celiac trunk stenosis or occlusion. All patients underwent pre-interventional dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Retrograde embolization was performed using microcoils and/or liquid agents without celiac trunk revascularization. Follow-up involved clinical and radiological assessment at one month. Technical and clinical success were evaluated, and complications were categorized as minor or major. Results: Twenty-three patients (mean age: 65 Â±14 years; 52% male) were included. Emergency embolization was required in 12 patients (52%). The technical success rate was 100%. Patients were monitored for a median of 16 months. Clinical success was 87%. No hemorrhagic recurrences were observed. Minor complications occurred in two cases. One major complication involved splenic infarction due to glue migration, requiring splenectomy and intensive unit care admission. Conclusion: Retrograde embolization of high-flow PDA aneurysms is effective and safe without needing celiac trunk revascularization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c953e1b079c0fd01e99e8db80de5276e825ca8638e6073996f364c6af342131b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
