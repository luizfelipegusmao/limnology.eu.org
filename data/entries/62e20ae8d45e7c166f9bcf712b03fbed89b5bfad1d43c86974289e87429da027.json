{"title":"Insights into Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Concise Review of Emerging Therapeutic Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0307/v1","date":1728014507000,"content":"Age related macular degeneration (AMD) as the name suggest is the timely degradation of the macular area of the eye which can lead to vision impairment, in particular the central vision. Macular is one of the important areas of the eye, present in the retina which controls our central vision. AMD is one of the most common types of irreversible blindness caused in older population of the society in developed countries. AMD is broadly classified as Dry AMD (Non Neovascular AMD) and Wet AMD (Neovascular AMD). Non Neovascular AMD more commonly known as Dry AMD is less aggressive and is very frequent type of AMD caused, it has three stages 1) Early dry AMD, 2) Intermediate Dry AMD, and 3) Late AMD. One the several therapies used to treat AMD is stem cells where Induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCâ€™s) derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells was used to treat dry AMD. The use of siRNA that targets Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) using different nanotechnology-based delivery system like the organic nanoparticles synthesized liposomes. An upcoming therapy used most widely in recent times is the photodynamic therapy where a photodynamic drug like verteporfin which a benzoporphyrin derivative is used, where the outcome shows great promise in reducing vision loss in wet AMD. This review discusses in details about age related macular degeneration and also its different novel therapies that is been currently used extensively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62e20ae8d45e7c166f9bcf712b03fbed89b5bfad1d43c86974289e87429da027","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
