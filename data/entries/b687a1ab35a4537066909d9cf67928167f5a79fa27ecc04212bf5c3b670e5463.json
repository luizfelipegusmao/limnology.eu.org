{"title":"Repurposing auranofin and meclofenamic acid as energy-metabolism inhibitors and anti-cancer drugs","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309331","date":1726581600000,"content":"<p>by Sara Rodríguez-Enríquez, Diana Xochiquetzal Robledo-Cadena, Silvia Cecilia Pacheco-Velázquez, Jorge Luis Vargas-Navarro, Joaquín Alberto Padilla-Flores, Tuuli Kaambre, Rafael Moreno-Sánchez</p>\r\nObjective <p>Cytotoxicity of the antirheumatic drug auranofin (Aur) and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug meclofenamic acid (MA) on several cancer cell lines and isolated mitochondria was examined to assess whether these drugs behave as oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors.</p> Methods <p>The effect of Aur or MA for 24 h was assayed on metastatic cancer and non-cancer cell proliferation, energy metabolism, mitophagy and metastasis; as well as on oxygen consumption rates of cancer and non-cancer mitochondria.</p> Results <p>Aur doses in the low micromolar range were required to decrease proliferation of metastatic HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas one or two orders of magnitude higher levels were required to affect proliferation of non-cancer cells. MA doses required to affect cancer cell growth were one order of magnitude higher than those of Aur. At the same doses, Aur impaired oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria and intact cells through mitophagy induction, as well as glycolysis. Consequently, cell migration and invasiveness were severely affected. The combination of Aur with very low cisplatin concentrations promoted that the effects on cellular functions were potentiated.</p> Conclusion <p>Aur surges as a highly promising anticancer drug, suggesting that efforts to establish this drug in the clinical treatment protocols are warranted and worthy to undertake.</p>","author":"Sara Rodríguez-Enríquez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b687a1ab35a4537066909d9cf67928167f5a79fa27ecc04212bf5c3b670e5463","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
