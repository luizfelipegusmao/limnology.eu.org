{"title":"Exploring Novel Biomarkers for an Acute Coronary Syndrome Diagnosis Utilizing Plasma Metabolomics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0426/v1","date":1715160342000,"content":"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening condition that requires a prompt diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Although serum troponin T and creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) are established biomarkers for ACS, it may take several hours to reach diagnostic values for ACS. In this study, we attempted to explore novel biomarkers for ACS with higher sensitivity than that of troponin T and CK-MB. The metabolomic profiles of 18 patients with ACS upon hospital arrival and those of the age-matched control (HC) group consisted of 24 healthy volunteers were analyzed using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Volcano plots showed 24 metabolites whose concentrations differed significantly between the ACS and HC groups. Using these data, we developed a multiple logistic regression model for the ACS diagnosis, in which lysine, isocitrate, and tryptophan were selected as minimum-independent metabolites. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value for discriminating ACS from HC was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.00). In contrast, those for troponin T and CK-MB were 0.917 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.812-1.00) and 0.988 (95% CI: 0.966-1.00), respectively. This study showed the potential of combining three plasma metabolites to discriminate ACS from HC with a higher sensitivity than that of troponin T and CK-MB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f970b0442e645fa674f2d47feb7f8de6751781681459f65937bb4fdca680918","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
