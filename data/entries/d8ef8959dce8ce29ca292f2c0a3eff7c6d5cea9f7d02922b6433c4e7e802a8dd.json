{"title":"Immunogenicity Persistence of Different Immunization Regimens of Rabies Vaccine in the 10–60 Years Age Group: a Follow-up Report Based on Phase III Clinical Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1729/v1","date":1724407726000,"content":"We evaluated the immunogenicity persistence of different immunization regimens of freeze-dried human rabies vaccine (Vero cells) in the 10–60 years age group of the Chinese population. Based on phase III clinical trials of Vero cells, participants who completed the full course of immunization were continuously enrolled in four-dose trial, five-dose, and five-dose control groups. Venous blood samples were collected 12 months after completion of the full immunization for rabies virus-neutralizing antibody (RVNA) testing, and the antibody-positive rate and geometric mean concentration (GMC) were calculated. Analysis of variance was used to compare three groups. The four-dose trial, five-dose trial, and five-dose control groups included 200, 186, and 214 participants, respectively. Twelve months after full immunization, the overall RVNA-positive rates were 97.00%, 93.55%, and 94.86% in the four-dose trial, five-dose control, and five-dose trial groups, respectively. The post-immunization RVNA GMCs values were 2.50, 2.05, and 2.04 IU/mL, respectively, with no statistically significant differences between them. Twelve months after full immunization, the overall RVNA-positive rate remained high, demonstrating satisfactory immunogenicity persistence for both immunization regimens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8ef8959dce8ce29ca292f2c0a3eff7c6d5cea9f7d02922b6433c4e7e802a8dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
