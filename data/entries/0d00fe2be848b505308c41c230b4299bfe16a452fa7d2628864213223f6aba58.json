{"title":"Open-Source Database for Modeling Cislunar Debris Propagation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1011/v1","date":1718366762000,"content":"As operations in Cislunar space continue to expand, the sustainability of operations in orbital environments beyond GEO has become a critical concern. The Cislunar region is known to have a higher non-linear chaotic component in the dynamics compared to the low-Earth environment. This research is focused on producing simulations to model debris trajectories and dispersion from spacecraft mishaps across various identified key Cislunar orbits. By varying initial conditions, simulations of explosions at different locations of the orbits are carried out and the debris propagation is analyzed. This research emphasizes the creation of a robust debris propagation scheme and the development of a comprehensive database to address the computational costs associated with debris propagation. The resulting codes and databases documenting the historical evolution of debris are published as open-source resources, aiming to aid in solving the Cislunar space debris and traffic problem and in forecasting future needs and policies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d00fe2be848b505308c41c230b4299bfe16a452fa7d2628864213223f6aba58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
