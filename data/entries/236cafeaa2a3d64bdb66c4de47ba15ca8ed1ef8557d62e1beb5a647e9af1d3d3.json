{"title":"EDX Elemental Mapping of Trace Amounts of Ir on the Surface of Pt Cubic Nanoparticles for Ammonia Electro-Oxidation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.614/7719604?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Advances in the field of nanomaterials necessitate corresponding advancements in elemental analysis. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) performed in scanning electron microscopes is a critical technique that enables determination of spatial compositional distributions. Elements such as Pt and Ir find frequent application in fuel cell technology [<a href=\"#ozae044.614-B1\">1</a>], and understanding their functioning requires knowledge of their elemental spatial distribution. However, when these elements are used together, with trace amounts of one, element mapping is exceptionally challenging with EDS. This is due to their dominant M emission peaks being only 70 eV apart, whereas the typical best energy resolution for EDS is 120 eV. Ir and Pt L-edges have a greater separation of nearer 270 eV, but their intensities have only 10% of the M-edges. To minimize the electron dose received by the sample and the acquisition time, we show that it is possible to distinguish Pt-Ir concentrations by analyzing the base regions of the combined Pt/Ir Mα-β peaks, along with observing the presence of much weaker signature of the M<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> peak in the 2.2 to 2.3 keV range. From our calibration data, this peak appears stronger in Ir than in Pt. These differences appear to not be reliably determined using common EDS data analysis software [<a href=\"#ozae044.614-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"236cafeaa2a3d64bdb66c4de47ba15ca8ed1ef8557d62e1beb5a647e9af1d3d3","category":"Environment"}
