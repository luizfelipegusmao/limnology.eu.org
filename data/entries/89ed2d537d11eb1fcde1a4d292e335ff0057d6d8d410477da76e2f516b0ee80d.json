{"title":"367 Changing the conversation: Evaluating feedyard closeouts and the beef system on a carcass basis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/95/7757088?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Beef cattle genetics, management, technologies and nutritional strategies are ever evolving, and current US trends favor feeding cattle to heavier carcass endpoints and optimizing quality grade. The average number of days on feed (DOF) in the US has increased year after year, averaging 195 and 183 DOF for steers and heifers, respectively, as reported by Elanco Benchmark data in 2021. As DOF increase, cattle live performance, including average daily gain and feed efficiency decline; however, hot carcass weight (HCW) becomes significantly heavier. Although a reduction in live feed conversion occurs as cattle are fed for extended DOF, the kilograms of additional live gain that result as kilograms of gain on the carcass, termed carcass transfer, increase linearly. As DOF are extended, carcass transfer has been reported to increase up to 88 %. As a result of genetic advancements, technologies, and feeding longer, HCW has trended heavier over the last 60 yr, with 2024 USDA HCW reported for April as 11.3 and 9.5 kg heavier for steers and heifers, respectively, year after year. According to mandatory price reporting data, approximately 74 % of fat cattle marketed in the US are sold as dressed beef. As we continue to feed to heavier endpoints and longer DOF, the profitability of selling on a carcass-basis increases. With the increase in carcass transfer as DOF extend, this presentation will attempt to address that cattle live performance should be adjusted to a carcass-basis for feedyards to appropriately capture the inflection point at which cost of additional gain equals the price received for the additional gain.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"89ed2d537d11eb1fcde1a4d292e335ff0057d6d8d410477da76e2f516b0ee80d","category":"Environment"}
