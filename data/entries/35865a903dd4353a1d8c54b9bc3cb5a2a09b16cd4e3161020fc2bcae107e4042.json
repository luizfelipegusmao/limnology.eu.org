{"title":"Dominant Tree Species and Litter Quality Govern Fungal Community Dynamics during Litter Decomposition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0725/v1","date":1725955389000,"content":"Litter decomposition is a crucial biochemical process regulated by microbial activities in forest ecosystem. However, the dynamic response of fungal community during litter decomposition to vegetation changes is not well understood. Here, we investigated the litter decomposition rate, extracellular enzyme activities, fungal community, and nutrient cycling-related genes in leaf and twig litters over a three-year decomposition period in a pure Liquidamabar formosana forest and a mixed L. formosana / Pinus thunbergii forest. The result showed that during the three-year decomposition, twig litter decomposed faster in the mixed forest than that in the pure forest. In both leaf litter and twig litter, β-cellobiosidase, N-acetyl-glucosamidase exhibited higher activities in the mixed forest, whereas phosphatase, β-glucosidase and β-xylosidase were higher in the pure forest. The fungal α-diversity were higher in both litters in the pure forest compared to mixed forest, with leaf litter showing higher α-diversity than twig litter. Fungal species richness and α-diversity within leaf litter increased as decomposition progressed. Within leaf litter, Basidiomycota dominated in the mixed forest while Ascomycota dominated in the pure forest. Funguild analysis revealed that symbiotroph and ectomycorrhizal fungi were more abundant in the mixed forest compared to the pure forest. In the third-year decomposition, genes related to phosphorus cycling was most abundant in both forests, with the pure forest having a higher abundance of cex and gcd genes. Fungal community structure, predicted functional structure, and gene composition differed between the two forest types and between the two litter types. Notably, the fungal functional community structure during the first-year decomposition was distinct from that in the subsequent two-year. These findings suggest that both dominant tree species, litter quality and decomposition time significantly influence the litter decomposition by recruiting different fungal community, thereby affecting the entire decomposition process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35865a903dd4353a1d8c54b9bc3cb5a2a09b16cd4e3161020fc2bcae107e4042","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
