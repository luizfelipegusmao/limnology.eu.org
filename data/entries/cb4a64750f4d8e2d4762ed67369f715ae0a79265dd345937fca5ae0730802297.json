{"title":"Comparative Studies on the Radiative Heat Transfer in Arc Plasma and Its Impact in a Model of a Free-Burning Arc","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0853/v1","date":1718195364000,"content":"The radiative heat transfer in arc plasma models is considered from the point of view of its description in terms of a net emission coefficient, the method of spherical harmonics in its lowest order, and the discrete ordinate method. Net emission coefficients are computed applying approximate and numerical approaches, the multi-band representation of the spectral absorption coefficient with three kinds of its averaging and two datasets. The self-consistent access to the radiative heat transfer is applied to a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of free-burning arc in argon at atmospheric pressure. The results obtained from the models employing the net emission coefficient, the method of spherical harmonics, and the discrete ordinate method are compared.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cb4a64750f4d8e2d4762ed67369f715ae0a79265dd345937fca5ae0730802297","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
