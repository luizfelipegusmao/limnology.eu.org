{"title":"In Situ Ferroelectric Polarization of BaTiO3 at Low Temperatures Measured by Electron Holography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.833/7720128?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The BaTiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite is a widely used ferroelectric, that exhibits thermal-induced phase transitions along specific directions. For example, below the Curie temperature, 393 K and down to 281 K the cubic <span>Pm</span>3¯<span>m</span> lattice distorts due to the opposite distribution of charge from a lattice parameter <span>a</span> = 4.01 Å [<a href=\"#ozae044.833-B1\">1</a>], into a tetragonal <span>P4mm</span> cell contracting along &lt;100&gt; to <span>a</span> = 3.966 Å and stretching along &lt;001&gt; to <span>c</span> = 4.035Å. Further, between 202 K and 281 K, the structure is suddenly polarized along [110] direction, adopting an orthorhombic <span>Amm2</span> lattice <span>a</span> = 5.704 Å, <span>b</span> = 3.963 Å and <span>c</span> = 5.683 Å. Moreover, below 202 K, the polarization effect occurs along [111] direction, leaving a rhombohedral <span>R3m</span> structure <span>a</span> = 3.998 Å lattice parameter. Tetragonal and rhombohedral structures exhibit ferroelectric polarizations, while the orthorhombic corresponds to a non-ferroelectric structure. The ferroelectric transitions in BaTiO<sub>3</sub> are related to the lattice transition and leading into a spontaneous polarization, which consists of negative and positive ions oriented asymmetrically that leads to the formation of a net electric dipole moment. Electric dipoles can be aligned uniformly under an external electric field until reach electric saturation and subsequently returned to remnant polarizations. The direction of the spontaneous polarization depends on the structure and symmetry of the crystal. The analysis of in situ ferroelectric polarization behavior at the nanoscale still being a challenge, not only due small tetragonally distorted ratio <span>c</span>/<span>a</span> but also due to the effect of dynamical diffraction in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) using electron holography to retrieve the phase. The ferroelectric polarization measured by the phase shift changes can be measured by the electric potentials between the ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric structures.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5dfb67552e76f744389caf6660c5bbbe5981b78cfd9e1160e765a7a5f8db56a0","category":"Environment"}
