{"title":"Association between Mental Illness and Disciplinary Confinement and Its Effect on Mental Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0576/v1","date":1720420545000,"content":"The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to evaluate the risk of inmates with mental disorder of being placed into disciplinary confinement (DC) and its effect on mental health. A systematic search of studies was performed in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models. Heterogeneity among study point estimates was assessed with Q statistics and quantified with I2 index. Publication bias was assessed with Eggerâ€™s test. Quality assessment was based on the GRADE Checklist for observational studies. Guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were followed throughout. First, a meta-analysis of 5 articles including 27,455 inmates showed than incarcerated individuals with a mental disorder were 1.23 times (OR=1.23, CI=1.10; 1.38) more likely to be placed in DC than incarcerated individuals without a mental disorder. Particularly, having a severe mental disorder (OR=1.31, p&amp;lt;0.001), a personality disorder (OR=1.66, p&amp;lt;0.001) and having previously received mental health services (OR=1.16, p=0.024) increased the risk of being placed in DC. Secondly, a systematic review of 5 articles including 171,300 inmates showed more psychological distress, psychiatric symptoms (self-harm, thought disorders, obsessive-compulsive symptoms), need for mental health services and hospitalizations in DC than the general correctional population. Considering the increased risk of placement in DC for incarcerated persons with a mental disorder and its deleterious effect on mental state, it is essential that correction officials create new safe interventions to manage these inmates and offer them proper mental health care to limit its use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ace25bfb91578b82b6e83117894374aaea9ec11cc01896e705c314e32287772e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
