Incidents of failure due increased temperature around root blade regions has caused Type II hot corrosion leading to cracking in blade roots resulting in catastrophic failure [<a href=\"#ozae044.135-B1\">1</a>]. Understanding the failure mechanism and crack characterisation is vital in solving this industrial issue. The complex hierarchical microstructure of single crystal Ni superalloys demands the use of multi-modal, multiscale imaging approach combining non-destructive and destructive methods that enable covering the broad span of length scales ranging from millimetre to nanometer scale in order to get a full understanding of the link between the microstructure and the mechanical behaviour under service conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c34dfa35b59486991b366e9aeb4bd4af671daf4007db64b76329577882e5de42","category":"Environment"}
