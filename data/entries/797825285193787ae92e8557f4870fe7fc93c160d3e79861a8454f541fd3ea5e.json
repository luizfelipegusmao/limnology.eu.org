{"title":"Short term biodistribution and in vivo toxicity assessment of intravenously injected pristine graphene oxide nanoflakes in SD rats","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae058/7644542?rss=1","date":1712880000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The present study aimed to elucidate the short term biodistribution of nano sized graphene oxide (GO) along with the toxicological assessment under <span>in-vivo</span> condition with an intent to analyse the toxic effects of sudden accidental exposure of GO The synthesised GO was characterized using UV-Visible spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, TGA and DLS. The morphological imaging was performed using SEM, TEM and AFM. With a lateral size of less than 300 nm, these nanoparticles exhibit significant organ barrier permeability of up to 20%. Upon acute exposure to 10 mg/kg dose of ICG-tagged GO nanoflakes through intravenous route, various organs such as kidney, spleen and liver were observed, and the nanoparticles predominantly accumulated in the liver upon 24 h of exposure. Upon confirming the accumulation of these particles in liver through IVIS imaging, our next attempt was to analyse various biochemical and serum parameters. An elevation in various serum parameters such as ALT, AST, Creatinine and Bilirubin was observed. Similarly, in the case of biochemical parameters tested in liver homogenates, an increase in NO, Catalase, GSH, SOD, ROS, LPO, GR, GPx, and GST was observed. This study highlights the potential toxicological risk associated with GO exposure which must be taken into account for any risk analysis associated with GO based consumer products and the occupational hazards.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"797825285193787ae92e8557f4870fe7fc93c160d3e79861a8454f541fd3ea5e","category":"Environment"}
