{"title":"Persistence and Stochastic Extinction in a Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Stochastically Perturbed Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1205/v1","date":1710926620000,"content":"The classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model is globally stable and uniformly persistent. However, in real-life biosystems extinction of species due to stochastic effects is possible. In this paper, we consider the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model under stochastic perturbations. For this model, using an analytical technique based on the direct Lyapunov method and a development of the ideas of R.Z. Khasminskii, we find the precise sufficient conditions for the stochastic extinction of one and both species and the precise necessary conditions for the stochastic system persistence. The stochastic extinction occurs via a process known as the stabilization by noise of the Khasminskii type, and, in order to establish the sufficient conditions for extinction, we found the conditions for the stabilization.\nThe analytical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.\n\n{\\bf Keywords:} stochastic perturbations, white noise, Ito's stochastic differential equation, the Lyapunov functions method,\nstability in probability, stabilization by noise, stochastic extinction, persistence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b581dce93d6bf19c67f78673c1593bd6e7334cd3a518c23bb9272f8382a86a3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
