{"title":"Interleukin‐4 inhibits the hypothalamic appetite control by modulating the insulin‐AKT and JAK‐STAT signaling in leptin mutant mice","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24264?af=R","date":1718077862000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Our previous research identified interleukin-4 (IL-4) as a key regulator of glucose/lipid metabolism, circulatory leptin levels, and insulin action, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and related complications. This study aimed to further elucidate the role of IL-4 in regulating hypothalamic appetite-controlling neuropeptides using leptin dysfunctional Leptin<sup>145E/145E</sup> mice as the experimental model. IL-4 significantly reduces body weight, food intake, and serum glucose levels. Our data demonstrated that IL-4 exhibits multiple functions in regulating hypothalamic appetite control, including downregulating orexigenic agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y levels, promoting expression of anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin, alleviating microenvironmental hypothalamic inflammation, enhancing leptin and insulin pathway, and attenuating insulin resistance. Furthermore, IL-4 promotes uncoupling protein 1 expression of white adipose tissue (WAT), suggesting its role in triggering WAT-beige switch. In summary, this study uncovers novel function of IL-4 in mediating food-intake behaviors and metabolic efficiency by regulating hypothalamic appetite-control and WAT browning activities. These findings support the therapeutic potential of targeting hypothalamic inflammation and reducing adiposity through IL-4 intervention for tackling the pandemic increasing prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.</p>","author":"Shu‐Mei Chen, \nChiao‐Wan Hsiao, \nYen‐Ju Chen, \nChen‐Jee Hong, \nJung‐Chun Lin, \nChing‐Ping Yang, \nYih‐Hsin Chang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"7ffb6149be1ca1681453af9a958fc424f1f48deded68ed36272bec775c851593","category":"Environment"}
