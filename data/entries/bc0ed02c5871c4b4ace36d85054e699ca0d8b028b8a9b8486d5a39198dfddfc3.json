{"title":"VND Genes Redundantly Regulate Cell Wall Thickening during Parasitic Nematode Infection","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/8/1224/7658313?rss=1","date":1714003200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant parasitic root-knot nematodes are major agricultural pests worldwide, as they infect plant roots and cause substantial damages to crop plants. Root-knot nematodes induce specialized feeding cells known as giant cells (GCs) in the root vasculature, which serve as nutrient reservoirs for the infecting nematodes. Here, we show that the cell walls of GCs thicken to form pitted patterns that superficially resemble metaxylem cells. Interestingly, <span>VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN1</span> (<span>VND1</span>) was found to be upregulated, while the xylem-type programmed cell death marker <span>XYLEM CYSTEINE PEPTIDASE 1</span> was downregulated upon nematode infection. The <span>vnd2</span> and <span>vnd3</span> mutants showed reduced secondary cell wall pore size, while the <span>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</span> triple mutant produced significantly fewer nematode egg masses when compared with the wild type. These results suggest that the GC development pathway likely shares common signaling modules with the metaxylem differentiation pathway and <span>VND1, VND2</span>, and <span>VND3</span> redundantly regulate plantâ€“nematode interaction through secondary cell wall formation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"bc0ed02c5871c4b4ace36d85054e699ca0d8b028b8a9b8486d5a39198dfddfc3","category":"Environment"}
