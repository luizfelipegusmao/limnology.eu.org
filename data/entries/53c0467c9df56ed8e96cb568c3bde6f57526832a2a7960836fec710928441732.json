{"title":"The Interactive Digital Media as a Scenography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1190/v1","date":1718690850000,"content":"Interactive Digital Media have become the most important pillars on which contemporary 21st century scenography is based, allowing for the use of many modern digital media as scenographic elements. With the steady development of digital arts, particularly digital animation, it has become a key role as a 21st century in presenting their theatrical visions.\nMy own issue is the use of digital Media as an Interactive scenographic element, as evidenced by the design of several spatial environments within the framework of an idea and a dynamic scenario that interacts with the Several Scenes of the theatrical Performances and is displayed on screen walls or dropped on thematic elements, resulting in a type of interaction between them and the Scenic Design.\nMy project includes instances of models exhibiting the link of designs to theme composition on stage, such as works utilized in plays, musical/motion drama, and event performances . The design used music synced with digital animated media designs as a scenographic element to reinforce the overall visual picture.\nThe study paper examines a theory of my own project, in which I offer a dynamic exhibition of full-back digital settings in rhythm with the music, suited to its movement and the character of the performance, to be employed as a Scenographic element at a Proscenium Theater (12W x 10D x 7H).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53c0467c9df56ed8e96cb568c3bde6f57526832a2a7960836fec710928441732","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
