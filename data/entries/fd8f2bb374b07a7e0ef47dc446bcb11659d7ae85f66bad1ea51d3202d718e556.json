{"title":"Synthesis and Characterization of Coconut-Derived Graphene and its Properties in Nickel/Graphene and Zinc/Graphene Electrodes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0217/v1","date":1722807498000,"content":"This study introduces a novel and sustainable method of producing graphene from coconut shells and investigates its application in Graphene, Ni/Graphene, and Zn/Graphene electrodes for advanced energy storage devices. The graphene was synthesized scalably using a pyrolysis and impregnation technique, with its successful synthesis verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electrical conductivity measurements characterizations. The study highlights the enhanced performance of Zn/Graphene electrodes, which outperform both pure graphene and Ni/Graphene variants. This superior performance is attributed to the smaller particle size of Zn (mean = 2.356 µm) compared to Ni (mean = 3.09 µm), and Zn’s more favorable electron configuration for electron transfer. These findings demonstrate the potential of bio-derived graphene composites as efficient, high-performance electrodes, paving the way for more sustainable and cost-effective energy storage solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fd8f2bb374b07a7e0ef47dc446bcb11659d7ae85f66bad1ea51d3202d718e556","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
