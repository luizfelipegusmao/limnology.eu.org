{"title":"Quantifying Compound and Nonlinear Effects of Hurricane‐Induced Flooding Using a Dynamically Coupled Hydrological‐Ocean Model","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036455?af=R","date":1721214923000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We recently developed a dynamically coupled hydrological-ocean modeling system that provides seamless coverage across the land-ocean continuum during hurricane-induced compound flooding. This study introduced a local inertial equation and a diagonal flow algorithm to the overland routing of the coupled system’s hydrology model (WRF-Hydro). Using Hurricane Florence (2018) as a test case, the performance of the coupled model was significantly improved, evidenced by its enhanced capability of capturing backwater and increased water level simulation accuracy and stability. With four model experiments, we present a framework to detangle, define, and quantify compound and nonlinear effects. The results revealed that the flood peaks in the lower Cape Fear River Basin and the coastal waters were contributed by inland flooding and storm surge, respectively. These two processes had comparable contributions to the flooding in the Cape Fear River Estuary. The compound effect was identified when the flood levels resulting from the combination of land and ocean processes surpassed those caused by an individual process alone. The compound effect during Hurricane Florence exhibited limited impact on flood peaks, primarily due to the time lag between the peaks of the storm surge and the inland flooding. In the period between the two peaks, the compound effect was salient and significantly impacted the magnitude and variation of the flood level. The nonlinear effect, defined as the difference between the compound flood level and the superposition of storm surge and inland flooding water levels, reduced flood levels in the river channels while increasing flood levels on the floodplain.</p>","author":"Daoyang Bao, \nZ.
