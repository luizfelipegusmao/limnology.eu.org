Pecan (<i>Carya illinoinensis</i> (Wangenh.) K. Koch) nuts are currently underutilized as plant-based proteins but hold great potential in the food industry. However, there is insufficient information available on pecan protein, particularly its protein fractions. This study aimed to explore the physicochemical and functional properties of protein isolate and the main protein fraction glutelin extracted from pecan nuts.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results revealed that glutelin (820.67 ± 69.42 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) had a higher crude protein content compared to the protein isolate (618.43 ± 27.35 g kg<sup>−1</sup>), while both proteins exhibited amino acid profiles sufficient for adult requirements. The isoelectric points of protein isolate and glutelin were determined to be pH 4.0 and pH 5.0, respectively. The denaturation temperature of the protein isolate (90.23 °C) was higher than that of glutelin (87.43 °C), indicating a more organized and stable conformation. This is further supported by the fact that the protein isolate had a more stable main secondary structure than glutelin. Both proteins demonstrated improved solubility, emulsifying, and foaming properties at pH levels deviating from their isoelectric points in U-shaped curves. Compared to the protein isolate, glutelin displayed superior water and oil absorption capacity along with enhanced gelling ability.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The protein isolate and glutelin from pecan nuts exhibited improved stability and competitive functional properties, respectively. The appropriate utilization of these two proteins will support their potential as natural ingredients in various food systems. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jiarui Cao, \nTingting Shi, \nYaosong Wang, \nJiahong Wang, \nFuliang Cao, \nPengfei Yu, \nErzheng Su","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4bbcd332ae3581ca3bba03ffaff9e2ef070bc8619a6d569ec1dccbea5fdc4cd9","category":"Environment"}
