{"title":"Modelling the Herbicide-Resistance Evolution in Lolium rigidum (Gaud.) Populations at the Landscape Scale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1776/v1","date":1721721773000,"content":"The repeated application of herbicides has led to the development of herbicide resistance. Models are useful for identifying key processes and understanding the evolution of resistance. This study developed a spatially explicit model at a landscape scale to examine the dynamics of Lolium rigidum populations in dryland cereal crops and the evolution of herbicide resistance under var-ious management strategies. Resistance evolved rapidly under repeated herbicide use, driven by weed fecundity and herbicide efficacy. Although fitness costs associated with resistant plants re-duced resistance evolution, they did not affect the speed of spread. The most effective strategies to slow resistance involved diversifying cropping sequences (e.g., crop rotation) and the herbicide applications (e.g., rotating different herbicide modes of action). Pollen flow was the main disper-sal vector, with seed dispersal also contributing significantly. Strategies limiting seed dispersal effectively decreased resistance spread. However, the use of a seed-catching device at harvest could unintentionally enrich resistance in the area. It would be beneficial to optimise the move-ment of harvesters between fields. The model presented here is a useful tool that may assist in the exploration of novel management strategies within the context of site-specific weed management at the landscape scale, as well as in the advancement of our understanding of resistance dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a0fdd4d36c20934e5179429aa2c261eb54b93ff9826aff94f847913bcdf37b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
