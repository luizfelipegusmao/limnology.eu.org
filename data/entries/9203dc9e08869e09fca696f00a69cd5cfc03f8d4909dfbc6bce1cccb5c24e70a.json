This proposed technique provides almost seamless system responses even during various fault scenarios.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Despite the unique advantages a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) offers to the grid-integrated renewable energy systems, they have a limitation of being susceptible to grid fault as their stator windings are directly connected to the grid. The fault current limiters (FCLs) provide a sustainable solution by enhancing the fault ride-through capability and thus it improve the transient performance of a DFIG. In this work, a multi-inductor-based H-bridge fault current limiter (HBFCL) is proposed to augment the transient performance of a DFIG. The operational efficacy of the HBFCL is evaluated through the administration of both symmetrical and asymmetrical fault scenarios. The effectiveness of the HBFCL is further investigated by comparing the performance of the HBFCL with that of the bridge-type series dynamic braking resistor (BSDBR). Both the graphical and numerical interpretations of the simulation result assert that the HBFCL improves the transient performance of a DFIG-based wind farm and outweighs the performance of the BSDBR in all aspects.</p>","author":"Md.
