{"title":"Energy Management of Hydrogen Hybrid Electric Vehicles &ndash; Online-Capable Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1014/v1","date":1713277384000,"content":"The results shown in this paper extend our research group's previous work, which presents the theoretically achievable hydrogen engine-out NOx (H2-NOx) Pareto front of a hydrogen hybrid electric vehicle (H2-HEV). While the Pareto front is calculated offline, which requires significant computing power and time, this work presents an online-capable algorithm to tackle the energy management of a H2-HEV with explicit consideration of the H2-NOx trade-off. Through the inclusion of realistic predictive data on the upcoming driving mission, a model predictive control algorithm (MPC) is utilized to effectively tackle the conflicting goal of achieving low hydrogen consumption while simultaneously minimizing the NOx. In a case study it is shown that the MPC is able to satisfy user-defined NOx limits over the course of various driving missions. Moreover, a comparison to the optimal Pareto front highlights the MPC's ability to achieve close-to-optimal fuel-performance for any desired cumulated NOx target on four realistic routes for passenger cars.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8132b062613429f045b5bc8ecf7feb45c19819def05580be3234991e6c38aaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
