{"title":"Effects of Varying Dietary Protein Levels on Growth Performance, Survival, Body Composition, Haemato‐Biochemical Profile, and Metabolic Responses of Hypselobarbus jerdoni (Day, 1870) Juveniles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/8627712?af=R","date":1704355200000,"content":"<p>A 60-day feeding trial has been carried out to access the optimal dietary crude protein (DCP) requirement of juvenile Jerdon’s carp, <i>Hypselobarbus jerdoni</i>. Six isoenergetic (around 400 Kcal DE/100 g), isolipidic (60.80 g/kg), and heteronitrogenous diets were prepared with graded levels of protein, <i>viz</i>., 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 g/kg (TCP 20-TCP 45 with 50 g/kg incremental level). A completely randomised design (CRD) was used to distribute 270 Jerdon’s carp juveniles (6.12–6.18 g) in six experimental groups in triplicates (15 fish/tank, 200 l water capacity). After 60 days, the fishes of the TCP30 group showed significantly higher weight gain, final body weight, and percentage weight gain (WG%). The fish of the TCP30 group exhibited a significantly higher feed efficiency ratio and specific growth rate. On the other hand, a significantly lower feed conversion ratio is recorded in the TCP30 and TCP35 groups. The protein efficiency ratio of fish was reduced significantly with the elevated DCP level. Whole-body moisture, lipid, and total ash contents of <i>H. jerdoni</i> were remain unaffected by DCP levels. However, DCP levels significantly influenced the whole-body protein of <i>H. jerdoni</i> juveniles, with significantly higher values noticed in the TCP30 and TCP35 groups. The TCP35, TCP40, and TCP45 groups exhibited significantly higher (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) protease activity, and the amylase activity showed a decreasing trend in response to dietary protein levels. A significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) higher SOD and CAT activity were observed in the TCP20 and TCP25 groups. However, lower hepatic glutamate pyruvate transaminase and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity were observed in the TCP30 and TCP35 groups, respectively. Furthermore, based on broken-line linear and second-order polynomial regression with respect to WG%, the optimal dietary crude protein requirement of <i>H. jerdoni</i> cultured for 60 days was found to be 309.72 and 316.40 g/kg.</p>","author":"Subam Debroy, \nParamita Banerjee Sawant, \nParimal Sardar, \nGouranga Biswas, \nTincy Varghese, \nMukunda Goswami, \nManas Kumar Maiti, \nRamjanul Haque, \nUdipta Roy, \nDebajit Sarma, \nPronob Das","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ichthyology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"411fbab4e21e579add0b45892c8bae33151f2fc1dcfa886f71382f3516ee5117","entryHash":"4666adcd90c8096f2dfe6bb1dc52c967c19a2281e8f05f21303f33221063ea05","category":"Environment"}
