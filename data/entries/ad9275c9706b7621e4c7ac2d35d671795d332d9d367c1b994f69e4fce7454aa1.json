{"title":"Variability in spectral absorption within cryptophyte phycobiliprotein types","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13439?af=R","date":1712751025000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Cryptophytes are known to vary widely in coloration among species. These differences in color arise primarily from the presence of phycobiliprotein accessory pigments. There are nine defined cryptophyte phycobiliprotein (Cr-PBP) types, named for their wavelength of maximal absorbance. Because Cr-PBP type has traditionally been regarded as a categorical trait, there is a paucity of information about how spectral absorption characteristics of Cr-PBPs vary among species. We investigated variability in primary and secondary peak absorbance wavelengths and full width at half max (FWHM) values of spectra of Cr-PBPs extracted from 75 cryptophyte strains (55 species) grown under full spectrum irradiance. We show that there may be substantial differences in spectral shapes within Cr-PBP types, with Cr-Phycoerythrin (Cr-PE) 545 showing the greatest variability with two, possibly three, subtypes, while Cr-PE 566 spectra were the least variable, with only ±1 nm of variance around the mean absorbance maximum of 565 nm. We provide additional criteria for classification in cases where the wavelength of maximum absorbance alone is not definitive. Variations in spectral characteristics among strains containing the same presumed Cr-PBP type may indicate differing chromophore composition and/or the presence of more than one Cr-PBP in a single cryptophyte species.</p>","author":"Kristiaän A.
