{"title":"Histone deacetylase OsHDA716 chilling out with OsbZIP46: antagonistically regulating cold stress tolerance in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1592/7588715?rss=1","date":1706054400000,"content":"<span>Plants do not have the luxury of having heated rooms during cold winters as we do. Therefore, to enhance plant cold tolerance and boost agricultural productivity, it is imperative to fully understand how cold perception is signaled inside the cells to activate mechanisms that protect plants from cold damage. It is well studied that a transcriptional cascade involving C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR/DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (CBF/DREB1) induces rapid changes in intracellular calcium levels upon cold stress (<a href=\"#koae025-B3\">Yuan et al. 2018</a>). However, epigenetic mechanisms involved in cold signal transduction are largely unknown, even though epigenetic regulation of gene expression has an essential role in plant adaptation to various environmental changes. Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that histone acetylation/deacetylation is essential to control gene expression in response to abiotic stress (<a href=\"#koae025-B1\">Cheng et al. 2018</a>). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) cause chromatin compaction through the deacetylation of lysine residues in histones, thereby reducing the accessibility of the transcription machinery to gene promoters (<a href=\"#koae025-B4\">Zheng et al. 2020</a>). However, their potential histone-independent functions in cold stress responses remain unexplored.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cf59d6649d91442e51a25d34f0f1d5dbbe0faaee617c35ae813e1becfe9971b3","category":"Environment"}
