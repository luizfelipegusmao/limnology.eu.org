{"title":"Characterization of a Biodegradable Mg-Alloy after SLM Processing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0813/v1","date":1710404474000,"content":"A new Mg-Zn-Zr-Ca alloy in powder state was obtained via mechanical alloying method, from pure elemental powder. Further, the obtained powder-alloy was processed by selective laser melting (SLM) procedure to obtain 3D printed samples for small biodegradable implants. A series of microstructural, mechanical and corrosion analysis were performed. The SEM analysis of powder-alloy reveal a good dimensional homogeneity, with uniform colored, no agglutinated and almost rounded particles, suitable for selective laser melting procedure. Further, the SLM samples reveal a robust and unbreakable morphology, with a suitable porosity and without undesirable balling effect. The tested Youngâ€™s modulus of the SLM samples, of 42 GPa, is close to cortical bone one, of 30 GPa. The corrosion tests performed in PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline) solution show that the corrosion parameters have a satisfactory evolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbd1d1548cd78f34d8229dd2a029e64bd8b69fe2e5723642cfd59af6fc281ecb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
