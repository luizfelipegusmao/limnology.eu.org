Individuals working in or living near poultry farms are highly susceptible to <i>C</i>. <i>psittaci</i> infection. In this study, we assessed the prevalence and genotypes of <i>C</i>. <i>psittaci</i> in poultries and humans in three cities of China by collecting fecal samples from different poultry species and throat swab samples and serum samples from workers in poultry farms and zoos. These samples were screened by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting <i>C</i>. <i>psittaci ompA</i>. The positive samples were subjected to PCR amplification and sequencing of <i>ompA</i>. The strains detected in the samples were genotyped on the basis of the phylogenetic analysis of <i>ompA</i> sequences. In total, 3.13% (40/1278) poultry fecal samples were positive in the qPCR assay, whereas 3.82% (6/157) of throat swab samples and 42.59% (46/108) of serum samples from the workers were positive in the qPCR and indirect fluorescent antibody assays, respectively. The strains detected in the 32 poultry samples and 6 human samples were genotyped as type A, indicating that the workers were infected with <i>C</i>. <i>psittaci</i> that originated in poultry birds in farms. Additionally, eight peacocks showed strains with the genotype CPX0308, which was identified in China for the first time. Elucidating the distribution of <i>C</i>. <i>psittaci</i> in animals and poultry-related workers may provide valuable insights for reducing the risk of <i>C</i>. <i>psittaci</i> infection within a population.","author":"Ling Hou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"078beae0f04f2f0581afe6a19d909975a1087b1e3e6e3964173d4a0d8c9ed77c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
