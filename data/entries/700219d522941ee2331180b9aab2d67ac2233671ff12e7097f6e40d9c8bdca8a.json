{"title":"Parecoxib and 5-Fluorouracil Synergistic Inhibition of Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer Cells by Targeting Akt/NF-&kappa;B and EMT Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1890/v1","date":1716908453000,"content":"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer mortality worldwide, and innovative drugs for the treatment of colorectal cancer are continually being revealed. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a common clinical chemotherapeutic drug. Acquired resistance to 5-FU is a clinical challenge in colorectal cancer. Parecoxib is a selective COX-2-specific inhibitor, which has been demonstrated to inhibit metastasis in colorectal cancers in our previous study. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic antimetastatic activities of parecoxib to 5-FU in human colorectal cancer cells and determine the underlying mechanism. parecoxib and 5-FU synergistically suppressed metastasis in colorectal cancer cells. Treatment with the parecoxib /5-FU combination induced an increase in E-cadherin and decrease in β-catenin. The parecoxib/5-FU combination could inhibit MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression and MMP-9 activity, and the NF-κB pathway might be suppressed as well. Mechanistic analysis denoted that the parecoxib/5-FU combination hindered the essential molecules of the PI3K/Akt route to obstruct metastatic colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the parecoxib/5-FU combination could inhibit reactive oxygen species. Our work showed the antimetastatic capacity of the parecoxib/5-FU combination for colorectal cancers via targeting the PI3K/Akt /NF-κB pathway.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"700219d522941ee2331180b9aab2d67ac2233671ff12e7097f6e40d9c8bdca8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
