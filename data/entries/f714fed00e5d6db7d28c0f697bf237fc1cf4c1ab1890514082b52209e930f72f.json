{"title":"Prognostic Value of Response to Inhaled Nitric Oxide Administration in Patients with ARDS Related to SARS-CoV-2 Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1276/v1","date":1711018905000,"content":"Background: The role of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) in managing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Covid-19 related (C-ARDS) is debatable. The study aimed to analyze the effect of iNO administration in patients with persistent severe hypoxia and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality. \nMethods: This retrospective study included 98 consecutive critically ill patients with C-ARDS admitted to ICU from 1 October 2020 to 31 October 2021. \nResults: Of these patients, 28% had received iNO. Twelve (44.4%) were responders. Kaplan-Mayer plot shows mortality was higher in non-responders (86.6 vs 25.0%). Non-response to iNo was the most important predictive value (p. 0.01). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for a percentage increase in PaO2 from baseline confirmed that it had a higher predictive value for in-hospital survival. A value of 19% can predict the death event with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 81.2%. \nConclusions: Therefore, we propose to use iNO as a vasoreactivity test for prognostic stratification in patients with persistent severe hypoxia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f714fed00e5d6db7d28c0f697bf237fc1cf4c1ab1890514082b52209e930f72f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
