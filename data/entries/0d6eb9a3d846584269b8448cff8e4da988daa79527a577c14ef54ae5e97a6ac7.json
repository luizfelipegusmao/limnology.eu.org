{"title":"Linked Links. A Research Project: The Multiple Superimposed Soft Networks as Network Profiles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0574/v1","date":1718016687000,"content":"This article, based on network science, aims to contribute to overcoming its geometric and technological phases. The novelty consists in considering links of networks as linked by superimposed networks, termed here multiple superimposed soft networks (MSSN), which is introduced as a research issue. Such links of links (termed here as passive links) concern, for instance, correspondences, incompatibilities, and temporal synchronizations between the occurrences of pairs of active links of effective networks, such as those based on electrical and telecommunication. A possible constitutive mechanism of such passive linkage consists of linkage representations for practices and histories of use expressed by their validating statistical reoccurrences. We consider the possible emergent nature of the passive linkage. The reason for introducing the design and usage of MSSN properties as a research issue involves making new approaches to profile and manage networks available. Correspondence between active linkage and MSSN properties should be a matter for an experiential, machine-learning approach. Research issues relate their possible usage on the active linkage such as for classification, comparations, detection of criticalities, diagnosis, performance evaluation, and regulatory as weak forces. Furthermore, the possible identification of standard corresponding configurations of passive and active linkage are finalized to avoid their establishment or, conversely, in facilitating their establishment and keeping their replication in different contexts (or partially and in combinations) and identifying related standardized approaches (also for classes of configurations having significant levels of equivalence). This research project has methodological generalizing aspects of trans-disciplinarity. We conclude by mentioning related research issues.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d6eb9a3d846584269b8448cff8e4da988daa79527a577c14ef54ae5e97a6ac7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
