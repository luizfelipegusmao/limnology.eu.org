Recently, cytidine deaminases have been uncovered as sources of mutagenesis in cancer. In an attempt to form a connection between these 2 cancer driving processes, we interrogated the cytidine deaminase family of proteins for potential roles in human ribosome biogenesis. We identified and validated APOBEC3A and APOBEC4 as novel ribosome biogenesis factors through our laboratory’s established screening platform for the discovery of regulators of nucleolar function in MCF10A cells. Through siRNA depletion experiments, we highlight APOBEC3A’s requirement in making ribosomes and specific role within the processing and maturation steps that form the large subunit 5.8S and 28S ribosomal (r)RNAs. We demonstrate that a subset of APOBEC3A resides within the nucleolus and associates with critical ribosome biogenesis factors. Mechanistic insight was revealed by transient overexpression of both wild-type and a catalytically dead mutated APOBEC3A, which both increase cell growth and protein synthesis. Through an innovative nuclear RNA sequencing methodology, we identify only modest predicted APOBEC3A C-to-U target sites on the pre-rRNA and pre-mRNAs. Our work reveals a potential direct role for APOBEC3A in ribosome biogenesis likely independent of its editing function. More broadly, we found an additional function of APOBEC3A in cancer pathology through its function in ribosome biogenesis, expanding its relevance as a target for cancer therapeutics.","author":"Mason A.
