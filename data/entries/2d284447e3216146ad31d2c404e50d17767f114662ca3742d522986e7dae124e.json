{"title":"p-Numerical Semigroups of Triples from the Three-Term Recurrence Relations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1982/v1","date":1721823560000,"content":"Many people, including Horadam, have studied the numbers $W_n$, satisfying the recurrence relation $W_n=u W_{n-1}+v W_{n-2}$ ($n\\ge 2$) with $W_0=0$ and $W_1=1$. In this paper, we study the $p$-numerical semigroups of the triple $(W_i,W_{i+2},W_{i+k})$ for integers $i,k(\\ge 3)$.   \nFor a nonnegative integer $p$, the $p$-numerical semigroup $S_p$ is defined as the set of integers whose nonnegative integral linear combinations of given positive integers $a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_\\kappa$ with $\\gcd(a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_\\kappa)=1$ are expressed in more than $p$ ways. When $p=0$, $S=S_0$ is the original numerical semigroup. The largest element and the cardinality of $\\mathbb N_0\\backslash S_p$ are called the $p$-Frobenius number and the $p$-genus, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d284447e3216146ad31d2c404e50d17767f114662ca3742d522986e7dae124e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
