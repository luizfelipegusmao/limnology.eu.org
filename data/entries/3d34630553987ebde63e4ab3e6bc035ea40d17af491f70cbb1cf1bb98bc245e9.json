{"title":"Review of Epiretinal Protheses Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1697/v1","date":1729758243000,"content":"Electronic devices called epiretinal prosthesis are used to restore vision in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), two degenerative retinal illnesses. It functions by stimulating the retina's surviving cells, which then excite the brain to receive visual information from the retina. Epiretinal prosthesis have the flexibility of electrode placement, which enables them to target particular regions of the retina. Furthermore, it enables a high level of spatial resolution, enhancing visual quality. For the purpose of activating retinal cells, it transforms visual input into electrical signals. In general, epiretinal prosthesis are a potential method for helping people with degenerative retinal illnesses regain their vision. Ongoing research aims to increase the effectiveness and safety of these devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d34630553987ebde63e4ab3e6bc035ea40d17af491f70cbb1cf1bb98bc245e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
