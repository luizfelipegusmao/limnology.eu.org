{"title":"An Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Employing Quasi-Random Numbers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0944/v1","date":1710514841000,"content":"This paper introduces an innovative Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm in-corporating Sobol and Halton Random number samplings. It evaluates the enhanced PSO's performance against conventional PSO employing Monte Carlo Random Number Samplings. The comparison involves assessing the algorithms across nine benchmark problems and the renowned Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The re-sults reveal consistent enhancements achieved by the enhanced PSO utilizing Sob-ol/Halton samplings across the benchmark problems. Particularly noteworthy are the substantial improvements demonstrated by the enhanced PSO in solving the Travel-ling Salesman Problem. These findings underscore the efficacy of employing Sobol and Halton random number generation methods in enhancing algorithm efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cde087a172824f08e380806f4ae29281f60e733f93d8d7ad15e0fe6e172adbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
