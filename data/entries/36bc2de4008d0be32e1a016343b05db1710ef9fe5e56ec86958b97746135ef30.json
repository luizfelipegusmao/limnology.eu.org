{"title":"A Dynamic Simulation of a Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting System Integrated with a Closed-Loop Voltage Source Converter for Sustainable Power Generation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1858/v1","date":1724684935000,"content":"Finding sustainable renewable energy sources for energy conversion and management is still an obscure topic. This paper presents a model-based simulation for an energy conversion system using piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) technology. A dynamic mathematical model of a PEH device consists of a piezoelectric transducer, a controlled PWM rectifier, and a closed-loop buck boost converter is developed. A piezoelectric transducer converts mechanical vibrations from a wind force into an oscillating train of electrical charges. The sinewave peak-to-peak level relationship describes the changeable values of these charges, which depend on the severity of the wind vibration. The controlled PWM rectifier, in conjunction with a closed-loop buck-boost converter, converts this train of sinewave cycles into DC voltages. The control blocks of the closed-loop buck-boost converter use the perturbation and observation (P&amp;amp;O) algorithm based on maximum power point tracking (MPPT), which adapts the operational voltage of the piezoelectric source to deliver the maximum power to load and improves the PEHS output voltage stability. A simulation program is employed to perform mathematical analysis on various wind vibration scenarios, piezoelectric sources without PWM converters, and piezoelectric vibration sources connected to a closed-loop P&amp;amp;O converter. The crucial results of this paper demonstrate that the proposed dynamic PEHS model effectively feeds low-power electronic loads by directly adjusting the output voltage level to the set voltage, even under different vibration severity levels. As a result, the proposed PEHS dynamic model serves as a guideline for researchers in the development of self-powered sensors, which contributes to understanding sustainable energy alternatives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36bc2de4008d0be32e1a016343b05db1710ef9fe5e56ec86958b97746135ef30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
