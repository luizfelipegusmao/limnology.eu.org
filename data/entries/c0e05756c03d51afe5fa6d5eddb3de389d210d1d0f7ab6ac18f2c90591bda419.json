{"title":"Review on Recent Trends in Composite Joints using Spot Welding Variants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0120/v1","date":1711980587000,"content":"Traditional resistance spot welding (RSW) was unsuccessful in forming quality composite joints between steel or aluminium-polymer based composites. This led to the development of spot-welding variants such as friction stir spot welding (FFSW), ultrasonic spot welding (USW) and laser spot welding (LSW). The paper reviewed the differences in the bonding mechanism, spot weld characteristics and challenges involved in using these spot-welding variants. Variants of RSW used series electrodes arrangement, co-axial electrodes, metallic inserts, interlayers or external energy to produce composite joints. FFSW and USW used nanoparticles, interlayers or energy directors to create composite spot welds. Mechanical interlocking is the common composite joint mechanism in all variants. Each spot-welding variant had different sets of weld parameters and distinct spot weld morphologies. FFSW is the most expensive variant but commonly used for composite spot weld joints. USW has a shorter welding cycle compared to RSW and FFSW but can only be used for small components. LSW is faster than the other variants, but limited work was found on its use in composite spot weld joining. Use of interlayers in FFSW and USW to form composite joints are potential research areas recommended in this review.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c0e05756c03d51afe5fa6d5eddb3de389d210d1d0f7ab6ac18f2c90591bda419","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
