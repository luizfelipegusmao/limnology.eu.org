{"title":"A Non-traditional Anti-gravity Method Is Theoretically Analyzed and Demonstrated and the Technical Realization Path Assumption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0608/v2","date":1712743088000,"content":"The thesis proposes a argument that a mass point moving in a horizontal circle on the Earth's surface can generate a radial centrifugal force of the Earth's center of mass, thus realizing an unconventional anti-gravity path. And through the theoretical analysis of the difference in the distribution of gravitational acceleration at different latitudes caused by the rotation of the earth, and the centrifugal force of a mass point moving in a horizontal circle on the earth's surface is analyzed, the validity of the argument is demonstrated. At the same time, the paper puts forward two possible basic principles, and makes theoretical analysis and demonstration. Conceive of the concrete experimental verification of principle two is proposed. Four technical schemes for antigravity ascent are proposed and basic analysis is made. On the premise of not fully considering the practical technical ability, it is theoretically proved that three of them have realistic operability and development potential. In theory, this paper opens up a different way of anti-gravity for human beings, which will bring new ideas and prospects for human beings to get rid of the bondage of gravity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5957726b0845c55b6248080fa508e4889331d8f679c27ad4c7ed601e48a988f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
