A response surface method was used to determine the optimal conditions of blackberry seed extracts (BSEs) with high 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity by ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). The composition and antioxidant capacity of BSEs were further analyzed.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The optimal conditions were material-to-liquid ratio of 0.07 g mL<sup>−1</sup>, ethanol concentration of 56%, extraction temperature of 39 °C and ultrasonic power of 260 W. Using these conditions, the extraction yield and total polysaccharide, phenolic and anthocyanin contents in BSEs were 0.062 g g<sup>−1</sup> and 633.91, 36.21 and 3.07 mg g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The Fourier transform infrared spectra of BSEs exhibited characteristic peaks associated with polysaccharide absorption. The antioxidant capacity, DPPH and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity, and ferric reducing antioxidant power of BSEs were 1533.19, 1021.93 and 1093.38 mmol Trolox equivalent g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The delphinidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside, paeoniflorin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside and cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-arabinoside contents in BSEs were 3.05,12.76 and 1895.90 ± 3.45 μg g<sup>−1</sup>. Five polyphenols including gallic acid, coumaric acid, ferulic acid, catechin and caffeic acid were identified and quantified in BSEs with its contents at 8850.43, 5053.26, 4984.65, 1846.91 and 192.40 μg g<sup>−1</sup>.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These results provide a method for preparing BSE containing functional components such as polysaccharides, phenols and anthocyanins through UAE, and BSEs have potential application in food industries. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mo Yang, \nShuai Wang, \nRong Zhou, \nYi Zhao, \nYu He, \nYi Zheng, \nHao Gong, \nWei‐Dong Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"417fb53a93b6eec9f500c0063d6e079684ea93e9d8824acfefe0d86f788297f8","category":"Environment"}
