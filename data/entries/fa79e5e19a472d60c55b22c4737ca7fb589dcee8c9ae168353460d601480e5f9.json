{"title":"117 Gene editing on the farm: Current status and future prospects","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/12/7664821?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Livestock with enhanced disease resistance genes offer both health advantages to animals and economic opportunities for farmers aiming to meet the rising demand for affordable, high-quality protein. This study builds upon prior research that utilized gene editing to modify the porcine CD163 gene, demonstrating resistance to the RNA virus responsible for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). To amplify the impact of this disease resistance trait, it is crucial for it to be present in commercially significant breeding populations, facilitating the widespread production and distribution of resistant pigs. In pursuit of this objective, a groundbreaking gene editing program was implemented, leveraging CRISPR-Cas technology, next-generation DNA sequencing, in vitro and in vivo off-target analyses, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and a simplified breeding strategy. This innovative approach aimed to introduce a single modified CD163 allele into four genetically elite and diverse porcine lines, rendering the cells and animals resistant to PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection. The resulting founder population is currently undergoing large-scale phenotype testing, multiplication through classical breeding methods, ongoing genetic refinement, and poised for commercialization pending regulatory approvals. This presentation will provide insights into the process and data associated with this scaled production, marking a significant stride towards the realization of commercially elite PRRS virus resistant pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"fa79e5e19a472d60c55b22c4737ca7fb589dcee8c9ae168353460d601480e5f9","category":"Environment"}
