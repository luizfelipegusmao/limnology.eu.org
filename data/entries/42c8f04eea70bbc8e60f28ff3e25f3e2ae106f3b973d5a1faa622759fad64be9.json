{"title":"Test of Sugarcane Resistance of Genetically Engineered Products SPS Event Against Sugarcane Streak Mosaic Virus Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2132/v1","date":1721968386000,"content":"Sugarcane Streak Mosaic Virus (SCSMV) poses a significant threat to sugarcane productivity. PRG sugarcane is a product of genetic engineering aimed at enhancing resistance to various environmental stresses, pests, and diseases. This study aimed to test and compare the resistance of two PRG sugarcane SPS events to SCSMV infection. The study was conducted using a single-factor Completely Randomized Design (CRD), comprising four treatments: Bululawang sugarcane variety as a control, PS 882 as a susceptible variety, PRG Sugarcane SPS 1, and PRG Sugarcane SPS 3, with 15 replications of 60 sugarcane mules each. PCR results indicated that mosaic infection in the sugarcane plants was most likely caused by SCSMV. Based on the morphological identification of the SCSMV virus and RT-PCR testing, the sugarcane plants positively infected with SCSMV were SPS1 U1 R1, SPS3 U2 R4, SPS3 U3 R3, and PS882 U3 R4. The highest incidence rate of the disease was observed in the SPS3 variety, while the lowest incidence rate was in the Bululawang variety. The PS882 variety exhibited the slowest SCSMV incubation period, showing symptoms of infection, whereas the SPS1 variety showed the fastest incubation period. The highest disease severity was recorded in the SPS3 variety, and the lowest in the PS882 variety. The sugarcane varieties with the highest klorofil content were SPS3, while the SPS1 variety had the lowest klorofil content.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"42c8f04eea70bbc8e60f28ff3e25f3e2ae106f3b973d5a1faa622759fad64be9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
