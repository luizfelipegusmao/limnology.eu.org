{"title":"Preparation and Characterization of a Novel Hydroxyapatite-Capsaicin Composite Intended for the In-Office Dental Bleaching Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1197/v1","date":1718696003000,"content":"The aim of this study was to synthetize a hydroxyapatite-capsaicin composite (HAp-CAP) and to evaluate its physicochemical data for further use in hydrogen peroxide in-office dental bleaching gel. The HAp-CAP was prepared by the precipitation method, performed in a 4:1 ratio using 3.2 g of nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HAp) and 0.8 g of capsaicin (CAP) in 99.5% ethyl alcohol (q.s.p) and zirconia beads at SpeedMixer®. The HAp-CAP was characterized by morphological, spectroscopic, and thermal analyses. In the following, the HAp-CAP was added to an in-office dental bleaching to test its effect on reducing hydrogen peroxide diffusion into the pulp chamber, as well as the effect in the color alteration during dental bleaching. The HAp-CAP were suitably obtained by the precipitation method, and the results demonstrates that the thermal stability of the CAP is greatly improved after reaction of HAp and CAP. The HAp-CAP into a bleaching gel slightly decreased the amount of hydrogen peroxide inside the pulp chamber and didn’t interfering in the bleaching effectiveness of dental bleaching. The HAp-CAP synthesis and characterization were successfully carried out, and its use in dental materials is a challenging task that needs further study since its addition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b2c052a491a9fcf8d920a3b53c061ee80eec8e619e1f4450695ccebce2f28bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
