{"title":"Death Profiles Due to Infectious Endocarditis in Brazil and Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0537/v1","date":1728375855000,"content":"Background: Studies on infectious endocarditis (IE) are mostly limited to institutions, which highlights the need for more comprehensive epidemiological studies. Objective: To verify the profile of deaths due IE and the relationship with deaths from other causes and conditions in Brazil and regions. Method: Study in database from the Brazilian Mortality Information System, from 2000 to 2019. Mentions of deaths due to IE, other causes and conditions were identified according to ICD-10. Cluster analysis was performed to verify the relationship between variables. Results: 52,055 deaths from IE were found, with a predominance of males, aged 60 to 79 years, in the Southeast, with deaths from the circulatory system most frequent. Three profiles were identified: 1 - age equal to or greater than 80 years, women, deaths due endocrine, circulatory and metabolic diseases, in the South and Southeast; 2 - also in the South and Southeast, age between 30 and 79 years, men, deaths due infectious and genitourinary diseases; 3 - 0 to 29 years, no genders differences, deaths due diseases of the respiratory system, in the North, Northeast and Central-West. Conclusion: Cluster analysis showed diversity in the profiles of deaths due IE, indicating heterogeneity in regions of the country.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c13b645a2b2fc109c5b05b90b647a25b57fdd9fb5d78ea70146d980a4dc04cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
