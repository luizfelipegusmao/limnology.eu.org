Most commonly these materials are studied with X-ray or neutron scattering methods, which only possess μm scale spatial resolution, or scanning probe methods, which are unable to probe any sub-surface features. Thus, cryogenic (scanning) transmission electron microscopy – aided by 4D-STEM and improved <span>in situ</span> holders – is an increasingly powerful method for the investigation of quantum materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"26ee41073cb2412822083bae5a18d9114a7cec7d7d7b9df7d33285dd57192b3a","category":"Environment"}
