Primitive examples of these materials (e.g., those that appear to have the least amount of aqueous alteration or thermal metamorphism on the asteroid) serve as an important record of the early history of organic matter and other mineral components of the solar nebula. Untangling the effects of aqueous and thermal alteration is difficult because these meteorites contain many different crystalline and amorphous components, many of which have grain sizes &lt; 100 nm.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"9b9f1c7b3d05a4e02eff9efff772146812e9cfe8028ff567b58a467b9d9db0fa","category":"Environment"}
