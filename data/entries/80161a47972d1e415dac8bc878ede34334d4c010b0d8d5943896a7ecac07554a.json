The method leverages the benefits of Jacobian-free approaches, utilizing divided differences to circumvent the computationally intensive calculation of Jacobian matrices. This adaptation significantly reduces computational overhead and simplifies the implementation process while maintaining high convergence rates. We demonstrate that this method achieves fifth-order convergence under specific parameter settings, with a broad applicability across various types of nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a series of numerical experiments which confirm its superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80161a47972d1e415dac8bc878ede34334d4c010b0d8d5943896a7ecac07554a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
