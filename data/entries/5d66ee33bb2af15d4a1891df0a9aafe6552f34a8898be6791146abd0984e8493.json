{"title":"Tumor markers for lipid metabolism‐related genes: Based on small cell lung cancer and bronchial asthma dual analysis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24152?af=R","date":1713272355000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Numerous studies have elucidated the intricate relationship between bronchial asthma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as well as the role lipid metabolism genes play in transitioning from bronchial asthma to SCLC. Despite this, the predictive power of single gene biomarkers remains insufficient and necessitates the development of more accurate prognostic models. In our study, we downloaded and preprocessed scRNA-seq of SCLC from the GEO database GSE164404 and severe asthma scRNA-seq from GSE145013 using the Seurat package. Using the MSigDB database and geneCard database, we selected lipid metabolism-related genes and performed scRNA-seq data analysis from the gene expression GEO database, aiming to uncover potential links between immune signaling pathways in bronchial asthma and SCLC. Our investigations yielded differentially expressed genes based on the scRNA-seq dataset related to lipid metabolism. We executed differential gene analysis, gene ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. In-depth GSEA pathway activation analysis, crucial target gene predictions via protein–protein interactions, and key cluster gene evaluations for differential and diagnostic ROC values correlation analysis confirmed that key cluster genes are significant predictors for the progression of bronchial asthma to SCLC. To validate our findings, we performed wet laboratory experiments using real-time quantitative PCR to assess the expression of these relevant genes in SCLC cell lines. In conclusion, this research proposes a novel lipid metabolism-related gene marker that can offer comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma leading to SCLC. Although this study does not directly focus on senescence-associated molecular alterations, our findings in the lipid metabolism genes associated with inflammation and cancer progression offer valuable insights for further research targeting senescence-related changes in treating inflammatory diseases.</p>","author":"Xiaobin Wang, \nYang Gao, \nHaiqiang Wang, \nXiaokang Gong, \nPeilong Bao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"5d66ee33bb2af15d4a1891df0a9aafe6552f34a8898be6791146abd0984e8493","category":"Environment"}
