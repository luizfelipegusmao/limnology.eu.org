{"title":"Customized Statistically Downscaled CMIP5 and CMIP6 Projections: Application in the Edwards Aquifer Region in South‐Central Texas","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EF004716?af=R","date":1728542378000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate projections are being used for decision-making related to climate mitigation and adaptation and as inputs for impacts modeling related to climate change. The plethora of available projections presents end users with the challenge of how to select climate projections, known as the “practitioner's dilemma.” In addition, if an end-user determines that existing projections cannot be used, then they face the additional challenge of producing climate projections for their region that are useful for their needs. We present a methodology with novel features to address the “practitioner's dilemma” for generating downscaled climate projections for specific applications. We use the Edwards Aquifer region (EAR) in south-central Texas to demonstrate a process to select a subset of global climate models from both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles, followed by downscaling and verification of the accuracy of downscaled data against historical data. The results show that average precipitation changes range from a decrease of 10.4 mm to an increase of 25.6 mm, average temperature increases from 2.0°C to 4.3°C, and the number of days exceeding 37.8°C (100°F) increase by 35–70 days annually by the end of century. The findings enhance our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on the EAR, essential for developing effective regional management strategies. Additionally, the results provide valuable scenario-based projected data to be used for groundwater and spring flow modeling and present a clearly documented example addressing the “practitioner's dilemma” in the EAR.</p>","author":"A.
