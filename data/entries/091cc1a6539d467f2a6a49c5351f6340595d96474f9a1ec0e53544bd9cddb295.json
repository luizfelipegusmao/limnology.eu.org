{"title":"Process Your Cryo-EM Data Using Computing Resources at Pacific Northwest Center for Cryo-EM (PNCC)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.446/7720055?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The Pacific Northwest Center for Cryo-EM (PNCC) serves as a NIH funded national electron microscopy facility, collaboratively managed by Oregon Health &amp; Sciences University (OHSU) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Distinguishing itself, PNCC provides its engaged users with access to computational resources for cryo-EM data processing and extends educational training opportunities in this field to newcomers. Handling extensive cryo-EM data demands significant computational power, specifically GPUs and ample storage capacities. However, accessing such resources can be restricted or financially burdensome for numerous institutions. To address this significant challenge within the cryo-EM community, PNCC offers computing access to all active PNCC General Access projects upon request and free-of-charge. The main PNCC Compute resource known as BOREAL include three different node types (See Table 1) that can be selected based on the software or job types needing to be run. The system has twenty \"Ampere\" nodes where each node has 8x 24 GB A5000 GPGPUs and fifty-six \"Volta\" nodes where each node has 2x 16GB V100 GPGPU. All are linked to 3PB parallel filesystems via FDR InfiniBand network. Standard priority access to the other normal BOREAL nodes (64 CPU only nodes) is also provided. Our recent acquisition of \"Ampere\" nodes has significantly enhanced job turnover, eliminating wait times in the job submission queue. This improvement allows all users to initiate jobs promptly.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"091cc1a6539d467f2a6a49c5351f6340595d96474f9a1ec0e53544bd9cddb295","category":"Environment"}
