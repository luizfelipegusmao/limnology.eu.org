{"title":"Bounded Number Theory: A Study on the Negation of Infinite Numbers in Parts or Completely","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1895/v2","date":1717664708000,"content":"The theory of limited numbers says that the number is not infinite, that is, the number is limited in parts or completely. To reach a conclusion about the limited number, one must understand the meaning of mathematics and varied spaces, therefore, one must understand that mathematics and spaces interact. Mathematics has the function of accurately describing the world, where numbers represent elements or facts that rationally belong to space, and spaces have different intensity of specific physical concepts in each space; therefore, there is no infinite element or fact due to the differences in the intensities of specific physical concepts in spaces that do not allow the fact or fact in all spaces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12f8fd0f99f2ce6167acfda6e206c80f576bfe5f0c57f9fb47dfea8edc012a08","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
