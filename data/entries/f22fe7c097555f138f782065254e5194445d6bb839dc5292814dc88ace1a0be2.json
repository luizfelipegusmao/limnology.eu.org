These biofilms are tolerant to antifungals and to the host immune system. To identify novel genes modulating <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> biofilm formation, we performed a large-scale screen with 2,454 <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> doxycycline-dependent overexpression strains and identified 16 genes whose overexpression significantly hampered biofilm formation. Among those, overexpression of the <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> paralogs that encode transcription factors and have orthologs only in biofilm-forming species of the <i>Candida</i> clade, caused impaired biofilm formation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> impeded biofilm formation without any defect in hyphal growth. Transcript profiling, transcription factor binding, and phenotypic microarray analyses conducted upon overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> demonstrated their role in reprogramming cellular metabolism by regulating central metabolism including glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes. Taken together, this study has identified a new set of biofilm regulators, including <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i>, that appear to control biofilm development through their specific role in metabolic remodeling.","author":"Laxmi Shanker Rai","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"f22fe7c097555f138f782065254e5194445d6bb839dc5292814dc88ace1a0be2","category":"Environment"}
