{"title":"Spring&#039;s Signal: Can Bud Burst Timing Enhance Resistance to Ash Dieback in Europe?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1521/v1","date":1726794824000,"content":"Ash dieback (ADB), caused by the invasive fungal pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, poses a significant ecological and economic challenge across Europe. Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), a key component of forest ecosystems, has experienced mortality rates reaching up to 85% in affected regions, severely threatening its ecological role and economic value. This study examines the relationship between the phenological traits of ash clones, particularly the timing of spring bud burst, and their susceptibility to H. fraxineus infection. The study was conducted in a clonal seed orchard located in northeastern Poland, encompassing 31 ash clones from different bioclimatic regions. Phenological observations of bud burst were carried out from early April to late May during the years 2018-2020, and crown damage and de-foliation levels were assessed multiple times throughout the growing season.\nThe results confirm that clones with earlier bud burst exhibit significantly higher survival rates and reduced crown damage. It was found that the timing of bud burst is strongly correlated with susceptibility to ash dieback, suggesting that phenological timing is a crucial factor in the selection of genotypes resistant to ash dieback. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and mixed models, revealed significant differences in susceptibility to infection among clones from different bioclimatic regions. Furthermore, the study high-lights the potential of breeding strategies focused on these traits to enhance the resilience of ash popula-tions. These findings are critical for the development of effective forest management practices aimed at conserving ash resources and maintaining biodiversity in the face of climate change and the ongoing spread of the pathogen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d264434e3c78f2d4d599e3849c4185b012e62ff03af9b1d1613a8db0d0d1e44b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
