{"title":"485 Impact of annual and perennial forage systems on forage biomass and quality, steer performance, and enteric methane emissions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/173/7757291?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Beef producers require forage options that provide adequate yield and high nutritive value, optimizing the production and sustainability of grazing operations. Few multiple year studies within Canada compare novel perennial and annual grass legume blends under grazing. This study evaluated the effects of perennial and annual forage systems on forage biomass and quality, grazing animal performance, and enteric emissions. Forage treatments included 1) AC Success hybrid bromegrass (<span>Bromus riparius Rehm</span>. × <span>Bromus inermis Leyss.</span>) + PS3006 alfalfa (<span>Medicago sativa L.</span>; HBG-ALF), 2) AC Armada meadow bromegrass (<span>Bromus riparius Rehm.</span>) + AAC Mountainview sainfoin (<span>Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.</span>; MBG-SF), 3) AC Hazlet fall rye (<span>Secale cereale L.</span>) + Frosty berseem clover (<span>Trifolium alexandrinum L.</span>; FR-CLOV), and 4) Winfred forage brassica (<span>Brassica oleracea L.× Brassica rapa L.</span>) + Gorilla forage brassica (<span>Brassica napus L.</span>) + 4010 pea (<span>Pisum sativum L.</span>) + CDC Austenson barley (<span>Hordeum vulgare L.</span>; BR-PE-BRAS). Yearling beef steers [n = 120, body weight (BW) = 397 ± 10 kg] were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 replicated (n = 3) forage systems for an average of 65 d grazing period amongst the 12 paddocks. Dry matter yield (DMY) was similar (<span>P</span> = 0.33) between BR-PE-BRAS (2,170 kg/ha) and HBG-ALF (1938 kg/ha), which were greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) than both MBG-SF (1030 kg/ha) and FR-CLOV (700 kg/ha) systems. Total digestible nutrient content (TDN) of FR-CLOV (63.6%) and BR-PEA-BRASS (62.0%) was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) than both MBG-SF (51.7%) and HBG-ALF (49.3%) forages. Crude protein (CP) was greatest in FR-CLOV (15.2% <span>P</span> = 0.0012) intermediate in BR-PEA-BRASS (10.0%) and HBG-ALF (8.5%), and least in MBG-SF (6.6%). Steer performance was greatest when grazing HBG-ALF (87 kg/ha) paddocks, which was similar (<span>P</span> = 0.31) to FR-CLOV (62 kg/ha) and similar (<span>P</span> = 0.10) MBG-SF (51 kg/ha), but greater (<span>P</span> = 0.01) than BAR-PEA-BRASS (26 kg/ha). Enteric methane concentration from steers was the least when grazing BR-PE-BRAS (19.7g/kg DMI), followed by FR-CLOV (22.4g/kg DMI), MBG-SF (23.4g/kg DMI) and finally HBG-ALF (28.1g/kg DMI). In summary, BR-PE-BRAS and HBG-ALF forage systems provided the greatest DMY, while steer average daily gain (ADG) grazing HBG-ALF forage outperformed steers on BR-PE-BRAS paddocks. Forage energy and protein was greater in annual forage systems FR-CLOV and BR-PE-BRAS, compared with perennial forage systems. Enteric methane levels were the lowest in the steers grazing BR-PE-BRAS forage.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"6c9cb72ab14f0cbcc9f181ec46770e4efaff3c6de62e949292c5e627c7ba10e2","category":"Environment"}
