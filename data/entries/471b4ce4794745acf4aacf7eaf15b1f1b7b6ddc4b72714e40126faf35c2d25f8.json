{"title":"Microbial Quality of Traditional Meat Products Manufactured on a Small Scale by Polish Farms in the Lodz Region","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0054/v1","date":1722519258000,"content":"The aim of present study was to assess the microbiological quality of eight traditional meat products (black pudding, white brown, baked pate, roasted pork, raw smoked ham, smoked steamed sausage, raw smoked bacon, raw smoked loin) manufactured by polish farmers in the Lodz region. A total of 37 samples were collected and analyzed twice: within \n24 h after purchase from manufactures and after 7 days of storage. Mesophiles, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Enterobacteriaceae, presence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were determined. The counts of isolated microorganisms varied depending on the product type and manufacturer. Mesophiles and lactic acid bacteria constituted the main microflora in the tested meat products. Enterobacteriace value was below detection limit in the most samples. The highest mean bacteria counts (mesophiles, LAB and Enterobacteriace) during storage were estimated in black pudding, followed by smoked steamed sausage and white brown. In opposite, the lowest mean bacteria levels were in baked pate and roasted pork. The obtained results showed significant influence of storage time on the mean number of mesophiles and LAB in the meat samples. Negative results for Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were observed during 7 days of storage, indicating the safety of the studied meat products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"471b4ce4794745acf4aacf7eaf15b1f1b7b6ddc4b72714e40126faf35c2d25f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
