{"title":"A High-Gain Broadband Circularly Polarized Crossed Dipole Antenna","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1409/v1","date":1721213120000,"content":"A high-gain broadband circularly polarized crossed dipole antenna is designed. This antenna utilizes two pairs of cross dipoles and a pair of phase delay lines to form circularly polarized radiation. Open-circuit stubs are loaded on the four arms of these two pairs of cross dipoles to introduce new circularly polarized resonating frequency. A rectangular ring patch is introduced directly below the cross dipoles to form the third circularly polarized resonating frequency, thereby broadening the axial ratio bandwidth of the antenna. In addition, metal posts are loaded at the four right angles of the rectangular ring patch to increase the antenna gain. Measurement results show that the antenna achieves a 3dB axial ratio bandwidth of 29.2% (1.9 GHz-2.55 GHz) and maintains a gain of 7.5 dB within the passband, exhibiting good circularly polarized radiation performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"292760fc1e32efe92b176c02849ec5c834a4b98dd2ef78167268d7497c7715e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
