{"title":"The student-teacher framework guided by self-training and consistency regularization for semi-supervised medical image segmentation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300039","date":1713794400000,"content":"<p>by Boliang Li, Yaming Xu, Yan Wang, Luxiu Li, Bo Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nDue to the high suitability of semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation, a plethora of valuable research has been conducted and has achieved noteworthy success in this field. However, many approaches tend to confine their focus to a singular semi-supervised framework, thereby overlooking the potential enhancements in segmentation performance offered by integrating several frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework named Pesudo-Label Mean Teacher (PLMT), which synergizes the self-training pipeline with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization techniques. In particular, we integrate the student-teacher structure with consistency loss into the self-training pipeline to facilitate a mutually beneficial enhancement between the two methods. This structure not only generates remarkably accurate pseudo-labels for the self-training pipeline but also furnishes additional pseudo-label supervision for the student-teacher framework. Moreover, to explore the impact of different semi-supervised losses on the segmentation performance of the PLMT framework, we introduce adaptive loss weights. The PLMT could dynamically adjust the weights of different semi-supervised losses during the training process. Extension experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves the best performance and outperforms the other five semi-supervised methods. The PLMT is an initial exploration of the framework that melds the self-training pipeline with consistency regularization and offers a comparatively innovative perspective in semi-supervised image segmentation.","author":"Boliang Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"759297b22c10f1d6bfb11c4584c1619ca1b3cad82d19651758a57a972b7c2264","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
