{"title":"Genomic Diversity as a Key Conservation Criterion: Proof‐of‐Concept From Mammalian Whole‐Genome Resequencing Data","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.70000?af=R","date":1725951600000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Many international, national, state, and local organizations prioritize the ranking of threatened and endangered species to help direct conservation efforts. For example, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assesses the Green Status of species and publishes the influential Red List of threatened species. Unfortunately, such conservation yardsticks do not explicitly consider genetic or genomic diversity (GD), even though GD is positively associated with contemporary evolutionary fitness, individual viability, and with future evolutionary potential. To test whether populations of genome sequences could help improve conservation assessments, we estimated GD metrics from 82 publicly available mammalian datasets and examined their statistical association with attributes related to conservation. We also considered intrinsic biological factors, including trophic level and body mass, that could impact GD and quantified their relative influences. Our results identify key population GD metrics that are both reflective and predictive of IUCN conservation categories. Specifically, our analyses revealed that Watterson's theta (the population mutation rate) and autozygosity (a product of inbreeding) are associated with the current Red List categorization, likely because demographic declines that lead to “listing” decisions also reduce levels of standing genetic variation. We argue that by virtue of this relationship, conservation organizations like IUCN could leverage emerging genome sequence data to help categorize Red List threat rankings (especially in otherwise data-deficient species) and/or enhance Green Status assessments to establish a baseline for future population monitoring. Thus, our paper (1) outlines the theoretical and empirical justification for a new GD-based assessment criterion, (2) provides a bioinformatic pipeline for estimating GD from population genomic data, and (3) suggests an analytical framework that can be used to measure baseline GD while providing quantitative GD context for consideration by conservation authorities.</p>","author":"Jong Yoon Jeon, \nAndrew N.
