{"title":"Advancing 100m sprint performance prediction: A machine learning approach to velocity curve modeling and performance correlation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303366","date":1715608800000,"content":"<p>by Chung Kit Tam, Zai-Fu Yao</p>\r\n\r\nThis study presents a novel approach to modeling the velocity-time curve in 100m sprinting by integrating machine learning algorithms. It critically addresses the limitations of traditional speed models, which often require extensive and intricate data collection, by proposing a more accessible and accurate method using fewer variables. The research utilized data from various international track events from 1987 to 2019. Two machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN), were employed to predict the velocity-time curve, focusing on the acceleration phase of the sprint. The models were evaluated against the traditional exponential speed model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), with the NN model demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, the study explored the correlation between maximum velocity, the time of maximum velocity occurrence, the duration of the maximum speed phase, and the overall 100m sprint time. The findings indicate a strong negative correlation between maximum velocity and final time, offering new insights into the dynamics of sprinting performance. This research contributes significantly to the field of sports science, particularly in optimizing training and performance analysis in sprinting.","author":"Chung Kit Tam","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5f16975f320b375abd3933efed47a3a8d986c806ef4df3637b8845abca6c7075","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
