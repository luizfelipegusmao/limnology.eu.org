Moreover, there are no regulations, local codes of practice, or legislation limiting the use of this material. Furthermore, ACP is cheaply available in local markets and can be installed quickly and easily. The aim of this study is to examine the aluminum composite panels available in the Iraqi market according to the specifications available in the suppliersâ€™ catalogs, and their effects on the Iraqi environment by conducting tests on the thermal effects of aluminum, its thermal and sound insulation, and the fire hazards and the toxicity it possesses. This study was conducted during the month of June 2021 in Baghdad, Iraq, according to the available international standards and indications of the suitability of aluminum panels, and poses recommendations.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"2ba8d50b20d117d5d8bfbfb77d2b0ebbf5c31750e7924d66d8289cdd9571e096","category":"Environment"}
