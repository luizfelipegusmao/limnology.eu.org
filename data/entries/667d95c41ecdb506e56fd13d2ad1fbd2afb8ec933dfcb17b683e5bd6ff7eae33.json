{"title":"Sex-Specific Variation in Metabolic Responses to Diet","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1317/v1","date":1721116897000,"content":"Suboptimal nutrition is a leading cause of cardiometabolic disease and mortality. Biological sex is a variable that can play a role in individual response to nutritional factors and may modulate the impact of nutrition on disease. This narrative review explores the intricate interplay between sex, nutrition, and health outcomes, and the consequent importance of considering sex in nutrition research, dietary recommendations, and disease management. We examine the impact of sex on how various dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean diet, macronutrient content and quality, Western diet, and energy restriction associate with or affect metabolic health and disease risk. Understanding how sex influences the response to the diet can inform precision nutrition interventions and approaches for disease prevention and management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"667d95c41ecdb506e56fd13d2ad1fbd2afb8ec933dfcb17b683e5bd6ff7eae33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
