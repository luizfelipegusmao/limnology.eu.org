{"title":"Multiparametric Mapping by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in the Risk Stratification of Ventricular Arrhythmias and Sudden Cardiac Death","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1730/v1","date":1711599959000,"content":"Risk stratification for malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death is a daunting task for physicians in daily practice. Multiparametric mapping sequences obtained via cardio-vascular magnetic resonance imaging can improve the risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias by unveiling the presence of pathophysiological pro-arrhythmogenic processes. However, their employment in clinical practice is still restricted. The present review explores the current evidence supporting the association between mapping abnormalities and the risk of ventricular arrhyth-mias in several cardiovascular diseases. The key message is that further clinical studies are needed to test the additional value of mapping techniques beyond conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging for selecting patients eligible for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5bacef6c5c5305ce4d5dcfaaac648760abfe412d529ce1d80f28eb8697191c2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
