{"title":"Antifungal Efficacy and Biofilm Inhibition of Candida albicans by Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) in Vietnam: A Comprehensive Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0422/v1","date":1725849166000,"content":"Candida albicans, a prominent constituent of the human microbiota, poses a significant health threat due to its opportunistic pathogenicity and adept biofilm-forming capabilities. This research delves into the antifungal attributes and biofilm inhibition potential of Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) cultivated in Vietnam. Renowned for its bioactive compounds, including terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole, and terpinolene, the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia, commonly referred to as tea tree oil (TTO), is scrutinized for its impact on Candida albicans. The study meticulously determines the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of TTO against Candida albicans in both planktonic and biofilm states. Additionally, it assesses the biofilm-forming capacity of Candida albicans and establishes the Minimum Biofilm Inhibitory Concentration (MBIC) and Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) of TTO. Employing a liquid culture dilution method within a defined concentration range of 0.1 μL/mL to 10 μL/mL, the experimental approach adheres to established protocols. The outcomes reveal a noteworthy MIC and MIC80 of 0.1 μL/mL and 2 μL/mL, respectively, and an MFC of 10 μL/mL for TTO against Candida albicans. Furthermore, TTO exhibits an MBIC of 2 μL/mL, showcasing its efficacy in inhibiting biofilm formation. However, the MBEC of TTO remains uncertain, possibly due to insufficient concentration tested, which may not effectively disrupt over 50% of the pre-formed biofilm mass within 24 hours. These results underscore the promising potential of TTO as a potent antifungal agent and biofilm inhibitor against Candida albicans, offering valuable insights for the innovation of novel therapeutic strategies in the realm of fungal infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"895711cfab278b16c90f6ae88d29032e4f12a8094a3027ff824c1277be7009fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
