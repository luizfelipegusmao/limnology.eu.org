{"title":"Green accounting and reporting in Bangladesh’s pharmaceutical and textile industries: A holistic perspective","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310236","date":1725976800000,"content":"<p>by Mohammad Mizenur Rahaman, Shamima Akter, Md. Alamgir Hossain, Adiba Rahman Bushra Chowdhury, Renhong Wu</p>\r\n\r\nThis study examined the factors influencing green accounting and reporting practices (GARPs) in Bangladesh’s pharmaceutical and textile industries. Hence, it draws upon disclosure theory to disclose relevant information in the context of environmental accounting and encourages them to boost their environmental performance. It utilized content analysis from 13 pharmaceuticals and 22 textiles data from Dhaka stock exchange (DSE) listed companies of Bangladesh and applied quantitative methods for comparative analysis. The findings showed that GARPs are influenced by firm characteristics and external factors rather than organizational performance, and eleven environmental indicators (separately) have a lower mean of less than 0.50 in both industries. Firms’ general characteristics (FFGC) are noteworthy factors that exhibit a negative coefficient for both the pharmaceutical and textile sectors but hold a robust impact on the GARPs, with P = 0.007 and 0.003, respectively. The statistical significance of environmental factors (EFs) applies to the textile sector p = 0.000. Implementing GARPs in the pharmaceutical industry proved more effective than in the textile sector, offering valuable support to managers in expediting environmental practices in Bangladesh’s textile industry.","author":"Mohammad Mizenur Rahaman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8b8d5d9da4cb98723a7187c880d5be1b912f76030df68babc56568368899ae74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
