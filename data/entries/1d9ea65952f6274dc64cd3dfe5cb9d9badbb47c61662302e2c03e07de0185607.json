{"title":"SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seroprevalence in Gabon: Findings from the Nationwide Household Serosurvey in a Sub-Saharan Africa Country","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1763/v1","date":1716887640000,"content":"Seroconversion surveys of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provide accurate estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This nationwide population-based cross-sectional serosurvey aimed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among residents in Gabon and compare the estimated cumulative number of COVID-19 cases with the officially registered number of laboratory-confirmed cases up to December 2021. Households in each province were randomly selected. Twenty-eight localities including 16 urban and 12 rural, were randomly selected to participate in the study. Whole blood samples were collected in dry tubes from all study participants around the country within 15 days. Serum samples were used to measure the total Immunoglobulin antibodies. Overall, data of 1672 households were analyzed. Out of the 3659 participants, 3175 were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, resulting in a crude seroprevalence of 86.77%. Stratification of study participants by age group has shown highest seroprevalences in 20–29 and 40-49 age groups with 91.78% (95% CI:89.5–93.6) and 91.42% (95% CI:88.7–93.5), respectively. Nyanga province had the lowest prevalence (72,8%), and Estuaire and Ogoué-Lolo provinces had the highest prevalence (90 and 92%, respectively). Our results suggest a high transmission rate in the Gabonese population, 21 months after the first SARS-CoV-2 case in the country. This high seroprevalence estimate could indicate that the applied infection control measures may not have been adequately implemented or appropriately adhered to by the population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d9ea65952f6274dc64cd3dfe5cb9d9badbb47c61662302e2c03e07de0185607","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
