{"title":"Reduced Runoff in the Upper Yangtze River Due To Comparable Contribution of Anthropogenic and Climate Changes","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004028?af=R","date":1721372400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The changing climate and intensifying human activities have made an impact on the hydrological processes in the upper Yangtze River (UYR), but quantifying their effects remains uncertain. This study used the Budyko framework to investigate the response of runoff (<i>Q</i>) to climate change and human activities during 1956â€“2017 and evaluate the impacts of human activities, including land use/cover change, water use, dam construction, and vegetation change, on watershed characteristic. Results show that climate change is the dominant driver of <i>Q</i> variations in the Wujiang River (WJR), Jialing River (JLR), and Jinsha River (JSR) watersheds, with contributions of 58.6%, 66.9%, and 67.6%, respectively. However, in Mingjiang River (MJR) and UYR watersheds, human activities contribute more to <i>Q</i> variations with 55.2% and 51.2%, respectively. Human activities play important roles in variation of watershed characteristics, and they can explain 22%, 26%, 36%, 25%, and 53% of the watershed character change in UYR, WJR, JLR, MJR, and JSR, respectively. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the causes of <i>Q</i> change in UYR, and provides a new perspective to explore the effects of specific human activities on watershed characteristics.</p>","author":"Feng Zeng, \nQiulan He, \nYao Li, \nWeiyu Shi, \nRuowen Yang, \nMingguo Ma, \nGuangwei Huang, \nJunlan Xiao, \nXinyue Yang, \nDongrui Di","siteTitle":"Wiley: Earth's Future: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2958dd76fb7907b9b5d9ef7cbca00ecda25efa9c5b75e193900a164a1ec3c84c","entryHash":"87cf55eee55d7ba18312ade69146756f6b95da946ddb94480ab311a4c75d3a8e","category":"Environment"}
