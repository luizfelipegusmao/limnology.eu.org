{"title":"Comparative Study on the Properties of Nitrile Rubber Filled with Carbon Powder and Carbon Black","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2283/v1","date":1727600679000,"content":"The properties of carbon powder filled nitrile rubber (NBR) were investigated. The effect of carbon powder content on the mechanical strength, vulcanization properties, mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity of NBR was explored. The purpose of the research is to pursue the optimal filling ratio and conditions of carbon powder to optimize the performance of rubber products.The reasonable filling range of carbon powder has been compared with N660 carbon black filled NBR and determined to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of carbon powder. The suitable application scenarios of carbon powder is clarified .The research results indicate that carbon powder can delay the sulfurization of NBR in the sulfurization system. The research results indicate that carbon powder can delay the sulfurization of NBR. In terms of filling system, the tensile strength, tear strength, and elongation at break of NBR gradually enhance as the amount of carbon powder increases. Carbon powder can replace carbon black in the application of NBR to improve the comprehensive performance of NBR, which provides a new kind of reinforcing material for NBR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c83642b34f96d2e136fa65475c51360143d868e494ffd8cd51259d4bf35258cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
