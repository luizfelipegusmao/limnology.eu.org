{"title":"Adsorption and partial catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur using facilely prepared materials derived from sludge of groundwater treatment","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14383?af=R","date":1722427964000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Realizing the use of biogas as fuel or a gas engine, it is needed to upgrade to natural gas standards when it comes to pure biomethane, meaning impurities must be removed to a certain low concentration. Among these tasks, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) removal steadfastly gets the most attention. In the present work, partial catalytic oxidation was used to convert H<sub>2</sub>S to less harmful forms. Adsorbents/catalysts applied to this process were prepared from the sludge of a groundwater treatment plant using a simple combination of drying and calcination methods. As a relevant result, the as-prepared sample (dried at 105°C for 24 h) exhibited high activity, with 90 ± 2% H<sub>2</sub>S conversion after 120 min of reaction time, while the sample calcined at about 500°C for 5 h (TP-500) showed the highest H<sub>2</sub>S conversion (96 ± 2%); the lowest 28 ± 1% belonged to the case of TP-700. The main compositions of the TP-500 sample were crystalline calcite and amorphous iron oxides. The average size of calcite crystallites was ~45 nm, with a specific surface area of ~76 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Moreover, the presence of oxygen in the catalytic process and the “self-outflow process” of sulfur desorption were the vital keys that allowed the partial H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation to take place continuously. After a reaction time of 2 h, the adsorption capacity of the best sample was 460.8 mg/g. Thus, it is obvious that inexpensive catalysts derived from sludge precursors can be effectively used for H<sub>2</sub>S removal from mixtures with air, supporting the treatment of raw biogas in the coming time.</p>","author":"Lam Pham Thanh Hien, \nThanh Son Cam, \nPham Hong Phuc, \nNguyen Thi Thuy, \nVo Thi Thanh Thuy, \nDang Van Thanh, \nNguyen Nhat Huy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"228673593218162b389fd4ba9d197e13277b5a66f28ca9cd75adb8e9f5abcd84","category":"Environment"}
