While the trade-off between food acquisition and predation avoidance has long been recognized in predicting antipredator responses, less attention has been paid to the dynamics of the food-safety trade-off driven by temporal variation in multiple risk factors under changing seasonal conditions.\n\nHere, we monitored foraging and vigilance behaviour of a central prey species, snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>), at fine temporal scales over the winter with various types of predation risk, while also experimentally manipulating predation risk by attracting predators to foraging patches.\n\nHares increased foraging and decreased vigilance over the winter, but hares under chronic risk decreased their antipredator efforts to a lesser degree, indicating that those individuals prioritized risk avoidance over food acquisition. Hares also decreased foraging and increased antipredator efforts in response to the temporal activity of predators and environmental cues of predation risk. However, the magnitude of the responses to the environmental cues was mediated by time of winter. While we did not detect a reactive response of hares to acute risk, we did find that hares exhibiting camouflage mismatch proactively increased vigilance.\n\nOverall, our results highlight the importance of species-specific traits and changing seasonal conditions in addition to temporal variation in multiple risk factors in predicting antipredator responses and the context dependence of risk effects.\n</p>","author":"Shotaro Shiratsuru, \nJonathan N.
