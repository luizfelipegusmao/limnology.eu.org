{"title":"Increasing the Photovoltaic Efficiency of Semiconductor (Cu1-xAgx)2ZnSnS4 Thin Thin Films through Ag Content Modification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1053/v1","date":1718606678000,"content":"The research that we are referring to examines the morphological, structural, and optical characteristics of kesterite (Cu1-xAgx)2ZnSnS4 (CAZTS) thin films, which are produced using a process known as thermal evaporation (TE). The study's main goal was to determine how different Ag contents affect the characteristics of CAZTS systems. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy: were used to confirm the crystal structure of the CAZTS thin films. Using a mathematical model of spectroscopic ellipsometry, the refractive index (n) represented the part of the complex refractive index, the extinction coefficient (k) portrayed the imaginary one, and also the energy band gap of the fabricated films were all calculated. The energy band gap of the thin films was also calculated. This is a crucial parameter for solar cell applications, as it determines the wavelength of light that the material can absorb. The energy band gap was found to decrease from 1.74 eV to 1.55 eV with increasing Ag content. The ITO/n-CdS/p-CAZTS/Mo heterojunction was well constructed, and the primary photovoltaic characteristics of the n-CdS/p-CAZTS junctions were examined for use in solar cells. Different Ag contents of the CAZTS layers were used to determine the dark and illumination (current-voltage) characteristics of the heterojunctions. The study's findings collectively point to CAZTS thin layers as potential absorber materials for solar cell applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5efc0fc952fdce944a5fd7bead8b09dd75c87cebc16beef33507c21df252ceb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
