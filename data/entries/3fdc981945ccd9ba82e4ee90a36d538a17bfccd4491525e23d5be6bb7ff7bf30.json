{"title":"Identification of agricultural areas to restore through Nature-based Solutions (NbS)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0277/v1","date":1728007917000,"content":"Starting from the objectives of the Nature Restoration Law and the concept of Forest Landscape Restoration, the objective of the following study is to present a methodological approach aimed at identifying areas that are best suited for the implementation of NbS for the improvement of landscape and habitat status in the study area identified by the Urban Atlas of the city of Campobasso (1028.64 km2). Using open data (ISPRA ecosystem services and Regional land use capability), an expert based approach (questionnaire) and a multi-criteria analysis (AHP), the Total Ecosystem Services Value (TESV) index was determined as a weighted additive sum of the criteria (Data) considered. The index was then classified into 8 clusters and the land use “Cropland” was extracted, matching Cluster 1 (740.09 Ha) with agricultural areas with less ES provision to be allocated to NbS and Cluster 8 (482.88 Ha) with valuable areas to be preserved, for a total of 2.34% of the study area. It was then possible to compare the “Forest” areas currently present in the study area with those of a possible future scenario, represented by the areas occupied today by forest with the addition of cluster 1 croplands. A landscape analysis was then conducted: it showed greater dispersion and fragmentation of forest patches in the future scenario but also greater connectivity and thus greater ecological functionality of the patches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fdc981945ccd9ba82e4ee90a36d538a17bfccd4491525e23d5be6bb7ff7bf30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
