{"title":"Non-specialist delivered psycho-social interventions for women with perinatal depression living in rural communities: A systematic review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003031","date":1720447200000,"content":"<p>by Anouk Ackerman, Nimrah Afzal, Alexandra Lautarescu, Claire A. Wilson, Abhijit Nadkarni</p>\r\n\r\nEvidence from low- and middle-income countries suggests that non-specialist-delivered interventions effectively improve access to perinatal mental health care. However, there have been no systematic attempts to synthesize the evidence on effectiveness, relevance, and application of this strategy to resource-limited settings such as rural areas. The aim of this review is to synthesize the evidence about the effectiveness of non-specialist delivered interventions in improving depression and related outcomes in women with perinatal depression living in rural communities. Seven electronic databases were searched using the following search concepts: perinatal depression (e.g., puerperal depression, antenatal depression), rural areas (e.g., remote, nonmetropolitan, underserved), and non-specialist workers (e.g., lay worker, volunteer aide, informal caretaker. The risk of bias was assessed using RoB-2 and ROBINS-I tools. A narrative synthesis was performed as the high degree of study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Nine unique studies were eligible for inclusion. Psychoeducation and problem-solving techniques were the most used intervention elements. Two interventions significantly reduced the prevalence of perinatal depression compared to usual care, and three interventions reported effectiveness in reducing depression symptom severity. There was little to no consistent evidence for other outcomes, including but not limited to maternal health care utilization, breastfeeding behaviors, and child health. This review provides limited evidence to suggest that non-specialist delivered interventions effectively improved outcomes among women with perinatal depression living in rural communities. The paucity of high-quality studies included in this review demonstrates that this rural demographic is frequently neglected in the context of maternal mental health research.","author":"Anouk Ackerman","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"6bf0a833da7d0183bb8f00a5cc2c5707633bbdd540f1e39b6a4d6b3649fafbd4","category":"Environment"}
