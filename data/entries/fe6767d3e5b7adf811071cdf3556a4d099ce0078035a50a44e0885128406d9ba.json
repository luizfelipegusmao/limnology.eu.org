{"title":"A comparison of white matter microstructure and correlates with neuropsychological measures in younger and older adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305818","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Abu-Bakar Sheriff, Vanessa Scarapicchia, Erin L. Mazerolle, Brian Christie, Jodie R. Gawryluk</p>\r\nObjective <p>With a globally aging population, there is a need to better understand how brain structure relates to function in healthy older and younger adults.</p> Methods <p>34 healthy participants divided into older (17; Mean = 70.9, SD = 5.4) and younger adults (17; Mean = 28.1, SD = 2.8) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging and neuropsychological assessment, including the California Verbal Learning Test 2nd Edition and the Trail Making Test (TMT-A and TMT-B). Differences in white matter microstructure for older and younger adults and the association between DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) and cognitive performance were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (p &lt; 0.05, corrected).</p> Results <p>Older adults had significantly lower FA and higher MD than younger adults in widespread brain regions. There was a significant negative correlation between executive function (TMT-B) and MD for older adults in the right superior/anterior corona radiata and the corpus callosum. No significant relationship was detected between DTI metrics and executive function in younger adults or with memory performance in either group.</p> Conclusions <p>The findings underscore the need to examine brain-behaviour relationships as a function of age. Future studies should include comprehensive assessments in larger lifespan samples to better understand the aging brain.</p>","author":"Abu-Bakar Sheriff","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fe6767d3e5b7adf811071cdf3556a4d099ce0078035a50a44e0885128406d9ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
