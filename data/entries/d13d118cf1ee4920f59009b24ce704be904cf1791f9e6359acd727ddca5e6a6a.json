{"title":"Dynamic Interrelations between Sensory and Affective Aspects of Pain in Patients with Chronic Pain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0142/v1","date":1714701967000,"content":"Depression, anxiety, and pain are part of a common phenomenon that requires to be studied together when evaluating patients with chronic pain. The aim of the study was to examine the correlations between depression, anxiety and pain intensity in patients with chronic pain and how they change when a depressive episode was added. A sample of 120 patients with chronic pain (age: 51.90±11.94; 81.7% female; 18.3% male) was studied in two stages with a three-month period between them. Patients with a depressive episode (n=61) were treated with antidepressants and analgesics, while a patient without depression (n=59) was treated only with analgesics. The scales used to achieve the objectives were: HAM-D-17, Spielberger‘s STAI and VAS. Insignificant correlations were found between depression, state and trait anxiety, and pain intensity (p&amp;lt;0,05) in the group without depression, except for a significant one between depression and state anxiety (p&amp;lt;0,01) in the second stage. Significant correlations were identified between all indicators (p&amp;lt;0,01) in the group with depression at the two stages. Those in the second stage were stronger. The interrelations between sensory and affective aspects of pain were stronger when a depressive episode occurs, the severity of which determines their dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d13d118cf1ee4920f59009b24ce704be904cf1791f9e6359acd727ddca5e6a6a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
