{"title":"Thermoplastic-Based Ballistic Helmets: Processing, Ballistic Resistance and Damage Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1389/v1","date":1721217405000,"content":"Ballistic helmets are individual armor equipment designed to protect a soldier's head from projectiles and fragments. Although very common, these helmets are responsible for several causalities due to their low ballistic resistance and large back face deformation to stop the projectile. Therefore, to enhance helmet performance, studies have focused on the development of new materials and new ballistic protection solutions. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a new ballistic solution using thermoplastic-based matrices. The first matrix was based on high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The second matrix was based on HDPE modified with ex-foliated montmorillonite (MMT). The main manufacturing processes of a thermoplastic-based ballistic helmet are presented, along with its ballistic performance, according to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) standard 0106.01 and an investigation of its failure mechanisms via a non-destructive technique. All the helmets resulted in level III-A ballistic protection. The postimpact helmets were scanned to evaluate the back face deformation dimensions, which revealed that the global cone deformation was deeper in the HDPE than in the HDPE/MMT. The failure analysis revealed an overall larger deformation area in the HDPE and HDPE/MMT helmet delamination zones in regions with a large radius of curvature than in zones with the lowest radius, which is in accordance with previous simulations from the literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84fdf7f193e7a25d14de752bd99c052cdf234ed68e5d2e99287b03a9314bec34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
