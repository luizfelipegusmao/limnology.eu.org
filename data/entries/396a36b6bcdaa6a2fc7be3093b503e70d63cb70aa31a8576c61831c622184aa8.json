{"title":"Embodied Agency and Resilience: A Framework for Examining Disabled Refugees&rsquo; Experiences in the Post-Migration Context","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1250/v1","date":1729074818000,"content":"Disabled people have been all but invisible in refugee research. The same can be said of refugees in disability studies. We propose an analytical framework that integrates critical and trauma approaches to inform studies of the experiences of disabled refugees as they express their agency and engage in their communities. Critical disability theory questions the assumptions undergirding the social model that have led to “fixed” conceptions of disabled people and ignored their innate agency. By equating disability with oppression, social model proponents have argued that the emancipation of disabled people may only be achieved through shifts in oppressive structures. On the other hand, understanding how trauma affects disabled refugees helps avoid defining them simply as dependent victims and omitting or overlooking their resilience. We contend that a sociocultural understanding of trauma allows for a dynamic and contextual perspective on agency and resilience; one that challenges the “traumatized refugee” narrative. The principal claim underpinning the framework is that disabled refugees should be regarded as capable agents of change confronting contexts of continuing trauma, displacement and vulnerability. This article offers an integrative and interpretive understanding of the lived experiences of disabled refugees that highlights the possibilities inherent in their human agency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"396a36b6bcdaa6a2fc7be3093b503e70d63cb70aa31a8576c61831c622184aa8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
