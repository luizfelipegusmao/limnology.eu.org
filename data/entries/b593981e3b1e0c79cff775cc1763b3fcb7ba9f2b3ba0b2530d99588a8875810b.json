{"title":"Advances in Corrosion of High-Temperature Materials: Interfacial Migration and Alloy Design Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0734/v1","date":1720607493000,"content":"Structural and functional materials are subjected to harsh oxidizing environments that lead to a rapid decline in their surface chemical stability. At high-temperatures, the diffusion of atoms is erratic; thus, the reactive elements (REs) get a chance to migrate to the surface and look for oxygen-reactive sites. Their migration from the lattice sites creates vacancies in the matrix and thus weakens the bond, making the material prone to environmental degrading factors. Subsequently, the inward diffusion of oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, or carbon may occupy these vacancies, resulting in undesired precipitation at the grain boundary, which is usually brittle. The solubility and dissociation of attacking species and corrosion products play the most critical role in corrosion in high-temperature water. To evade such situations, Ti, Al, and Cr are added in Ni/Fe-based alloys, forming a dense oxide layer on the surface that impedes further surface migration of ions. The stability of the alloys is then determined by the capability of these oxide layers to heal or reform during spalling/cracking. This review attempts to understand the migration of REs at the interfaces to prepare structural materials in any unexpected set of oxidizing service conditions. This review will also try to establish the interaction mechanism of REs novel/conventionally added in the alloys with the oxidizing elements in the environments to design better degradation-resistant high-temperature alloys.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b593981e3b1e0c79cff775cc1763b3fcb7ba9f2b3ba0b2530d99588a8875810b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
