{"title":"The Evolution of Zoological Classification: From Linnaean Taxonomy to an Ecological and Interactive Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1875/v1","date":1729758428000,"content":"Since Carl Linnaeus introduced the binomial nomenclature system in the 18th century, zoological classification has experienced significant transformations. While Linnaeus’ taxonomy provided a foundational structure based on morphological traits, advancements in evolutionary theory, genetics, and molecular biology have revolutionized the way organisms are classified. This article traces the evolution of classification methods, from Linnaeus’ hierarchy to Darwin’s theory of evolution, and highlights modern phylogenetic techniques based on genetic data. However, the discussion also introduces the need for a reformulation of zoological classification to incorporate species interactions and ecological relationships, as proposed by Johann Friedrich Humboldt over 50 years before Darwin. Humboldt’s holistic view of nature, where species interact and co-evolve within ecosystems, offers valuable insights for understanding evolution as a collective process, shaping life on Earth as a unified organism. Embracing this perspective will help the next generation of scientists approach biodiversity and conservation with a deeper appreciation of species interdependence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b12eae7ba49362f7c318d00938a8c25f326ebfd15d6452b5ecf61192c662300","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
