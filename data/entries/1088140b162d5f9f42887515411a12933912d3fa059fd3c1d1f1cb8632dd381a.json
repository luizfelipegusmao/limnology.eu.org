{"title":"Arctic fishes reveal patterns in radiocarbon age across habitats and with recent climate change","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10442?af=R","date":1728032926000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change alters the sources and age of carbon in Arctic food webs by fostering the release of older carbon from degrading permafrost. Radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) traces carbon sources and age, but data before rapid warming are rare and limit assessments over time. We capitalized on <sup>14</sup>C data collected ~ 40 years ago that used fish as natural samplers by resampling the same species today. Among resampled fish, those using freshwater food webs had the oldest <sup>14</sup>C ages (&gt; 1000 yr BP), while those using marine food webs had the youngest <sup>14</sup>C ages (near modern). One migratory species encompassed the entire range of <sup>14</sup>C ages because juveniles fed in freshwater streams and adults fed in offshore marine habitats. Over ~ 40 yr, average <sup>14</sup>C ages of freshwater and marine feeding fish shifted closer to atmospheric values, suggesting a potential influence from “greening of the Arctic.”</p>","author":"Ashley E.
