{"title":"Peptide-Based Biomaterials for Combatting Infections and Improving Drug Delivery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1104/v1","date":1728933202000,"content":"Self-assembling peptides have emerged as promising materials for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications due to their unique biocompatibility, biodegradability, and multifunctionality. These properties make them ideal candidates for addressing the challenges posed by biofilm-associated infections linked to implanted medical devices. Additionally, these peptides can form a variety of nanostructures, including nanotubes, hydrogels, and nanosheets, which facilitate targeted drug delivery and enhance therapeutic efficacy. The successful translation of peptide-based materials into clinical applications is exemplified by products like RADA16 and lanreotide, which improve therapeutic outcomes and enhance patient compliance. Furthermore, the development of peptidomimetics extends the versatility of these materials across various biomedical applications. This review highlights the potential of peptide-based biomaterials as effective tools in combating infections and as innovative platforms for drug delivery, emphasising their significance in modern medical therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b435c4d0755f7f43cbf47f9c27096dc05e2e057a2cc04055d878c6f240c39fa4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
