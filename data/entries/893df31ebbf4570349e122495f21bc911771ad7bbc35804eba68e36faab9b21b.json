{"title":"A Study of Differential Topology on the Magnetically Induced Isotropically Averaged Lorentz Force Density of Few Simple MoleculesSupporting Information","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1367/v1","date":1721196684000,"content":"Quantum chemical topology addresses the study of the chemical structure by applying the tools of differential topology to scalar and vector fields obtained by quantum mechanics. Here the magnetically induced isotropically averaged Lorentz force density has been computed and topologically analysed for 11 small molecules. Critical points (attractors, repellers and saddles) have been determined and trajectories connecting the attractors have been computed. It is shown that kinds and numbers of the critical points are rather transferable in similar molecules. CC bonds of different order are endowed with critical points of different kind close to their centre. The long range behaviour of the force allows understanding the value of the sum of topological indices of the isolated critical points.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"893df31ebbf4570349e122495f21bc911771ad7bbc35804eba68e36faab9b21b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
