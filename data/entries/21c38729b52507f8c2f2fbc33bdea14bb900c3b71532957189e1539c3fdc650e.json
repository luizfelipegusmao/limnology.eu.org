{"title":"Arabidopsis pollen prolyl-hydroxylases P4H4/6 are relevant for correct hydroxylation and secretion of LRX11 in pollen tubes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4415/7693755?rss=1","date":1718409600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Major constituents of the plant cell walls are structural proteins that belong to the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) family. Leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) proteins contain a leucine-rich domain and a C-terminal domain with repetitive Ser–Pro<sub>3–5</sub> motifs that are potentially to be <span>O</span>-glycosylated. It has been demonstrated that pollen-specific LRX8–LRX11 from <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> are necessary to maintain the integrity of the pollen tube cell wall during polarized growth. In HRGPs, including classical extensins (EXTs), and probably in LRXs, proline residues are converted to hydroxyproline by prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4Hs), thus defining novel <span>O</span>-glycosylation sites. In this context, we aimed to determine whether hydroxylation and subsequent <span>O</span>-glycosylation of Arabidopsis pollen LRXs are necessary for their proper function and cell wall localization in pollen tubes. We hypothesized that pollen-expressed P4H4 and P4H6 catalyze the hydroxylation of the proline units present in Ser–Pro<sub>3–5</sub> motifs of LRX8–LRX11. Here, we show that the <span>p4h4-1 p4h6-1</span> double mutant exhibits a reduction in pollen germination rates and a slight reduction in pollen tube length. Pollen germination is also inhibited by P4H inhibitors, suggesting that prolyl hydroxylation is required for pollen tube development. Plants expressing <span>pLRX11::LRX11-GFP</span> in the <span>p4h4-1 p4h6-1</span> background show partial re-localization of LRX11–green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the pollen tube tip apoplast to the cytoplasm. Finally, immunoprecipitation-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed a decrease in oxidized prolines (hydroxyprolines) in LRX11–GFP in the <span>p4h4-1 p4h6-1</span> background compared with <span>lrx11</span> plants expressing <span>pLRX11::LRX11-GFP</span>. Taken together, these results suggest that P4H4 and P4H6 are required for pollen germination and for proper hydroxylation of LRX11 necessary for its localization in the cell wall of pollen tubes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"21c38729b52507f8c2f2fbc33bdea14bb900c3b71532957189e1539c3fdc650e","category":"Environment"}
