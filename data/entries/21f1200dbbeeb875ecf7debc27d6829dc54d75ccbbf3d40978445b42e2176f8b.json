This study explores the multifaceted impacts of 5G, focusing on its influence on customer experiences, operational efficiency, and supply chain management. The integration of 5G enables advanced technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), significantly enhancing the interactivity and personalization of the shopping experience. Real-time data collection and analysis, facilitated by 5G, allow for more precise inventory management and optimized store operations, leading to improved customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs. In the supply chain domain, 5G technology offers enhanced visibility and control through real-time tracking and environmental monitoring, which improves logistics efficiency and product quality management. Despite these advancements, the adoption of 5G technology involves considerable challenges, including high infrastructure costs, data security concerns, and global disparities in technology deployment. Businesses must navigate these obstacles while leveraging the benefits of 5G to achieve competitive advantage. The study also highlights the role of 5G in integrating with other advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, to drive further innovation. Additionally, 5G supports sustainability efforts by optimizing energy use and reducing waste. Overall, the successful implementation of 5G requires strategic investment and adaptability, but it holds the potential to revolutionize retail and supply chain operations, enhancing efficiency, customer engagement, and sustainability in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"21f1200dbbeeb875ecf7debc27d6829dc54d75ccbbf3d40978445b42e2176f8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
