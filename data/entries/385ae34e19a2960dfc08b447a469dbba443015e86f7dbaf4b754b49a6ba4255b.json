{"title":"Conjunctival Melanoma: A Clinical Review and Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1752/v1","date":1721658401000,"content":"Conjunctival melanoma (Co-M) is an aggressive, invasive eye and eyelid cancer. Its global inci-dence of ~1 in a million is increasing at a rate ratio of ~1.4, but this rises sharply in over 65-year-olds. Although rare, Co-M has a devastating impact on the lives of those who develop it. Co-M is often misdiagnosed or overlooked leading to vision loss either from destructive effects of the tumour or side effects of therapy, facial disfigurement from radical surgery, and death from metastases. Due to its rarity, there is limited evidence for diagnosis and management; hence, there is no standardised treatment and not all cases are referred to a specialised ocular oncology centre. Recent progress in cancer immunology and genetics have revolutionised treatment of cutaneous melanoma, which share some similarities to Co-M.  A better understanding of Co-M and its precursor lesions is urgently needed to lead the development of novel targeted and immuno-therapies both for local tumour control and disseminated disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive clinical overview of the current knowledge of Co-M, its epidemiology, pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, management, and recent advances in novel biological therapies for personalised treatment of this disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"385ae34e19a2960dfc08b447a469dbba443015e86f7dbaf4b754b49a6ba4255b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
