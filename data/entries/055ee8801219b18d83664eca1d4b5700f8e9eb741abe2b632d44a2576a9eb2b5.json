{"title":"Seasonal variation in the population structure and production of the copepod Calanus sinicus in the Yellow Sea","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/46/1/86/7504770?rss=1","date":1704326400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We estimated the total production of <span>Calanus sinicus</span> over four seasons by measuring somatic and egg production rates in the Yellow Sea. In the process of measuring somatic production, the length–weight relationship and growth rates of <span>C. sinicus</span> in this region were also derived. The population abundance and biomass of <span>C. sinicus</span> were especially high in spring. All copepodite stages had similar proportions in spring, whereas the late stages and adults were most common in summer. The mean total production of the <span>C. sinicus</span> population was 107.6–259.7 μg C m<sup>−3</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>, ranging from higher values in spring to lower values in summer. The annual total production of <span>C. sinicus</span> in the Yellow Sea was 64.3 mg C m<sup>−3</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> (4032 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>). The production of <span>C. sinicus</span> was positively correlated with chlorophyll <span>a</span> concentration, rather than water temperature or salinity. This study is the first to quantify the secondary production of <span>C. sinicus</span> in the Yellow Sea. These findings will broaden our understanding of the ecology of <span>C. sinicus</span> and its contribution to the Yellow Sea food web.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plankton Research Current Issue","siteHash":"76dddc2a9ba5dfb3490083b30b542d64431810a1f59aa42d49b14d3439ebc9c8","entryHash":"055ee8801219b18d83664eca1d4b5700f8e9eb741abe2b632d44a2576a9eb2b5","category":"Environment"}
