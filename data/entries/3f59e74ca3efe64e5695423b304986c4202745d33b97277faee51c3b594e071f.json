{"title":"Programming Language Engineering&mdash;a Review of Text Processing Language Design, Implementation and Evaluation Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0636/v1","date":1728455748000,"content":"Programming languages drive most if not all of modern problem-  solving using computational methods and power. Research into new  programming languages and methods is essential to the furthering or  improvement of computational problem-solving by making the design,  implementation, and application of automation to general or particu-  lar problem-solving ever easier, more accessible, and more performant.  General-purpose Programming Languages (GPLs) typically are designed  to be purely domain agnostic—meaning they can be applied in any ﬁeld,  for any kind of problem. However, this typically also makes them hard  and diﬃcult to apply in problems where non-programmers or even ex-  perts with little or no GPL programming skills are required to leverage  programmatic problem solving capabilities, which is why Domain Speciﬁc  Languages (DSLs) come into play; they are generally more ﬁne-tuned to-  wards improving human productivity and performance than that of the  machine, while making solving particular, domain-oriented problems sim-  pler. In this paper, we review the literature concerning how to design and  then fully implement a new DSL, with special focus on a DSL for generic  problem-solving leveraging Text Processing methods—essentially, a Text  Processing Language (TPL). We consider leveraging the design research  paradigm and philosophy as a systematic framework for guiding research  into the development of new TPLs. This work presents for the ﬁrst time,  new unifying theory concerning general, but also TPL-speciﬁc language  engineering theory and guiding frameworks—UPLT, PLEF &amp; PLEf. We  consider quantitative but also qualitative evaluation of programming lan-  guages. The SOE framework is re-introduced for this purpose too. Finally,  we set the pace for future theoretical and practical research into the ﬁeld  of programming language engineering especially with focus on TPLs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f59e74ca3efe64e5695423b304986c4202745d33b97277faee51c3b594e071f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
