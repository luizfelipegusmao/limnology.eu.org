{"title":"Harnessing Chitosan Beads as an Immobilization Matrix for nZVI for the Treatment of Cr(VI) Contaminated Laboratory Residue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0850/v1","date":1726067256000,"content":"Nanocomposites (NCs) consisting of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) immobilized in chitosan (CS) were prepared and employed, for the removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from both synthetic and real wastewater. Medium (MCS) and high (HCS) molecular weight chitosan and stabilization with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and different nZVI load were explored. Characterization through Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) revealed millimeter-sized spheres with micrometer-sized nZVI clusters randomly distributed. Better nanoparticle dispersion was observed in NCs from the CMC-MCS and HCS combinations. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated that CS binds to Fe(II) or Fe(III) on the surface of nZVI through its functional groups -CONH-, -N-H and -C-OH and through the -COO- functional group of CMC, forming a bidentate bridge complex. Through experiments with synthetic waters, it was found that the elimination of Cr(VI) is favored by lowering the pH, obtaining the maximum percentage of Cr(VI) removal at pH 5.5. With real waters, it was shown that increasing the mass of NCs also improves the removal of Cr(VI), following a pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetics. The synthesized materials show great potential for applications in environmental remediation, showing good efficiency in the removal of Cr(VI) in wastewater.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e23ea5db2b0666dce7527fb1b19f77541d1a8f673416de03b2ade658f573b300","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
