{"title":"14 Effects of increasing daily dietary standardized ileal digestible lysine intake of gilts and sows during d 35 to 112 of gestation on reproductive performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/65/7664859?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Our objective was to determine the effects of increasing daily dietary standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine (Lys) intake during d 35 to 112 of gestation on sow and litter performance. A total of 704 gilts and sows (PIC Camborough) were used. Females were group-housed after d 35 of gestation and individually fed with electronic sow feeders (ESF). At d 35 of gestation, females were balanced for body weight (BW) and caliper scores within parity categories, and randomly allotted to 1 of 4 treatments. Treatments consisted of increasing daily dietary SID Lys intake (11.1, 13.5, 16.1, and 18.5 g/d). Both gilts and sows received 2.37 kg/d of a gestation diet containing 3.17 Mcal of ME/kg, which was estimated to avoid feeding females below their maintenance requirements throughout the entire gestation. Treatments were achieved by different blend of low (0.47% SID Lys) and high (0.78% SID Lys) Lys diets via ESF based on the set feed allowance for females. Sow was the experimental unit and data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with the lmer and glmerfunctions of R, considering treatment, parity, and their interaction as fixed effects. There was no evidence (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) of treatment and parity interaction for any response criteria. Body weight at d 112 of gestation and BW change from d 35 to 112 of gestation increased (linear; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) with increasing daily dietary SID Lys intake (Table 1). No evidence for SID Lys treatment differences were observed for BW at weaning or BW change during lactation (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). There was no evidence (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) for treatment differences on caliper score (CS) at d 35 of gestation, d 112 of gestation, at weaning, or CS changes during gestation and lactation. There was no evidence for treatment difference on total born, percentage stillbirth and percentage of mummified fetuses (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). However, there was a marginal reduction in percentage born alive piglets (quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.056), with the least proportion of piglets born alive observed in females receiving 16.1g of daily SID Lys intake from d35 to d112 of gestation. Increasing daily dietary SID Lys intake during d 35 to 112 of gestation did not affect piglet birth weight, piglet average daily gain during lactation, proportion of removed pigs, and proportion of dead pigs during lactation. In summary, increasing daily dietary SID Lys intake during d35-to-112 of gestation increased female BW; however, no evidence of benefits was observed for female reproductive performance and litter performance during lactation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5ae0b6d0369e9f5c249d7776f66ba84cfd62d91e735545b4479de4a56b408c55","category":"Environment"}
