{"title":"Phaeocystis: A Global Enigma","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-marine-022223-025031?TRACK=RSS","date":1705449600000,"content":"<div><p>The genus <span>Phaeocystis</span> is globally distributed, with blooms commonly occurring on continental shelves. This unusual phytoplankter has two major morphologies: solitary cells and cells embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Only colonies form blooms. Their large size (commonly 2 mm but up to 3 cm) and mucilaginous envelope allow the colonies to escape predation, but data are inconsistent as to whether colonies are grazed. Cultured <span>Phaeocystis</span> can also inhibit the growth of co-occurring phytoplankton or the feeding of potential grazers. Colonies and solitary cells use nitrate as a nitrogen source, although solitary cells can also grow on ammonium. <span>Phaeocystis</span> colonies might be a major contributor to carbon flux to depth, but in most cases, colonies are rapidly remineralized in the upper 300 m. The occurrence of large <span>Phaeocystis</span> blooms is often associated with environments with low and highly variable light and high nitrate levels, with <span>Phaeocystis antarctica</span> blooms being linked additionally to high iron availability. Emerging results indicate that different clones of <span>Phaeocystis</span> have substantial genetic plasticity, which may explain its appearance in a variety of environments. Given the evidence of <span>Phaeocystis</span> appearing in new systems, this trend will likely continue in the near future.</p></div>","author":"Walker O.
