{"title":"ELONGATED HYPOTCOTYL5 and SPINE BASE SIZE1 together mediate light-regulated spine expansion in cucumber","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/552/7577636?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant trichome development is influenced by diverse developmental and environmental signals, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not well understood in most plant species. Fruit spines (trichomes) are an important trait in cucumber (<span>Cucumis sativus</span> L.), as they affect both fruit smoothness and commercial quality. Spine Base Size1 (CsSBS1) has been identified as essential for regulating fruit spine size in cucumber. Here, we discovered that CsSBS1 controls a season-dependent phenotype of spine base size in wild-type plants. Decreased light intensity led to reduced expression of <span>CsSBS1</span> and smaller spine base size in wild-type plants, but not in the mutants with <span>CsSBS1</span> deletion. Additionally, knockout of <span>CsSBS1</span> resulted in smaller fruit spine base size and eliminated the light-induced expansion of spines. Overexpression of <span>CsSBS1</span> increased spine base size and rescued the decrease in spine base size under low light conditions. Further analysis revealed that ELONGATED HYPOTCOTYL5 (HY5), a major transcription factor involved in light signaling pathways, directly binds to the promoter of <span>CsSBS1</span> and activates its expression. Knockout of <span>CsHY5</span> led to smaller fruit spine base size and abolished the light-induced expansion of spines. Taken together, our study findings have clarified a CsHY5â€“CsSBS1 regulatory module that mediates light-regulated spine expansion in cucumber. This finding offers a strategy for cucumber breeders to develop fruit with stable appearance quality under changing light conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d4e9805be67984702ee17c141c2beed817cbdd76a8da1130cb7b666856358669","category":"Environment"}
