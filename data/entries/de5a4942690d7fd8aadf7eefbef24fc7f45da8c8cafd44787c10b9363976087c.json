This includes research and clinical diagnostic TEM and is especially true with the recent explosive growth of volume EM, which uniquely provides molecular-resolution structural biology in near-millimeter volumes while enabling correlative light and x-ray microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.491-B1\">1-4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"de5a4942690d7fd8aadf7eefbef24fc7f45da8c8cafd44787c10b9363976087c","category":"Environment"}
