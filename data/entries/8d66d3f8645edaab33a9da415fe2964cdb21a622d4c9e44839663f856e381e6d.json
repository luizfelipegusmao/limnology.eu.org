{"title":"UAV-Assisted THz-VLC Communication Systems: An In-depth Performance Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1871/v1","date":1716960914000,"content":"This paper investigates the performance of dual hop UAV-assisted communication channels, employing a decode and forward relay architecture. The system utilizes Terahertz (THz) communication in the primary hop and Visible Light Communication (VLC) in the secondary hop. We conduct a\nthorough analysis by deriving closed-form expressions for end to end bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, we employ a Monte Carlo approach to generate best fitting curves and validate our numerical expressions with simulation results. Evaluation via BER and outage probability demonstrates the proposed systemâ€™s effectiveness. The outcomes of this research offer valuable insights into the feasibility and limitations of UAV-assisted THz-\nVLC systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d66d3f8645edaab33a9da415fe2964cdb21a622d4c9e44839663f856e381e6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
