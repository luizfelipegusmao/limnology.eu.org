{"title":"Development of a Herb-Based Dietary Ingredient with Potential Nootropic Properties: From Bench to Bedside","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2075/v1","date":1727335323000,"content":"Brain health is a matter of great importance as we age, where memory loss and other cognitive declines become slowly apparent. There are numerous natural solutions, called nootropics, that can help mitigate this natural process. While some, such as ginkgo biloba, have been traditionally used for centuries, in many cases there is a lack of scientific evidence on their potential mechanisms and efficacy. To this end, the objective of the current study is to evaluate and compare several standardized herb extracts with potential nootropic effects, and from this analysis develop a formula and confirm its effect in healthy volunteers with mild cognitive impairment. A total of 9 standardized herb extracts were chosen based on previous scientific evidence and tested in human neural stem cell cultures exposed to oxidative stress. The expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), NRF2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also analyzed. As a result, it was observed that an extract from Salvia officinalis revealed to have the most noticeable effect among the herbs analyzed. In further tests it was confirmed that its combination with rutin, a phenolic compound with potential nootropic effects, increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, as well as inhibiting acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity. Finally, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted, testing the effects of the combination at two different doses, for 12 weeks, in healthy volunteers aged 50+ with mild cognitive impairment. Two questionnaires were applied, the MoCA and ADAS-Cog. As a result, both doses significantly improved several characteristics related to memory, particularly memory recall, with a more noticeable effect in the higher dose. Therefore, the results suggest that the long-term intake, at least 6-12 weeks, of a natural herb blend comprised of Salvia officinalis and rutin can help improve certain brain health-related parameters in healthy subjects with mild cognitive impairment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c20839b52cd0c09231f03c03764afb9dbd154cad9f138d902c8a39bd24f6182a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
