We assessed species boundaries in the <span>P. tharos</span> group using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, focusing on sampling in western Canada, where 4 species (<span>P. tharos</span>, <span>P. cocyta</span>, <span>P. batesii</span>, and <span>P. pulchella</span>) have classically been recognized. Phylogenetic and cluster-based analyses confirm that there are indeed 4 species based on the maintenance of genomic integrity in the presence of occasional hybridization and low levels of gene flow. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) does not consistently distinguish species, with haplotypes extensively shared between species. Limited sampling of <span>P. batesii</span> indicates complex boundaries and interactions with other <span>Phyciodes</span>, especially with <span>P. pulchella</span> and <span>P. cocyta.</span> This study demonstrates the power of a genome-wide perspective to elucidate the integrity of boundaries between recently diverged species that remain capable of occasional hybridization.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Insect Systematics and Diversity Current Issue","siteHash":"d4d59e2090793e303021830a9c164d689828dc5448b6052be7ec32e87f45cab0","entryHash":"ea51f6d2c8d0063a7ab51a72100309d9c203498f1c08250aac579d0ed3ca624e","category":"Environment"}
