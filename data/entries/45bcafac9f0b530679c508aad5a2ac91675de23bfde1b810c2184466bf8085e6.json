{"title":"Case Report: Successful Treatment of Solitary Fibrous Tumor with Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0428/v1","date":1728381908000,"content":"This case report describes the innovative treatment of a 73-year-old woman with a Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) using Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 resin microspheres. SFTs are rare tumors that pose significant treatment challenges, particularly in cases of recurrence or when the disease has metastasized. Systemic therapies often have limited effectiveness. In this case, the patient initially presented with a pelvic mass that was surgically resected, but she later developed metastatic disease in the liver. After experiencing severe side effects from targeted therapy with sunitinib, SIRT was chosen as an alternative treatment. Remarkably, the patient achieved substantial tumor reduction and symptom relief following this novel intervention. To our knowledge and following extensive literature search, this is the first documented instance of treating SFT with SIRT. It provides new insights into its potential as a therapeutic strategy, especially for cases where conventional treatments are inadequate or cause intolerable side effects. The success of SIRT, in this case, highlights its potential as a less invasive, locally targeted treatment option and may offer new hope for patients with similar conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45bcafac9f0b530679c508aad5a2ac91675de23bfde1b810c2184466bf8085e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
