We report the synthesis of 15 novel analogs utilizing a strategic approach focused on intermediate diversification. Key intermediates, (Z)-5-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-ylmethylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione <b>5a</b> and (Z)-5-(benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-ylmethylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione <b>5b</b>, were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation and acetal formation reactions, respectively. Subsequent N-alkylation reactions provided a platform for introducing diverse functionalities and exploring structure–activity relationships to optimize the medicinal chemistry profile of these novel compounds. The synthesized compounds were tested against various human cancer cell lines, including for breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-453), lung (A549), and prostate (PC-3) cancers, using an MTT assay. Compounds <b>8c</b> and <b>10g</b> emerged as particularly promising, exhibiting activity against all tested cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 3.41 ± 0.51 and 40 μM. These compounds also induced apoptosis, suggesting that they inhibit cell proliferation through this cell death pathway. Moreover, relative molecular docking studies provided evidence that compound <b>8c</b> likely functions by intercalating with DNA.</p>","author":"Kiran Kumar Vunnam, \nNaresh Kumar Katari, \nNagalakshmi Jeedimalla, \nRambabu Gundla, \nJayaprakash Kanijam Raghupathi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"007b231e0a156266022d103a2813a87623bffac5c930e80dfb71b92f8c827142","category":"Environment"}
