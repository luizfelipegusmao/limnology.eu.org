While laws governing individual movement trajectories and population flows across locations have been extensively studied, the predictability of population-level mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic driven by specific activities such as work, shopping, and recreation remains elusive. Here we analyze mobility data for six place categories at the US county level from 2020 February 15 to 2021 November 23 and measure how the predictability of these mobility metrics changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantify the time-varying predictability in each place category using an information-theoretic metric, permutation entropy. We find disparate predictability patterns across place categories over the course of the pandemic, suggesting differential behavioral changes in human activities perturbed by disease outbreaks. Notably, predictability change in foot traffic to residential locations is mostly in the opposite direction to other mobility categories. Specifically, visits to residences had the highest predictability during stay-at-home orders in March 2020, while visits to other location types had low predictability during this period. This pattern flipped after the lifting of restrictions during summer 2020. We identify four key factors, including weather conditions, population size, COVID-19 case growth, and government policies, and estimate their nonlinear effects on mobility predictability. Our findings provide insights on how people change their behaviors during public health emergencies and may inform improved interventions in future epidemics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"27604e0c30d096a5bc8bf5b6a0d8884204ee0faa26ee1ec00cc6f7cd1beceab2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
