{"title":"Light-driven dynamics: unravelling thiol-redox networks in plants through proteomics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1111/7606716?rss=1","date":1707696000000,"content":"<span>Unlike animals, plants cannot hunt for prey or seek shelter; instead, they use photosynthesis by harvesting the energy from sunlight to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into biomass, allowing them to grow and spread. Owing to their sessile nature, plants have evolved ingenious mechanisms to protect themselves from too much sunlight and to adapt their metabolism to fluctuating environmental conditions. One of the mechanisms is the thiol-based redox regulation of protein activities, an ancient and evolutionary conserved mechanism of post-translational modification. Thiol groups of cysteine residues in proteins form disulfide bonds when oxidized, but this bond is broken into two thiol groups upon reduction by a group of small proteins called thioredoxins (Trxs) (<a href=\"#kiae076-F1\">Fig. 1A</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ebcf4e286588852acc03278fde5bf56b2ab51d6fe6bfb7f27764300108af75d2","category":"Environment"}
