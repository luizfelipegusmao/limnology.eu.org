{"title":"Spatio-temporal evolution of sports tourism industry integration: A empirical analysis of Xinjiang in China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300959","date":1712757600000,"content":"<p>by Ke Zhang, Xuehui Mei, Zhengqing Xiao</p>\r\n\r\nSince the issuance of the \"Guiding Opinions on Vigorously Developing Sports Tourism\" in 2016, the integration of sports and tourism has become a strategy in regional economic development. It creates new economic growth points, enhances local images, and promotes cultural communication. In the context of the \"Tourism Makes Xinjiang Thrive\" strategy, quantitatively investigating the integration of the sports and tourism industries helps people to better understand their interaction which can serve as the valuable input in policy-making for the comprehensive development of a region. This paper uses entropy weight method, stochastic frontier analysis and coupling coordination model to quantitatively analyze the effect of sports tourism industry integration in Xinjiang from the perspective of integration path. Meanwhile, the Dagum Gini coefficient and nuclear density estimation were used to analyze the regional differences and dynamic evolution of industrial integration quality. The result shows that (1) The sports and tourism integration quality in Xinjiang has not reached the optimal goal of complete integration. In the process of mutual industrial promotion, tourism promotes a higher degree of integration with the sports industry. (2) The industrial integration quality shows a phenomenon of “imbalance and inadequacy” among the regions. The regions with high quality of industrial integration were Urumqi, Ili, Kashgar, Altay and Changji, which have rich sports tourism resources. (3) The overall spatial difference in the quality of industrial integration presented a fluctuation downtrend. The difference between the tourism industrial belts was very significant.","author":"Ke Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2d2e88317fe15033e7325904c09024d0f1ea3c4daa661402ef34a10ef0ba28ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
