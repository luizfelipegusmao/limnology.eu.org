{"title":"China’s logistics evolution: A study of development characteristics and catalytic effects on economic growth","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309737","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Fuwei Qiao, Qinzhe Yang, Wei Shi, Xuedi Yang, Wei Ma, Lulu Zhao, Guanwen Ouyang</p>\r\n\r\nThe impact of logistics development on the economy covers many aspects, such as production, cost, employment, international trade, etc. It is an indispensable part of the modern economy, which helps to improve overall economic efficiency and social prosperity. This study studies the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution characteristics of China’s logistics development from 2008 to 2018 and explores its impact on economic growth in multiple dimensions of time and space. The research findings indicate the following: (1) From 2008 to 2018, China’s logistics development level (LDL) exhibited a clear upward trend. The differences between the eastern, central, and western regions showed fluctuating downward patterns, ultimately converging towards a high-level concentration. Concerning spatial distribution, China’s logistics development demonstrated a trend towards the west and south. However, the spatial pattern of \"strong in the east and weak in the west \" has existed for a long time. Moreover, the \"T-shaped\" pattern between coastal provinces and those along the Yangtze River Basin deepened, and the LDL in the central and western regions significantly improved. (2) The advancement of China’s LDL effectively promotes its economic growth, confirming that the Belt and Road Initiative enhances the role of logistics development in driving economic growth. Regarding regional differences, logistics development positively influences economic growth in the eastern and western regions, with a less significant impact on the central region. Regarding the strength of influence, logistics development has a more substantial effect on promoting high-ranking provinces in the entire country, the eastern region, and the central region, as well as boosting economic growth in low-ranking provinces in the western region.","author":"Fuwei Qiao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0f9301fa968dd9b331245c4be4e5866e08070b4b2b6ce15076cb6f75b9030483","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
