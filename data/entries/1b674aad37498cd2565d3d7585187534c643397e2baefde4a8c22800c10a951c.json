{"title":"Productivity enhancement techniques for tubular solar stillâ€”A review","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14345?af=R","date":1715141849000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Access to safe drinking water remains a global challenge, primarily due to the prevalence of water contamination in various regions. Numerous methods have been explored to address this issue and convert polluted water into potable sources. However, the cost associated with these methods often hinders their widespread adoption. Solar distillation, harnessed by abundant solar energy, emerges as a promising and sustainable solution. Although solar distillation technology has made significant advancements in recent years, the endeavor to boost its efficiency remains a substantial challenge. Typically, solar stills yield between 4 and 6 liters of fresh water per square meter of solar still per day under ideal circumstances. Notably, both single-basin and double-basin solar stills have been extensively researched to discover methods for enhancing their productivity. A notable innovation in this field, the tubular solar still (TSS), has gained recognition for its capacity to improve productivity. The present review article systematically examines the development of efficient and cost-effective solar distillation systems on a global scale. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature pertaining to techniques employed to enhance TSS performance. The study categorizes these techniques, conducts in-depth evaluations of both experimental and simulation studies, and offers a meticulous comparison of various strategies to optimize TSS functionality. Furthermore, the article identifies existing research gaps and puts forth prospective directions for advancing TSS efficiency.</p>","author":"Ritesh Krishna Sambare, \nSatish Kumar Dewangan, \nPankaj Kumar Gupta, \nSandeep Joshi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"1b674aad37498cd2565d3d7585187534c643397e2baefde4a8c22800c10a951c","category":"Environment"}
