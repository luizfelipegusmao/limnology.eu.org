{"title":"Symposium summary: epigenetic inheritance—impact for biology and society 23–25 August 2023, Zürich, Switzerland","link":"https://academic.oup.com/eep/article/doi/10.1093/eep/dvae002/7630448?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The possibility that acquired traits can be transmitted across generations has been the subject of intense research in the past decades. This biological process is of major interest to many scientists and has profound implications for biology and society but has complex mechanisms and is therefore challenging to study. Because it involves factors independent from the DNA sequence, this form of heredity is classically referred to as epigenetic inheritance. Many studies have examined how life experiences and various environmental factors can cause phenotypes that are heritable and be manifested in subsequent generations. Recognizing the major importance and complexity of this research, the fourth edition of the Epigenetic Inheritance Symposium Zürich brought together experts from diverse disciplines to address current questions in the field of epigenetic inheritance and present recent findings. The symposium had sessions dedicated to epidemiological evidence and animal models, transmission mechanisms, methodologies and the far-reaching impact on society and evolution. This report summarizes the talks of speakers and describes additional activities offered during the symposium including poster sessions and an art competition on the topic of epigenetic inheritance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Epigenetics Current Issue","siteHash":"5549213f473d96cee0cf7ca1db1da1a69239cc267977bfd813fd34781f2cddbb","entryHash":"f52f001e2d4f65925c3c4bd1c7027fed389035c47abaecf5488d8ecc5198aadc","category":"Environment"}
