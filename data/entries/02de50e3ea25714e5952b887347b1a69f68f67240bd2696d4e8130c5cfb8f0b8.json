{"title":"Application of Fixed Frequency Ultrasound in the Cultivation of S. cerevisiae for Rice Wine Fermentation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13465?af=R","date":1710943137000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Rice wine fermentation is limited by its long fermentation time, weak taste, and unpleasant flavors such as oil and odor. In this study, a novel ultrasound technology of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> was used with the aim of improving fermentation efficiency and volatile flavor quality of RW.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results showed that fixed frequency ultrasonic treatment (28 kHz, 45 W/L, 20 min) of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> seed culture at its logarithmic metaphase significantly increased the biomass and alcohol yield by 31.58% and 26.45%, respectively, and reduced fermentation time by nearly 2â€‰days. Flavor analysis indicated that the flavor compounds in RW, specifically the esters and alcohols, were also increased in quantity after the ultrasonic treatment of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> seed liquid. The isobutyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate and phenethyl acetate contents were increased by 78.92, 129.19, 7.79 and 97.84%, respectively, as compared to the control.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results show that ultrasonic treatment of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> reduced fermentation time and enhanced the flavor profile of RW. This study can provide the theoretical and/or technological basis for the research and development of RW.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
