{"title":"Relationship between Sleep Disturbances and Chronic Pain: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0272/v1","date":1725509147000,"content":"Sleep disturbances and chronic pain are prevalent and interrelated conditions that significantly impact individuals' quality of life. Understanding the intricate dynamics between sleep and pain is crucial for developing effective treatments that enhance the well-being of affected individuals and reduce the economic burden of these debilitating conditions. This narrative review examines the complex relationship between sleep disturbances and chronic pain. We describe the prevalence and types of sleep disturbances and sleep disorders in chronic pain patients. Posteriorly we critically review the clinical and experimental evidence investigating the relationship between sleep disturbances and chronic pain aiming to clarify the impact of chronic pain on sleep and, conversely, the impact of sleep disturbances on pain perception. We conclude that a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances is almost a consensus in the literature, however, the strength of each direction of the association is less clear. As of now, the literature suggests that sleep impairment is a stronger predictor of pain than pain is a predictor of sleep impairment. Additionally, addressing sleep disturbances in chronic pain patients is crucial, as poor sleep has been linked to higher levels of disability, depression, and pain-related catastrophizing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db9462fea8612a6fe445c248e8c9a83daac06b359f0f57b5f557bc6066867b72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
