{"title":"Instagram Helped to Reveal That Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) Was the Main Vector of Chikungunya Virus (ECSA-Genotype) and Presented High Frequencies of kdr Mutations during an Explosive Outbreak in Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0009/v1","date":1714526702000,"content":"The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) presents global health challenges, with Brazil witnessing out-breaks since its introduction in 2014. In 2023, Minas Gerais (MG) experienced a CHIKV outbreak, prompting entomological investigations to identify vectors, viral lineages, and assess insecticide resistance. This study utilized social media platforms and citizen science concept to conduct a comprehensive entomological survey. Following Instagram posts, residents with CHIKV sus-pected cases were able to schedule mosquito aspirations. During the aspirations, 421 mosquitoes (165 Aedes aegypti and 256 Culex quinquefasciatus) were captured from 40 households in Salinas city (MG) and tested for Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses through RT-qPCR. Twelve out 57 pools (10 of Ae. aegypti and 2 of Cx. quinquefasciatus) tested positive for CHIKV RNA. Viral RNA was also detected in the heads of 9 Ae. aegypti individuals (but not in Cx. quinquefasciatus). Genome sequencing revealed that CHIKV belonged to the East-Central-South-Africa (ECSA) genotype. Additionally, genetic analyses revealed high frequencies of kdr alleles, suggesting resistant to pyrethroids insecticides in this Ae. aegypti population. These findings emphasize the urgent need for innovative vector study and control strategies to combat arbovirus transmission, and inter-disciplinary approaches in public health interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72608f478035bfbfbc132ab9950bd7d5ee8c441894ec19757d88eb45d944b20c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
