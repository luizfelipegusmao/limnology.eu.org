{"title":"Establishment of a tumor-associated fibroblast associated gene score based on scRNA-seq to predict prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311801","date":1729173600000,"content":"<p>by Hao Yu, Ziqi Peng, Xing Li, Yiqi Zhang</p>\r\n\r\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) is emerging as a tool for the development of improved patient prognosis and the development of novel antitumor drugs. As the most important stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in the development of TNBC. The rise of single-cell sequencing technology has facilitated our study of the various cell types in TME. In this study, we interpreted the heterogeneity of TNBCs from the perspective of tumor-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment based on the TNBC single-cell sequencing dataset GSE118389, in the hope of providing help for individualised treatment. Combining the TCGA database and the GSE103091 dataset, four genes associated with CAFs in TNBC (CERCAM, KLF10, ECM1,HGF) were identified using the R package Seurat as well as correlation consensus clustering analysis. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR, WB and IHC experiments confirmed their expression in TNBC. Based on these genes, CAFs Score was established and validated to correlate with the prognosis of patients with TNBC, with patients in the high score group surviving significantly worse than those in the low score group (P&lt;0.001). In addition, there were significant differences in immune cell infiltration and expression of immune checkpoints between the high and low scoring groups. Compared to Stage I &amp; II, the CAFs Score was higher in Stage III &amp; IV TNBC patients (P = 0.043) and higher in N1-3 TNBC patients than in N0 TNBC patients (P = 0.035). EMT scores were higher within the high CAFs Score group (P = 1.4e-11) and there was a positive correlation between Stemness Score and CAFs Score (R = 0.61, P = 3.6e-09). Drug sensitivity analysis combining the GSE128099 showed a higher sensitivity to Gemcitabine in the low CAFs Score group (P = 0.0048). We speculate that these four CAFs-related genes are likely to be involved in regulating gemcitabine resistance in TNBC patients.","author":"Hao Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4192f165989bab29e96fde8dca12c9e9c08ae5fbe70459c26b58339af78a58b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
