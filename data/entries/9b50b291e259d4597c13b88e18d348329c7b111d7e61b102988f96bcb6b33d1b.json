{"title":"Spatial and temporal recruitment variability of sandy subtidal megabenthic populations on an open coastline influenced by a tsunami caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12801?af=R","date":1710849852000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The spatial distribution and size structure of two infaunal filter-feeding bivalves, that is, Sakhalin surf clam <i>Spisula sachalinensis</i> (Schrenck, 1862) and dwarf sunray surf clam <i>Mactra crossei</i> (Dunker, 1877), and an epibenthic deposit feeder, namely the sand dollar <i>Scaphechinus mirabilis</i> (A. Agassiz, 1864), were investigated on an open sandy beach in northern Japan after the tsunami caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Settlement of <i>S. sachalinensis</i> was relatively abundant in the 2011- and 2012-year classes, but then substantially decreased until the early months of 2013. The 0+-year-old distribution was associated mainly with a depth gradient and weakly with the median grain size of the sediment. <i>Mactra crossei</i> had (1) an inverse trend in long-shore variation in abundance at 2+ years of age and (2) later-post-settlement processes that regulated its population dynamics, compared to those of <i>S. sachalinensis</i>. The 2010-year classes for both Mactridae species survived until 2+ years of age, although their abundance showed a high level of spatial variation. <i>Scaphechinus mirabilis</i> showed fine-scale spatial variation in their recruitment dynamics. The cross-shore distribution of <i>S. mirabilis</i> showed a clear ontogenetic shift from shallow to deep water. The cross-shore distribution of small <i>S. mirabilis</i> (&lt;40 mm in test diameter) overlapped that of the juvenile <i>S. sachalinensis</i>, but their interaction was unclear. Overall, the level of spatial and temporal recruitment variation was relatively high in each species. However, the tsunami has scarcely influenced the cross-shore distribution and population structure of each species.</p>","author":"Daisuke Sugiura, \nShotaro Fukui‐Hashizume, \nHideki Noro, \nYoshikazu Fujikawa","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"9b50b291e259d4597c13b88e18d348329c7b111d7e61b102988f96bcb6b33d1b","category":"Environment"}
