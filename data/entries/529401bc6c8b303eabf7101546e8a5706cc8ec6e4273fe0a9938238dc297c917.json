While MITs are usually accompanied by a structural transition, a key question in many systems is whether the transition is electronically or structurally driven and – particularly for device applications where switching speeds are critical – whether the transitions can be decoupled [<a href=\"#ozae044.695-B2\">2</a>]. One such heavily-studied model system with concurrent structural and electronic transition is the rare-earth nickelate perovskites, in which the MIT is thought to be strongly dependent on structural parameters such as bond angle [<a href=\"#ozae044.695-B3\">3</a>]. Here, we focus on NdNiO<sub>3</sub>, which in bulk exhibits a high-temperature metallic orthorhombic phase that transitions to a monoclinic insulator upon cooling below the metal-insulator transition temperature <span>T</span><sub>MI</sub> ∼205 K [<a href=\"#ozae044.695-B4\">4</a>]. It has been proposed that the transition is accompanied by electronic charge disproportionation on the nickel sites [<a href=\"#ozae044.695-B4\">4</a>]. Recent advances in the growth of high quality thin-films of nickelates offer a potential opportunity to explore possible suppression of the structural transition using the effects of confinement in the ultra-thin limit [<a href=\"#ozae044.695-B5\">5</a>]. Successful fabrication of membrane geometry of these high-quality thin films now provides a direct way of characterizing plan-view and cross-sectional orientation providing multiscale information not easily unattainable in ultra-thin films otherwise [<a href=\"#ozae044.695-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"529401bc6c8b303eabf7101546e8a5706cc8ec6e4273fe0a9938238dc297c917","category":"Environment"}
