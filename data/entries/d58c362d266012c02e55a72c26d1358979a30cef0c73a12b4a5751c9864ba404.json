{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Length Deformation in Classical and Relativistic Mechanics: Part-2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1332/v1","date":1716304901000,"content":"This study, serving as Part-2 of the research titled \"Comparative Analysis of Length Deformation in Classical and Relativistic Mechanics,\" investigates the behaviour of matter within gravitationally bound systems. Through meticulous examination of projected length alterations, the research highlights differences between classical and relativistic mechanics frameworks, emphasizing the necessity of considering relativistic effects beyond velocity alone. Additionally, the study underscores the crucial role of gravitational effects on the effective mass of moving objects, which emerges as a critical factor in predicting length deformation across scientific disciplines. The incomplete treatment of relativistic effects within Relativistic Mechanics, including acceleration and material stiffness, emphasizes the importance of comprehensively understanding gravitational influences on effective mass. This is evident in gravitational equations, where the gravitational force depends not only on the object's mass but also on its effective mass, influenced by kinetic energy. Thus, incorporating the gravitational effect on effective mass enhances the understanding of length deformation phenomena within gravitationally bound systems, enriching scientific discourse.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d58c362d266012c02e55a72c26d1358979a30cef0c73a12b4a5751c9864ba404","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
