{"title":"Systematic Review of Individual, Family, and Community Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors in Children Reported from Developmental Criminology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1399/v1","date":1721201993000,"content":"The study examines the risk and protective factors in childhood for boys and girls who engage in unlawful behavior, through the lens of developmental criminology. This field explores the elements contributing to the emergence of antisocial and prosocial behaviors in childhood, which are linked to the increase or desistance of delinquency in later years. To enhance understanding in this domain, the study analyzes risk and protective factors associated with criminality in children across various levels: individual, family, and community. Utilizing a systematic review grounded in the PRISMA method, the study identifies and categorizes a range of factors, including conduct problems, socio-emotional competencies, biological determinants, social exclusion, interpersonal relationships, institutional governance, family adversity, caregiver characteristics, and family composition. This review underscores the significance of recognizing risk and protective factors in child development to design interventions at multiple levels, aiming to prevent antisocial behavior proactively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cbc41b3f41191cf85e2198bc51935e4307b12fcd57e74f454cf2f2d9d9bfee0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
