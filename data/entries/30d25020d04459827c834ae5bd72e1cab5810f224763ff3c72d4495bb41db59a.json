{"title":"Geomagnetic Field Measurements based Adaptive Cubature H-infinity Filter for Microsatellite Autonomous Orbit Estimation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0113/v1","date":1719834849000,"content":"To address the issue of reduced orbit estimation accuracy resulting from discrepancies between in-orbit measured geomagnetic field values and IGRF model values in autonomous orbit estimation of microsatellites based on geomagnetic field measurements, this study introduces an adaptive cubature H-infinity filtering algorithm. Firstly, it presents the low-altitude orbital dynamics model and geomagnetic field measurement model for microsatellites. Subsequently, within the adaptive cubature H-infinity filtering algorithm, a spherical simplex rule and a second-order Gaussian-Legendre quadrature criterion are employed to compute the spherical surface integral and radial integral. Additionally, a spherical simplex-radial quadrature rule is proposed to enhance the approximation accuracy of nonlinear Gaussian weighted integrals. Furthermore, by integrating extended H-infinity filtering based on game theory with the cubature quadrature rule, an inverse proportional relationship between constraint level and filtering innovation is established. This allows for adaptive adjustment of the constraint level to enhance robustness against model errors. Finally, through semi-physical simulation experiments, it is demonstrated that compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves autonomous orbit estimation position accuracy of microsatellites by 7.49%, while also enhancing velocity accuracy by 3.1%, thus validating its effectiveness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30d25020d04459827c834ae5bd72e1cab5810f224763ff3c72d4495bb41db59a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
