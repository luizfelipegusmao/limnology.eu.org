{"title":"Circulating Interleukin-22 in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0019/v1","date":1719814337000,"content":"Abstract: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents the most severe manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD), characterized by a particularly poor prognosis. Consequently, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is imperative in the event of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Interleukin-22 (IL-22) may be a new CAD biomarker because it signals and regulates immune and inflammatory responses. Objectives: To investigate the differences in circulating IL-22 levels between patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI and healthy controls; and to determine if these differences are associated with the culprit coronary artery, door-to-balloon time (DBT), final angiographic result, CAD classification, and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: A total of 280 participants were recruited, comprising 210 STEMI cases and 70 healthy controls. Participants underwent clinical and angiographic evaluation, and serum IL-22 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney and Fisher’s tests, with a p &lt; 0.05 significant. Results: Serum IL-22 levels were lower in cases (149.63, 84.99–294.56) than in controls (482.67, 344.33–641.00), p &lt; 0.001. Lower IL-22 levels were associated with the right coronary artery (RCA) (144.57, 70.84–242.43; 146.00, 63.60–279.67; 191.71, 121.80–388.97), p = 0.033. IL-22 was lower with shorter DBT (≤ 60 minutes, 106.00, 49.60–171.71; &gt; 60 minutes, 153.00, 88.86–313.60), p = 0.043. Conclusions: IL-22 levels were significantly lower in patients with STEMI compared to healthy controls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6984a5eccc0da2a3a1f9505d4570c30e2c370614cdd2d6448c97f0cf59a649ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
