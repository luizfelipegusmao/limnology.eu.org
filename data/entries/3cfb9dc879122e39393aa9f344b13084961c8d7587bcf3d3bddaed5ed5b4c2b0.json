{"title":"The miRNA Contribution in Adipocyte Maturation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0080/v1","date":1714574852000,"content":"Mesenchymal stem cells due to their multipotent ability are considered one of the best candidates to be used in regenerative medicine. The most used source of those stem cells long the last decades was the bone marrow, despite its limited cell resources and the painful and very invasive surgical treatment. Therefore, the scientific community investigated many alternative sources for the harvesting of these stem cell subpopulations. Adipose tissue attracted the biggest interest thanks to special features, such as great tissue abundance, easy availability, and in the end the large amount of positive mesenchymal stem cells. Once it was verified that these stem cell subpopulations possess the same bone marrow differentiation potential, it became evident that they would be the ideal candidate to be used in regenerative and tissue engineering applications. Even the regenerative use of these cells long become a sensitive point because not all the acquired phenotypes resulted in the best source for plastic procedures. As documented in the literature, the ideal fillers for regenerative is represented by stem cell population. Therefore, it became crucial to investigate any kind of biological mechanism on the differentiative ability of those mesenchymal stem cells, especially their regulative factors. One of the most studied and important regulators are the miRNAs. Indeed, miRNA play a crucial role in the differentiation process of adipose stem cell cultures isolated from patients or obtained by commercial cell lines toward osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes differentiated populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3cfb9dc879122e39393aa9f344b13084961c8d7587bcf3d3bddaed5ed5b4c2b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
