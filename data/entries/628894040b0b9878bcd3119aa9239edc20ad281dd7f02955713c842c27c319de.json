{"title":"From Crystals to Cells: Freezing Challenging Biological Targets With The VitroJet","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.359/7720462?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Vitrification of samples in solution via plunge freezing has long been the field standard for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) sample preservation. Over time, many (semi-)automated systems have been developed. However, most commercial, or home-built systems require gentle sample blotting with filter paper to remove excess liquid from the EM grid surface just prior to plunging the grid into a suitable cryogen. Unfortunately, these ‘handling’ steps along with variations associated with sample application and the timescales surrounding the entire process increases the likelihood of artifacts such as poor particle dispersion, sample aggregation or dissociation, ice inconsistencies, and grid damage. To this end, several groups have developed novel sample application and freezing systems. These include microfluidic and pin-printing technologies for sample application to the grid, along with different methods for freezing [<a href=\"#ozae044.359-B1\">1</a>]. One system recently developed by CryoSol World is the VitroJet. It is a fully automated system that incorporates grid plasma cleaning, pin-printing to apply small volumes (picoliters) of sample across standard EM grids, and real-time process monitoring by the user. Once the sample is uniformly deposited, the grid is rapidly frozen between two jets of liquified ethane. The entire process proceeds without sample blotting. Preliminary data and reports have demonstrated the utility of the pin-printing and blot-free technology for fast, reproducible sample vitrification of isolated proteins and other small macromolecular complexes [<a href=\"#ozae044.359-B2\">2</a>]. Here we present results showing the success of using a VitroJet system for preparing a range of biological samples for cryo-EM, cryo-ET, and micro-ED investigations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"628894040b0b9878bcd3119aa9239edc20ad281dd7f02955713c842c27c319de","category":"Environment"}
