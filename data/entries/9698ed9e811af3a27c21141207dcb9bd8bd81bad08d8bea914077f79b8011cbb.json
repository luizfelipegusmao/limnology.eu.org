It is pivotal to various aspects related to plant development and responses to the environment. Consequently, knowledge of the plant epigenetic regulation network, encompassing both upstream signals and downstream targets, is imperative for crop improvements, thereby ensuring food security amidst shifting climates. With this objective in mind, the <span>Plant Physiology</span> Editorial Team has curated this Focus Issue on plant epigenetics, containing a compilation of research articles alongside timely reviews. The topics cover diverse types of plant epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation; histone modifications; noncoding RNAs; and chromatin accessibility, primarily focusing on their role in regulating crop agronomic traits.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"9698ed9e811af3a27c21141207dcb9bd8bd81bad08d8bea914077f79b8011cbb","category":"Environment"}
