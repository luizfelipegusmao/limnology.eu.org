{"title":"Evaluating Bacterial Spore Preparation Methods for Scanning Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/3/564/7664319?rss=1","date":1714694400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can reveal the ultrastructure of bacterial spores, including morphology, surface features, texture, spore damage, germination, and appendages. Understanding these features can provide a basis for adherence, how physical and environmental stressors affect spore viability, integrity, and functionality, as well as the distribution and function of surface appendages. However, the spore sample preparation method can significantly impact the SEM images’ appearance, resolution, and overall quality. In this study, we compare different spore preparation methods to identify optimal approaches for preparation time, spore appearance and resolved features, including the exosporium and spore pili, for SEM imaging. We use <span>Bacillus paranthracis</span> as model species and evaluate the efficacy of preparation protocols using different fixation and drying methods, as well as imaging under room- and cryogenic temperatures. We compare and assess method complexity to the visibility of the spore exosporium and spore appendages across different methods. Additionally, we use Haralick texture features to quantify the differences in spore surface appearance and determine the most suitable method for preserving spore structures and surface features during SEM evaluation. The findings from this study will help establish protocols for preparing bacterial spores for SEM and facilitating accurate and reliable analysis of spores’ characteristics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bbec178eb4703f61ebda29991c4db814795b0cecb9b681270a936bd0586557e7","category":"Environment"}
