{"title":"Three-Dimensional Bowing Measurement of Distal Femur at Actual Size and Clinical Implications of Total Knee Arthroplasty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1650/v1","date":1716796741000,"content":"Background and Objectives: To assess femoral shaft bowing (FSB) in the coronal and sagittal planes and introduce the clinical implications of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by analyzing a three-dimensional (3D) model with virtual implantation of the femoral component. Materials and Methods: Sixty-eight patients (average age: 69.1 years) underwent 3D model reconstruction, incorporating medullary canals, by importing computed tomography (CT) data into Mimics® software. A mechanical axis (MA) line was drawn from the midportion of the femoral head to the center of the intercondylar notch; proximal/distal straight centerlines (length, 60 mm; diameter, 1 mm) were placed in the center of the medulla canal. Acute angles between the two centerlines were measured as lateral and anterior bowing. The acute angle by distal centerline and MA line was measured as distal coronal and sagittal alignment in both anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. The diameter of curve (DOC) of the medulla along the posterior border was measured. Results: The mean lateral bowing on the AP view was 3.71°, and the mean anterior bowing on the lateral view was 11.82°. The average DOC of the medullary canal was 1501.68 mm. The distal coronal alignment of all femurs was an average of 6.40°, and the distal sagittal alignment was 2.66°. Overall, 22 femurs had coronal bowing, 42 had sagittal bowing, and 15 had both. Conclusion: In Asians, FSB is present in coronal, sagittal, or both directions. Increased anterolateral FSB may lead to cortical abutment in the sagittal plane despite limited space in the coronal plane. During TKA, distal coronal alignment can guide distal femoral valgus cut angle, whereas distal sagittal alignment helps anticipate femoral component positioning, avoiding anterior notching. Osteotomy along the anterior cortical bone to prevent notching may result in outliers due to differences between distal sagittal alignment and distal anterior cortical axis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ba675aa9fc80d004bde3fcf35a3bbb947c73aaf76edfec3b966da9ae169b1f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
