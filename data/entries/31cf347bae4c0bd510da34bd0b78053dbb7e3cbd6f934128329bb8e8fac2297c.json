Although it is an important step forward, the restoration section focuses heavily on remediating toxic waste. China can maximize the revised law’s impact by also requiring mining companies to incorporate plans to restore ecosystem services and carbon benefits and to commit to transparency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"31cf347bae4c0bd510da34bd0b78053dbb7e3cbd6f934128329bb8e8fac2297c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
