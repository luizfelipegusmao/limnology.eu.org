{"title":"Spatiotemporal expression analysis of jasmonic acid and saponin‐related genes uncovers a potential biosynthetic regulation in Panax notoginseng","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13800?af=R","date":1723187985000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Sanqi, the root of <i>Panax notoginseng</i>, has long been recognized for its therapeutic effects on cardiovascular diseases. Saponins, including ginsenosides and notoginsenosides, are the main bioactive components of <i>P. notoginseng</i>. The biosynthesis of saponins is closely related to the defense responses orchestrated by endogenous hormones.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>To provide new insights into the underlying role of phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) in the synthesis and regulation of saponins, we performed an ultra-performance liquid chromatography analysis of different tissues of <i>P. notoginseng</i> aged 2–4 years. Moreover, by combined evaluation of saponin content and transcriptome profiling of each tissue, the spatial and temporal distribution of saponins was analyzed. N notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rd accumulated in the underground tissues, including the root, tuqi, fibril and rhizome. In agreement with this data, the corresponding genes of the endogenous hormone JAs, especially <i>coronatine insensitive 1</i> (<i>COI1</i>) and <i>myelocytomatosis proteins 2</i> (<i>MYC2</i>), were predominantly expressed in the underground tissues. The tissue- and age-specific distribution of saponins was consistent with the expression of genes involved in JA biosynthetic, metabolic and signaling pathways.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The present study has revealed the temporal and spatial effects of endogenous phtohormones in the synthesis and regulation of notoginsenosides, which will provide a significant impact on improving the ecological planting technology, cultivating new high-quality varieties and protecting the rare resources of medicinal <i>P. notoginseng.</i> © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yu‐Ru Tong, \nKang Chen, \nZhou‐Qian Jiang, \nLi‐Chan Tu, \nYun‐Feng Luo, \nHan Zheng, \nYa‐Qiu Zhao, \nSi‐Yu Shen, \nYa‐Ting Hu, \nWei Gao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"fcc828aea90b3e8d80571709def76f6dc068107a0b1b396d5b81744a39ef6764","category":"Environment"}
