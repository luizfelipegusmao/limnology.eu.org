MRI assessed graft/ACL inclination angles, medial/lateral anterior tibial translation (ATT), and femoral/tibial rotation angles on both surgical and contralateral sides. Femorotibial angle (FTA) and rotational tibial subluxation (RTS) were calculated for comparing MRI results.</p> Results <p>Following ACL reconstruction, graft inclination angles, ATT, and FA/TA were significantly greater than those of the contralateral knee joint (P&lt;0.05). FTA and RTS did not differ significantly between sides, but exhibited significant correlation.</p> Conclusions <p>Graft inclination angles could not fully recover to normal levels post-ACL reconstruction, while notable medial/lateral ATT occurred on the surgical side. Additionally, a significant correlation was observed between FTA and RTS, suggesting their potential as combined clinical indicators for assessing knee joint rotation stability.</p>","author":"Zirong Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"889afbbdf180340a8514c6cf967dd409061d0138ba2f51128d6e8f2eaab8ec5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
