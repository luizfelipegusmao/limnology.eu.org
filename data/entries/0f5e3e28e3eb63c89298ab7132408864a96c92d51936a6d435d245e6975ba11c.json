{"title":"Assessing Herbicide Efficacy and Susceptibility for Weed Management and Enhancing Production of Non-GMO Soybean Cultivation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0494/v1","date":1712564109000,"content":"Soybean (Glycine max L.) is a vital leguminous crop known for its rich nutritional profile, includ-ing high protein and oil content, making it a valuable resource in global agriculture and human nutrition. In Pakistan due to regulatory issues non-GMO soybean is grown therefore, the universal herbicide control method is not applicable. Similarly, for other crops, specific herbicides are avail-able but for soybean no crop specific herbicide is present. A comprehensive study was conducted over two growing seasons, in 2022 and 2023, at Agronomic Research Farm University of Agri-culture Faisalabad. The research involved 16 different treatments, including both six pre-emergence and eight post-emergence herbicides as well as a control group and weedy check. Findings of this study showed that critical importance of weed management in soybean cultiva-tion, as unchecked weed infestation can lead to substantial yield losses. Among the pre-emergence herbicide S-Metolachlor + Pendimethalin performed best and showed higher plant height (54.33 cm &amp; 53.67 cm), 100 grain weight (11.57 g &amp; 12 g), seed yield plant-1 (13.07 g and 12.87 g), lower Susceptibility Index (10%), higher weed control percentage (91.21% &amp; 95.65%) higher weed con-trol efficiency (92.02% &amp; 93.43%), herbicide efficiency index (27.54% &amp; 32.48%) and lower weed index (18.16% &amp; 21.70%) during 2022 and 2023 respectively. However, in post emergence herbi-cide the Fluizefop-p-butyl is most effective herbicide due to less crop injury 10% Susceptibility In-dex, higher plant height (42.67 cm &amp; 44 cm), whole plant weight (93.33 g &amp; 95 g), 100-grain weight (11.40 g &amp; 11.77 g), seed yield plant-1 (12.87 g &amp; 13.13 g), higher weed control percentage (91.12% &amp; 91.03%) higher weed control efficiency (89.73% &amp; 92.36%, herbicide efficiency index (21.18% &amp; 30.41%) and lower weed index (19.42% &amp; 20.08%) in both 2022 and 2023 respectively. Notably, herbicides such as S-Metolachlor + Atrazine + Mesotrione, Topramezone, Mesosulfu-ron-methyl + Iodosulfuron-methyl sodium and Mesotrione + Atrazine led to complete plant mor-tality, resulting lethal to soybean. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that screened the best suitable herbicides with less plant injury, and higher efficiency index. So, it is recom-mended that the application of S-Metolachlor + Pendimethalin as PRE and Fluizefop-p-butyl as POST showed the least injury and best weed control results with higher grain yield.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f5e3e28e3eb63c89298ab7132408864a96c92d51936a6d435d245e6975ba11c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
