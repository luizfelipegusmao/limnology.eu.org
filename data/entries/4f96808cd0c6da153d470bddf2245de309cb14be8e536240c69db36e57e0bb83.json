{"title":"Safety, Acceptability and Feasibility of Single Dose Rifampicin as Post‚ÄêExposure Chemoprophylaxis for Contacts of Leprosy Patients in Togo: A Mixed Method Sequential Explanatory Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1821/v1","date":1727158587000,"content":"World Health Organization is encouraging countries to include contact screening and single dose of rifampicin administration as preventive chemotherapy for contacts of leprosy patients in their leprosy control activities.  However, no study has been conducted to assess the safety of SDR-PEP and acceptability and feasibility of this intervention in Togo.  To assess the safety of SDR-PEP we used a cohort design and for acceptability and feasibility we used a mixed method combining a quantitative study to assess the safety of SDR-PEP in a cohort of contacts from recently diagnosed leprosy patients followed by a qualitative study to identify the social, cultural or institutional factors that would influence the adoption of single dose rifampicin as post-exposure prophylaxis for contacts of leprosy patients in Togo. For the quantitative study, all identified index patients agreed to the disclosure of their status to their contacts and provided a list of their contacts. All the contacts found agreed to take part in the study and an appointment was made for screening. However, some contacts were absent on the screening day for no reason. All eligible contacts agreed to take SDR and were followed up after taking the drug. No severe adverse events were reported during follow-up. For the qualitative study, 72 interviews (66 semi-structured interviews and 6 focus groups) were carried out, and it emerged that overall, opinions were favorable on the acceptability and feasibility of implementing single dose rifampicin as post-exposure prophylaxis for contacts of leprosy patients in Togo. However, a number of conditions need to be considered for more effective results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f96808cd0c6da153d470bddf2245de309cb14be8e536240c69db36e57e0bb83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
