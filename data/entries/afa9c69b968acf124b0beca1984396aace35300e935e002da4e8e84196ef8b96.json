In addition to near-field microscopy the technology has been advanced to enable hyperspectral, nanoscale Fourier-transform spectroscopy (nano-FTIR) using broadband radiation from the visible spectral range, mid-IR and THz spectral ranges, with the particularly useful application in the mid-IR “fingerprint” region due to ability performing material chemical identification with resolution exceeding conventional IR absorption techniques 100-fold.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"afa9c69b968acf124b0beca1984396aace35300e935e002da4e8e84196ef8b96","category":"Environment"}
