{"title":"Is cannabis a slippery slope? Associations between psychological dysfunctioning, other substance use, and impaired driving, in a sample of active cannabis users","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310958","date":1728482400000,"content":"<p>by Steven Love, Bevan Rowland, Kerry Armstrong</p>\r\n\r\nCannabis is a gateway drug that can lead to the engagement of other substances. Psychological dysfunctioning and dependence have been highlighted as primary components to substance misuse. The purpose of this study was to investigate what aspects of cannabis use and psychological dysfunctioning are associated with the engagement of other substances and impaired driving. Subject to screening, 200 active adult cannabis users completed an online survey. Existing data involving non-cannabis users (<i>N</i> = 833) were also implemented as comparative data. The comparisons suggested that cannabis users were far more likely to have used other drugs in the past 12 months, compared to non-cannabis users. Bivariate correlations and multiple regressions indicated that the degree of cannabis use and likely dependence, psycho-social motives for using cannabis, emotion dysregulation, and psychopathology were positively associated with the frequency of using and driving on other substances. Finally, an ANOVA demonstrated that outside of age, there were no apparent differences in substance use behaviours, motives for using cannabis, and psychological dysfunction, between medicinal and black-market cannabis users. These findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating self-regulatory concepts into current road safety initiatives, which aim to reduce the interconnected issue of substance misuse and impaired driving behaviours.","author":"Steven Love","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1d3a9bfecf4c6bc7660035a5b707985a4a32dab1ce7016fac6d0bae5d71b69a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
