{"title":"A Compact, Low-Cost and Low-Power Turbidity Sensor for Continuous In-Situ Stormwater Monitoring","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1338/v1","date":1713862375000,"content":"Turbidity stands as a crucial indicator for assessing water quality, and while turbidity sensors exist their high cost prohibit their extensive use. In this paper, we introduce an innovative turbidity sensor, and it is the first low-cost turbidity sensor which is designed specifically for long-term stormwater in-field monitoring. Its low cost ($23.50 USD), enables the implementation of high spatial resolution monitoring schemes. The sensor design is available under open hardware and open-source licences, and the 3D-printed sensor housing is free to modify based on different monitoring purposes and ambient conditions. The sensor was tested both in the laboratory and in the field. The laboratory results show a strong linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.99) between the sensor readings and the commercial hand-held turbidimeter (Thermo Scientific AQ4500) results of the solution. In the field, the low-cost sensor measurements were statistically significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.01) to a standard high-cost commercial turbidity sensor (GreenSpan TS-1000). Biofouling and drifting issues were also analysed after the sensors were deployed in the field for more than 6 months, showing both biofouling and drift occur during monitoring. Nonetheless, in terms of maintenance requirements, the low-cost sensor exhibited similar needs compared to the Green-Span sensor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e2961ab90d5fa0c6469740363485bcf3f6a0ac753d8a50c1499f594947a0fb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
