At baseline, we assessed HH infrastructure and practices among healthcare workers (HCWs) at two large hospitals in the Dominican Republic during the COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs were observed for HH adherence (HHA) (defined as the use of alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) or handwashing with soap and water) before and after patient contact and donning new gloves before patient contact. The baseline assessment was repeated following implementation of local production and distribution of ABHR and a HH promotion campaign. Descriptive analyses and regression models evaluated predictors of HHA and glove use. Cumulative HHA was 18.9%. While patient-care areas with a functional HH resource increased from 47% at baseline to 92% after the intervention, HHA declined from 23.0% to 16.7%. HHA was higher after patient contact (aOR = 5.88; 95% CI = 4.17–8.33), during a period of increased COVID-19 risk (aOR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.05–2.77), during invasive patient contacts (aOR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.23–2.17) and when gloves were not used (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.01–1.56). The negative association between glove use and HHA diminished when access to HH resources increased. New gloves were donned before 39.6% of patient contacts. Glove use was higher among nurses (aOR = 7.12; 95% CI = 3.02–16.79) and during invasive contacts (aOR = 4.76; 95% CI = 2.27–10.0). While access to HH resources increased after the interventions, HHA did not increase. HHA was lower when COVID-19 risk was lower. Findings from this study may guide future efforts to increase HHA among HCWs.","author":"C.
