{"title":"A one-dimensional semaglutide-GLP-1R-based mini static GIBAC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0953/v1","date":1718334268000,"content":"Drug-target binding is an essential parameter in drug discovery and design to ensure drug efficacy and specificity. In 2022, the concept of a general intermolecular binding affinity calculator (GIBAC) was for the first time coined: $Kd = f(molecules, envPara)$. Technically, GIBAC represents a set of in silico approaches for structural and biophysical data generation towards a paradigm shift in precise drug discovery and design, providing a comprehensive framework for intermolecular binding affinity calculation with adequate accuracy, precision and efficiency. For the first time, this study reports a prototype of GIBAC (semaGIBAC), i.e., a one-dimensional semaglutide-GLP-1R-based mini static GIBAC, based on an experimental complex structure of semaglutide and GLP-1R. Semaglutide is a potent GLP-1 receptor agonist used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by regulating blood glucose levels and promoting weight loss. In 2021, a structural modification involving a Val27-Arg28 exchange was manually introduced to enhance semaglutide-GLP-1R binding affinity. This study employs a comprehensive structural and biophysical analysis aimed at thoroughly exploring the sequence space of semaglutide-GLP-1R to design analogues with improved binding affinity, leading to the identification of a promising semaglutide analogue, which binds to GLP-1R with an affinity that is more than two orders of magnitude (113.3 times) higher than native semaglutide. To sum up, this article puts forward a promising structural biophysical approach for developing GLP-1 receptor agonists with enhanced efficacy, and with a GIBAC prototype (semaGIBAC), this article argues again that the time is now ripe for the construction of a real GIBAC to be listed on the agenda of the drug discovery and design community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83b932e9479f7871ef55d8cc9d29a86d71ccd906cc8eaa9297acb725f3374a5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
