{"title":"A Distributed Algorithm for Reaching Average Consensus in Unbalanced Tree Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1310/v1","date":1724055526000,"content":"In this paper, a distributed algorithm for reaching average consensus is proposed for multi-agent systems with tree communication graph, when the edge weight distribution is unbalanced. First, the problem is introduced as a key topic of core algorithms for several modern scenarios. Then, the relative solution is proposed as a finite-time algorithm, which can be included in any application as a preliminary setup routine, and it is well-suited to be integrated with other adaptive setup routines, thus making the proposed solution useful in several practical applications. A special focus is devoted to the integration of the proposed method with a recent Laplacian eigenvalue allocation algorithm, and the implementation of the overall approach in a wireless sensor network framework. Finally, a worked example is provided, showing the significance of this approach for reaching a more precise average consensus in uncertain scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83fecd25d75374eda4108df32fef6044706a50559b6b409aa432eae0aaf8281b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
