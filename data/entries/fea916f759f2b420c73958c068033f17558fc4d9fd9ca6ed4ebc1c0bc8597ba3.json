However, new nuclear concepts must be rigorously tested, developed, and studied before they can be licensed for commercial use. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is the US Department of Energy’s center for nuclear energy research and development and is tasked with helping enable the development and commercialization of novel nuclear concepts.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fea916f759f2b420c73958c068033f17558fc4d9fd9ca6ed4ebc1c0bc8597ba3","category":"Environment"}
