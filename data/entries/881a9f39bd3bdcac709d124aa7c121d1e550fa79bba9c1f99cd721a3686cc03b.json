{"title":"201 The effects of the supplementation of a Zinc-amino acid complex in pig nursery diets with differing pharmacological levels of zinc oxide and complexity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/104/7665091?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Diet complexity (DC), which has significance in nursery pig production, generally refers to a greater number of highly digestible ingredients. Increased DC may have even greater significance in scenarios of reduction or withdrawal of zinc oxide (ZnO) in nursery diets. The objectives were to determine 1) the impact of adding Zn-amino acid complex (Zinpro ProPath Zn) to mid- (MC) and low-complexity (LC) diets on nursery pig performance and health compared with a high complexity (HC) diet, and 2) the impact of Zinpro ProPath Zn in diets with and without pharmacologic levels of ZnO. A total of 2,400 mixed-sex weanling pigs [initial body (BW) weight = 5.79 ± 0.15 kg] were assigned to 1 of 5 dietary treatments during nursery (42 d) as follows: 1) HC; MC diet with 2) MC+ZnO) or without 3) MC-ZnO) pharmacologic ZnO; and LC diet with 4) LC+ZnO) or without 5) LC-ZnO) pharmacologic ZnO. All diets except HC were supplemented with Zinpro ProPath Zn (125 mg/kg Zn) and ZnO [3,000, 2,000, and 0 mg/kg Zn during Phases I (14 d), II (14 d) and III (14 d), respectively]. Different DC were achieved by manipulating the inclusion of spray-dried plasma, soy protein concentrate, and whey protein. Growth performance, onset of feed intake, fecal dry matter, number of injectable treatments administered, and serum acute-phase response were assessed. Pigs fed HC (20.0 kg) had greater final BW (FBW) compared with pigs fed MC-ZnO (18.8 kg), which had greater FBW compared with pigs fed LC-ZnO (17.5 kg; SEM = 0.34; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Average daily feed intake (ADFI) was greater in pigs fed HC (0.46 kg/d) compared with MC-ZnO (0.43 kg/d) and LC+ZnO (0.42 kg/d), which had greater ADFI compared with LC-ZnO (0.39 kg/d; SEM = 0.01; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Similarly, average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were greater in pigs fed HC (0.33 kg/d, 0.72 kg/kg, respectively) compared with pigs fed LC (0.27 kg/d, 0.67 kg/kg, respectively), regardless of ZnO (SEM = 0.01; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). There was no effect of dietary treatments on the fecal dry matter or on the onset of feed intake of pigs (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). The number of injectable treatments administered was greatest in LC-ZnO (62.7%), followed by LC+ZnO (50.6%), MC regardless of ZnO (44.0%), and HC (36.7%; SEM = 1.04; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Serum alkaline phosphatase was less in LC-ZnO than the other groups (229.8 vs. 280.9 ± 11.9 IU/L; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Taken together, feeding HC diets during the nursery appears to be effective in improving performance and health of pigs, particularly when compared with MC and LC diets without ZnO. Moreover, the addition of Zinpro ProPath Zn may partially attenuate the negative effects of ZnO removal in MC, but not LC, diets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"881a9f39bd3bdcac709d124aa7c121d1e550fa79bba9c1f99cd721a3686cc03b","category":"Environment"}
