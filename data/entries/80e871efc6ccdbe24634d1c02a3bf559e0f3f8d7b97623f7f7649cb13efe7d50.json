{"title":"A Scoping Review of Genetic Algorithms in Serious Games: Applications, Challenges, and\nFuture Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0531/v1","date":1725617414000,"content":"The integration of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) into Serious Games (SGs) has gained traction\nas a method to optimize game mechanics and personalize user experiences. While GAs are\nwell-known for their effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems, their application in\nSGs remains relatively under-explored. This review aims to address this gap by systematically\nmapping the existing literature on the intersection of these two fields. The primary objective\nof this scoping review is to identify and synthesize the existing research on the application of\nGAs in SGs, with a focus on understanding the current state of the field, identifying common\napplications, challenges, and potential future directions. The review includes studies published in\nEnglish that focus on the use of GAs within SGs. The search encompassed articles from academic\njournals and conference proceedings without restrictions on publication dates. Exclusion criteria\nincluded studies that did not specifically address the integration of GAs in SGs. A systematic\nsearch was conducted in databases such as ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, Scopus\nand Inspec in July 2024. The search terms used included \"genetic algorithm,\" \"evolutionary\nalgorithm,\" \"computational algorithm,\" and \"serious games.\" Unpublished data and articles\nwere not considered. Data were charted using a PRISMA flowchart developed by the author\nVV. Key categories for data extraction included study objectives, methods, outcomes, type of\nstudy and GA used and the specific applications of GAs in SGs. Data charting was conducted\nindependently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved through discussion and consensus.\nThe search identified 154 studies, of which 23 met the inclusion criteria. The included studies\nhighlight the diverse applications of GAs in SGs, ranging from optimizing game scenarios to\npersonalizing learning experiences. Challenges identified include the computational complexity\nof GAs and difficulties in their integration into existing game frameworks. The findings of this\nreview suggest that while the use of GAs in SGs is a promising area of research, it remains in its\nnascent stages. Future research should focus on addressing the technical challenges of integrating\nGAs into SGs and exploring their application across a wider range of game genres and educational\ncontexts. Limitations of the review include the potential for publication bias and the exclusion of\nnon-English language studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80e871efc6ccdbe24634d1c02a3bf559e0f3f8d7b97623f7f7649cb13efe7d50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
