Through custom control of the electron beam position that actively feeds back on image, spectroscopy, and data streams from electron detectors, it is possible to use focused beam energy to precisely initiate, direct, and terminate desired material transformations. This high degree spatial and temporal control can be used to generate point defects, drill holes that are a single or few atoms in size, and mill thin lines or other patterns in materials, change phase, modify bond coordination, and reposition dopants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"08d6a5b00d77ad30927db48e0f6bf3f0efefb644ca2f23dfbcd9b3c78b0603f6","category":"Environment"}
