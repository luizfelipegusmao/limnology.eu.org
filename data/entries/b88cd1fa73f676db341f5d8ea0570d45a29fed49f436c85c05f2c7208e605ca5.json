{"title":"Impact of gel concentration on filter fluxes in microfiltration of Hanford tank wastes and simulants","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14104?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Treatment processes have been proposed that will utilize crossflow filtration to concentrate sludge waste streams at the Department of Energy's Hanford Site. Challenges associated with solid–liquid separation of the waste streams drive a necessary evaluation of available Hanford high level waste (HLW) filtration data. Limiting flux conditions during crossflow filtration are elucidated with the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface. A mass transfer coefficient between the gel and bulk concentrations plays a critical role in determining filter flux. A correlation between the gel concentration and mass transfer coefficient is made to assist in determining filter performance of select HLW streams. As a process alternative to crossflow filtration, gravity settling of waste streams may be deployed as a solid–liquid separation technique. However, this results in a contrasting performance with the centrifuged solids concentration. A method was developed to estimate expected filtration and settling performance based on physical characterization data for Hanford tank waste samples. By assessing the estimated processing performance of HLW, technical support can be provided during flowsheet planning.</p>","author":"A. M. Westesen, \nJ. G. H. Geeting, \nK. P. Brooks, \nR. W.
