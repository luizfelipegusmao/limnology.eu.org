{"title":"Missed or Delayed Diagnosis of Heart Disease by the General Pediatrician","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0867/v1","date":1710687717000,"content":"Primary care pediatricians encounter a wide range of complex conditions in their daily clinical practice. It is not uncommon for their patients to get exposed to medical errors. Diagnostic errors, defined as missed, delayed, or wrong diagnosis, are of great importance as they may cause significant harm to the pediatric patient with severe disease. These errors often occur when the symptoms and signs of a disease are atypical or missing. Data on the most frequent misdiagnosed situations in pediatrics is scarce. One of these groups of conditions is that regarding cardiac diseases. The pediatric cardiology field has met rapid development over the past few decades. Primary care providers play a key role in diagnosis, management, and referral of children with heart disease, both congenital and acquired, because many common cardiac complaints are first addressed in the primary care setting. The scope of this review is to investigate the cardiac entities that are often missed by the general pediatricians. In particular, it aims to spot the most common of them, to describe their clinical presentation, their diagnostic options, red flags, and tips, and to provide the ways to avoid erroneous, delayed, or missed diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84ad205dd9c22c14d78152a0666e49167de3e7b31deacd050962f2aadf2896e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
