{"title":"30 Microbiota and Companion Animal Health","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/124/7757124?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The intestinal microbiota has been shown to have an important role in health and disease of animals. It is a complex system that depends on interactions between the luminal environment and specific bacterial taxa and their function (e.g., production of short-chain fatty acids, conversion of bile acids). Dietary substrates are an important factor for microbial metabolism and supplements have the potential to help in maintaining intestinal health. Major changes in the microbiota and their loss of function (dysbiosis) are mainly associated with antibiotic treatment and in chronic intestinal disease likely due to chronic remodeling of the epithelium. Therefore, often these changes persist long-term. Chronic enteropathies (CE) occur very commonly in dogs and cats, and are frustrating to treat due to lack of specific markers. The pathophysiology is complex and includes changes in the immune system (e.g., inflammation), intestinal function, and the intestinal microbiome. The current classification based on treatment response (i.e., food- vs. steroid-responsive) is currently being questioned, as new research findings indicate that CE is a syndrome with many overlapping unspecific features, often with chronic irreversible changes in intestinal function and dysbiosis. The presentation will summarize novel research about the pathophysiology and novel concepts in multi-modal therapy to these conditions. This program will help better understand the role of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease (with focus on acute diarrhea and chronic intestinal inflammation). New diagnostic methods for evaluation of the intestinal microbiota will be covered. Finally, this lecture will review how to best manage the clinical signs of acute and chronic diarrhea. This includes new evidence of the negative impact of antibiotics on the microbiome and the critical role nutrition can play in managing these patients.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"7c54d01c7e99c781864d3e9b74df2ac08ae71770a99b80b2a5d8b228455e833d","category":"Environment"}
