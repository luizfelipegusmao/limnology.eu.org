{"title":"Effect of Fertilization in Companion Cropping Systems of Andean Fruit Trees in the Municipality of Ipiales (Fertilization Levels in Andean Fruit Trees)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1017/v1","date":1723616472000,"content":"Companion cropping involves growing two or more species together, benefiting the conservation of natural resources and improving fertilization and nutrient cycling by balancing chemical and organic sources. Studies, as in the case of tree tomato and Hass avocado, have shown a significant increase in yield compared to monocultures, highlighting the viability of this practice. In addition to their environmental benefit, companion crops offer economic advantages to producers by obtaining multiple products in a single harvest, strengthening food security and the economy of rural families. This study evaluated three levels of fertilization and interactions between fruit trees at different altitudes, observing differential behavior in the variables evaluated. The combination of cape gooseberry and blackberry showed significantly positive results, with more leaves and fewer pests, demonstrating the benefits of companion plants. A trend towards the combined use of chemical and organic fertilizers was observed, a potential strategy to reduce costs and improve crop growth. The results were shared with producers interested in implementing companion cropping, encouraging the adoption of this more sustainable and profitable agricultural practice. Companion crop agriculture represents a viable and promising strategy for a more efficient and sustainable agriculture, with both environmental and economic benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0f1941267d6e20a439040863ecfb34fd2e3a940cadfd2b479386539e6829dc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
