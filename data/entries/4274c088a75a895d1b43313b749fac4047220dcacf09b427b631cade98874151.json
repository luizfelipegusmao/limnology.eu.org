{"title":"Process Simulation of Post-combustion CO2 Capture Using Alkanolamines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0195/v1","date":1714978364000,"content":"Environmental preservation presents numerous challenges, particularly in capturing carbon di-oxide. Despite multiple studies on this topic, there remains a need for additional capture plants, particularly in the energy sector. The power industry emits flue gas during its post-combustion process, and capturing carbon dioxide from this gas would make power plants more environ-mentally friendly while aiding the preservation of the planet. The work conducted in This study aimed to investigate the gap in knowledge to contribute to the development of a better world without harming it. The identified research gap reveals no established optimal monoethanola-mine (MEA) solvent concentration for the process. A simulation was performed using Aspen Hysys to analyze the absorption efficiency at higher solvent concentrations and address this is-sue. The input data was obtained from a flue gas capture plant in the UK. The results obtained from discrete increments indicate an optimal solid result for an MEA concentration of 36 wt.%. Further analysis of temperature and pressure revealed that other solvents, such as diethanola-mine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA), are more stable at higher concentrations and that DEA and TEA at the same concentration as MEA consumed significantly less energy to capture carbon dioxide.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4274c088a75a895d1b43313b749fac4047220dcacf09b427b631cade98874151","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
