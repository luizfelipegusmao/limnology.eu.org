{"title":"Thermal adaptation in plants: understanding the dynamics of translation factors and condensates","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4258/7648805?rss=1","date":1713312000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants, as sessile organisms, face the crucial challenge of adjusting growth and development with ever-changing environmental conditions. Protein synthesis is the fundamental process that enables growth of all organisms. Since elevated temperature presents a substantial threat to protein stability and function, immediate adjustments of protein synthesis rates are necessary to circumvent accumulation of proteotoxic stress and to ensure survival. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms that control translation under high-temperature stress by the modification of components of the translation machinery in plants, and compares them to yeast and metazoa. Recent research also suggests an important role for cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates, named stress granules, in these processes. Current understanding of the role of stress granules in translational regulation and of the molecular processes associated with translation that might occur within stress granules is also discussed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"54e55f21327329683280b963613c76f5da9e0e78b511287a1ca1e79e274c6445","category":"Environment"}
