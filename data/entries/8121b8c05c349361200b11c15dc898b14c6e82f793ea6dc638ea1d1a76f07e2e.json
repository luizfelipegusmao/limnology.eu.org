{"title":"Chronic exposure to BDE-47 aggravates acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis by promoting acinar cell apoptosis and inflammation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/1/120/7614095?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The effect of 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a persistent environmental pollutant commonly used as a flame retardant in various consumer products, on pancreatitis has not been clearly elucidated, although it has been reported to be toxic to the liver, nervous system, and reproductive system. Acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) models were induced in this study by intraperitoneal injection of caerulein. The aim was to investigate the impact of BDE-47 on pancreatitis by exposing the animals to acute (1 week) or chronic (8 weeks) doses of BDE-47 (30 mg/kg in the low-concentration group and 100 mg/kg in the high-concentration group). Additionally, BDE-47 was utilized to stimulate mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, pancreatic primary stellate cells, and acinar cells in order to investigate the impact of BDE-47 on pancreatitis. <span>In vivo</span> experiments conducted on mice revealed that chronic exposure to BDE-47, rather than acute exposure, exacerbated the histopathological damage of AP and CP, leading to elevated fibrosis in pancreatic tissue and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells in the pancreas. <span>In vitro</span> experiments showed that BDE-47 can promote the expression of the inflammatory cytokines Tnf-α and Il-6 in M1 macrophages, as well as promote acinar cell apoptosis through the activation of the PERK and JNK pathways via endoplasmic reticulum stress. The findings of this study imply chronic exposure to BDE-47 may exacerbate the progression of both AP and CP by inducing acinar cell apoptosis and dysregulating inflammatory responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"8121b8c05c349361200b11c15dc898b14c6e82f793ea6dc638ea1d1a76f07e2e","category":"Environment"}
