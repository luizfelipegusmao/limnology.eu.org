{"title":"Physicochemical and Rheological Characteristics of Fermented Sour Cream (&ldquo;Suero Coste&ntilde;o&rdquo;) Produced in Colombia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0794/v1","date":1715579709000,"content":"\"Suero costeño\" a type of sour cream, is a traditional dairy product made mainly in the Colombian Caribbean region and has a variety of uses. The objective was to characterize the physicochemical and rheological properties of “suero costeño” produced in department of Córdoba-Colombia. Samples of \" suero costeño \" were obtained from local producers, characterized physicochemically (protein, fat, crude fiber, moisture, ash, carbohydrates, chlorides, pH and acidity), and rheologically (stationary tests), adjusting their behavior to the power-law model. The results show great variability in the physicochemical characteristics of the “suero costeño” made by the different artisanal producers, classifying it as a full-fat sour cream or light sour cream, and values of protein, pH and acidity similar to similar traditional dairy products from other countries, such as Reindeer sour cream and Curd or cottage cheese. “Suero costeño” can be classified as a pseudoplastic fluid and depending on the raw materials used and the production process, some present thixotropy, which may be the product of interactions between proteins and fats, which cause changes in the internal structure. Due to this great variability in its physicochemical and rheological characteristics, it is necessary to standardize the process of producing to improve the marketing of this Colombian culinary product.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a012ab7404d234b64efd0cfbaba10806094c886b351949e6d79cafc603c0a4b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
