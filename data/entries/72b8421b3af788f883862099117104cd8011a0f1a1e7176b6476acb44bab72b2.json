{"title":"Three-Month Mortality in Nonhaematological Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis: Differences between Subtypes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0795/v1","date":1725957842000,"content":"ABSTRACT (words 232) Objectives: Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a fungal lung infection characterized by slowly progressive destruction of the lung parenchyma and has four main subtypes. The objective of this work was to evaluate the epidemiology of CPA in our area and evaluate the involvement of the different subtypes in mortality. Methods: This was a descriptive longitudinal retrospective study developed in three tertiary hospitals in Spain. Among all patients admitted with a pulmonary aspergillosis diagnosis, we selected those who fulfilled the criteria for chronic aspergillosis according to the criteria of Denning, excluding those with a haematological disorder. Results: Among 409 inpatients recorded as having pulmonary aspergillosis infection, only 76 (18.5%) fulfilled the criteria for CPA, with an estimated incidence of 0.67 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year. The subtypes detected were subacute invasive aspergillosis (SAIA) in 33 (43.4%) patients, simple aspergilloma (SA) in 25 (32.9%) patients, cavitary chronic aspergillosis (CCPA) in 13 (17.1%) patients and chronic fibrosant (CFAP) in 5 (6.5%) patients. The overall three-month mortality was 23%, which was higher in SAIA patients. The predictors of early mortality were age &gt;65 years (OR 3.0 CI 95 1.0–9.5 0.043) and SAIA subtype vs. other subtypes (OR 3.1 CI 95 1.0–9.5 p 0.042). Conclusions: The incidence rate estimated was inferior to that previously reported. Three-month mortality in patients with CPA was high, with older age and SAIA subtype being the variable independent predictors of a worse prognosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72b8421b3af788f883862099117104cd8011a0f1a1e7176b6476acb44bab72b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
