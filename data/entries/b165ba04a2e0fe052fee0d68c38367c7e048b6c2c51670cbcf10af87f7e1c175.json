{"title":"Short-term spatial dispersion patterns between the larger grain borer and the maize weevil in grain columns","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/1/127/7450391?rss=1","date":1700784000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The invasive larger grain borer (<span>Prostephanus truncatus</span>) and the maize weevil (<span>Sitophilus zeamais</span>) co-occur in many regions of the world. While competition between these 2 species has been studied extensively, there is little information on spatial dispersion patterns in bulk storage of grain. To evaluate potential overlap in realized niche, we evaluated the short-term spatial dispersion behavior of <span>P. truncatus</span> and <span>S. zeamais</span> in monolayers of maize alone or together for 1 day compared to 7 days. We evaluated competition under three different densities, namely 10–20, 75–150, and 150–300 insects/kg for <span>P. truncatus</span> and <span>S. zeamais.</span> The monolayers were equally divided into 24 zones to track location the abundance of insects and damage to maize. We found that both species generally aggregated together and were correlated to the same location as heterospecifics. After 1 day, most of the insects for both species were near the top of the monolayer, but by 7 days, most individuals were at the bottom of the monolayers. In monolayers, when alone, <span>P. truncatus</span> created a clear path of destruction to the bottom of the monolayer, but when <span>S. zeamais</span> was present, damage was lessened and shifted upwards in the grain column. In an olfactometer assay, <span>P. truncatus</span> preferred maize odors, while <span>S. zeamais</span> exhibited no preference among maize, conspecifics, and heterospecifics. In evaluating relative emissions, each of these treatments emitted unique odors but with significant overlap. These data may improve targeting of chemical control tactics by identifying the position of these insects in the grain mass.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"b165ba04a2e0fe052fee0d68c38367c7e048b6c2c51670cbcf10af87f7e1c175","category":"Environment"}
