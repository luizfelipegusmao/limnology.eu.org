{"title":"Damming of streams due to the construction of a highway in the Amazon rainforest favors individual trophic specialization in the fish (Bryconops giacopinii)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15906?af=R","date":1725430741000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In Amazonian streams, damming caused by road construction changes the system's hydrological dynamics and biological communities. We tested whether the degree of specialization in fish (<i>Bryconops giacopinii</i>) individuals is higher in pristine stream environments with intact ecological conditions than in streams dammed due to the construction of a highway in the Amazon rainforest. To achieve this, stomach content data and stable isotopes (<i>δ</i>\n<sup>13</sup>C and <i>δ</i>\n<sup>15</sup>N) in tissues with varying isotopic incorporation rates (liver, muscle, and caudal fin) were used to assess the variation in consumption of different prey over time. The indices within-individual component (WIC)/total niche width (TNW) and individual specialization were employed to compare the degree of individual specialization between pristine and dammed streams. The condition factor and stomach repletion of sampled individuals were used to infer the intensity of intraspecific competition in the investigated streams. The species <i>B. giacopinii</i>, typically considered a trophic generalist, has been shown to be, in fact, a heterogeneous collection of specialist and generalist individuals. Contrary to our expectations, a higher degree of individual specialization was detected in streams dammed by the highway. In dammed streams, where intraspecific competition was more intense, individuals with narrower niches exhibited poorer body conditions than those with broader niches. This suggests that individuals adopting more restricted diets may have lower fitness, indicating that individual specialization may not necessarily be beneficial for individuals. Our results support the notion that intraspecific competition is an important mechanism underlying individual specialization in natural populations. Our results suggest that environmental characteristics (e.g., resource breadth and predictability) and competition for food resources interact in complex ways to determine the degree of individual specialization in natural populations.</p>","author":"Gabriel Gazzana Barros, \nMárcio Silva Araújo, \nGilvan Takeshi Yogui, \nJansen Zuanon, \nCláudia Pereira de Deus","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"afe5f005e383c9fc04ccda439298e8e02feb3317221bbf3622909a5bc9de3a19","category":"Environment"}
