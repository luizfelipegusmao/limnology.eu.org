{"title":"3D and 2D Stability Analysis of Bentonite Slurry Trench with Shear Strength Reduction Technique and Limit Equilibrium Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1385/v1","date":1716285111000,"content":"The bentonite slurry trenches are becoming increasingly popular in the excavation process of trenches, especially for diaphragm wall construction. The problem that needs to be addressed is the stability of bentonite slurry trenches. This paper presents a stability analysis of trenches with temporary support of bentonite slurry, with unit weights ranging from 10.5 to 12.0 kN/m3, in the realistic stratum: C3 in the Hue city area. The analysis employs the shear strength reduction technique (SSR) with Mohr-Coulomb materials for the numerical method to evaluate the factor of safety (FS). The finite element method (FEM) software program (RS) and the finite difference method (FDM) FLAC software were applied. Additionally, the limit equilibrium method (LEM) of Bell-Washbourne and three-dimensional (3D) Bishop are used for calculating trench stability. The analysis results show a good agreement between RS2 and FLAC2D and RS3 and FLAC3D. Secondly, upon comparison, it is noted that the safety factors of the 3D software programs (RS3, FLAC3D) are higher than those of the 2D software programs (RS2, FLAC2D), ranging from 52.3 to 63.0% for trench lengths of 6m. However, for trench lengths of 54m, the safety factor values in 2D and 3D are nearly equal. Thirdly, the safety factor of the Bell-Washbourne method (LEM) is lower than the numerical analysis methods (FLAC and RS programs). Using the three-dimensional numerical method appears to be effective for estimating stability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e6f7b173d4fa7efcb92d7a3ce1ce2aa42111e9bf500b651cf1aab81638f28456","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
