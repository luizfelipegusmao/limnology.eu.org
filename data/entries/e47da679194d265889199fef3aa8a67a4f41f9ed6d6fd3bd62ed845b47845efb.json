Materials and Methods: the retrospective analysis of 1336 patients who were newly diagnosed with UM at Department of Ophthalmology and Ophthalmic Oncology, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum Krakow, Poland between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021. The demographic and clinical data were compiled including localization, size and treatment methods of tumors. Results: In total, 728 patients with UM were included before COVID-19 pandemic in years 2018-2019 and 608 were included during COVID-19 pandemic in years 2020-2021. Fixed-base dynamics indicators for the incidence of uveal melanoma (base year 2018) in the national referral center in Poland were 80.22% and 86.81% in year 2020 and 2021, respectively. UMs were statistically significantly larger and more frequently localized anterior to the equator of the eye globe in year 2021 than in year 2018 (Chi^2 Pearson test p= 0.0001 and p= 0.0077, respectively). The rate of patients treated with enucleation increased from 15.94% in year 2018 to 26.90% in year 2021 (Chi^2 Pearson test p=0.0005). Conclusions: statistically significant differences were found in the management of uveal melanoma in National Referral Center in Poland during COVID-19 pandemic with tumors being larger, more frequently localized anterior to the equator of the eye globe and more often enucleated.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e47da679194d265889199fef3aa8a67a4f41f9ed6d6fd3bd62ed845b47845efb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
