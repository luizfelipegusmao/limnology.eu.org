{"title":"Temperature-dependent gene regulatory divergence underlies local adaptation with gene flow in the Atlantic silverside","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/6/1133/7633506?rss=1","date":1711065600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Gene regulatory divergence is thought to play an important role in adaptation, yet its extent and underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive for local adaptation with gene flow. Local adaptation is widespread in marine species despite generally high connectivity and is often associated with tightly linked genomic architectures, such as chromosomal inversions. To investigate gene regulatory evolution under gene flow and the role of inversions associated with local adaptation to a steep thermal gradient, we generated RNA-seq data from Atlantic silversides (<span>Menidia menidia</span>) from two locally adapted populations and their F1 hybrids, reared under two temperatures. We found substantial divergence in gene expression and thermal plasticity between populations, with up to 31% of genes being differentially expressed. Reduced thermal plasticity, temperature-dependent gene misexpression, and the disruption of coexpression networks in hybrids point toward a role of regulatory incompatibilities in local adaptation, particularly under colder temperatures. Chromosomal inversions show an accumulation of regulatory incompatibilities but are not consistently enriched for differentially expressed genes. Together, these results suggest that gene regulation can diverge substantially among populations despite gene flow, partly due to the accumulation of temperature-dependent regulatory incompatibilities within inversions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"ff6c60c92f8f2d3dc9b43e6e4edbaa8884d19a40ae518b90d115c0572f6f5cc6","category":"Environment"}
