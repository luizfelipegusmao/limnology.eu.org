{"title":"Physical Layer Security in RIS-NOMA Assisted IoV Systems with Uncertain RIS Deployment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1447/v1","date":1729234623000,"content":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), as an emerging radio technology, is widely used to expand transmission distance and structure cascade channels to improve the performance of communication systems. However, although RIS-NOMA assisted Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication system can improve the overall transmission and rate performance with  continuous development of wireless communication technology, the physical layer security (PLS) issue has gradually attracted attention and becomes more and more important in the application of the system. The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential threaten for PLS, when RIS is utilized in order to improve the security performance of wireless communications. In particular, this work considers the non-fixed of RIS location and wiretapping behavior of eavesdroppers on the data, and further analyzes the maximum safe-rate for above location assumptions. The results show that RIS demonstrates significant advantages on  security performance and provides a useful reference for the security design of future wireless communication systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7111dde22b3f932ed1b9f12dd29e45e3ea7bc4462e2968172c3a3b0a7ff034c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
