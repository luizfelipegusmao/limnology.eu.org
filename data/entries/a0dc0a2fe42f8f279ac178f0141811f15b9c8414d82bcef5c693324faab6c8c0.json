{"title":"Modeling Missile Trajectory and Impact Dynamics with 6 Degree of Freedom Equations of Motion in Virtual Reality Simulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0809/v1","date":1718186322000,"content":"Existing methods for simulating missile dynamics and training often rely on three degrees of freedom (3DOF) motions, limiting their ability to represent the complex maneuvers and targeting strategies of modern missiles. This paper proposes integrating virtual reality (VR) technology with six degrees of freedom (6DOF) dynamics to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of missile simulation and training. By incorporating 6DOF dynamics, simulations can capture the full range of missile motion, providing a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Through VR, users can immerse themselves in realistic missile scenarios, interact with dynamic behaviors in real-time, and refine their targeting and interception skills. The integration of VR with 6DOF dynamics also facilitates real-time feedback and evaluation, enhancing training efficiency and proficiency in missile operations. This approach aims to revolutionize missile training by bridging the gap between traditional simulation methods and real-world dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a0dc0a2fe42f8f279ac178f0141811f15b9c8414d82bcef5c693324faab6c8c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
