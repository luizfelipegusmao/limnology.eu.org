{"title":"A nanopore-based cucumber genome assembly reveals structural variations at two QTLs controlling hypocotyl elongation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/970/7628146?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Xishuangbanna (XIS) cucumber (<span>Cucumis sativus</span> var. <span>xishuangbannanesis</span>) is a semiwild variety that has many distinct agronomic traits. Here, long reads generated by Nanopore sequencing technology helped assembling a high-quality genome (contig N50 = 8.7 Mb) of landrace XIS49. A total of 10,036 structural/sequence variations (SVs) were identified when comparing with Chinese Long (CL), and known SVs controlling spines, tubercles, and carpel number were confirmed in XIS49 genome. Two QTLs of hypocotyl elongation under low light, SH3.1 and SH6.1, were fine-mapped using introgression lines (donor parent, XIS49; recurrent parent, CL). SH3.1 encodes a red-light receptor Phytochrome B (PhyB, CsaV3_3G015190). A ∼4 kb region with large deletion and highly divergent regions (HDRs) were identified in the promoter of the PhyB gene in XIS49. Loss of function of this PhyB caused a super-long hypocotyl phenotype. SH6.1 encodes a CCCH-type zinc finger protein FRIGIDA-ESSENTIAL LIKE (FEL, CsaV3_6G050300). FEL negatively regulated hypocotyl elongation but it was transcriptionally suppressed by long terminal repeats retrotransposon insertion in CL cucumber. Mechanistically, FEL physically binds to the promoter of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1a (COP1a), regulating the expression of COP1a and the downstream hypocotyl elongation. These above results demonstrate the genetic mechanism of cucumber hypocotyl elongation under low light.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"21e7ed4b2be95c8296fa8d2b5278f64bf4cc5f2c2f1deace8dc076260ac9c809","category":"Environment"}
