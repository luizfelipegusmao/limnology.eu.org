{"title":"Improving the Sustainability of Caciocavallo Ragusano Cheese Production and Enhancing Its Role on Consumer Health and Liking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1251/v1","date":1726493437000,"content":"In this study, Caciocavallo Ragusano, a typical cheese produced in Sicily Island (Italy), was ob-tained from milk of dairy cows fed with and without enriched olive cake (ECO and CTR, respec-tively) in order to evaluate nutritional, microbiological, volatile, and sensory differences in cheeses. ECO cheese showed greater (p &lt; 0.05) MUFA and PUFA and polyphenols content, and lower SFA content than CTR cheese. Microbiological analyses revealed the absence of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and E. coli O157, and no significant differences in the vi-able counts of the remaining microbial groups analyzed, between samples. Thermophilic lacto-cocci were more prevalent in ECO cheese. The implementation of culture-independent method, such as PCR-DGGE analyses, revealed the presence of a more diverse microbial population in both cheeses. Regarding the volatile compounds profile, long-chain free fatty acids were more abundant in the ECO cheese resulting in a healthier free fatty acid profile. This study also showed that, especially for their appearance and taste, the consumers mostly appreciated the ECO cheese. Results showed that using enriched olive cake could enhance the sustainability and the quality of Ragusano cheese, improving not only the health of the consumers but also positively influencing tastes and acceptability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1207ef05e3a826fd1388eae9a99caca17888e6cf033405fcc4d789ec2dd95070","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
