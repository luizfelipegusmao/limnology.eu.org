{"title":"Simple derivation of L-absorption spectra of 3d transition metal elements by the self-absorption effect observed in soft X-ray emission spectra","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/73/5/451/7619226?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study proposes a simple evaluation method for deriving L-absorption information from two L-emission spectra of 3d transition metal (TM) elements obtained at two different accelerating voltages. This method realizes a spatial identity for X-ray emission and absorption spectroscopies. This method was evaluated for the Fe L-emission spectra of Fe and its oxides and was applied to the TM L-emission spectra of MnO, Co, CoO and NiO. The derived absorption peak positions were consistent with those obtained previously at synchrotron orbital radiation facilities, which considered the coreâ€“hole effect. This simple derivation method could be useful for obtaining X-ray absorption spectroscopy distribution images from X-ray emission spectroscopy mapping data obtained by scanning electron microscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"54958be43b58bcac650855fd1be5dce3e7a06c592fa2cf200d4053914931f928","category":"Environment"}
