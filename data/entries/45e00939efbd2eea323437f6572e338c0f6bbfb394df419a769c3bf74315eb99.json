{"title":"High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) program in High-School Physical Education Classes for promoting Fitness in Adolescents: a Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2194/v1","date":1724941191000,"content":"This study aims to investigate whether 16 weeks of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) implemented on Physical Education classes (PEC), can improve physical fitness in high-school adolescents This study was a two-arm randomized controlled trial design with adolescents (15-17 years old). Twelve classes were randomized to either a 16 weeks of HIIT (HIIT-G, n = 106 students) implemented on PEC warm-up or a control group (CG, n = 123 students) of usual PEC warm-up. The HIIT sessions ranged from 14 to 20 all-out bouts intervals, adopting a 2:1 work-to-rest ratio. Post-intervention measures revealed a significant difference between groups in CRF and girls from HIIT-G increased their cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with significant difference between female groups and a medium to large effect size. The main findings from this study indicate that brief whole-body HIIT of an extremely low volume, over 16 weeks, can improve CRF in adolescent girls.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45e00939efbd2eea323437f6572e338c0f6bbfb394df419a769c3bf74315eb99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
