{"title":"Oceanographic features boost latitudinal patterns in copepod body size distribution in the South Atlantic","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12694?af=R","date":1728453808000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) is an under-sampled ocean where the influence of environmental drivers on copepod body size is poorly understood. This study investigated the body size distribution of copepods from 13°S to 64°S to test Bergmann's rule, which predicts the occurrence of smaller organisms in warmer areas. We hypothesized that additional influence of oceanographic features strengthens this pattern. Zooplankton were sampled during the austral summer from the chlorophyll maximum depth up to the surface, at approximately 100 m depth, using a 200-<i>μ</i>m net. The samples were analyzed using the ZooScan imaging system and were classified using the Ecotaxa tool. We estimated copepod family abundance, biomass, and size structure, and their relationships with environmental variables were assessed through generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Although most copepods increased in size at higher latitudes, not all families followed Bergmann's rule. Small adults of Clausocalanidae, Paracalanidae, Corycaeidae, and Oncaeidae contributed mostly in the Brazil Current (BC), while Calanidae copepodites disproportionately contributed to overall biomass, and Oithonidae adults were the most abundant in high latitudes. Copepod abundance or biomass hotspots were present in the southern limit of the warm BC, at the Subtropical Confluence Zone, and in the subantarctic waters at the Drake passage. Our results suggest that oceanographic features strengthen latitudinal body size relationships due to food availability, and the importance of different life history strategies.</p>","author":"Érica C.
