{"title":"Bioactivity, Efficacy, and Safety of a Wound Healing Ointment with Medicinal Plant Bioactives: In Vitro and In Vivo Preclinical Evaluations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0824/v1","date":1728557980000,"content":"Chronic wounds have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, necessitating the management of pain, infection, bleeding, and emotional challenges. Debridement, which involves the removal of nonviable tissue, is crucial for promoting wound healing. In addition to surgical methods, cost-effective alternatives such as local solutions and ointments with biological properties have been explored. The use of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and collagen-synthesizing abilities holds promise for wound healing. This study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a wound-healing ointment containing bioactive ingredients derived from medicinal plants (extracts, essential oils, and vegetable oils). Pre-clinical tests were conducted following standardized protocols. The chemical composition of the ointment was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to gain insights into its synergistic action. FTIR analysis revealed similarities between the product's spectrum and that of bioactive compounds. The in vitro tests demonstrated that all formulations of the ointment induced no cell death, DNA damage, or acute toxicity in cell cultures. No lethal dose was observed, indicating the safety of the ointment at all concentrations. In vivo preclinical analyses demonstrated no adverse responses being effective in the healing process, similar to the gold standard (Silver Sulfadiazine). The regenerative ointment displayed excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity in vitro and in vivo studies, contributing to the development of innovative and sustainable wound management therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f7c027e85b51df9d02142d4f9664b6435613e8a8a60538d3c701c88a2423d4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
