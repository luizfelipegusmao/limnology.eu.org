{"title":"How Can Genomics Help or Hinder Wildlife Conservation?","link":"https://new.annurev.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-021022-051810?TRACK=RSS","date":1707955200000,"content":"<div><p>Genomic data are becoming increasingly affordable and easy to collect, and new tools for their analysis are appearing rapidly. Conservation biologists are interested in using this information to assist in management and planning but are typically limited financially and by the lack of genomic resources available for non-model taxa. It is therefore important to be aware of the pitfalls as well as the benefits of applying genomic approaches. Here, we highlight recent methods aimed at standardizing population assessments of genetic variation, inbreeding, and forms of genetic load and methods that help identify past and ongoing patterns of genetic interchange between populations, including those subjected to recent disturbance. We emphasize challenges in applying some of these methods and the need for adequate bioinformatic support. We also consider the promises and challenges of applying genomic approaches to understand adaptive changes in natural populations to predict their future adaptive capacity.</p></div>","author":"Thomas L.
