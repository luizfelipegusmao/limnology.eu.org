{"title":"Solving Fuzzy Transportation Problem: Exploring a Novel Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0157/v1","date":1714712715000,"content":"The Fuzzy Transportation Problem (FTP) represents a significant extension of the Classical Transportation Problem (TP) by introducing uncertainly and imprecision into the parameters involved. Various algorithms have been proposed to solve the FTP, including fuzzy linear programming, metaheuristic algorithms and fuzzy mathematical programming techniques combined with Artificial Neural Networks. This paper presents the application of Trigonometric Acceleration Coefficients-PSO (TrigAc-PSO), a variation of the Classical Particle Swarm optimization algorithm, which is an innovative algorithm originally developed for solving the TP. TrigAC-PSO, has demonstrated remarkable success in optimizing various problem domains in crisp environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3df5ee7e6c62153c85e93ce3800eeb95ddf67997d169de93702dcfb2a498d09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
