{"title":"Secondary sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic shifts in habitat use by the lesser guitarfish Zapteryx brevirostris","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15833?af=R","date":1718594394000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Sexual dimorphisms are generated by divergent processes, such as natural or sexual selection and niche convergence. Males and females of the lesser guitarfish, <i>Zapteryx brevirostris</i>, present morphological differences in their discs, and the relationships with the species biology and ecology were unrecognized. Analysing the morphometry of 201 specimens and the influence of bottom features on the frequencies of 188 specimens among life stages and sexes, we found strong evidence that gonadal maturation leads to dimorphisms on discs, validating a concavity on male pectoral fins as a secondary sexual dimorphism and rejecting the hypothesis that such dimorphisms were related to ecological pressures. The principal component analysis (PCA) and permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA) analyses revealed that males and females shared similar body aspects until they reached maturity, mainly due to lower variations in <i>W</i>\n<sub>D</sub>, <i>W</i>\n<sub>R</sub>, <i>L</i>\n<sub>D</sub>, <i>D</i>\n<sub>PRO</sub>, and <i>L</i>\n<sub>SC</sub> at younger life stages. The relationships of these variables with <i>L</i>\n<sub>T</sub> corroborate the former results, showing a changing point around <i>L</i>\n<sub>T</sub> &gt; 30 cm where females started to attain larger measurements than males. Moreover, we revealed ontogenetic shifts, with adults from both sexes exploring different habitats than juveniles and subadults. Differences in frequencies of each life stage were best explained by organic matter (OM) with the adults exploring bottom habitats of higher concentrations of OM than juveniles and subadults, strengthening the assumption that body differences between sexes are not related to ecological pressures. These results bring not only new insights about the possible advantages that those morphometric differences provide to males while mating but also information about the abiotic influences on species distribution, which, along with knowledge of local oceanographic dynamics and benthic community patterns, would inform actions for species conservation.</p>","author":"Thamíris C.
