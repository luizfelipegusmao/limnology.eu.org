Cristea</p>\r\n\r\nAt the core of organelle functions lies their ability and need to form dynamic organelleâ€“organelle networks that drive intracellular communication and coordination of cellular pathways. These networks are facilitated by membrane contact sites (MCSs) that promote both intra-organelle and inter-organelle communication. Given their multiple functions, MCSs and the proteins that form them are commonly co-opted by viruses during infection to promote viral replication. This Essay discusses mechanisms acquired by diverse human viruses to regulate MCS functions in either proviral processes or host defense. It also examines techniques used for examining MCSs in the context of viral infections.","author":"William A.
