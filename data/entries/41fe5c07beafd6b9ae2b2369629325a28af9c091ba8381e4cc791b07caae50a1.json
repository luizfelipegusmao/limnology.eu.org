{"title":"Correlating Quantified Cathodoluminescence Spectra in Jadeite with Micro-scale Color Measurements in Visible-Near Infrared Reflectance Spectrometry","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.009/7719459?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Cultures throughout history have valued jadeite jade (hereinafter jade), a natural material assemblage composed predominately of the NaAl endmember pyroxene, jadeite (NaAlSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) that is prized for its mechanical properties and enticing coloration [<a href=\"#ozae044.009-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.009-B2\">2</a>]. The geological setting for the formation of jadeite-rich rocks and associated complex geochemical phenomena is well documented in the literature [<a href=\"#ozae044.009-B3\">3-5</a>]. Unlike single crystal gems, jade often contains a mixture of colors, but the stone is perhaps best known for exhibiting a range of green hues from pale green to blue green, and to deep green [<a href=\"#ozae044.009-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.009-B6\">6</a>]. Efforts to classify jade color include qualitative matching to a set of reference color tiles, and less commonly, use of a more quantitative set of color perception values first established by International Commission on Illumination’s (CIE 1931) color space, which includes values for light-dark luminance level (L*), a green-red vector (a*), and a blue-yellow vector (b*) [<a href=\"#ozae044.009-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.009-B8\">8</a>]. Two principal mechanisms have been identified as the cause of green coloration in jadeite: 1) the chemical state of impurity Fe, either 2+ or 3+, and 2) minor to trace Cr in the crystal structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.009-B9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.009-B10\">10</a>]. Previous studies have associated Cr<sup>3+</sup> with cathodoluminescence (CL) spectral features in jadeite using point spectrometry, with more recent connections made via 2D CL spectrum imaging [<a href=\"#ozae044.009-B11\">11-13</a>]. In this effort, we are seeking to establish whether Cr impurities are correlated with green coloration in jadeite using micro-scale (≤110 μm) visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) reflectance spectrometry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"41fe5c07beafd6b9ae2b2369629325a28af9c091ba8381e4cc791b07caae50a1","category":"Environment"}
