{"title":"Phytoremediation of Mercury Contamination: Bibliometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2281/v1","date":1722241306000,"content":"Mercury is classified as one of the worldâ€™s most toxic and dangerous pollutants. It tends to bio-accumulate and biomagnify within the trophic chain and is persistent. Various approaches are available to remediate Hg-affected sites, including phytoremediation, which includes the use of plants to clean up contaminated environments. Phytoremediation of mercury contamination is at-tracting increasing attention because of its advantages: it is environmentally friendly, inexpensive, simple, and can improve soil fertility. In this report, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix software were used to analyze 457 and 697 documents published from 2000 to 2023, retrieved from the data-bases WoS and Scopus, respectively. China, India, the United States, and Spain are the top four most productive countries. The largest topic area was environmental sciences, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences was the organization that contributed the most to the overall number of pub-lications. The keywords with the highest frequency, excluding phytoremediation and mercury in WoS, were heavy metals, accumulation, cadmium, soils, and phytoextraction. In Scopus, the most frequent keywords were bioremediation, heavy metals, soil pollution, bioaccumulation, biodeg-radation, and environmental. From the above analysis, we concluded that future research should focus on 1) finding native plants, 2) increasing remediation ability through assisted phytoremedi-ation, 3) studies of molecular mechanisms in plants with phytoremediation potential, and 4) ge-netic engineering applications. This study provides insight into trending themes and serves as a reference for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa10278f3a4f18edf113fcb9dab59b3bde48b6a00563e8f4a757680c0d691401","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
