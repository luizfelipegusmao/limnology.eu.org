{"title":"LADRC-based grid-connected control strategy for single-phase LCL-type inverters","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303591","date":1715781600000,"content":"<p>by Zhi Feng, Xiaojie Zhou, Chan Wang, Weizhou Huang, Ziqi Chen</p>\r\n\r\nTo ensure that grid-connected currents are of high quality, it is crucial to optimize the dynamic performance of grid-connected inverters and their control. This study suggests using a combination of reduced-order linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) and a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. By applying this control strategy to a single-phase photovoltaic grid-connected system, the systemâ€™s ability to suppress grid harmonics is significantly improved. The validity and effectiveness of this control approach have been confirmed through simulations and experiments. The results show that the LADRC-based control system is robust and capable of rejecting disturbances, resulting in a significant reduction in the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of grid-connected currents. Comparative analysis with traditional control methods demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed approach.","author":"Zhi Feng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce24845398332b64d2be2ee3b5b4347996a4385187f7b9af4b4ae7880eaa1de2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
