{"title":"Results of the Terrestrial Laser Scanning Survey in the Underground Mining of the Oyu Tolgoi Project to Determine Cross Penetrating Length and Volumes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1583/v1","date":1711443331000,"content":"The paper presents the results of high precision control survey carried out in the underground mining of Oyu Tolgoi project using terrestrial laser scanning technology. The purpose of the measurements is to ensure the heading, total length and volume of the penetration and excavation works are being implementing in accordance with the planned and designed dimensions. We established a network of 18 reference points in the tunnel of the selected underground level which were repeatedly measured 4 times by two round readings of the Trimble S7 tacheometry and processed by using the Trimble Business Center software. All points except the one was within the permissible error. Based on these points the excavation length and volumes were determined using the Trimble SX12 laser scanner.\n\tThe difference between the planned work quantity provided by the Oyu Tolgoi project and the actual values measured by the laser scanning was calculated using the comparative method. The TLS partial control measurements  in the excavations made through the ore bodies revealed the length of  20285.72 m and volume of 441128.80 m3 for underground 7 mine levels while their project values were 16158.26 m length and 422837.50 m3 volume, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf607929b4b13bbdc0d6cc3cc4fc45efc04b1d8e42dcbd518be8adbde96064e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
