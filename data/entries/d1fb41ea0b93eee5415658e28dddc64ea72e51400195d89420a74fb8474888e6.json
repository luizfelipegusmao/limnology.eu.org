{"title":"Host plant preference of Lygus hesperus (Hemiptera: Miridae) in 4 field crops: potato, alfalfa, carrot, and pea","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/2/288/7618425?rss=1","date":1709424000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The western tarnished plant bug, <span>Lygus hesperus</span> (Knight), has emerged as a pest of potatoes (<span>Solanum tuberosum</span> L.) in the Lower Columbia Basin of Oregon and Washington. This species is generally found infesting several other field-grown crops in the region; however, their host preference is poorly understood. Thus, greenhouse cage experiments were conducted to evaluate <span>L. hesperus</span> host preference by simultaneously presenting adults with 4 host plants: potato, alfalfa, <span>Medicago sativa</span> L., carrot, <span>Daucus carota</span> L., and pea, <span>Pisum sativum</span> L. In addition, an oviposition test was conducted. The results indicated that <span>L. hesperus</span> actively chose as a host and as an oviposition substrate among the 4 host plants. We found a significantly higher number of adults on alfalfa and potato plants over carrot or pea plants at 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h after adults were released into the cage. However, 96 h after release, more <span>L. hesperus</span> were found in alfalfa. In addition, female <span>L. hesperus</span> strongly preferred potato and alfalfa plants as an oviposition substrate over carrot and pea plants at 96 h after release.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"d1fb41ea0b93eee5415658e28dddc64ea72e51400195d89420a74fb8474888e6","category":"Environment"}
