The emphasis is on exploring the stability and delivery of gene-specific double-stranded RNA, particularly through nanoencapsulation. This is because the susceptibility of dsRNA to degradation and limited cellular penetration, emphasising the need for effective delivery mechanisms. The review presents an in-depth exploration of nanoparticles for the encapsulation and delivery of dsRNA, including virus-like particles (VLPs), and non-viral based nanoparticles such as liposomes, chitosan, and beta-glucan. VLPs, derived from non-infectious shrimp virus structures, exhibit biocompatibility and natural functionality, making them suitable carriers for dsRNA. The application of chitosan and its derivatives are explored for their efficacy in reducing viral infections in shrimp. Beta-glucan particles are examined for their immunostimulant properties in shrimp aquaculture. The text emphasises the use of yeast-based glucan particles for encapsulating dsRNA, showcasing their potential in preventing viral diseases in shrimp. The review introduces cautionary considerations for nanoparticle formulation, highlighting factors such as pH, organic solvents, metal ions, and environmental ribonuclease that can impact dsRNA stability during synthesis. In conclusion, the text discusses the potential economic worthiness and environmental risk assessment of dsRNA technology in shrimp aquaculture. While acknowledging successful applications in other environments, it underscores the need for regulatory approval and risk assessment for dsRNA-based products in the aquaculture industry. The evaluation of dsRNA in real-world shrimp farms is deemed necessary for commercial utilisation, taking into account income, expenses, safety, and environmental considerations.</p>","author":"Veasarach Jonjaroen, \nPatai Charoonnart, \nSarocha Jitrakorn, \nPanwajee Payongsri, \nRudee Surarit, \nVanvimon Saksmerprome, \nNuttawee Niamsiri","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"0a3d9882e7ce4fbe688c0ccfaa9c3ab19497ced5c97a1974d98ce37308f4863f","category":"Environment"}
