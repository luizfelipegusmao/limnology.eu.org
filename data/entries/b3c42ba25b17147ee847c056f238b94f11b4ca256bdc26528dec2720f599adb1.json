{"title":"Woody invaders of a temperate forest have unique root-associated fungal communities","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10530-024-03384-5","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Non-native, invasive plants are increasingly common in Eastern North American forests, but their impact on soil fungi remains unclear. We used DNA metabarcoding to investigate the effects of nativity, plant mycorrhizal type and soil factors on root-associated fungal communities. We focused on understory woody plants in a deciduous forest tract in central New York state, and included three plant types, invasive arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), native AM, and native ectomycorrhizal (EM), each represented by 3â€“5 species. We found lower fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) diversity in EM than AM plants, but no OTU diversity difference between native and invasive AM species. Pathogen OTU richness and relative abundance were not distinct between plant types. OTU composition was influenced by host mycorrhizal type and by AM plant nativity, with mycorrhizal fungi being important drivers in both cases. The relationships of soil characteristics (e.g., pH) with OTU composition were independent of plant nativity and mycorrhizal type. Specific root length of native AM species was lower than that of invasive AM plants, while EM plants were intermediate. Irrespective of plant type, OTU composition was distinct among plant species, particularly in fungal communities associated with the invader <em>Rhamnus cathartica</em>. These results suggest that invasive AM plants may shift fungal composition relative to native AM and EM plants, with potential long-term consequences for soil biodiversity.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"b3c42ba25b17147ee847c056f238b94f11b4ca256bdc26528dec2720f599adb1","category":"Environment"}
