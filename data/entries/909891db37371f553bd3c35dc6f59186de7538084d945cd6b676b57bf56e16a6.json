{"title":"Longitudinal Associations between Emotional Resilience and Mental Health among Chinese Adolescents in the School Context: The Mediating Role of Positive Emotions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1782/v1","date":1719325552000,"content":"(1) Background: Emotional resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals to cultivate positive emotions and effectively navigate through negative emotions in terms of stress or adversity. Recent research has focused on the significant impact of adolescentsâ€™ negative emotions, as opposed to positive emotions, on mental health. The examination of positive emotion provides a distinct viewpoint on the relationship between emotional resilience and mental health in adolescents. Consequently, the current research conducted two separate investigations to examine the impact of adolescent emotional resilience on mental health, as well as the mediating influence of positive emotion. (2) Methods: Study 1 comprised a cross-sectional analysis of 3086 Chinese adolescents, while Study 2 involved a longitudinal examination of 266 Chinese adolescents. (3) Results: Results indicated that emotional resilience was associated with enhanced levels of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and overall mental health, while also demonstrating a negative correlation with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Positive emotions were found to have a partial mediating effect on the relationship between emotional resilience and mental health. These results indicate that emotional resilience not only has a direct impact on mental health but also influences mental health indirectly through positive emotions. (4) Conclusions: The findings highlighted the role of emotional resilience in mitigating psychological problems and enhancing mental health in Chinese adolescents. The implications and limitations were discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"909891db37371f553bd3c35dc6f59186de7538084d945cd6b676b57bf56e16a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
