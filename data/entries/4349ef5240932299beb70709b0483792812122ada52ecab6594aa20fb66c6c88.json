{"title":"Opportunities and Challenges Impeding the Adoption of Community Engagement and Service Learning in African Higher Education Institutions: A Minireview and Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1842/v1","date":1719391746000,"content":"The higher education sector in Africa has experienced remarkable growth over the past decades, enrolling and graduating millions of students annually. Despite this progress, high unemployment rates among graduates and pervasive underdevelopment have raised questions about the relevance of higher education in Africa. Critics have intensely scrutinized the quality of curricula, highlighting a significant mismatch between the skills offered and the demands of the job market. This disconnect is often due to curricula that are unresponsive to both job requirements and students' needs. Enhanced pedagogical approaches are essential to address this issue. Community engagement and service learning (CE&amp;SL) offer promising solutions by bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Recognizing the potential benefits, higher education institutions across the continent are gradually integrating CE and SL into their teaching and research frameworks. However, the adoption of these approaches has been slow.\nThis paper explores the opportunities and challenges hindering the effective and widespread implementation of CE and SL in African higher education institutions and proposes practical strategies to overcome these obstacles. By embracing these innovative approaches, African universities can better prepare graduates for the dynamic job market and contribute more effectively to the continent's development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4349ef5240932299beb70709b0483792812122ada52ecab6594aa20fb66c6c88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
