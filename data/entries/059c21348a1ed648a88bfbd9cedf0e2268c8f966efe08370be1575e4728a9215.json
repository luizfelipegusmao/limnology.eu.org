{"title":"Food Waste Valorisation: Leveraging on Singapore&rsquo;s Zero Waste Masterplan and 30-by-30 Goal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0797/v1","date":1718177674000,"content":"Singapore, being a land-scarce country, is heavily dependent on imported food, which poses a challenge in ensuring food security. In addition, the substantial amount of food waste generated in Singapore further deepens food insecurity challenges, imposing enormous pressure on the country's food and land resources. In the recent years, valorising food waste streams into higher value products has been an increasing trend in tackling food wastage due to its economical and environmental benefits. This paper provides a thorough review on food waste valorisation in Singapore and summarizes critical information from the current food landscape to the food waste management strategies adopted. The review highlights the prototypes developed from food waste streams by the local research and development capabilities and the technological processing and techniques used for versatile applications ranging from food and nutraceuticals to urban agriculture. The challenges associated with the valorisation of food waste are also addressed. Two ambitious Initiatives by the Singapore government Zero Waste Plan and the 30-by-30 food security goal to encourage food waste valorisation are explored and presented. The review serves as a reference for other countries in ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"059c21348a1ed648a88bfbd9cedf0e2268c8f966efe08370be1575e4728a9215","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
