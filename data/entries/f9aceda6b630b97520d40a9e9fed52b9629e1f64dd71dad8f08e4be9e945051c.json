{"title":"Design and Investigation of Hybrid Microfluidic Micromixer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1780/v1","date":1714205761000,"content":"Nowadays, microfluidics has become an anarchist interdisciplinary topic with considerable attention in a wide range of biotechnology applications. In this research work, numerical investigation of microfluidic micro-mixer is carried out using hybrid actuation approach with different micropillar shapes and gaps. For this purpose, COMSOL Multiphysics is used with three different physics such as thermoviscous acoustic to solve acoustic governing equations, laminar physics is used to solve fluid flow governing equations and diluted transport species is used to solve mixing governing equations. The simulations were carried out with flow velocity of 200 Âµm/s at both inlets with an oscillation frequency of 15kHz. The outcomes were in the form of acoustic characteristics such as acoustic pressure, acoustic velocity, acoustic streaming and mixing index. The results revealed that the inclusion of micropillars enhanced the mixing performance and strength of acoustic field resulting in improvement of mixing performance compared to the case without micropillars. In addition, it was also investigated that blade shape micropillars with 0.150 mm gaps deliver best results compared to the other cases with maximum and minimum values of the mixing index 0.95 and 0.72 respectively. The obtained results can be extremely helpful for design and modifications of hybrid microfluidics micro-mixer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9aceda6b630b97520d40a9e9fed52b9629e1f64dd71dad8f08e4be9e945051c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
