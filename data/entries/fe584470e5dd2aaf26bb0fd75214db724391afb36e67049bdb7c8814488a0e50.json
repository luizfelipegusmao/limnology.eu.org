Yet, while sensorineural hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders worldwide, gene therapy applied to the human inner ear is still in its infancy. Recent advances in the development recombinant AAVs have significantly improved their cell tropism and transduction efficiency across diverse inner ear cell types to a level that renders this tool valuable for conditionally manipulating gene expression in the context of developmental biology studies of the mouse inner ear. Here, we describe a protocol for <i>in utero</i> micro-injection of AAVs into the embryonic inner ear, using the AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-DJ serotypes that respectively target the sensory hair cells and the supporting cells of the auditory sensory epithelium. We also aimed to standardize procedures for imaging acquisition and image analysis to foster research reproducibility and allow accurate comparisons between studies. We find that AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-DJ provide efficient and reliable tools for conditional gene expression targeting cochlear sensory and supporting cells in the mouse inner ear, from late embryonic stages on.","author":"Carla Maria Barbosa Spinola","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fe584470e5dd2aaf26bb0fd75214db724391afb36e67049bdb7c8814488a0e50","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
