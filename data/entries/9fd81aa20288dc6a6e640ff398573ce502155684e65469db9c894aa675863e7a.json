{"title":"Collagen and Its Derivatives Serving Biomedical Purposes: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1673/v1","date":1724364955000,"content":"Biomaterials have been the subject of extensive research, with their applications in medicine and pharmacy expanding rapidly. Collagen and its derivatives stand out as valuable biomaterials due to their high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and lack of toxicity and immunogenicity. This review comprehensively examines collagen from various sources, its extraction and processing methods, and its structural and functional properties. Preserving the native state of collagen is crucial for maintaining its beneficial characteristics. The challenges associated with chemically modifying collagen to tailor its properties for specific clinical needs are also addressed. The review discusses various collagen-based biomaterials, including solutions, hydrogels, powders, sponges, scaffolds, and thin films. These materials have broad applications in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and wound healing. Additionally, the review highlights current research trends related to collagen and its derivatives. These trends may significantly influence future developments, such as using collagen-based bioinks for 3D bioprinting or exploring new collagen nanoparticle preparation methods and drug delivery systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9fd81aa20288dc6a6e640ff398573ce502155684e65469db9c894aa675863e7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
