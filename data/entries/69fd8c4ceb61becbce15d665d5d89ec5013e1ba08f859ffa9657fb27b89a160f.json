{"title":"Bimonthly variation in nutrient composition and taste components of Crassostrea gigas cultured in Rushan, Southern yellow sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16139?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Oyster (<i>Ostrea gigas thunberg</i>) has high nutritional and economic values. We analysed bimonthly nutrient-level variations in Rushan oyster (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>) to establish a basis for the analysis of the nutritional quality of oysters. The contents of the proximate composition, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals and non-volatile taste substances were measured using Pacific oysters collected between March 2019 and May 2020; this was followed by comparing the impact of seasonal fluctuations on oyster composition. The findings demonstrated that the contents of crude protein and amino acids with seasonal features were higher in the summer and decreased in the winter and spring. Moreover, crude fat and fatty acid content were found to be higher in the winter and spring and decrease in the summer. Winter and spring have greater EUC values and several taste components than summer and autumn. In conclusion, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> are more nutritious and delectable from March through May. These findings are useful in determining the ideal season for harvesting and consuming oyster products.</p>","author":"Xinnan Zhao, \nJixing Peng, \nHaiyan Wu, \nGuanchao Zheng, \nMengmeng Guo, \nXuming Kang, \nZhijun Tan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"69fd8c4ceb61becbce15d665d5d89ec5013e1ba08f859ffa9657fb27b89a160f","category":"Environment"}
