{"title":"Histone Methyltransferase SUV39H2 Supports Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cell Metastasis by Regulation of SIRT1","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24370?af=R","date":1720781086000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor with high metastatic features originating from the nasopharynx. However, the underlying mechanism of Suppressor of variegation 3–9 homolog 2 (SUV39H2) in NPC remains poorly understood. RT-qPCR was carried out to examine SUV39H2 and SIRT1 expression in NPC tissues and cells. Kaplan–Meier method was utilized to evaluate the association between SUV39H2 level and overall survival. The function of SUV39H2 and SIRT1 in NPC cell viability, metastasis, and apoptosis was tested through CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry experiments. Here, it was uncovered that SUV39H2 level was augmented in NPC tissues and cells. Moreover, SUV39H2 expedited NPC cell viability, metastasis, and inhibited apoptosis, while SIRT1 addition reversed these impacts. Besides, SUV39H2 induced H3K9me3 enhancement to repress SIRT1 transcription via binding to SIRT1 promoter. Collectively, our results demonstrated upregulated SUV39H2 aggravated NPC tumorigenesis through SIRT1, which may offer a potential therapeutic target for NPC.</p>","author":"Jianqiang You, \nHaixiang Xue, \nChangjiang Chao, \nZhixuan Zhang, \nXiaoye Tan, \nXiaoye Wang, \nHaifeng Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"310b3ba2f7e613a53cc55e753560e6d7aeec674aabc42fc02a0036959fbf271c","category":"Environment"}
