{"title":"Design and Evaluation of a Powered Exoskeleton for Individuals with Spinal Cord Injury: An Experimental Study of Safety, Usability, and Kinematic Performance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1125/v1","date":1715876205000,"content":"Exoskeleton technology has been shown to be useful for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), potentially facilitating their recovery of motor function and social reintegration. However, studies on the safety and usability of exoskeletons are limited. This study aimed to design a powered exoskeleton for SCI and evaluate its safety and usability. Ten healthy adults participated in this study. The prototype exoskeleton featured an adjustable frame, computer-controlled hip and knee joint actuators, and a gait-trigger sensor. The experimental actions included walking, standing, and sitting, with and without the prototype. Safety outcomes included adverse events, vital signs, numerical rating scale (NRS) scores for pain, discomfort, and fatigue, and prototype-human body clearance. Usability outcomes included donning and doffing times, subjective ratings, gait speed, stride length, and kinematic parameters of hip and knee joint angles. Safety outcomes showed no serious adverse events, stable vital signs, minimal NRS scores, and acceptable clearance. Usability outcomes showed high efficiency and received positive ratings. Kinematic parameters showed significant positive correlations between normal walking and walking with the prototype for both hip and knee joint angles, confirming its effectiveness in assisting walking. However, further device improvements and gait parameter tuning are necessary for future clinical application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee57f7d104411bb3c8278d58d583ddedd60dc1830b6f5cce65589480e646c980","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
