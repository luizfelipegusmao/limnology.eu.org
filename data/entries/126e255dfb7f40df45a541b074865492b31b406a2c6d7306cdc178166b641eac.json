{"title":"Efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine containing hawthorn for hyperlipidemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae035/7625491?rss=1","date":1710115200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The traditional Chinese herb hawthorn is gaining attention for its potential to lower lipid levels due to its active components that positively influence lipid metabolism. Our meta-analysis of fourteen randomized controlled trials compared traditional Chinese medicine containing hawthorn with conventional lipid-lowering drugs for hyperlipidemia. Hawthorn-based medicine showed promise in reducing total cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, albeit less effective than standard drugs in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, caution is needed due to methodological limitations in some trials, emphasizing the importance of further well-designed studies to clarify hawthornâ€™s efficacy in managing hyperlipidemia.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"126e255dfb7f40df45a541b074865492b31b406a2c6d7306cdc178166b641eac","category":"Environment"}
