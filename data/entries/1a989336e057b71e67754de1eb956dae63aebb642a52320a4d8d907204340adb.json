{"title":"Assessment and Prioritization of Sub-Watersheds Vulnerable to Soil Erosion in an Ungauged River Basin Using MOORA, COPRAS, MARCOS and MABAC Methods","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12524-024-01942-x","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Identifying soil erosion-prone zones in an ungauged river basin is crucial for devising and implementing timely soil protection measures to mitigate soil degradation and protect soil quality. Soil erosion damages the fragile ecosystem, decreases soil fertility, and reduces reservoir water storage, thereby impacting food production. The prime motive of the current research work is to assess and categorize on the basis of priority the sub-watersheds (SWs) susceptible to substantial soil erosion in the Ponnaniyar River basin (an ungauged river basin) based on the morphometric parameters that impact soil erosion. To achieve this research objective, four multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches based on the outranking approach and synthesis method are adopted to facilitate the decision-making process by considering an integrated and balanced assessment of multiple complex parameters for devising effective soil conservation measures to minimize soil erosion. Cartosat-1 digital elevation model (DEM) is employed to extract eighteen morphometric parameters under linear, shape, areal, relief and hypsometric aspects. The priority of SWs obtained by different MCDM techniques is evaluated using percentage of variation and intensity of variation. The outcomes show that the MABAC method is effective in prioritizing SWs with the least percentage of variation (59.61%) and intensity of variation (4.397). It is also found to be the best method for integration with the RSS method for determining SW priority with a root sum of squares value of 43. SW1 is identified to be highly vulnerable to soil erosion with a grade average value of 1.00 followed by SW2 (3.00), SW3 (3.25) and SW13 (5.00), requiring immediate implementation of watershed planning and management measures to control the extent of soil erosion and safeguard soil resources.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"1a989336e057b71e67754de1eb956dae63aebb642a52320a4d8d907204340adb","category":"Environment"}
