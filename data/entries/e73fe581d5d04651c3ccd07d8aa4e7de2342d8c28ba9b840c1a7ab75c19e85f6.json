Studies have shown that about a quarter of these mothers will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result. This study aims to identify internal personality factors associated with the development of PTSD in mothers who gave birth before 33 weeks. The results revealed significant correlations between two personality dimensions (neuroticism and extraversion) and the likeliness of developing PTSD in mothers who gave birth prematurely. Neuroticism is positively liked with the disorder while extraversion is negatively correlated with it. Studies should now focus on early detection of PTSD and better interventions for these mothers.","author":"Laurane Grand","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e73fe581d5d04651c3ccd07d8aa4e7de2342d8c28ba9b840c1a7ab75c19e85f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
