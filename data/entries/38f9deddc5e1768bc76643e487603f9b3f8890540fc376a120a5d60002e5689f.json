{"title":"Alignment of Track Oscillations during Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-023-3073-y","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Recent studies on tropical cyclone (TC) intensity change indicate that the development of a vertically aligned TC circulation is a key feature of its rapid intensification (RI), however, understanding how vortex alignment occurs remains a challenging topic in TC intensity change research. Based on the simulation outputs of North Atlantic Hurricane Wilma (2005) and western North Pacific Typhoon Rammasun (2014), vortex track oscillations at different vertical levels and their associated role in vortex alignment are examined to improve our understanding of the vortex alignment during RI of TCs with initial hurricane intensity. It is found that vortex tracks at different vertical levels oscillate consistently in speed and direction during the RI of the two simulated TCs. While the consistent track oscillation reduces the oscillation tilt during RI, the reduction of vortex tilt results mainly from the mean track before RI. It is also found that the vortex tilt is primarily due to the mean vortex track before and after RI. The track oscillations are closely associated with wavenumber-1 vortex Rossby waves that are dominant wavenumber-1 circulations in the TC inner-core region. This study suggests that the dynamics of the wavenumber-1 vortex Rossby waves play an important role in the regulation of the physical processes associated with the track oscillation and vertical alignment of TCs.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"38f9deddc5e1768bc76643e487603f9b3f8890540fc376a120a5d60002e5689f","category":"Environment"}
