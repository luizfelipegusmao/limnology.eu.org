{"title":"Optimizing the Complexity of Higher-Order Moment Inclusion in Portfolio Management with the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1019/v1","date":1726148384000,"content":".This paper explores the effectiveness of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) and traditional Mean-Variance optimization in financial portfolio management. Using a dataset comprising global financial assets, we applied both methodologies to optimize portfolios based on multiple objectives, including risk, return, skewness, and kurtosis. The findings reveal that NSGA-III outperforms the Mean-Variance method in achieving a more diverse set of Pareto-optimal portfolios. NSGA-III portfolios exhibited superior performance in balancing risk and return, demonstrated by higher Sharpe ratios, more favorable skewness, and lower kurtosis. Additionally, NSGA-III's ability to simultaneously optimize across multiple conflicting objectives highlights its robustness in navigating complex financial landscapes, offering enhanced portfolio resilience. In contrast, the Mean-Variance approach, while effective in achieving balanced risk and return, was limited in addressing higher-order moments of the return distribution. These results underscore NSGA-III's potential as a powerful tool for portfolio optimization, providing a comprehensive alternative to traditional methods in modern financial markets where multiple objectives must be considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbb3802c83fd7d4e56086bf405c698fc2ab480dde66ed8526c0c81cdd43c1c20","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
