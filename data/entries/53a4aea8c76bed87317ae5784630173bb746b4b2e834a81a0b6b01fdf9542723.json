To proactively manage pest resistance, there is an urgent need to better understand the genetic basis of resistance to Vip3Aa, which has been largely unknown. We discovered that retrotransposon-mediated alternative splicing of a midgut-specific chitin synthase gene was associated with 5,560-fold resistance to Vip3Aa in a laboratory-selected strain of the fall armyworm, a globally important crop pest. The same mutation in this gene was also detected in a field population. Knockout of this gene via CRISPR/Cas9 caused high levels of resistance to Vip3Aa in fall armyworm and 2 other lepidopteran pests. The insights provided by these results could help to advance monitoring and management of pest resistance to Vip3Aa.","author":"Zhenxing Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"53a4aea8c76bed87317ae5784630173bb746b4b2e834a81a0b6b01fdf9542723","category":"Environment"}
