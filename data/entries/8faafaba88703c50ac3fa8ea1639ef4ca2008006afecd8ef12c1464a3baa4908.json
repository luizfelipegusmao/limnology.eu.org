{"title":"Charge Phenomena in the Elastic Backscattering of Electrons from Insulating Polymers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0227/v1","date":1719924731000,"content":"Elastic peak electron spectroscopy, abbreviated EPES, involves ana- lyzing the line shape found in the elastic peak. The reduction in the energy of electrons of the elastic peak is a result of energy transfer to the target atoms, a phenomenon known as recoil energy. EPES differs from other electron spectroscopies in its unique ability to identify hydrogen in polymers and hydrogenated carbon-based materials. This feature is particularly noteworthy because lighter elements exhibit stronger energy shifts.\nThe energy difference between the positions of the elastic peak of carbon and the elastic peak of hydrogen tends to increase as the kinetic energy of the incident electrons increases.\nIf, during electron irradiation of an insulating polymer, the number of secondary electrons emitted by the surface is less than the number of electrons absorbed in the sample, the surface floats energetically until it stabilizes at a potential energy eVs. As a result, the interaction energy changes and modifies the energy difference between the elastic peaks of hydrogen and carbon.\nIn this study, the charge effects are evaluated using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the EPES spectra of electrons interacting with polystyrene and polyethylene.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8faafaba88703c50ac3fa8ea1639ef4ca2008006afecd8ef12c1464a3baa4908","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
