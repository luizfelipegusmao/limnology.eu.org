{"title":"Simulation-Based Medical Education: 3D Printing and the Seldinger Technique","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0411/v1","date":1715088196000,"content":"3D-printed models with high anatomic fidelity are an increasingly viable tool in simulation-based medical education. One advantage of 3D models is they provide enhanced tactile and spatial understanding of complex anatomy to develop technical skills used in minimally invasive procedures. We propose that 3D anatomical models can improve the development of Interventional Radiology vascular access skills – first described in the 1950s as the Seldinger Technique – for pre-clerkship medical students. Early adoption of 3D-printed technology in pre-clinical medical education can lead to improved student engagement and satisfaction when learning procedural techniques. This study involved creating a 3D model of the upper extremity vasculature from an anonymized CT angiogram, using it as a medical education tool for 31 pre-clinical medical students practicing the Seldinger Technique on a prefabricated venipuncture arm, and assessing student satisfaction with this form of learning. Overall, attendees responded positively to the incorporation of the 3D model in medical education to improve their anatomic understanding and application to the Seldinger Technique. These results indicate that the use of 3D models in simulation-based medical education can provide benefits to acquiring technical skills and the potential to decrease training costs without harming a patient.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"08553e7a8d8c2205ddee3f640b209aaf7a1ea480b9344a9746a325427b36faf3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
