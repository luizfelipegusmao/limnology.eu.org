{"title":"Ten-Year Observational Study of Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma: Clinical Outcomes, Prognostic Factors, and Five-Year Survival Rates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1687/v1","date":1727086656000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with lung adenocarcinoma being the most prevalent subtype. This study aims to review the clinical data and survival outcomes of patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 471 patients who had surgery for lung adenocarcinoma at our institution. Their medical histories, including previous neoplasms, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and symptoms, were thoroughly reviewed. We calculated the overall survival rate and evaluated the impact of tumor grading and spread through air spaces (STAS) on patient outcomes. Results: The survival rate for the entire cohort was 76.23%. There was no significant difference in survival rates between patients classified as G1 and G2, suggesting that a simplified two-tier grading system may be more effective. Patients with STAS had a lower survival rate than those without STAS. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a simplified grading system may improve prognostic evaluations for lung adenocarcinoma patients. Furthermore, STAS is a crucial factor affecting survival rates and should be considered in future treatment strategies. Expanding research in this area is essential to enhance treatment approaches for lung adenocarcinoma patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b34da75d486de4108f7adb832981887c516dc7b6a07d2f18002277ecba71b687","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
