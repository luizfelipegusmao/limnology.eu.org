{"title":"Dynamic Models of Mechanical Seals for Turbomachinery Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1664/v1","date":1719211834000,"content":"One of the primary causes of the mechanical seal failure is rotor vibration. Traditional dynamic seal models often would not be able to fully explaining the failure mechanisms. The seal dynamic models proposed in this paper, including those developed by the authors, prove valuable in predicting seal dynamics during operation in specific turbomachinery and in explaining the causes of seal failure. The single-mass dynamic model is suitable for analyzing contact mechanical seal and simple design dry gas seals dynamics. The two-mass dynamic model is used for investigating operational dynamics processes in classical dry gas seals under complex loading conditions. The three-mass dynamic model is used to study various complex mechanical seal types. This model is able to determine the normal operating condition range and to explain leakage mechanisms in the presence of excessive rotor vibrations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec0bfcb01d91a48fd7b590aee8e9aef4b5d16712ffaa35fedc551c470897670f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
