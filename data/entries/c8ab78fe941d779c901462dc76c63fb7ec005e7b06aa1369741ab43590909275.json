{"title":"A Rose by Any Other Name: The Long Intricate History of Localized Aggressive Periodontitis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2553/v1","date":1722431986000,"content":"Abstract:\nThis narrative review challenges the recent World Workshop Consensus (WWC) conferences failure to classify aggressive periodontitis (AP) in young adults as distinct from adult periodontitis. Deficiencies in the consensus process, results of these deficiencies, and their impact on disease classification are presented. Support for retaining localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) in adolescents as a unique disease, focuses on the; 1) age of onset, 2) rate of bone loss in those affected, and 3) unique microbiological etiological associations. Examples of, 1) unique clinical signs and symptoms of LAgP are presented, and 2) the microbial subgingival consortia that precedes these clinical signs and symptoms are described. Tables show, 1) decreased publications for AP since publication of WWC guidelines and 2) Bradford-Hill guidelines that support the unique etiological consortia replicated in clinically well-defined longitudinal studies. The review describes major deficiencies in the WWC as compared to other medically-related well-run consensus conferences that, 1) set pre-conference standards for 70 â€“ 80% agreement of expert participants, and 2) published the dissenting point of view. In contrast, the WWC conference was decided by a mere majority, and never presented the dissenting view. The review concludes that averaging of mean pocket depth reduction, or attachment gain can misrepresent disease and/or success of treatment in aggressive diseases. In contrast, clinical assessment of time to recurrence of subgingival re-infection with possible translocation of oral microbes to distant sites is presented as an alternative measurement of success.   Other questions and future directions are presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8ab78fe941d779c901462dc76c63fb7ec005e7b06aa1369741ab43590909275","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
