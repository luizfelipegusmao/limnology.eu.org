{"title":"Intuition in Conception, Development, and Use of Disruptive Technologies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2021/v1","date":1721894196000,"content":"Technology can mediate the gap between observation methods and scientific experience. Intuition—as a form of unconscious knowledge—is one of the most important elements in the emergence of disruptive technology, since the new ideas do not work only on the technical level, but also on social, psychological, political, and economic ones. Its origin is influenced by the creators’ background, the current scientific and technical possibilities, and also by deep aspirations, illusions, motivations, and human values of researchers.However, there is an epistemological breakthrough between scientific experience and intuition. Owing to the idea that intuitions are not individual, this article explores the relation between intuition and innovation since different perspectives with the aim to provide researchers more pathways for creating collective disruptive innovations in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f94604661a2a7a12236b23be403f1d5269749064003220dca0ab61f0a43b8dd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
