{"title":"Revisiting the Landscape Mosaic model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304215","date":1716991200000,"content":"<p>by Peter Vogt, James Wickham, Jos√© Ignacio Barredo, Kurt Riitters</p>\r\n\r\nThe landscape mosaic model quantifies and maps the spatial juxtaposition of different land uses. It provides a landscape perspective of anthropic threats posed by agriculture and urban development, and the spatial-temporal shifting of the landscape mosaic indicates landscapes where anthropic intensity has changed. We use the U.S. Geological Survey provided National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the years 2001 and 2021 to derive the landscape mosaic at five analysis scales. To improve earlier implementations of the model, we introduce the heatmap, a flexible scheme providing more thematic reporting opportunities and allowing for better quantitative summary reporting across analysis scales as well as for temporal trends. The results are exemplified at regional scale for the Atlanta metropolitan area. We use the improved model to investigate the land cover context over time and at different analysis scales and show how custom color tables detail different thematic features of the landscape mosaic, including the degree and change of anthropic intensity. We conclude with a discussion of potential applications in ecology, landscape planning, and restoration to illustrate the benefits of the revised landscape mosaic model. All assessment tools are now available in open-source software packages.","author":"Peter Vogt","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7c862a1c38acf2a3097d54d910e196fc8a2182eae785953ca137cf7c0538afe2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
