{"title":"The impact of flipping class intervention on reading comprehension: Different approaches and proficiency levels","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305041","date":1718892000000,"content":"<p>by Arfan Fahmi, Nur Mukminatien, Daniel Ginting, Shirly Rizki Kusumaningrum</p>\r\n\r\nFlipped classes can improve English language teaching and learning, especially reading outcomes, by enhancing student engagement and motivation through interactive and captivating educational materials. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of different schema activations in different English flipped class formats in pre-reading activities on the reading comprehension of students with different reading proficiency levels. A quasi-experimental research design was employed involving 30 first-year students from the first university and 28 first-year students from the second university in Surabaya, Indonesia, who were studying English as a general course at an intermediate level. The study used informed consent and two different formats, A and B, where pre-reading tasks were completed in class or asynchronously online, respectively. The study found that using video-based pre-reading activities in flipped class can improve comprehension and schema acquisition. Flipped classes can provide personalized learning experiences, but its effectiveness varies depending on the strategies and delivery methods used. While most students benefit from flipped classes, those who struggle with self-discipline and time management may find it challenging to adapt to the online component and may experience lower performance as a result.","author":"Arfan Fahmi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"97758059bad326bdea9786cd502ea23f4d5355baa0a4331d3ff65ecf73696724","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
