{"title":"Design of a Long-Throated Flume in a Drainage Channel of a Rice Cultivated Plot","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0909/v1","date":1715662218000,"content":"In the plot under study, rice is grown under anaerobic conditions by means of flood irrigation that maintains a constant water depth during most of the crop cycle. Thus, water requirements reach a very high volume of about 12,000 m3/ha. At the outlet there is a drainage channel where there are no measuring devices. Its control will allow us to establish practices to reduce the high water consumption. We have designed a long-throated flume that can cover the entire range of flow rates to measure, between 0.02 and 0.05 m3/s in this case. Since the drainage channel has a trapezoidal cross section and is built on land, the throat of the flume will also be trapezoidal to ease the transition between the two sections and reduce head losses. A new procedure has been developed that allows to directly design the dimensions of the narrowed section, side slope and bottom width, by previ-ously choosing the modular limit, the sill height and the length of the throat more in accordance with the characteristics of the channel where the flume is to be installed. The analysis of the obtained results demonstrates the accuracy and feasibility of the presented procedure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf59e881e2ee43a4a225e6f91ea64947b907d4e031509caa06aa5f0ef70dea7d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
