Organotypic cultures are increasingly being used to assess therapeutics for various cancers and infectious diseases. Monitoring drug cytotoxicity in cell cultures is crucial in drug development, and several commercially available kits for cytotoxicity assessment offer distinct advantages and limitations. Given the complexity of organoid cultures, including donor-driven variability, we investigated drug-treated, tissue stem cell-derived human intestinal organoid responses with commonly used cell cytotoxicity assay kits. Using seven different compounds, we compared the cytotoxicity assay performance of two different leaky membrane-based and two metabolism-based assays. Significant variability was seen in reported viability outcomes across assays and organoid lines. High baseline activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in four human intestinal organoid lines required modification of the standard LDH assay protocol. Additionally, the LDH assay reported unique resilience to damage in a genetically-modified line contrasting results compared to other assays. This study highlights factors that can impact the measurement of cell cytotoxicity in intestinal organoid models, which are emerging as valuable new tools for research and pre-clinical drug testing and suggest the need for using multiple assay types to ensure reliable cytotoxicity assessment.","author":"Miranda A.
