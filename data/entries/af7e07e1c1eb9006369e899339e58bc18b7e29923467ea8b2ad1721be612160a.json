{"title":"Variations of spectra of quasars with their velocities in the expanding Universe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0413/v1","date":1722931994000,"content":"An atomic matter stores its motion information which is contained in velocity-induced shifts in the atomic energy levels. For redshifts  less than or of the order of $\\frac{1}{137}$, the velocity-dependent shifts of the energy levels of hydrogen atoms are calculated analytically.  These velocity-dependent energy shifts lead to the changes of radiative transition wavelengths and doublet splittings of the quasar spectral lines. These spectral variations can be described by the effective value of the fine structure constant depended on the radiative source velocities.   In the expanding  Universe, these velocities are variable in time and space. It leads to the change of the effective value of the fine structure constant  with the cosmological epochs, whereas the fundamental value of the fine structure constant does not.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af7e07e1c1eb9006369e899339e58bc18b7e29923467ea8b2ad1721be612160a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
