{"title":"The Toba Eruption 74,000 Years ago Strengthened the Indian Winter Monsoon‐Evidence From Coccolithophores","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023PA004823?af=R","date":1713938398000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The global impact of the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) supereruption is still heavily debated, ranging from having little effects on climate to significantly affecting modern human evolution. Climate models and proxy records show that the eruption may have caused cooling of the Asian landmass, thus impacting regional climate such as the Indian monsoon system. However, the immediate effect of the eruption on the Indian monsoon has not been indisputably demonstrated in any proxy record. Here, we present a paleo-primary productivity (PP) record in core SO130-289KL from the northeastern Arabian Sea based on the coccolithophore species <i>Florisphaera profunda</i> transfer function. <i>Florisphaera profunda</i> decreased from ∼30% before the YTT eruption to ∼8% right after the YTT eruption, which translates to an increase in PP by ∼65% from a long-term average of ∼200 gC/m<sup>2</sup>/yr for about 8–19 years after the eruption. The duration was estimated using a new error-weighted mean age of the YTT eruption (73.9 ± 0.1 ka, 2σ uncertainties) based on recent age estimates from ice cores, radiometric dating, and speleothem records. The elevated PP is most likely linked to the deepening of the surface ocean mixed layer driven by strengthened northeasterly Indian winter monsoon winds. This hypothesis is supported by stable oxygen isotope records from speleothem and ice cores, which show indications of a strengthening of the Indian winter monsoon during times of increased PP. Our results support previous modeling studies and provide unequivocal evidence from a marine record for an Indian monsoon response to the supereruption.</p>","author":"Jose Dominick Guballa, \nJörg Bollmann, \nKatherine Schmidt, \nAndreas Lückge","siteTitle":"Wiley: Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"69a881e15689378344e2f544f17d899603864e0695b4208841b63784555058e2","entryHash":"914471eb8df8832b783ad15c82d9c18ee113858c39922ef8619800913d731754","category":"Environment"}
