{"title":"The Impact of Personality Interactions on Foraging Strategy and Growth in Native and Invasive Turtles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1362/v1","date":1718795179000,"content":"Animal personalities play a crucial role in invasion dynamics during alien species invasions. The behavioral strategies adopted by native species varied among personalities when facing an invasion by alien species, just as the invasive species exhibited variations in behavior strategies across different personalities during the invasion process. However, the effects of personality interactions between native species and invasive species on behavior and growth are rarely illustrated. We used the globally invasive freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans and the native freshwater turtle Mauremys reevesii to investigate how the personality combinations of native and invasive turtles would impact the foraging strategy and growth of both species. We found that M. reevesii exhibited bolder and more exploratory personalities than T. scripta elegans. The foraging strategy of M. reevesii was mainly affected by the personality of T. scripta elegans, while the foraging strategy of T. scripta elegans was influenced by both their own personality and M. reevesii's personality. In addition, we did not found that the personality combination would affect the growth of either T. scripta elegans or M. reevesii. Difference in foraging strategy may be due to the competitive advantage of invasive species and variations in the exploration-exploitation foraging strategy among different personalities. Overall, our results reveal the mechanisms of personality interaction effects on the foraging behavior of both native and invasive species during alien species invasion and provide empirical evidence to help understand the effects of personality in invasion dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07e6c66cb3a9d7de3d3b40a430d53c8a23b270cdb5aa4735660c2154fa112945","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
