Although progress has been made in characterizing flow resistance in vegetated flows, the impact of vegetation on bed shear stress, a key driver of sediment transport, still needs better characterization and understanding. This research, explores bed shear stress and near-bed flow characteristics in sparse arrays of rigid emergent cylinders mimicking vegetation over a rough bed. For this purpose, a novel adaptation of a shear plate was used to measure bed shear stress at the canopy scale. These measurements were analyzed in relation to spatially averaged near-bed flow quantities for different array densities. The results show that, for a constant water depth, the investigated cylinder canopy enhances the ratio between bed shear stress and bulk flow velocity (i.e., Darcy-Weisbach bed friction factor) compared to unobstructed open-channel flows, and that this ratio increases with array density. Moreover, higher near-bed velocities were observed for higher array densities. On the other hand, no influence of the cylinder array on near-bed values of turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent stresses was observed. Finally, it is shown that the thickness of the near-bed layer is a suitable parameter to scale the ratio between bed shear stress and bulk flow velocity in vegetated rough bed flows.</p>","author":"J.
