{"title":"State of the Art Synthesis of Ag-ZnO-Based Nanomaterials by Novel Atmospheric Pressure Microplasma Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2283/v1","date":1722239965000,"content":"Atmospheric pressure Microplasma is a simple, cost-effective, efficient, and eco-friendly procedure, which is superior to the traditional nanomaterials synthesis techniques. It generates high yields and allows for a controlled growth rate and morphology of nanomaterials. The silver (Ag) nanomaterials, with their unique physical and chemical properties, exhibit outstanding antibacterial and anti-fungal properties. Similarly, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanomaterials, known for their low toxicity and relatively lower cost, find wide applications in wound repair, bone healing, and antibacterial and anticancer applications. The use of core-shell nanomaterials in certain situations where some nanoparticles can cause serious harm to host tissues or organs is a testament to their potential. A benign material is coated over the core to reduce toxicity in these cases. This review compares the numerous configurations of microplasma systems used for synthesizing nanomaterials and their use in producing Ag, ZnO, and their core-shell (Ag-ZnO) nanomaterials for biomedical applications. The summary also includes the effect of control parameters, including cathode diameter, gas flow rate, precursor concentration, voltage, and current, on the nanomaterial's characteristics and applications. In addition, it provides a research gap in the synthesis of Ag, ZnO, and core shall nanomaterials by this technique, as well as the development and limitations of this technique and the use of these nanoparticles for biomedical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"214800189c82cdfdc68db549bc8b7a12c4c8d4ec67cd65cab2338391474ed7df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
