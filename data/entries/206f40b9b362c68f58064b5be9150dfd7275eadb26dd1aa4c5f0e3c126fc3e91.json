This technology directly underpins the 4D-STEM computational imaging approach, in which a focused probe is rastered over a sample and a two-dimensional diffraction pattern is collected at each probe location. Many 4D-STEM datasets are inherently multimodal, as a single dataset can be analyzed to produce maps of crystal orientation, strain, and other properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.119-B1\">1</a>]. Since its inception, the 4D-STEM approach has skyrocketed in popularity, and is now increasingly applied to complex samples and <span>in-situ</span> data streams.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"206f40b9b362c68f58064b5be9150dfd7275eadb26dd1aa4c5f0e3c126fc3e91","category":"Environment"}
