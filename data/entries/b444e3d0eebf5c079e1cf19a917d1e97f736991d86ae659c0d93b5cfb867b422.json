{"title":"Comparative study of blood physiological, antioxidant capacity, nutrition and organoleptic quality between wild, factory and cage‚Äêcultured Hexagrammos otakii","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16154?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Nutrient richness and fast-growing rate have rapidly advanced the aquaculture of <i>Hexagrammos otakii</i>. The current farming methods of <i>H. otakii</i> include wild stocking, cage culture and factory culture; however, the influence of each style on this species is unclear. This study aimed to establish and compare the nutritional profiles, muscle quality and physiological status of wild (WF), factory-cultured (FC) and cage-cultured (CC) <i>H. otakii</i>. Haematological parameters revealed remarkable differences in haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume and platelet levels between the wild and cultured <i>H. otakii</i>. The proximal composition showed significantly higher and lower levels of crude lipids and proteins, respectively, in the CC group than that in the WF group. Likewise, the WF group exhibited significantly higher scores for texture attributes, such as hardness and springiness in addition to the significantly higher calcium and selenium contents than that in the cultured groups. Moreover, significant variations were determined in liver antioxidant capacity with a higher malondialdehyde content and glutathione peroxidase activity in the CC group than that in the other groups. Furthermore, the levels of all amino acids as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids and docosahexaenoic acid were significantly higher in the cultured groups than those in the WF group<i>.</i> In summary, regular consumption of cultured <i>H. otakii</i> may provide superior health benefits than that of wild <i>H. otakii</i> on the basis of the nutritional structure of muscle; however, wild <i>H. otakii</i> has a better taste and richer mineral composition.</p>","author":"Xin Gao, \nZiru Chu, \nLidong Shi, \nHaojie Zhai, \nWei Wang, \nTongjun Ren, \nYuzhe Han","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"b444e3d0eebf5c079e1cf19a917d1e97f736991d86ae659c0d93b5cfb867b422","category":"Environment"}
