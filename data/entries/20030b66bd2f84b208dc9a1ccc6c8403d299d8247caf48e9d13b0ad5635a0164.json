{"title":"Improvement of Ride Comfort of Truck Semi-Active Cab Suspension System Based on Accurate Modeling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0529/v1","date":1723111597000,"content":"The semi-active cab suspension system for trucks is gaining increasing importance due to its economic advantages, low energy consumption, and significant enhancement of ride comfort. This paper investigates the effects of three control methods on improving ride comfort of semi-active cab suspension systems under random and bump road conditions: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, fuzzy PID control, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). Initially, an accurate multi-degree-of-freedom truck cab suspension model was developed and validated through actual road tests. Based on this model, three control strategies were designed and implemented. Finally, the effectiveness of each control strategy was evaluated under various road conditions, including random and bump road scenarios. The results demonstrate that these control strategies can effectively reduce vibrations and impacts, significantly enhancing ride comfort, which is crucial for reducing driver fatigue and improving driving safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20030b66bd2f84b208dc9a1ccc6c8403d299d8247caf48e9d13b0ad5635a0164","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
