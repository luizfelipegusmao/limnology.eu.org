{"title":"The Effects of Foreign Direct Investments on Wage Trends in the Dutch Labor Market","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0753/v1","date":1725951644000,"content":"The investigation of the correlation between Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) and wage dynamics, particularly in the context of gender-related aspects, is of paramount importance in understanding the broader implications of economic globalization. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between FDIs and wage trends, with a specific focus on the Dutch context. \nUsing data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Bank, the research applies statistical techniques, including regression analysis, to explore the relationship between FDIs and wage trends over time, with a focus on gender differences. The analysis reveals that while FDIs contribute to overall wage growth, their impact varies significantly between male and female employees in the Netherlands. This highlights the need for policies addressing these gender-based disparities, providing a unique gender-focused perspective on the influence of FDIs on wage trends and expanding the existing literature on economic globalization and wage dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4fb6e0be386b5ea5d6f5196ae1228da6ffec9bdfd36d51e233e6444cad5ac974","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
