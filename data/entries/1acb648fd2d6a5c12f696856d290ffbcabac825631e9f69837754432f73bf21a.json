{"title":"A Significance of Endothelial Dysfunction in Long COVID-19 for The Possible Future Pandemic of Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1518/v1","date":1718963106000,"content":"Various symptoms have been reported to persist beyond acute phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which is referred as long coronavirus disease 19 (long COVID-19). Over 65â€‰million individuals suffer from long COVID-19. However, the causes of long COVID-19 have been largely unknown. Since long COVID-19 symptoms are observed throughout the body, vascular endothelial dysfunction may be a strong candidate to induce long COVID-19. The angioten-sin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells. We previously found that the risk factors for athero-sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and the history of ASCVD can be the risk for severe COVID-19, suggesting a contribution of pre-existing endothelial dysfunction to severe COVID-19. Here, we show a significant association of endothelial dysfunction with development of long COVID-19 and show that biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction in patients with long COVID-19 are also crucial players in development of ASCVD. We consider the influence of long COVID-19 on development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ASCVD. Furthermore, we suggest the therapeutic interventions for long COVID-19 by considering endothelial dysfunction as the treatment tar-gets for long COVID-19. Such interventions may prevent pandemic of CKD and ASCVD in post COVID-19 era.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1acb648fd2d6a5c12f696856d290ffbcabac825631e9f69837754432f73bf21a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
