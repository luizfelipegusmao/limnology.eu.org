{"title":"Maternal Vaccination for the Prevention of Infantile RSV Disease: An Overview of the Authorized, In-Progress, and Unsuccessful Vaccine Candidates.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2067/v1","date":1717071794000,"content":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) continues to pose a significant challenge, contributing to elevated hospitalization rates among children up to 5 years old, with a disproportionate burden on newborn and infants under 6 months old. The unique characteristics of the young immune system make it prone to altered responses to infections and vaccinations, requiring a tailored approach to disease prevention. The recent approval of the maternal RSV vaccine, (brand name ABRYSVO), represents a pivotal advancement in preventive strategies among newborns and infants, marking a milestone in RSV research as the first market-approved maternal vaccine. The present review examines clinical trial data on both recent and previous vaccine candidates, as well as the licensed vaccine, focusing on the prevention of RSV disease in newborns and young infants through the passive acquisition of antibodies following maternal immunization. Additionally, it evaluates the safety profile of these vaccines.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"356b50e612858014ac45116a0c133636d1f964d4be185b94bbefec07d8485ca2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
