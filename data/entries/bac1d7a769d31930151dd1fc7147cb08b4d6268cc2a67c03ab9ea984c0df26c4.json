{"title":"Genome-wide association studies identify loci controlling specialized seed metabolites in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1705/7284016?rss=1","date":1695772800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants synthesize specialized metabolites to facilitate environmental and ecological interactions. During evolution, plants diversified in their potential to synthesize these metabolites. Quantitative differences in metabolite levels of natural Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) accessions can be employed to unravel the genetic basis for metabolic traits using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we performed metabolic GWAS on seeds of a panel of 315 <span>A. thaliana</span> natural accessions, including the reference genotypes C24 and Col-0, for polar and semi-polar seed metabolites using untargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. As a complementary approach, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of near-isogenic introgression lines between C24 and Col-0 for specific seed specialized metabolites. Besides common QTL between seeds and leaves, GWAS revealed seed-specific QTL for specialized metabolites, indicating differences in the genetic architecture of seeds and leaves. In seeds, aliphatic methylsulfinylalkyl and methylthioalkyl glucosinolates associated with the <span>ALKENYL HYDROXYALKYL PRODUCING</span> loci (<span>GS-ALK</span> and <span>GS-OHP</span>) on chromosome 4 containing <span>alkenyl hydroxyalkyl producing 2</span> (<span>AOP2</span>) and <span>3</span> (<span>AOP3</span>) or with the <span>GS-ELONG</span> locus on chromosome 5 containing <span>methylthioalkyl malate synthase</span> (<span>MAM1</span>) and <span>MAM3</span>. We detected two unknown sulfur-containing compounds that were also mapped to these loci. In GWAS, some of the annotated flavonoids (kaempferol 3-<span>O</span>-rhamnoside-7-<span>O</span>-rhamnoside, quercetin 3-<span>O</span>-rhamnoside-7-<span>O</span>-rhamnoside) were mapped to <span>transparent testa 7</span> (<span>AT5G07990</span>), encoding a cytochrome P450 75B1 monooxygenase. Three additional mass signals corresponding to quercetin-containing flavonols were mapped to <span>UGT78D2</span> (<span>AT5G17050</span>). The association of the loci and associating metabolic features were functionally verified in knockdown mutant lines. By performing GWAS and QTL mapping, we were able to leverage variation of natural populations and parental lines to study seed specialized metabolism. The GWAS data set generated here is a high-quality resource that can be investigated in further studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"bac1d7a769d31930151dd1fc7147cb08b4d6268cc2a67c03ab9ea984c0df26c4","category":"Environment"}
