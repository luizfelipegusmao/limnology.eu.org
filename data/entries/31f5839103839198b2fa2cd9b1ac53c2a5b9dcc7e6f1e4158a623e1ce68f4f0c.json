In adult plants resistant to <i>Pt</i>, a horizontal adult plant resistance (APR) is observed: APR protects the plant against multiple pathogen races and is distinguished by durable persistence under production conditions. The <i>Lr46/Yr29</i> locus was mapped to chromosome 1B of common wheat genome, but the identity of the underlying gene has not been demonstrated although several candidate genes have been proposed. This study aimed to analyze the expression of nine candidate genes located at the <i>Lr46/Yr29</i> locus and their four complementary miRNAs (tae-miR5384-3p, tae-miR9780, tae-miR9775, and tae-miR164), in response to <i>Pt</i> infection. The plant materials tested included five reference cultivars in which the molecular marker <i>csLV46G22</i> associated with the <i>Lr46/Yr29</i>-based <i>Pt</i> resistance was identified, as well as one susceptible control cultivar. Biotic stress was induced in adult plants by inoculation with fungal spores under controlled conditions. Plant material was sampled before and at 6, 12, 24, 48 hours post inoculation (hpi). Differences in expression of candidate genes at the <i>Lr46/Yr29</i> locus were analyzed by qRT-PCR and showed that the expression of the genes varied at the analyzed time points. The highest expression of <i>Lr46/Yr29</i> candidate genes (<i>Lr46-Glu1</i>, <i>Lr46-Glu2</i>, <i>Lr46-Glu3</i>, <i>Lr46-RLK1</i>, <i>Lr46-RLK2</i>, <i>Lr46-RLK3</i>, <i>Lr46-RLK4</i>, <i>Lr46-Snex</i>, and <i>Lr46-WRKY</i>) occurred at 12 and 24 hpi and such expression profiles were obtained only for one candidate gene among the nine genes analyzed (<i>Lr46-Glu2</i>), indicating that it may be a contributing factor in the resistance response to <i>Pt</i> infection.","author":"Julia Spychała","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"31f5839103839198b2fa2cd9b1ac53c2a5b9dcc7e6f1e4158a623e1ce68f4f0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
