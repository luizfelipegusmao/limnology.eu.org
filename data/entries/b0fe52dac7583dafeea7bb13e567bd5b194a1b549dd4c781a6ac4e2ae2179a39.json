{"title":"Raising Awareness of the Importance of Early Diagnosis of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1093/v1","date":1713355413000,"content":"The article discusses early diagnosis and intervention for developmental delays in children, emphasizing the role of specialized services and personnel in supporting recovery and development. It presents findings from a pilot project initiated in Bucharest, aiming to assess the incidence of developmental delays in children aged 1-3 years in selected kindergartens, including ASD. The study involved children, parents, and specialists, utilizing systematic behavior observation (SBO) and semi-structured interviews. Results indicate that out of 613 evaluated children, 81 received specialized control recommendations, with 4 cases showing potential risk of ASD. Additionally, 8 children were diagnosed with autism. The incidence of autism in children aged 1-3 years was 1 in 51. Although exploratory, these findings suggest a model of good practice for future early diagnosis campaigns nationally. Conclusively, the study underscores the importance of early diagnosis and intervention for developmental delays, advocating for a responsive community and emphasizing the significance of national-level efforts to address these issues effectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0fe52dac7583dafeea7bb13e567bd5b194a1b549dd4c781a6ac4e2ae2179a39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
