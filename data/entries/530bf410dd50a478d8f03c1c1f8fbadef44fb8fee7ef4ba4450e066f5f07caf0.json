{"title":"Assessment of Postbiotic, Mundticin-like Substance EM 41/3 Application in Broiler Rabbits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0669/v1","date":1710247456000,"content":"Nowadays, animal breeders look for effective innovations to care animal health. Use of probiotics, postbiotics, parabiotics and the other beneficial natural substances are dominated. Mundticin-like substance EM 41/3 is thermo-stable bacteriocin (postbiotic) with a broad antimicrobial spectrum. In this study its effect in broiler rabbits was assessed. Rabbits represent food-derived animal and they are also suitable animal model. The parameters tested were analyzed by validated methods. Administration of MLS EM 41/3 produced by non-autochthonous strain Enterococcus mundtii EM 41/3 lead to significant increase of parameter immunity-phagocytic activity, while it did not influence microbiota composition. It also did not influence blood biochemistry and no oxidative stress was noted. Moreover, higher growth parameters were noted and also stimulated hydrolytic activity. Finally, no negative influence on rabbit meat quality was noted. Postbiotic MLS EM 41/3 administration in feeding strategy seems to be contributing fact for rabbit health status maintaining.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"530bf410dd50a478d8f03c1c1f8fbadef44fb8fee7ef4ba4450e066f5f07caf0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
