{"title":"Just Add Water and Stir: An Artificial Suburban Lake Develops Into an Important Moulting Site for Large‐Bodied Herbivorous Wildfowl","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.70002?af=R","date":1729666800000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Egø Engsø is an artificial Danish suburban lake created in 2006, primarily for nutrient retention and flood control. Expanding submerged macrophyte cover (dominated by Stoneworts <i>Chara</i> spp. and Pondweeds <i>Potamogeton</i> spp.) attracted moulting concentrations of 600 mute swans <i>Cygnus olor</i>, 1100 greylag geese <i>Anser anser</i> and 280 Canada geese <i>Branta canadensis</i>. These unexpected additions to the avifauna benefit from reliable food supplies and effective protection from recreational disturbance on and near the water surface. Egø Engsø is a model of enabling intense human activity at a waterbird moulting site, and confirming appropriate planning can accommodate multiple functional objectives following wetland creation.</p>","author":"Kevin Kuhlmann Clausen, \nPer Nissen Grøn, \nHenning Lykke Larsen, \nPreben Clausen, \nAnthony David Fox","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems: Table of Contents","siteHash":"53f1a0c472ad7591633d0b281e1df2834126145a77ec9c0585f4049ad3e52c8f","entryHash":"dd56e8cc22faa4a5a3c4c2af671cf0283bb8f969fddc7c0ac9590d66b3c553a4","category":"Environment"}
