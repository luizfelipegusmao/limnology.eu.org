{"title":"Evaluation of Bacterial Cellulose/Alginate-Based Hydrogel with Frog Skin, in Wound Healing in Horses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0098/v1","date":1714644827000,"content":"We evaluated the macroscopic and histopathological aspects of skin healing by secondary intention in equine wounds, surgically induced and topically treated with bacterial cellulose hydrogel with alginate (BCAG) or frog skin (FSG), compared with ringer lactate (CG). Three wounds were created on each side of the lumbar region, one side for gross evaluation with photos and measurement of the area and contraction rate and the other for histopathological evaluation, with the sides selected randomly, in 5 horses. All wounds received daily treatment, and clinical and histopathological evaluations were conducted on postoperative days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Although no statistical differences were observed, the BCAG presented a reduced wound area and a high wound contraction percentage on days 14 and 21. At 28 days, the average contraction rates were 96.08%, 92.87%, and 88.6% for the CG, BCAG, and FSG, respectively. Although there was no statistical difference between the groups in wound healing in this study in horses, in clinical evaluations an early start of filling the area of the wounds treated with frog skin was observed, and on D14 and D21, a smaller area and higher contraction rate were observed in BCAG, which can be attributed to more efficient re-epithelialization and fibroblast proliferation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0635b61fb7be8fcc8cd97b87b253710cc09061a24f287ffde2c6fbfec01d5e3e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
