{"title":"An Exploration of Ideals and Filters In Triangle Algebras","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1173/v1","date":1723723786000,"content":"In the study of algebraic structures related to logical systems, Ideals and filters have different\nmeanings and they are algebraic notions related to logical provable formulas. Unlike the classical\nBoolean lattice theory, ideals and filters are not dual notions in residuated lattices. An interesting\nsubclass of residuated lattices is the class of triangle algebras, which is an equational representation\nof interval-valued residuated lattices that provides an algebraic framework for using closed intervals\nas truth values in fuzzy logic. The main aim of this article is to introduce and study the concept of\nideals in triangle algebras and investigate the connection between ideals and filters. We first point out\nthat the construction procedure for the filter generated by a subset of a triangle algebra established\nby Zahiri et al. is incorrect, and we proceed to give an alternative characterization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b8d053f50f694d0ec12f5a5dd401fdf4dc51f24911081d25d40b71fc7f287ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
