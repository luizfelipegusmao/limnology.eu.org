{"title":"Low Levels of Burnout Among Advanced Care at Home Providers at Mayo Clinic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0873/v1","date":1726037391000,"content":"Burnout in healthcare affects the quality of patient care. In 2020, Mayo Clinic implemented Advanced Care at Home (ACH), a new hospital-at-home program. We aimed to assess burnout levels among ACH providers, analyzing data from quarterly surveys. Physicians and nurse practitioners registered in ACH completed a 16-question anonymous survey distributed via email. Ten questions from the original survey used the Maslach Burnout Inventory to measure the three domains associated with burnout: depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and personal achievement. We conducted a descriptive analysis using frequency distribution and percentages. A total of 27 providers participated, with response rates of 38%, 23%, and 66% in the first, second, and third quarters. Over 75% of the participants responded satisfactorily to nine of the ten questions associated with the risk of burnout. Moreover, 77% of providers felt joyful at work \"always or most of the time.\" Of the 74% of participants who responded to the question about feeling burned out from work, 48% of the participants \"strongly” or “somewhat” disagreed, while only 26% \"strongly” or “somewhat” agreed. Mayo Clinic's ACH has demonstrated low levels of burnout among providers, positively impacting the well-being of healthcare workers and contributing to a high standard of patient care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d56376c15e821679ee4b9b0aef2854dd02cedd51d1c3c2cc0af5b371ac091eae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
