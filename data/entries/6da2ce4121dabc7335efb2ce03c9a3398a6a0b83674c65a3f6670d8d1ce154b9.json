{"title":"Optimizing E-Commerce with Multi-Objective Recommendations Using Ensemble Learning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2180/v1","date":1727433091000,"content":"In the dynamic landscape of online shopping, predicting user behaviors such as clicks, cart additions, and orders is crucial for optimizing sales strategies. Traditional recommendation systems often focus on a single objective, limiting their effectiveness in a multifaceted e-commerce environment. This article proposes a multi-objective recommendation system that leverages previous events in user sessions to forecast these key metrics, addressing challenges such as imbalanced positive and negative samples, varying session lengths, and the need for effective sampling techniques. Our approach integrates LightGBM, XgBoost, and Recbole GRU4Rec through ensemble learning, combining the strengths of these models to enhance prediction performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods, offering significant improvements in accuracy and robustness. This work provides a comprehensive solution for online retailers to better predict user behaviors and optimize their sales strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and business outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6da2ce4121dabc7335efb2ce03c9a3398a6a0b83674c65a3f6670d8d1ce154b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
