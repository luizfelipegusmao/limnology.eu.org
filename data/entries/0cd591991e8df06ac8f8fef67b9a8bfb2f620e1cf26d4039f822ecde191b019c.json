{"title":"Quantifying Visual Differences in Drought Stressed Maize through Reflectance and Data-Driven Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1949/v1","date":1714483677000,"content":"Environmental factors, such as  drought-stress, significantly impact maize growth and productivity worldwide. To improve yield and quality, effective strategies for early detection and mitigation of drought-stress in maize are essential. This paper presents a detailed analysis of three imaging trials conducted to detect drought-stress in maize plants using an existing, custom-developed, low cost, high throughput phenotyping platform. We propose a pipeline for early detection of water stress in maize plants using a Vision Transformer classifier and analysis of distributions of near-infrared (NIR) reflectance from the plants. We also explored suitable regions on the plant that are more sensitive to drought-stress and show that the region surrounding the youngest expanding leaf (YEL) and the stem can be used as a more consistent alternative to analysis involving just the YEL. Our results show good separation between well-watered and drought-stressed trials for two out of the three imaging trials both in terms of classification accuracy from data-driven features as well as through analysis of histograms of NIR reflectance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cd591991e8df06ac8f8fef67b9a8bfb2f620e1cf26d4039f822ecde191b019c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
