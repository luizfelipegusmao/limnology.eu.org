{"title":"An Agile Approach for Adopting Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly Energy Solutions with Advanced Computational Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1846/v1","date":1714291036000,"content":"In the face of the burgeoning electricity demands and the imperative for sustainable\ndevelopment amidst rapid industrialization, this study introduces a dynamic and adaptable\nframework suitable for policy-makers and renewable energy experts working on integrating\nand optimizing renewable energy solutions. While using a case study representative model for\nSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to demonstrate the challenges and opportunities present in introducing\noptimization methods to bridge power supply deficits and the scalability of the model to other\nregions, this study presents an agile multi-criteria decision tool that pivots on four key development\nphases, advancing upon established methodologies and pioneering refined computational techniques,\nto select optimal configurations from a set of Policy Decision Making Metrics (PDM-DPS).\nCentral to this investigation lies a rigorous comparative analysis of variants of three advanced\nalgorithmic approaches: Swarm-Based Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO),\nDecomposition-Based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA/D), and Evolutionary-Based\nStrength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2). These are applied to a grid-connected hybrid\nsystem, evaluated through a comprehensive 8760-hour simulation over a 20-year planning horizon.\nThe evaluation is further enhanced by a set of refined Algorithm Performance Evaluation Metrics\n(AL-PEM) tailored to the specific constraints. The findings not only underscore the robustness\nand consistency of the SPEA2 variant over 15 runs of 200 generations each, which ranks first on\nthe AL-PEM scale but also validate the strategic merit of combining multiple technologies and\nempowering policymakers with a versatile toolkit for informed decision-making.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"462dbb08339eddcd6dc1e854bc000c1f7f18e71bbdb5e38955204ecefbefa89b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
