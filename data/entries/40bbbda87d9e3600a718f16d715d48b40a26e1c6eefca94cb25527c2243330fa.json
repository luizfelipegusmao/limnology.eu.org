{"title":"Time Dependent Retarded Electromagnetic Motors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1512/v1","date":1721305802000,"content":"We have shown that Newton’s third law does not strictly hold in a system with remote elements, due the finite speed of signal propagation and thus force imbalance occurs at the system’s center of mass. As the said system is affected by a total force for a finite duration, mechanical energy and momentums are gained by the system. In early works we assumed that the bodies were macroscopically charge neutral. Later we removed this restriction, thus analyzing the consequences on a possible electric charged relativistic motor. On the first published paper on this subject we studied this phenomena in general but gave only an example of a system reaching a stationary state, in this paper we shall analyze a charged retarded electromagnetic motor in a more general time dependent setting giving specific examples in which the system never reaches a stationary state yet produces steady linear momentum non the less.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40bbbda87d9e3600a718f16d715d48b40a26e1c6eefca94cb25527c2243330fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
