{"title":"Maslinic acid alleviates alcoholic liver injury in mice and regulates intestinal microbiota via the gut–liver axis","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13624?af=R","date":1725860041000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene acid, is widely distributed in natural plants and mainly found in the fruit and leaves of olives and hawthorn. MA has been reported as having many health-promoting functions, such as anticancer, anti-inflammation and neuroprotective activities. According to previous study, hawthorn extract has certain hepatoprotective effects. However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear, especially the effect of MA on gut microbiota.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Our study reveals that MA effectively counteracts alcohol-induced liver injury and oxidative stress. It mitigates alcohol-induced intestinal barrier damage, reverses increased permeability and reduces translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This prevents LPS/Toll-like receptor 4 activation, leading to decreased TNF-<i>α</i> and IL-1<i>β</i> production. Furthermore, MA rebalances gut microbiota by reversing harmful bacterial abundance and enhancing beneficial bacteria post-alcohol consumption.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>MA, through modulation of gut microbiota, alleviates alcohol-induced liver injury via the gut–liver axis. These findings support the potential use of MA as a functional food ingredient for preventing or treating alcoholic liver disease. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jingwen Su, \nYuan Dai, \nXianyao Wu, \nXinhu Zhou, \nXianying Fang, \nXiangyang Ge, \nLinguo Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5007e0d84943128fa6d068e182a90637b29d7905531f1fe87c88fc766095ac38","category":"Environment"}
