{"title":"Egg Cryopreservation for Social Reasons-A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0788/v1","date":1728551778000,"content":"This paper provides an overview of the social reasons that lead women to consider egg cryopreservation, as well as the attitudes and knowledge of women towards this procedure. Methods: For the creation of this article, a literature review was carried out both in the existing medical literature and in search engines. The key points are 1. The main reasons women choose to delay childbearing are the lack of a suitable male partner, education and career advancement, and financial instability. Women feel societal and family pressure to have children, even though they may not feel ready. 2. Women's attitudes towards egg cryopreservation vary. While some are open to the idea, many are opposed to it, especially when it is used for non-medical reasons. There are concerns about the success rates, health risks, and ethical implications of the procedure. 3. The legal and regulatory framework around egg cryopreservation differs across countries. Some countries allow it only for medical reasons, while others have more permissive policies. The issue of who should bear the financial cost of the procedure is also debated. 4. There is a need to better educate women, as well as healthcare providers, about fertility decline and the options available for preserving fertility, including egg cryopreservation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3c1d6a83629b1051bece476bef2c8ffd12c686262cf53f5412f0f408ce8a0cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
