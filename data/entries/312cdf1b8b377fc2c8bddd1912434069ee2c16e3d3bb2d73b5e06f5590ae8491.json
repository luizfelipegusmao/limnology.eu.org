{"title":"Determining muscle plasticity and meat quality development of low-input extended fed market-ready steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae064/7661028?rss=1","date":1714608000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, which ultimately led to many meat processors temporarily shutting down or reducing processing capacity. This backlog in processing capacity forced many feedlots to retain cattle for longer periods of time and assume the risk of major market fluctuations. The aim of this study was to understand how a dietary insult affects meat quality and muscle metabolism in market-ready steers (590 kg). Sixteen market-ready (590 kg) commercial Angus crossbred steers were subjected to a maintenance diet of either forage or grain for 60 d. Longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle samples were collected immediately postmortem and processed for characteristics reflecting the underlying muscle fiber type and energy state of the tissue. Despite cattle being subjected to a 60-d feeding period, there were no detectable differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) in carcass characteristics, color of lean, or ultimate pH (pH<sub>u</sub>). Moreover, our data show that muscle plasticity is rather resilient, as reflected by lack of significance (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) in oxidative and glycolytic enzymes, myosin heavy chain isoforms (MyHC), myoglobin, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents. These data show that market-ready steers are capable of withstanding a low-input feeding strategy up to 60 d without dramatically impacting underlying muscle characteristics and meat quality development.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"312cdf1b8b377fc2c8bddd1912434069ee2c16e3d3bb2d73b5e06f5590ae8491","category":"Environment"}
