{"title":"Retrospective Analysis to Optimize the Detection of MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1062/v1","date":1713346608000,"content":"Our study optimized MET ex14 skipping mutation detection by analyzing 223 Oncomine Focus Assay (OFA)-positive cases using Pan Lung Cancer PCR Panel (AmoyDx) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Among the 11 MET ex14 skipping mutation-positive cases (average read counts: 1,390), two with OFA read counts of 2540 and 10177 were positive on all platforms. Those with OFA read counts ranging from 179â€“612 tested negative elsewhere. Specimens with low ratios (average ratio: 0.12% for nine cases) may yield false-positive results. Our results suggested monitoring read counts and ratios, and validating results with RT-PCR, is crucial to prevent false positives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5bdbb18ff57c017aac01d8dd58378e7e052745e5d770551b72e8fd7ab9f74ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
