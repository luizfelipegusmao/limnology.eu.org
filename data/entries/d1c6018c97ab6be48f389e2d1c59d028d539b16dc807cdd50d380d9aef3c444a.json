{"title":"A literature review of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) indicators in the Construction Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0203/v1","date":1722606700000,"content":"Matters relating to preservation of environmental resources and climate change, social inclusion and diversity, and open and sound governance have rapidly gained global attention. However, little is known about the construction industry in meeting the environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria towards sustainable development. In this study, the purpose is to identify the key ESG indicators for construction development. A systematic literature review was undertaken using data from Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, JSTOR, ProQuest, and Web of Science. The results show some of the key ESG indicators as climate resilience and green construction activities (at the project level), and active stakeholder engagement and effective project governance (at the firm level) and meeting environmental and social regulation requirements (industry/national level). The limitation of the article is in the sample size of twenty-six journal articles with future expectation of increment as ESG gain more acceptance in the construction industry. This study will be significant for the design of practice framework and policies on ESG in the construction industry. Comprehensively, this study presents relevant ESG indicators for construction management and presents essential information for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1c6018c97ab6be48f389e2d1c59d028d539b16dc807cdd50d380d9aef3c444a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
