{"title":"The Anti‐Metastatic Action of Oxyresveratrol via Suppression of Phosphoryl‐ERK/‐PKCα‐Mediated Sp1/MMP1 Signaling in Human Renal Carcinoma Cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24400?af=R","date":1724330300000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Oxyresveratrol (OxyR) exerts biological and pharmacological effects in a variety of tumor cells, including antioxidant action, antitumor activity, and proapoptotic effects. However, the regulation of targeted signaling pathways by OxyR and the mechanism underlying these effects in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been less studied. We observed that OxyR at noncytotoxic doses did not affect the growth of human RCC cells or normal kidney HK2 cells. OxyR inhibited ACHN and Caki-1 cell migration and invasion through targeting matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) expression. Analysis of clinical databases showed that high MMP1 expression is associated with lower overall survival (OS) in these cancers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). OxyR significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of Sp1. Furthermore, luciferase assay results showed that OxyR inhibited Sp1 transcriptional activity. Additionally, OxyR preferentially suppressed the activation of ERK and PKCα. Treatment with U0126 (MEK inhibitor) or G06976 (PKCα inhibitor) clearly decreased Sp1 and MMP1 expression and inhibited RCC cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, OxyR may be a potential antitumor therapy for the inhibition of migration and invasion by controlling p-ERK/Sp1 and p-PKCα/Sp1-mediated MMP1 expression in RCC.</p>","author":"Tsai‐Kun Wu, \nYi‐Hsien Hsieh, \nTung‐Wei Hung, \nYi‐Chen Lin, \nChia‐Liang Lin, \nYu‐Jou Liu, \nYing‐Ru Pan, \nJen‐Pi Tsai","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"18979fe9492809668a223b1fa2f1502a6f6f644f8f28f5d1eac49147c088cc7d","category":"Environment"}
