{"title":"Illuminating Malaria: Spectroscopy&#039;s Vital Role in Diagnosis and Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0364/v1","date":1728315957000,"content":"Spectroscopic techniques have emerged as crucial tools in the field of malaria research, offering immense potential for improved diagnosis and enhanced understanding of the disease. This re-view article pays tribute to the pioneering contributions of Professor Henry Mantsch in the realm of clinical biospectroscopy, by comprehensively exploring the diverse applications of spectro-scopic methods in malaria research. From the identification of reliable biomarkers to the devel-opment of innovative diagnostic approaches, spectroscopic techniques spanning the ultraviolet to far-infrared regions have played a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of malaria. This re-view will highlight the multifaceted ways in which spectroscopy has contributed to the field, with a particular emphasis on its impact on diagnostic advancements and drug research. By leverag-ing the minimally invasive and highly accurate nature of spectroscopic techniques, researchers have made significant strides in improving the detection and monitoring of malaria parasites. These advancements hold the promise of enhancing patient outcomes and aiding in the global ef-forts towards the eradication of this devastating disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a289cae1f5de1a4a816e1f8f9163914bab1c93be0824b3efee386aad309e8832","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
