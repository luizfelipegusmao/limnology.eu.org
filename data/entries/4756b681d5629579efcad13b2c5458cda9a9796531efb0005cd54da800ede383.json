{"title":"Blocking IL‐23 Signaling Mitigates Cigarette Smoke‐Induced Murine Emphysema","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24405?af=R","date":1725278828000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Inflammatory cell infiltration is a characteristic feature of COPD and correlates directly with the severity of the disease. Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that regulates Th-17 inflammation, which mediates many pathophysiological events in COPD. The primary goal of this study was to determine the role of IL-23 as a mediator of key pathologic processes in cigarette smoke-induced COPD. In this study, we report an increase in <i>IL23</i> gene expression in the lung biopsies of COPD patients compared to controls and identified a positive correlation between <i>IL23</i> gene expression and disease severity. In a cigarette smoke-induced murine emphysema model, the suppression of IL-23 with a monoclonal blocking antibody reduced the severity of cigarette smoke-induced murine emphysema. Mechanistically, the suppression of IL-23 was associated with a reduction in immune cell infiltration, oxidative stress injury, and apoptosis, suggesting a role for IL-23 as an essential immune mediator of the inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of CS-induced emphysema.</p>","author":"Xue Tian, \nShaohua Wang, \nChujie Zhang, \nY. S.
