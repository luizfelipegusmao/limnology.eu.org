{"title":"CFDP1 regulates the stability of pericentric heterochromatin thereby affecting RAN GTPase activity and mitotic spindle formation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002574","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Gokul Gopinathan, Qian Xu, Xianghong Luan, Thomas G. H. Diekwisch</p>\r\n\r\nThe densely packed centromeric heterochromatin at minor and major satellites is comprised of H3K9me2/3 histones, the heterochromatin protein HP1α, and histone variants. In the present study, we sought to determine the mechanisms by which condensed heterochromatin at major and minor satellites stabilized by the chromatin factor CFDP1 affects the activity of the small GTPase Ran as a requirement for spindle formation. CFDP1 colocalized with heterochromatin at major and minor satellites and was essential for the structural stability of centromeric heterochromatin. Loss of CENPA, HP1α, and H2A.Z heterochromatin components resulted in decreased binding of the spindle nucleation facilitator RCC1 to minor and major satellite repeats. Decreased RanGTP levels as a result of diminished RCC1 binding interfered with chromatin-mediated microtubule nucleation at the onset of mitotic spindle formation. Rescuing chromatin H2A.Z levels in cells and mice lacking CFDP1 through knock-down of the histone chaperone ANP32E not only partially restored RCC1-dependent RanGTP levels but also alleviated CFDP1-knockout-related craniofacial defects and increased microtubule nucleation in CFDP1/ANP32E co-silenced cells. Together, these studies provide evidence for a direct link between condensed heterochromatin at major and minor satellites and microtubule nucleation through the chromatin protein CFDP1.","author":"Gokul Gopinathan","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"dbeaf70edfbda8a90b607e42ee7dfdc2f1776773871d03fe856c9ab4b3129a16","category":"Environment"}
