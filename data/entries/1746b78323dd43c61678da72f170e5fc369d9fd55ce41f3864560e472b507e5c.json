{"title":"Implementation of ADS-B in Latin America and Its Projection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0949/v1","date":1718281506000,"content":"The adoption of ADS-B in Latin America has been gradual but steady. Some countries, such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico, have made significant progress in the implementation of this system, while others are still in the early stages. It should be noted that the implementation of ADS-B is used in both military and civilian environments. For this reason, this research aims to provide information on the different characteristics that make up the surveillance systems. However, there are fundamental factors to promote the adaptation of ADS-B in Latin America, since they reduce the risk of collisions and air accidents by providing accurate and real-time information on the position and altitude of aircraft. On the other hand, it allows optimizing flight routes and reducing waiting time on the ground, which translates into fuel and cost savings for airlines. ADS-B increases the number of aircraft that can safely operate in the same airspace, which is especially important in regions with growing air traffic.       ADS-B adoption in Latin America is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. The drivers for ADS-B adoption remain in place, and governments in the region are taking steps to accelerate its implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1746b78323dd43c61678da72f170e5fc369d9fd55ce41f3864560e472b507e5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
