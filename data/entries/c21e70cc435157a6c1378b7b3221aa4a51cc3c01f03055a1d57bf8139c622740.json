{"title":"Ethical AI in Financial Inclusion: The Role of Algorithmic Fairness on User Satisfaction and Recommendation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1655/v1","date":1721635014000,"content":"This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on financial inclusion satisfaction and recommendation, focusing on ethical dimensions and perceived algorithmic fairness. From the perspectives of organizational justice theory and the heuristic-systematic model, we examine how constructs of algorithm transparency, algorithm accountability, and algorithm legitimacy influence users' perceptions of fairness, and subsequently, their satisfaction with and recommendation of AI-driven financial inclusion. Through a survey-based quantitative analysis, our results indicate that perceived algorithmic fairness acts as a mediating factor between the ethical attributes of AI systems and user satisfaction as well as their recommendation. Findings reveal that higher levels of transparency, accountability, and legitimacy enhance customers' perceptions of fairness, which in turn significantly increases both their satisfaction with financial inclusion services facilitated by AI and their likelihood to recommend them. This research not only contributes to the literature on AI ethics by highlighting the critical role of transparent, accountable, and legitimate AI practices in fostering satisfaction and recommendation among users, but also fills a significant gap in understanding the ethical implications of AI in financial inclusion contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c21e70cc435157a6c1378b7b3221aa4a51cc3c01f03055a1d57bf8139c622740","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
