Neuropathic pain is commonly associated with late cancer stages, and is resultant of tumor metastasis to bone, herein referred to as cancer-induced bone pain. Given the severe impact on quality of life and clinical treatment strategies focusing on symptom management, novel therapeutics are needed to alleviate cancer-induced bone pain and/or reduce cancer burden. In the current study we characterized a commercially available murine fibrosarcoma cell line, NCTC-2472 <i>in vitro</i>, which can be used to assess the capacity of novel compounds to impact cellular viability. We found that dimethyl sulfoxide, a known cytotoxic agent and common drug preparation compound, significantly decreased cell viability in a dose-related manner. We then characterized the <i>in vivo</i> tumor development and associated pain behavior characteristics following implantation of NCTC-2472 fibrosarcoma into male and female C3H/HeJ mice. The C3H/HeJ strain was utilized as these mice are syngeneic with NCTC-2472 fibrosarcoma and their use reduces potential implantation failure. We found that tumor development in mice resulted in the development of mechanical allodynia but not thermal hyperalgesia. Gabapentin, a clinically relevant analgesic, produced dose-related mechanical allodynia reversal. These studies provide further characterization of a cancer-induced bone pain model that can be used to examine novel compounds as anti-cancer and analgesic therapeutics.","author":"Yuma T.
