{"title":"Microscopy Analysis of the Effect on Biofilm Covered Bacteria Exposed to Wound Dressings Impregnated with Cuprous Oxide Microparticles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2003/v1","date":1727258789000,"content":"Microbial infections in wounds can significantly delay the healing process, with bacteria often forming protective biofilms that shield them from external threats. In this study, we evaluated the impact of copper oxide-impregnated wound dressings (referred to as COD) on a bacterial mixture comprising common gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens encased in biofilm. The bacterial mix was exposed to COD or control dressings for 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours, and the effects were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. After just 1 hour of exposure to COD, notable leakage of bacterial cytoplasmic contents was observed. By the 3-hour mark, the gram-negative bacteria exhibited formation of holes in their cell walls, while gram-positive bacteria showed a reduction in cell width. These findings demonstrate the ability of COD to effectively kill bacteria, even when protected by biofilm, supporting clinical observations of its efficacy in managing infected wounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a8db746b4c122c2e919db15adb5210a8c87fb02e676d4ba99addd0e6ca32695","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
