Stoecker</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study examined the effects of a peer-led integrated nutrition education intervention with maternal social support using Care Groups on infant growth among South Sudanese refugees in Uganda.</p> Methods <p>A community-based cluster-randomized trial (RCT) was conducted among 390 pregnant women (third trimester). Two intervention study arms were Mothers-only(n = 131) and Parents-combined (n = 142) with a Control (n = 117). WHO infant growth standards defined length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) for stunting, weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) for underweight and weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) for wasting. The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) social support index was a proxy measure for social support. A split-plot ANOVA tested the interaction effects of social support, intervention, and time on infant growth after adjusting for covariates. Further, pairwise comparisons explained mean differences in infant growth among the study arms.</p> Results <p>The mean infant birth weight was 3.1 ± 0.5 kg. Over the study period, infant stunting was most prevalent in the Control (≥ 14%) compared to Mothers-only (&lt; 9.5%) and Parents-combined (&lt; 7.4%) arms. There were significant interaction effects of the Care Group intervention and social support by time on infant mean LAZ (F <sub>(6, 560)</sub> = 28.91, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), WAZ (F <sub>(5.8, 539.4)</sub> = 12.70, <i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001) and WLZ (F <sub>(5.3, 492.5)</sub> = 3.38, <i>p</i> = 0.004). Simple main effects by the end of the study showed that the intervention improved infant mean LAZ (Mothers-only vs. Control (mean difference, <i>MD)</i> = 2.05, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; Parents-combined vs. Control, <i>MD</i> = 2.00, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and WAZ (Mothers-only vs. Control, <i>MD</i> = 1.27, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; Parents-combined vs. Control, <i>MD</i> = 1.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>Maternal social support with an integrated nutrition education intervention significantly improved infant stunting and underweight. Nutrition-sensitive approaches focused on reducing child undernutrition among post-emergency refugees may benefit from using Care Groups in programs.</p> Trial registration <p>Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT05584969.</p>","author":"Joel J.
