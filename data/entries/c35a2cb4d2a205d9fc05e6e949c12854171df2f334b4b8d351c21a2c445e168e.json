{"title":"Evaluation of landscape created by erosion control dam using physiological and psychological indicators","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309804","date":1727964000000,"content":"<p>by Yong-Rae Kim, Beom-Su Kim, Choyun Kim, Sang In Lee, Won-Shin Cho, Hyeongkeun Kweon, Chorong Song, Jung Il Seo</p>\r\n\r\nThis study demonstrated the effect of differences in the exterior of erosion control dams (ECDs) on humans. We recruited 34 university students. Participants sat 1.4 m away from the display while wearing a device for measuring heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability. They (i) took a rest while viewing a gray screen for one minute; (ii) viewed a randomly displayed image of one of the three ECDs’ images for one minute; (iii) filled out questionnaires (using the semantic differential method and a profile of mood states) for five minutes; and (iv) took a rest to wash out residual sensitivity for five minutes. The process was repeated three times with three different ECD images. No significant difference was found between the participants’ HRs measured before and while viewing the images of the three ECDs with different exterior materials, although the HRs were significantly reduced when viewing the wood-attached ECD compared with the concrete-exposed ECD. Participants perceived the concrete-exposed and stone-attached ECDs artificially, while they felt the wood-attached ECD naturally. In addition, the vigor score was significantly increased while total mood disturbance was significantly decreased when viewing the wood-attached ECD. However, there were no significant differences in other indicators, and participants’ responses to the exteriors of the ECDs were positive overall. Our findings show that people do not physiologically and psychologically perceive ECDs negatively. Therefore, securing stability against sedimentary disasters should be a priority before using the landscape elements of an ECD.","author":"Yong-Rae Kim","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c35a2cb4d2a205d9fc05e6e949c12854171df2f334b4b8d351c21a2c445e168e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
