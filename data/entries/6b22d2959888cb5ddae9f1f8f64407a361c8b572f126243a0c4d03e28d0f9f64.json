If you need to get up a climb and use a big surge in effort, that’s your fast-twitch fibres that you’re relying on. HIIT training does that perfectly.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Because HIIT intervals are short, they enable you to accumulate a lot of time at an intensity above what you’d otherwise be able to sustain in continuous blocks.

What is your training session going to look like after that? You can’t just keep periodically smashing yourself.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Nichols recommends two HIIT sessions a week – and a maximum of three – otherwise you risk <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/overtraining-syndrome/\">overtraining</a>. “You can have too much of a good thing,” he adds.</span></p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Easy riding for anaerobic fitness\" title=\"Easy riding for anaerobic fitness\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’ll need to fit in steadier rides around HIIT sessions to maintain aerobic fitness.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sam Voaden</i></span></div>\n<p><span>If you do decide to add HIIT workouts to your training, Rowe says it’s important to not neglect the rest of your riding. “</span><span>If you purely do HIIT training, you’re going to struggle with your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/5-ways-to-improve-your-cycling-endurance/\">endurance</a> because it’s all about short, sharp efforts,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bottrill agrees, adding that you still need to be logging the miles to see the true benefits of HIIT workouts translated on the road. “</span><span>You’ve still got to do that endurance base,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>He also recommends keeping HIIT to a limited phase of a training block when you want to sharpen your fitness, because of how mentally challenging sessions can be. “The hardest bit is your head,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The sessions take a lot out of you. You can find it very hard to then complete the next session. If you’re going to do that type of training, you’d probably want to build a six-week phase of it.
