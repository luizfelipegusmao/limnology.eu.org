{"title":"Is trade relevant to the macro drivers of carbon dioxide emissions? A study of high‐ and low‐trade openness economies","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12543?af=R","date":1722920271000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The objective of this research is to systematically compare the impact of macro determinants on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, using the theoretical frameworks of trade, the Environmental Kuznets Curve, and the Pollution Haven Hypothesis. The study specifically focuses on high- and low-trade-openness economies from 1995 to 2020. Methodologies employed include stepwise regression, fully modified least squares, pooled ordinary least squares, and fixed effects models. Long-run dynamics were assessed using Granger causality tests and Pedroni and Johansen cointegration tests. The results indicate both long-term and short-term relationships between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the following variables: (i) gross capital formation (GCF), (ii) per capita income (PCI), (iii) population (POP), and (iv) trade openness. Trade openness has a positive and significant effect on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in highly trade openness economies, whereas it has a negative effect in low trade-open economies. Highly open economies are more significantly impacted by GCF and POP on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared with low- trade openness economies. Additionally, PCI positively and significantly influences CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in low- trade openness countries, and this effect is greater than in high- trade openness economies. The study also identifies a bidirectional causal relationship between PCI, GCF, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in both groups of economies, as well as a unidirectional relationship between trade openness, POP, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in both high-  and low- trade openness countries.</p>","author":"Shahida Suleman, \nHassanudin Mohd Thas Thaker, \nCalvin Cheong Wing Hoh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"0beb8fc69e91afda0ff81ec7a73991aaf4eaab03dce88f799d9e2d7eb97a7a8c","category":"Environment"}
