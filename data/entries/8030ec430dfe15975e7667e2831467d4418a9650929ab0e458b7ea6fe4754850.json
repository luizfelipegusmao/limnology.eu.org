In response, this paper explores the optimized fabrication of an Adams pulse motor integrated with an Arduino microcontroller, aiming to enhance performance while addressing the specific demands of aerospace applications. The Adams pulse motor, renowned for its simplicity and efficiency, serves as the basis of this study. Operating on the principles of electromagnetism, the motor comprises a stator and rotor configuration. When given electricity in pulses, the magnetic fields generated by stators interact with the rotor, inducing rotational motion. This simplicity makes the Adams pulse motor an attractive candidate for aerospace propulsion systems, where reliability and fuel efficiency are very important. Integration with an Arduino microcontroller introduces sophisticated control capabilities, enabling real-time adjustment of motor parameters such as speed, torque, and direction. Furthermore, the Arduino facilitates sensor feedback integration, allowing for autonomous operation and fault detection. This level of control not only enhances performance but also contributes to overall system reliability. One of the key highlights of this study is the application of the optimized Adams pulse motor integrated with an Arduino microcontroller in the aerospace industry. Aircraft propulsion systems are undergoing a shift towards more sustainable alternatives. The integration of the Adams pulse motor with Arduino aligns with this motive, offering a greener and more efficient propulsion/ power solution for aerospace applications. In conclusion, the optimized fabrication of Adams pulse motors integrated with Arduino microcontrollers holds tremendous promise for the aerospace industry. As the demand for sustainable propulsion solutions continues to grow, this integrated system presents a compelling option for future aircraft propulsion systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8030ec430dfe15975e7667e2831467d4418a9650929ab0e458b7ea6fe4754850","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
