{"title":"The Status of Food Insecurity at the Household Level in the North-Eastern Highlands of Ethiopia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1881/v1","date":1714359967000,"content":"Food insecurity is a multidimensional concept adequately challenging not only the complex operationalization effort but also judgments of who is food secure and who is not. This study aimed to assess the level of household food insecurity in the study area. Both probability and non-probability sampling procedures were employed to draw the 367 respondents, key informants, and focus group discussants. The Consolidated Approach for Reportig Indicators (CARI) console model was constructed with four indicators: Food consumption score, Food energy shortfall, Food expenditure share, and Livelihood asset depletion. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze data in the models. The CARI result revealed that 41.1%, 9.3%, 20.4% and  29.2% of households were food secure, marginally food secure, moderately food insecure and severely food insecure, respectively. The overall prevalence showed that 49.6% households were food insecure and 50.4% were food secure. Moreover, female-headed households and households living the Belg and CHV livelihood zones were more food insecure than their counterparts. The study concluded that the problem of food insecurity is pervasive in the study area in general and Belg and CHV livelihood zones, in particular. Therefore, more attention and intervention should be given by policymakers and concerned development partners to alleviate the problem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92d56b397742d46bae79e37533e4702b0b0e20da853368af83b842581a9da3c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
