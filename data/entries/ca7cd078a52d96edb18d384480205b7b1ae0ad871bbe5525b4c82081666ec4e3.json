{"title":"Relationship Between Marriage and Prediabetes Among Health Care Workers: Mediating Effect of Triglycerides","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0735/v1","date":1723429459000,"content":"Background and Objectives: In the literature, relationships between being married and having prediabetes or diabetes are inconsistent. We aimed to investigate whether marriage is a protective or risk factor for prediabetes and to uncover new insights into its impact on prediabetes. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, questionnaires were distributed by email to 1,039 staff members who participated in an employee health check from a hospital affiliated with a medical university in Taiwan. Fasting blood glucose and triglyceride (TG) levels were checked and the questionnaires elicited basic demographic characteristics and included the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, logistic regression, and mediation analysis were conducted for statistical analysis. Results: Among the group aged 20–37 years, married, obesity, neck and shoulder pain, and elevated TG levels were independent risk factors for prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose). For those &gt;38 years old, overweight, obesity, and elevated triglyceride (TG) were the independent risk factors for impaired fasting glucose. Increased TG levels serve as a mediating factor linking marriage to an increased risk of prediabetes for the group aged 20–37 years. Conclusions: TG play a significant role in the association between marriage and prediabetes among the group aged 20–37 years. Therefore, dietary habits, especially those of young adult couples should be considered. Our findings connect marital status to prediabetes, facilitating advances in diabetes prevention.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ca7cd078a52d96edb18d384480205b7b1ae0ad871bbe5525b4c82081666ec4e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
