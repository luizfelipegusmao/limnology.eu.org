Tucker</p>\r\n\r\nSocial innovation in health is a ground-up, community-engaged process that draws on the diverse strengths of local individuals to drive social change and health improvement. Social innovation may be particularly useful in low and middle-income countries to ensure effective and sustainable health solutions. The purpose of this study is to describe the findings of a global youth (18–35 years old) crowdsourcing open call on social innovations, and to identify the levels of engagement in such innovations. We organized a global crowdsourcing open call (Go Youth!) to identify and recognize youth social innovations in health and adopted both quantitative and qualitative approaches to analyze our data. For quantitative analyses, we described the socio-demographic characteristics of youth who submitted innovations. For qualitative analyses, we adopted a deductive-inductive analytic approach utilizing an adapted Hart’s Ladder as a conceptual framework for our thematic analysis of participants’ submissions, which comprised four levels of youth engagement: none, minimal, moderate, and substantial. The open call received 99 eligible submissions. Most participants were 23 years of age or older (90.7%), resided in LMICs (98.0%), male (64.3%), and had a bachelor’s or higher degree (72.4%). Most of the submissions were written in English (93.9%), located in Africa (69.7%), and had prior implementation (60.2%). A total of 39 innovations had substantial youth engagement and qualitative data suggested that youth leadership and peer mentorship of other youth in the community were important aspects of engagement. LMIC youth developed and implemented social innovations that had evidence of impact or effectiveness in their communities, illustrating how social innovation approaches may be feasible in LMICs. More efforts should be made to identify and empower youth in these settings to spark change.","author":"Rayner Kay Jin Tan","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"63402c26d47037c1ccd8569a32e4ec9d005cd858ab87975951da8624ddc06af4","category":"Environment"}
