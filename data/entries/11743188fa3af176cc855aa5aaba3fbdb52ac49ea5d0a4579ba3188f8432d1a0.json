{"title":"Comparison of Kinanthropometric Values in Amateur Athletes of Different Disciplines According to their Sexual Gender","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1317/v1","date":1724056772000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Kinanthropometry is the science that deals with the measurement of variations of the physical dimensions and composition of the human body, according to the age and different degrees of nutrition of a person. This discipline postulates that all the measurements obtained in statics will have an impact on the dynamics. This studyâ€™s objective was to evaluate the kinanthropometric differences; Methods: The study was done in a population of 403 persons, aged between 18 and 42 years, who were categorized based on their biological sex and in what sport they usually practiced in a purely recreational way. Measurements and indices were obtained following the protocol of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK); Results: We observed significant differences in most of the values, for example, men use the presented higher values in relation to weight, height and size of some circumferences, in addition to Body Weight Index (BMI), Relative Index of the Lower Limbs (RILL), percentage of muscle weight (%M) and percentage of residual weight (%R). On the other hand, women presented higher values in most body folds, in addition to the Cormic Index (CI), Body Density Index (BDI), percentage of fat weight (%F) and percentage of bones weight (%B); Conclusions: This work could be useful for people to choose what kind of sport will be better for them according to their morphotype.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"11743188fa3af176cc855aa5aaba3fbdb52ac49ea5d0a4579ba3188f8432d1a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
