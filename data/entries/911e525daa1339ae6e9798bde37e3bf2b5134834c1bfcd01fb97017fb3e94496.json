{"title":"Demographic Characteristics of an Expanding Iberian Wild Goat Population in Southern Pyrenees, Spain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1593/v1","date":1713944675000,"content":"The escape and establishment of Iberian wild goats, Capra pyrenaica, from an enclosure in the 1990s marked the beginning of the recovery of the species in the Pyrenees. This population has occupied part of the Prepyrenees and has contacted another population reintroduced in France since 2014. It coexists with other wild ungulates, including the feral and domestic goats Capra hircus that has been living free since the 1960s. Today itâ€™s the largest Iberian wild goat Pyrenean population. Between 2006 and 2022 we monitored the population and its expansion based on vantage points, itineraries and testimonies. The results indicate: (i) a population, of uncertain genetic origin, in numerical (15% average annual growth) and areal expansion, with the capacity to connect with other populations; (ii) an estimate of at least 500 individuals; (iii) in the process of expansion in contact with Iberian wild goats from France; (iv) sympatry with feral and domestic goat population in its main nucleus whose estimate exceeds 2000 specimens and (v) hybridization with feral and domestic goats. In 2022 sustainable hunt started with a hunting quota of 20 individuals. Genetic characterization and the establishment of an international coordinated monitoring are two of the current priorities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"911e525daa1339ae6e9798bde37e3bf2b5134834c1bfcd01fb97017fb3e94496","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
