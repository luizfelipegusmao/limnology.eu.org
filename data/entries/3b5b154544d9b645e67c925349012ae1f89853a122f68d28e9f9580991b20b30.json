Leslie</p>\r\n\r\nGlutathione transferase P1 (GSTP1) is a multi-functional protein that protects cells from electrophiles by catalyzing their conjugation with glutathione, and contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and signalling. GSTP1, usually described as a cytosolic enzyme, can localize to other cell compartments and we have reported its strong association with the plasma membrane. In the current study, the hypothesis that GSTP1 is palmitoylated and this modification facilitates its dynamic localization and function was investigated. Palmitoylation is the reversible post-translational addition of a 16-C saturated fatty acid to proteins, most commonly on Cys residues through a thioester bond. GSTP1 in MCF7 cells was modified by palmitate, however, GSTP1 Cys to Ser mutants (individual and Cys-less) retained palmitoylation. Treatment of palmitoylated GSTP1 with 0.1 N NaOH, which cleaves ester bonds, did not remove palmitate. Purified GSTP1 was spontaneously palmitoylated <i>in vitro</i> and peptide sequencing revealed that Cys48 and Cys102 undergo <i>S-</i>palmitoylation, while Lys103 undergoes the rare <i>N-</i>palmitoylation. <i>N</i>-palmitoylation occurs via a stable NaOH-resistant amide bond. Analysis of subcellular fractions of MCF7-GSTP1 cells and a modified proximity ligation assay revealed that palmitoylated GSTP1 was present not only in the membrane fraction but also in the cytosol. GSTP1 isolated from <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, and MCF7 cells (grown under fatty acid free or regular conditions), associated with plasma membrane-enriched fractions and this association was not altered by palmitoyl CoA. Overall, GSTP1 is modified by palmitate, at multiple sites, including at least one non-Cys residue. These modifications could contribute to regulating the diverse functions of GSTP1.","author":"Vanessa Marensi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3b5b154544d9b645e67c925349012ae1f89853a122f68d28e9f9580991b20b30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
