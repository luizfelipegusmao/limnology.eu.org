{"title":"SEM Morphological Analysis of Local Regional Anesthesia Needles Used for Single and Multiple Injections on the Oral Mucosa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0275/v1","date":1719996078000,"content":"Introduction. Anesthesia is widely used in various fields of dentistry to reduce patient discomfort when the treatment would be painful. The dentist may need to infiltrate the anesthetic into multiple locations and this is usually done with the same needle which passes through the soft tissues several times to distribute the anesthetic solution over a larger area. The present study aims to evaluate, through a morphological analysis under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), how the beveled tip of a 30G needle, used to inject anesthetic several times into different areas of the vestibular mucosa, changes. Materials and methods. 30G needles with two different brands were tested, in vivo used for a variable number of sequential injections from 1 to 6 on 192 patients. The specimens were analyzed under SEM observation to evaluate any deformations induced by contact with the vestibular soft tissues. Results. The amount of deformation, measured along the axis parallel to the needle, was proportional to the number of injections. The protrusion of deformations, measured on an axis perpendicular to the needle, were maximum on the needles used 3 times. For the needles used 4,5 and 6 injections, no further increase in deformations was noted. Conclusion. From the data it seems that the tested needles are not produced to withstand multiple injections consequently after the first injection on soft tissues, they undergo a deformation which could increase the risk of injury to the mucosa itself or to nerves and vessels with which they come into contact. It would be advisable to use the single needle for a reduced number of injections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2655190c48cdd08612cd18ad61b8449a3d7dbfa3d3277268bb56d303f0938a2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
