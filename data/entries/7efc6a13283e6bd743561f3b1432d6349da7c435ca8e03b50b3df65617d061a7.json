{"title":"Use of Distributed Energy Resources Integrated with the Electric Grid in the Amazon: A Case Study of the UFPA PoraquÃª Electric Boat Using Digital Twin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0420/v1","date":1722933661000,"content":"Electric mobility is a global trend and necessity, with electric and solar boats offering a promising alternative for transportation electrification and carbon emission reduction, especially in the Amazon region. This study analyzes the system of a solar boat from the SIMA project, to be implemented at UFPA, using MATLAB software for modeling. The Simulink tool was utilized to model the system, focusing on operational parameters such as module voltage, converter voltage, and speed. Results indicate that the solar boat's operational cost is significantly lower compared to a similar internal combustion model, considering diesel's high consumption and cost. The environmental impact is also reduced, with nearly 72 tons of CO2 emissions avoided annually, thanks to Brazil's renewable energy matrix. Simulations confirmed the project's parameters, demonstrating the efficiency of digital twin technology in monitoring and predicting system performance. The study underscores the importance of digital twins and renewable energy in promoting sustainable transportation solutions, advocating for the replication of such projects globally. Future research should focus on further advancing digital twin applications in electric mobility to enhance predictive maintenance and operational efficiency.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7efc6a13283e6bd743561f3b1432d6349da7c435ca8e03b50b3df65617d061a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
