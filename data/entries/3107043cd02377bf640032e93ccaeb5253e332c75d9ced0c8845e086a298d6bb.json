{"title":"Strep Easy Kit; a bio‐enrichment dual ICG‐strip test for simultaneous detection of Streptococcus agalactiae serotypes Ia and III in fish samples","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14000?af=R","date":1721109552000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Strep Easy Kit, a bio-enrichment dual ICG-strip test, is a diagnostic tool designed for the detection of <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, an important pathogenic bacterium in tilapia farming. The kit can simultaneously identify two different serotypes of <i>S. agalactiae</i>, serotype Ia and serotype III. This capability is crucial for the collection of valuable epidemiological data and facilitates strategic planning for effective vaccine development and deployment. The Strep Easy Kit consists of two main steps: pathogen enrichment and pathogen detection. The enrichment step increases the concentration of bacteria so that the bacterial load is raised to the level reliably detectable by the subsequent ICG strip test. This is achieved by incubating the fish samples in a suitable liquid medium under specified temperature and time conditions. The second step involves the use of the dual-ICG strip test. This strip test consists of two monoclonal antibodies and one polyclonal antibody that are specific to <i>S. agalactiae</i> and can distinguish between <i>S. agalactiae</i> serotype Ia and <i>S. agalactiae</i> serotype III. This dual capability enables the ICG strip test to simultaneously detect both serotypes of <i>S. agalactiae</i> in a single test kit. The detection limit of the test kit, which consists of a dual ICG-Strip test combined with an enrichment step, is 100 CFU/mL. The kit can be used to detect <i>S. agalactiae</i> in both live and dead fish samples, making it versatile for various testing scenarios. The test results obtained using the Strep Easy Kit have shown a 94.4% correlation with the standard method (Thai Agricultural Standard; TAS 10453-2010), with 90.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Significant advantages of the Strep Easy Kit lie in its simplicity and portability, allowing farmers to perform the test by themselves and on-site. This makes it a practical and accessible tool for the tilapia farming industry.</p>","author":"Orawan Himananto, \nKirana Yoohat, \nKannawat Danwisetkanjana, \nMallika Kumpoosiri, \nSombat Rukpratanporn, \nYada Theppawong, \nNanthita Sukchai, \nSirima Siripaitoon, \nNontawith Areechon, \nSasimanas Unajak, \nOraprapai Gajanandana","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"3107043cd02377bf640032e93ccaeb5253e332c75d9ced0c8845e086a298d6bb","category":"Environment"}
