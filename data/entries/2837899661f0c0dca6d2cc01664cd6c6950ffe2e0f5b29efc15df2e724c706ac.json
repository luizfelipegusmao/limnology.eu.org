The aim of the study was to explore factors associated with LARC usage among Zimbabwean adolescent girls and young women, using data from the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey. Cross tabulations and chi-square tests were used initially to describe associations. Odd ratios were then used to measure the strength of association between LARCs usage and the independent variables using stepwise multinomial logistic regression. From the 2132 sexually active females included in the study 9.1% were LARCs users and 42% were SARCs users at the time of the survey. Secondary and primary education had increased odds of not using any method (OR: 5.032, 95% CI: 2.136–11.8512 and OR: 5.799, 95% CI: 2.327–14.453 respectively) compared to tertiary education. Women with no living children had increased odds of not using any method (OR 66.543, 95% CI: 25.784–171.7381). Being not married was associated with decreased odds of SARCs usage (OR 0.399, 95% CI: 0.285–0.558). Desire for no more children was associated with reduced odds of SARCs usage (OR: 0.448, 95% CI: 0.304–0.66). Being a member of the Apostolic Faith church was associated with increased odds of not using any method (OR 1.423517, 95% CI: 1.018–1.990309). In conclusion, acquiring a tertiary education, having children, a desire to cease bearing children altogether, being unmarried and belonging to the highest wealth class were generally associated with an increased likelihood of using LARCs. Being a member of the Apostolic Faith church was associated with a decreased likelihood of LARCs usage. Findings from the study are relevant in the Zimbabwean context and highlights the relevant factors essential to focus on, when carrying out interventions aimed at increasing LARCs uptake in the country.","author":"Isaac Chipako","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"2837899661f0c0dca6d2cc01664cd6c6950ffe2e0f5b29efc15df2e724c706ac","category":"Environment"}
