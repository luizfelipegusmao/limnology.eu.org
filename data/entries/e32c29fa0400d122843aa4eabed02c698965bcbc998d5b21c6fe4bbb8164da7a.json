{"title":"Ripe on time: How posttranslational modifications of a transcription factor impact tomato fruit ripening","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/14/7683262?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span>Food loss during postharvest storage is not just an economic problem but also forms a major threat to global food security. Fruits and vegetables especially are susceptible to spoilage and quality loss. One of the most important crops worldwide is tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>), with approximately 180.8 million tons of tomato fruits being produced each year (<a href=\"#kiae308-B4\">León-García et al. 2017</a>; <a href=\"#kiae308-B7\">Meng et al. 2022</a>). Tomato is also used as a model plant to investigate senescence and fruit ripening because of its short life cycle and relatively small (900 Mb) genome (<a href=\"#kiae308-B8\">Tomato Genome Consortium 2012</a>). Furthermore, an easy readout for tomato fruit ripening is the production of carotenoids, the organic pigments that give the ripe tomato its characteristic red color (<a href=\"#kiae308-B5\">Liu et al. 2015</a>; <a href=\"#kiae308-B6\">Llorente et al. 2016</a>). Fruit ripening is a complex process modulated by several signaling molecules like ethylene, abscisic acid, and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) (<a href=\"#kiae308-B1\">Alexander and Grierson 2002</a>; <a href=\"#kiae308-B3\">Kai et al. 2019</a>). Candidate species for the transduction of signals triggered by H<sub>2</sub>S are post-translationally modified proteins, called persulfides, where a cysteine thiol (-SH) is covalently bound to sulfur (-SSH) (<a href=\"#kiae308-B2\">Corpas et al. 2021</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"e32c29fa0400d122843aa4eabed02c698965bcbc998d5b21c6fe4bbb8164da7a","category":"Environment"}
