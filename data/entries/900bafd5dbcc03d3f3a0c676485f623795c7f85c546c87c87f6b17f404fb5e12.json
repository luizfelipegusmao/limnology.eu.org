{"title":"Modern Contraceptive Use: An Analysis of The Factors Influencing Its Adoption Among Women of Reproductive Age in North-Central Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1833/v1","date":1729737450000,"content":"Objectives: In Nigeria, modern contraceptive use remains relatively low despite numerous efforts to increase awareness and accessibility. This study examined the geopolitical factors influencing modern contraceptive use in North-central Nigeria Design: Using data from the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, this study quantitatively investigated the factors influencing modern contraceptive use among women of reproductive age. The data were analyzed using R studio. Respondents' characteristics were described using frequency and percentage. A logistic regression model was employed to identify factors associated with modern contraceptive usage in the north-central region of Nigeria. Bivariate logistic regression was carried out between the explanatory and response variables. Settings: This study focused specifically on the north-central zone of Nigeria comprising 6 states, namely, Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger, and Plateau states with the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Results: Nearly one-third (30.1%) of the respondents are above 35 years of age. 3 out of every 5 (61.2%) respondents are currently married. This study found that the average modern contraceptive usage among women of reproductive age in north Central Nigeria is less than 15%. Age, education, childbirth delivery method, number of children, access to media, and state of residence are key drivers of modern contraceptive adoption and utilization among women of reproductive age in north-central Nigeria. Conclusion: This study finds it plausible to increase the awareness and sensitization of modern contraceptives and contraceptive usage in this region. There is a need for health education on the benefits and relevance of modern contraceptive usage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"900bafd5dbcc03d3f3a0c676485f623795c7f85c546c87c87f6b17f404fb5e12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
