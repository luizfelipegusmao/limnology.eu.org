Despite being suggested as antioxidants due to the high reactivity of their vinyl ether groups with reactive oxygen species, our study reveals the generation of subsequent reactive oxygen and electrophilic lipid species from oxidized plasmalogen intermediates. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the oxidation products by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS), we demonstrate that singlet molecular oxygen [O<sub>2</sub> (<sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>)] reacts with the vinyl ether bond, producing hydroperoxyacetal as a major primary product (97%) together with minor quantities of dioxetane (3%). Furthermore, we show that these primary oxidized intermediates are capable of further generating reactive species including excited triplet carbonyls and O<sub>2</sub> (<sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>) as well as electrophilic phospholipid and fatty aldehyde species as secondary reaction products. The generation of excited triplet carbonyls from dioxetane thermal decomposition was confirmed by light emission measurements in the visible region using dibromoanthracene as a triplet enhancer. Moreover, O<sub>2</sub> (<sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>) generation from dioxetane and hydroperoxyacetal was evidenced by detection of near-infrared light emission at 1,270 nm and chemical trapping experiments. Additionally, we have thoroughly characterized alpha–beta unsaturated phospholipid and fatty aldehydes by LC–HRMS analysis using two probes that specifically react with aldehydes and alpha–beta unsaturated carbonyls. Overall, our findings demonstrate the generation of excited molecules and electrophilic lipid species from oxidized plasmalogen species unveiling the potential prooxidant nature of plasmalogen-oxidized products.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"10442af2cf8b1a6c91c9080bd94cde3d8fe824290dcc046b1540d57f7b292955","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
