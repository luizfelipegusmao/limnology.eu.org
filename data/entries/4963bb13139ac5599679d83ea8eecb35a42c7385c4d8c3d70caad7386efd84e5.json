{"title":"Ongoing introgression of a secondary sexual plumage trait in a stable avian hybrid zone","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/9/1539/7675325?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Hybrid zones are dynamic systems where natural selection, sexual selection, and other evolutionary forces can act on reshuffled combinations of distinct genomes. The movement of hybrid zones, individual traits, or both are of particular interest for understanding the interplay between selective processes. In a hybrid zone involving two lek-breeding birds, secondary sexual plumage traits of <span>Manacus vitellinus</span>, including bright yellow collar and olive belly color, have introgressed ~50 km asymmetrically across the genomic center of the zone into populations more genetically similar to <span>Manacus candei</span>. Males with yellow collars are preferred by females and are more aggressive than parental <span>M. candei</span>, suggesting that sexual selection was responsible for the introgression of male traits. We assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of this hybrid zone using historical (1989–1994) and contemporary (2017–2020) transect samples to survey both morphological and genetic variation. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data and several male phenotypic traits show that the genomic center of the zone has remained spatially stable, whereas the olive belly color of male <span>M. vitellinus</span> has continued to introgress over this time period. Our data suggest that sexual selection can continue to shape phenotypes dynamically, independent of a stable genomic transition between species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"4963bb13139ac5599679d83ea8eecb35a42c7385c4d8c3d70caad7386efd84e5","category":"Environment"}
