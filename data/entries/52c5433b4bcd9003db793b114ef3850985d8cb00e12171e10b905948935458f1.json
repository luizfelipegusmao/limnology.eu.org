{"title":"Impact of increasing dietary standardized ileal digestible arginine to lysine ratio from 0.85 to 1.15 and water-based arginine supplementation on growth performance and gut integrity of weaned pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae102/7710098?rss=1","date":1720569600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this experiment was to assess the influence of arginine (Arg) supplementation in water and/or feed on the growth performance and gastrointestinal health of newly weaned pigs. Two hundred and forty pigs (5.06 kg; PIC, Hendersonville, TN) were randomly allocated into 80 mixed-sex pens (3 pigs/pen) and subjected to a 2 × 4 factorial design. Two levels of Arg were supplemented in water (0% or 8% stock, dosed through a 1:128 proportioner) for the first phase (days 0 to 7), and four dietary arginine levels (0.85, 0.95, 1.05, and 1.15) standardized ileal digestible (SID) Arg to Lysine (Lys) ratios for the first two phases (days 0 to 7 and 7 to 21). All treatments were provided a common diet (0.96 SID Arg:Lys) for the last phase days 21 to 42. One pig per pen underwent a dual sugar absorption test of lactulose at 500 mg/kg and mannitol at 50 mg/kg of body weight (BW) via gastric tube on days 7 and 21 postweaning, with blood plasma collected 4 h later. The pig tested on day 7 was subsequently euthanized for intestinal tissue collection. Pen growth performance and feed disappearance were evaluated for 3 phases: days 0 to 7, 7 to 21, and 21 to 42 postweaning. The statistical analysis used linear models to examine the effects of SID Arg:Lys in the feed, Arg level in water, and their interactions, with pen as the experimental unit. Orthogonal contrasts were used to test the linear and quadratic effects of increasing SID Arg:Lys in the diet. Growth performance during the first period exhibited variability, reflected by negative gain-to-feed (G:F) ratios, caused by the enteric health challenge. Consequently, data were analyzed separately for each phase. Increasing dietary SID Arg:Lys caused a linear improvement (<span>P</span> = 0.04) in final BW (18.47 and 21.90 kg, for 0.85 and 1.15 SID Arg:Lys, respectively). A trend (<span>P</span> = 0.09) suggested a linear impact of dietary SID Arg:Lys on average daily gain during days 21 to 42. Arg supplementation, whether administered through water or diet, did not affect lactulose and mannitol absorption on both days 7 and 21, nor did it alter histological measurements in the collected ileum tissues on day 7 postweaning. In conclusion, increasing dietary SID Arg:Lys increased final BW but had no clear impacts on intestinal health within the parameters measured, potentially impacted by the rotavirus diagnosis in the first week post-wean.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"52c5433b4bcd9003db793b114ef3850985d8cb00e12171e10b905948935458f1","category":"Environment"}
