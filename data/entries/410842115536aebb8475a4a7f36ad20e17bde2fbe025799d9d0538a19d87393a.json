{"title":"Research on the Mechanics and Cutting Performance of Multilayer Nanostructured TiAlN/TiSiN/ZrN Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1487/v1","date":1726740237000,"content":"The aerospace industry has made extensive use of titanium alloy material due to its exceptional qualities, which include high strength, low weight, and resistance to corrosion. However, these qualities also pose challenges for the material's processing. This paper examines the Ti6Al4V milling endmills coating. First, an analysis is done on the solubility of Ti and Si elements. It is discovered that W and Co elements are far more soluble in Ti than Si and Zr elements, which can effectively stop element diffusion. Next, the base's composition was planned. It was discovered that when the amount of Al increased, the base's surface roughness increased while its hardness and elastic modulus decreased. The binding force between the substrate and the base was greater at 50: 50 Ti:Al ratio. TiSiN and TiSiN/ZrN functional layer properties are examined. When Zr is added to TiSiN/ZrN coating, it improves the coating's hardness and elastic modulus, increases density, and decreases surface roughness and friction coefficient when compared to TiSiN coating. Lastly, an analysis of the initial and intermediate tool wear was done using the Ti6Al4V milling experiment. It was discovered that adding Zr element could successfully extend the tool's cutting life by preventing adhesive wear.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"410842115536aebb8475a4a7f36ad20e17bde2fbe025799d9d0538a19d87393a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
