{"title":"Can the Necrophagous Blow Fly Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Be Reared on Plant-Based Meal?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1460/v1","date":1716383443000,"content":"The oviparous blow fly Calliphora vicina has shown potential as a managed pollination species to support honeybee (Apis mellifera) usage in Australian horticulture. This blow fly species lays eggs onto carrion soon after death and the resultant larvae that hatch are necrophagous and feed on the decomposing tissues of the dead animal. Newly hatched larvae of this fly were provided with plant-based meals (soya bean and canola) and compared with animal-derived meatmeal to determine if plant-based meal could be used to mass rear this blow fly species. Both soyabean and canola meal media did not support the survival of any larvae through to adult eclosion. The addition of only 10% whole egg powder to the plant-based meals enabled survival to eclosion of 39% and 13% on soyabean and canola based medias respectively compared with 76% on animal-based meatmeal with 10% whole egg powder. Larvae fed livestock meatmeal with 10% whole dried egg powder had the fastest development to the pupal stage, the highest pupation rate, the heaviest pupae and the highest subsequent adult eclosion. This study concluded that the use of plant-based meals in the mass rearing of the blow fly C. vicina was neither viable, nor economically viable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3211cba3e96eb030295a1a7f22e8680fc1eaf0d55d182fbbde6289ff2f2c289c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
