{"title":"Discovery of Benzisothiazolone Derivatives as Bifunctional Inhibitors of HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase DNA Polymerase and Ribonuclease H Activities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0032/v1","date":1717394166000,"content":"The ribonuclease H (RNase H) active site of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is the only viral enzyme not targeted by approved antiretroviral drugs. Using a fluorescence-based in vitro assay, we screened 65,239 compounds at a final concentration of 10 µM to identify inhibitors of RT RNase H activity. We identified 41 compounds that exhibited 50% inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50) values &amp;lt; 1.0 µM. Two of these compounds, 2-(4-methyl-3-(piperidin-1-ylsulfonyl)phenyl)benzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one (1) and ethyl 2-(2-(3-oxobenzo[d]isothiazol-2(3H)-yl)thiazol-4-yl)acetate (2), which both share the same benzisothiazolone pharmacophore, demonstrate robust antiviral activity (50% effective concentrations of 1.68 ± 0.94 µM and 2.68 ± 0.54, respectively) in the absence of cellular toxicity. A limited structure-activity relationship analysis identified two additional benzisothiazolone analogs, 2-methylbenzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one (3) and N,N-diethyl-3-(3-oxobenzo[d]isothiazol-2(3H)-yl)benzenesulfonamide (4), which also resulted in inhibition of RT RNase H activity and virus replication. Compounds 1, 2 and 4, but not 3, inhibited the DNA polymerase activity of RT (IC50 values ~ 1 to 6 µM). In conclusion, benzisothiazolone derivatives represent a new class of multifunctional RT inhibitors that warrants further assessment for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09dbc29285b039cf214b24d8a02901029ee937707cb775762179fed1e87b902b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
