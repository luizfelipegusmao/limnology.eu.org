{"title":"IoT Security Risk Assessment and Mitigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0468/v1","date":1725540753000,"content":"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed various sectors, from smart homes to industrial systems. However, this growth has introduced significant security risks due to the increased attack surface and diverse nature of IoT devices. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of IoT security risks and explores effective mitigation strategies. We first categorize the primary risks associated with IoT, including data breaches, device manipulation, and network vulnerabilities. Using a multi-layered approach, we analyze these risks in different contexts, such as consumer IoT, industrial IoT, and healthcare. The study then reviews existing security frameworks and protocols, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We propose a hybrid mitigation strategy combining encryption, access control, and anomaly detection to enhance IoT security. Furthermore, we discuss the role of regulatory standards and best practices in reinforcing IoT security. The findings underscore the need for a proactive and adaptive security posture to address evolving threats in the IoT landscape.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b12038881386dfc4cd64e24e738ecf6e6ad48223c65315e1b807e97b63f9618","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
