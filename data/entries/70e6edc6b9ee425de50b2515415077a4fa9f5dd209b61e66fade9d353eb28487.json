{"title":"The Roles of Obesity and ASB4 in Preeclampsia Pathogenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1423/v1","date":1721212978000,"content":"Preeclampsia is a complex pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder which poses significant risks for both maternal and fetal health. Preeclampsia affects 5-8% of the pregnancies in the United States, causing a significant public health and economic burden. Despite extensive research, the etiology and pathogenesis of preeclampsia remain elusive, but have been correlated with maternal conditions such as obesity. In the past decades, the incidence of preeclampsia increased along with the prevalence of obesity among women of reproductive age. Maternal obesity has been shown to negatively affect pregnancy in almost all aspects. However, the precise mechanisms by which obesity influences preeclampsia are unclear. Ankyrin repeat and SOCS Box Containing protein 4 (ASB4) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can promote the degradation of a wide range of target proteins. ASB4-null mice display a full spectrum of preeclampsia-like phenotypes during pregnancy including hypertension, proteinuria, and decreased litter size. Furthermore, maternal obesity induced by a high fat diet aggravates preeclampsia-like phenotypes in pregnant mice lacking ASB4. Variants in the ASB4 gene have been associated with obesity in humans, and a functional connection between the ASB4 gene and obesity has been established in mice. This review discusses the connections between preeclampsia, obesity, and ASB4.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70e6edc6b9ee425de50b2515415077a4fa9f5dd209b61e66fade9d353eb28487","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
