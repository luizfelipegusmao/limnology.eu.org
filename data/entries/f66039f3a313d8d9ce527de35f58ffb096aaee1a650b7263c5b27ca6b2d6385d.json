Ideal bio-interfaces would facilitate signal transductions by providing optimized biomaterial-cell interactions. With the increased capability to manipulate matter at different length scales, new bio-interface materials are being developed through different material selections and designs. Multi-scale characterization techniques are imperative for elucidating the intricate mechanisms underlying bio-interface interactions, thereby providing critical insights for the conceptualization and design of future materials. Here, we will introduce some of our recent work on bio-interface design with multi-scale characterization for microbial modulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f66039f3a313d8d9ce527de35f58ffb096aaee1a650b7263c5b27ca6b2d6385d","category":"Environment"}
