{"title":"Comparison of Methods for Isolating Exosomes from Plasma in Subjects with Normal and High-Fat Percentage and 3T3-L1 Cell Culture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0665/v1","date":1715329498000,"content":"The adipose tissue is responsible for fat storage and is the major producer of exosomes. Biological content transported by the exosomes provides information, such as immunometabolic alterations. This study aimed to isolate whole exosomes from plasma and supernatant of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells using three isolation techniques. Plasma from 120 individuals categorized by body adipose tissue proportion and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were used in this study. The exosome isolation techniques were differential centrifugation (DC), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and a commercial kit (Invitrogen), and characterized by cryo-TEM, TEM, and western blot for the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81. In the three isolation techniques, cryo-TEM and TEM analysis showed similar quality, quantity, and morphology of exosomes; at the same time, no difference was observed between individuals categorized by proportion of body fat. According to our results, the concentration of the circulating exosomes is not different between normal and high-fat percentage individuals, but rather their composition. The SEC and kit commercial proved that compile with most of the advantages of an exosome isolation technique, nerveless we emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate methodology depending on the specific research objectives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0787690fddb345be3e00b1bb3ff864e6d73a10a52c859a5e83c36e3feff63994","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
