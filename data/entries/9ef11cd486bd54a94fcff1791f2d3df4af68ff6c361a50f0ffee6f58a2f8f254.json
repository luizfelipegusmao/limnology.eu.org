{"title":"Effects of sources and routes of administration of vitamins A, D and copper on postnatal status of these micronutrients in piglets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txad138/7458859?rss=1","date":1701734400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Twenty-six nulliparous sows were fed conventional gestation and lactation diets supplemented (<span>N</span> = 13) or not (<span>N</span> = 13) with extra daily supplements of 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol (25-OH-D3; 4 ĸIU), β-carotene (24 ĸIU), and copper (<strong>Cu</strong>)-proteinate (45 mg) from day 90 of gestation to 21 d of lactation (<strong>L21</strong>). In each litter, 10 piglets were divided into 5 pairs received, at 2 (<strong>L2</strong>) and 8 d (<strong>L8</strong>) of age, one of the five combinations of micronutrient sources and routes of administration (<span>N</span> = 260 piglets total). These neonatal treatments (<span>N </span>= 26 pairs or 52 piglets each) consisted of oral vitamin D3, retinol acetate and CuSO<sub>4</sub> (<strong>T1</strong>); oral 25-OH-D3, β-carotene, and Cu proteinate (<strong>T2</strong>); exposure to ultraviolet light (<strong>UVB</strong>), oral retinol palmitate and Cu gluconate (<strong>T3</strong>); intramuscular vitamin D3 and retinyl propionate and oral Cu acetate (<strong>T4</strong>); oral saline (<strong>CTRL</strong>). Oral or intramuscular provisions corresponded to 12 mg of Cu and 70 and 12 ĸIU of vitamins A and D, respectively. Blood samples were collected from all piglets at L2, L8, and L21 for determination of serum Cu, retinol, and 25-OH-D3. Body weight was measured at birth, L2, L8, and L21. Piglets were weaned at L21, and liver and blood samples were collected 2 d later to evaluate oxidative enzymes in blood and liver and hepatic ATP concentrations and expression of genes associated with antioxidant status. Sow treatments had marginal or no impacts on Cu, retinol, 25-OH-D3, or antioxidant status in piglet blood serum and liver. However, when supplements were given to piglets, hepatic Cu was 38% greater in for all treated piglets compared to CTRL (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), hepatic retinol was 3 times higher in T1 than in CTRL (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.01) and intermediate for other treatments whereas serum 25-OH-D3 was markedly increased with T2 and T3 at L8 and L21, respectively, compared to CTRL (Piglet treatment × Age interaction, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Concerning antioxidant activities, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) in plasma of T2 piglets whereas the highest values (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) for indicators of oxidative damage to proteins were observed in T4 piglets. The study revealed that oral Cu proteinate from T2, oral retinol acetate from T1, oral 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol from T2, and UVB light exposure from T3 were the most efficient ways of increasing the postnatal status of these micronutrients in suckling piglets and this may have some impacts on their peri-weaning antioxidant status.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"9ef11cd486bd54a94fcff1791f2d3df4af68ff6c361a50f0ffee6f58a2f8f254","category":"Environment"}
