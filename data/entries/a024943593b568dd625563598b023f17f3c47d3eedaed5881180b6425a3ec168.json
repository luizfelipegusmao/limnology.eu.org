{"title":"Estimating Sediment Trap Efficiency of Flood Events During Flood Season in the Three Gorges Reservoir","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036975?af=R","date":1727941501000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Sediment trapping significantly influences the comprehensive benefits of reservoirs and hinders the connection between sediment and nutrients in the upstream and downstream of rivers. Quantifying the role of sediment trapping by dams is important because this operation controls fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, and water quality, particularly for flood processes with highly variable inflows. This study developed a new model to calculate the sediment trap efficiency (TE) of flood events during the flood season in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) using a generalized theoretical approach. The TE of 55 flood events that occurred since the impoundment of the TGR were calculated and ranged from 16.0% to 99.8%, with a mean of 77.8%. Contrary to the previous understanding that large reservoirs have consistently large TE values based on long-term data, our results show that large reservoirs can have a wide range of TE values during short-term flood events. The proposed model estimates TE using three variables: inflow discharge, outflow discharge, and reservoir water level. Furthermore, the additional sedimentation risk to the TGR by optimized scheduling during the flood season is discussed. The results provide a reference for sedimentation management and optimal operation in the TGR.</p>","author":"Shi Ren, \nYu Gao, \nWei‚ÄêJie Wang, \nYinjun Zhou, \nHanqing Zhao","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"a024943593b568dd625563598b023f17f3c47d3eedaed5881180b6425a3ec168","category":"Environment"}
