{"title":"Effect of Phytohormone Kinetin on Cell Density, Photosynthetic Pigments, Antioxidant Enzymes, and Fatty Acid Composition of the Microalgae Tetraselmis suecica","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/5967771?af=R","date":1690009200000,"content":"<p>The effects of phytohormone Kinetin on cell density, photosynthetic pigments, antioxidant enzymes, and fatty acids composition of the microalgae <i>Tetraselmis suecica</i> were investigated. <i>T. suecica</i> was treated with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/L) of Kinetin at optimal growth conditions (salinity 28 g/L, temperature 25°C, and 24 hr photoperiod). Results indicated an increase in cell density in all treatments compared to the control; however, it was not significant, except for the treatment, 15 mg/L (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The content of photosynthetic pigments and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, measured after 10 days, significantly increased in the presence of Kinetin (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Total <i>n</i>-3 fatty acid was significantly higher at 25 mg/L of Kinetin. At 15 mg/L, arachidonic acid (ARA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were significantly higher compared to the control (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, Kinetin could be useful for the production of the microalgae <i>Tetraselmis suecica</i> to increase growth, chemical composition, and antioxidant enzyme activity.</p>","author":"Tahereh Asghari, \nNasrollah Ahmadifard, \nMehdi Nikoo, \nFemi Fawole","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"0a6865baa88ea5359b735d2c2918db9d0ad1267bf0f23c1c0bd608abf19a482d","category":"Environment"}
