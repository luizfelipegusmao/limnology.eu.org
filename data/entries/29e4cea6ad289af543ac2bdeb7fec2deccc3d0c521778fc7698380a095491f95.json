{"title":"Leisure Instruction Content Considered Important by Special Education Teachers for Students with Intellectual Disabilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0659/v1","date":1725882789000,"content":"Leisure education has the potential to improve quality of life and prepares students for social par-ticipation after graduation. This study aimed to elucidate the perspectives of special education teachers regarding leisure instruction. This study surveyed 538 teachers from 10 special needs schools for students with intellectual disabilities in Prefecture A, a rural area of Japan. An online survey was conducted from October 21 to November 17, 2023. The survey items were based on 13 aspects of leisure instruction identified from a literature review related to leisure instruction in Japan and a qualitative analysis of interviews with high school teachers in special needs schools for stu-dents with intellectual disabilities. The results showed that “The ability to pass time during brief periods of free time,” “Various activity experiences that lead to leisure,” and “Knowing one’s strengths and weaknesses in activities” were significantly more important during school. Con-versely, “understanding the psychological importance of leisure,” “connecting with organizations that support leisure activities,” and “finding places to engage in leisure activities” were significantly more important after graduation. The results of this study will be used to identify gaps in percep-tions between special education teachers and vocational rehabilitation practitioners responsible for post-social participation support.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"29e4cea6ad289af543ac2bdeb7fec2deccc3d0c521778fc7698380a095491f95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
