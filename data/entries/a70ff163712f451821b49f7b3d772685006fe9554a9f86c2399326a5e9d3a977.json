{"title":"Genetic engineering low-arsenic and low-cadmium rice grain","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/2143/7470473?rss=1","date":1702339200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Rice is prone to take up the toxic elements arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) from paddy soil through the transporters for other essential elements. Disruption of these essential transporters usually adversely affects the normal growth of rice and the homeostasis of essential elements. Here we report on developing low-As and low-Cd rice grain through the co-overexpression of <span>OsPCS1</span>, <span>OsABCC1</span>, and <span>OsHMA3</span> genes under the control of the rice <span>OsActin1</span> promoter. Co-overexpression of <span>OsPCS1</span> and <span>OsABCC1</span> synergistically decreased As concentration in the grain. Overexpression of <span>OsPCS1</span> also decreased Cd concentration in the grain by restricting the xylem-to-phloem Cd transport in node I, but paradoxically caused Cd hypersensitivity as the overproduced phytochelatins in <span>OsPCS1</span>-overexpressing plants suppressed OsHMA3-dependent Cd sequestration in vacuoles and promoted Cd transport from root to shoot. Co-overexpression of <span>OsHAM3</span> and <span>OsPCS1</span> overcame this suppression and complemented the Cd hypersensitivity. Compared with non-transgenic rice control, co-overexpression of <span>OsABCC1</span>, <span>OsPCS1</span>, and <span>OsHMA3</span> in rice decreased As and Cd concentrations in grain by 92.1% and 98%, respectively, without causing any defect in plant growth and reproduction or of mineral nutrients in grain. Our research provides an effective approach and useful genetic materials for developing low-As and low-Cd rice grain.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"a70ff163712f451821b49f7b3d772685006fe9554a9f86c2399326a5e9d3a977","category":"Environment"}
