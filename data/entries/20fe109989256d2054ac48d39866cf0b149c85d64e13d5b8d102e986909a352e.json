{"title":"A Mannose-Modified Lipid Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticle Vaccine Increased the Anti-Tumor Immune Response by Modulating the Tumor Microenvironment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1365/v1","date":1711114679000,"content":"With the rapid development of tumor immunotherapy, nanoparticle vaccines have attracted much attention as a potential therapeutic strategy. The potential role of the mannose-modified lipid calcium phosphate nanoparticle vaccine in enhancing the anti-tumor immune response was investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mannose modification on the immune response of nanoparticles in regulating the tumor microenvironment through systematic review and analysis and to explore its potential clinical application in tumor therapy. Currently, despite the potential advantages of nanoparticle vaccines in immunotherapy, achieving an effective immune response in the tumor microenvironment remains a challenge. Tumor immune escape and overexpression of immunosuppressive factors limit its clinical application. Therefore, this study will explore how to intervene in the immunosuppressive mechanism in the tumor microenvironment through mannose-modified lipid calcium phosphate nanoparticle vaccines so as to improve the immunotherapy effect of tumor patients and provide new ideas and strategies for the field of tumor therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20fe109989256d2054ac48d39866cf0b149c85d64e13d5b8d102e986909a352e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
