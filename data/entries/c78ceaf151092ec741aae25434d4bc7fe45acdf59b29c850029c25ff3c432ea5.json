{"title":"Exploring the relationship between frugivorous birds and fruit trees in urban parks using citizen science data","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11252-024-01625-y","date":1738368000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The occurrence of frugivorous bird species is strongly associated with the occurrence of fruit tree species in natural environments. However, the presence of a similar relationship in urban areas has not been explored. In this study, we used citizen science and field data to test for the existence of this relationship in 24 urban parks in Beijing, China. We compared the species richness and species composition of the two groups after accounting for park area, differences in diet among bird species, and differences in phenology between the two groups. We also constructed an interaction network between frugivorous bird and fruit tree species to evaluate the importance of each fruit tree species. Our results showed a significant positive relationship between the species richness of frugivorous birds and fruit trees. This relationship was significant year-long except during the summer for 133 bird-tree pairs. Park areas did not significantly affect the relationship. However, we found the interaction effect of the park area and the richness of fruit tree species mediated the relationship in certain months. We did not detect significant relationships in species composition between frugivorous birds and fruit trees. Amur honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera maackii</em>), Chinese Juniper (<em>Sabina chinensis</em>), and Oriental persimmon (<em>Diospyros kaki</em>) played a central role in the network of frugivorous bird and fruit tree species. Our results provide evidence for cross-trophic interactions between frugivorous bird species and fruit tree species, justifying planting fruit trees to enhance bird diversity and resilience in urban areas. However, this objective should focus on maximizing fruit production by planting key fruit tree species rather than increasing the total number of fruit tree species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"c78ceaf151092ec741aae25434d4bc7fe45acdf59b29c850029c25ff3c432ea5","category":"Environment"}
