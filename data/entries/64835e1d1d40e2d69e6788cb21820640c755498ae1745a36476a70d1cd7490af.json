{"title":"Navigating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Societal Implications, Ethical Considerations, and Governance Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1573/v1","date":1721377854000,"content":"Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a pivotal advancement in AI with far- reaching implications across technological, ethical, and societal domains. This paper addresses the following: (1) an in-depth assessment of AGI’s transformative potential across different sectors and its multifaceted implications, including significant financial impacts like workforce disruption, income inequality, productivity gains, and potential systemic risks; (2) an examination of critical ethical considerations, including transparency and accountability, complex ethical dilemmas and societal impact; (3) a detailed analysis of privacy, legal and policy implications, particularly in intellectual property and liability, and (4) a proposed governance framework to ensure responsible AGI development and deployment. Additionally, the paper explores and addresses AGI's political implications, including national security and potential misuse. By analyzing and considering computer science, philosophy, economics, and policy perspectives, we offer a multidisciplinary view of AGI’s challenges and opportunities, advocating for proactive measures to align AGI development with human values and societal interests.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64835e1d1d40e2d69e6788cb21820640c755498ae1745a36476a70d1cd7490af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
