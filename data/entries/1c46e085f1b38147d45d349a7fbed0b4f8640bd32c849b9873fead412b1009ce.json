{"title":"Intense training prevents the amnestic effect of inactivation of dorsomedial striatum and induces high resistance to extinction","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305066","date":1717682400000,"content":"<p>by Martha Martínez-Degollado, Andrea C.

Prado-Alcalá</p>\r\n\r\nA large body of evidence has shown that treatments that interfere with memory consolidation become ineffective when animals are subjected to an intense learning experience; this effect has been observed after systemic and local administration of amnestic drugs into several brain areas, including the striatum. However, the effects of amnestic treatments on the process of extinction after intense training have not been studied. Previous research demonstrated increased spinogenesis in the dorsomedial striatum, but not in the dorsolateral striatum after intense training, indicating that the dorsomedial striatum is involved in the protective effect of intense training. To investigate this issue, male Wistar rats, previously trained with low, moderate, or high levels of foot shock, were used to study the effect of tetrodotoxin inactivation of dorsomedial striatum on memory consolidation and subsequent extinction of inhibitory avoidance. Performance of the task was evaluated during seven extinction sessions. Tetrodotoxin produced a marked deficit of memory consolidation of inhibitory avoidance trained with low and moderate intensities of foot shock, but normal consolidation occurred when a relatively high foot shock was used. The protective effect of intense training was long-lasting, as evidenced by the high resistance to extinction exhibited throughout the extinction sessions. We discuss the possibility that increased dendritic spinogenesis in dorsomedial striatum may underly this protective effect, and how this mechanism may be related to the resilient memory typical of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).","author":"Martha Martínez-Degollado","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1c46e085f1b38147d45d349a7fbed0b4f8640bd32c849b9873fead412b1009ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
