{"title":"Scaling of fast‐start performance and its thermal dependence in mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15613?af=R","date":1710504692000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Fast-start predator-escape performance and its sensitivity to temperature (24, 30, and 36°C) were evaluated in mummichog <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i> across a range of body sizes spanning YOY to adult (35–68 mm standard length). Mummichogs exhibit isometry of body dimensions and areas of the dorsal and anal fins but negative allometry of the caudal fin area. These scaling relationships are consistent with observed decreases in fast-start angular velocities with increasing body size. Linear velocity, on the contrary, does not vary with size, and both large and small mummichogs are capable of traversing similar distances in a given amount of time. In addition, temperature influences fast-start performance in similar ways over the size range, though the magnitude of the effect varies with size for some performance measures. In general, fast-start performance increases with test temperature, but mummichogs acclimated to warmer temperatures exhibit lower performance at each test temperature. Altogether, our results suggest that mummichogs across the adult size range may suffer decreases in their predator-escape performance as increasing sea temperatures combine with short-term temperature fluctuations in the estuaries these fish occupy.</p>","author":"David C.
