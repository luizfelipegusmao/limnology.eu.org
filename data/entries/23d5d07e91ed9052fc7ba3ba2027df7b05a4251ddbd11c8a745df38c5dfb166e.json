{"title":"Rotating Target Detection Using Commercial 5G Signal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0952/v1","date":1713232208000,"content":"Passive radar detection emerges as a pivotal method for environmental perception and target de-tection within radar applications. Leveraging its advantages, including minimal electromagnetic pollution and efficient spectrum utilization, passive radar methodologies have garnered increasing interest. In recent years, there has been an increasing selection of passive radar signal sources, and the emerging 5G has the characteristics of high frequency band, high bandwidth, and a large number of base stations, which make it have significant advantages in passive radar. Therefore, this paper introduces a passive radar target detection method based on 5G signals and designs a rotating target speed measurement experiment. In the experiment, this paper validated the method of de-tecting rotating targets using 5G signals and evaluated the measurement accuracy, providing a research foundation for passive radar target detection using 5G signals and detecting rotating targets such as drone rotors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23d5d07e91ed9052fc7ba3ba2027df7b05a4251ddbd11c8a745df38c5dfb166e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
