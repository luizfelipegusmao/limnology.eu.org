{"title":"Inclusive Information Design in Heritage Landscapes. \nExperimental proposals for the Archaeological Site of Tiermes, Spain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0345/v1","date":1720008089000,"content":"The social recognition of cultural landscapes has increased in recent years. Culture must be accessible to all citizens, helping them to interpret the cultural landscape in the most respectful and autonomous way possible. Nevertheless, the link between accessibility and heritage requires a sensitive perception of the environment and individuals in their different situations. Usually, however, only partial solutions are offered, whereas a global, truly sustainable and inclusive approach should be adopted. In this sense, information design can play an essential role in the enjoyment and knowledge of Heritage Landscapes. The aim of this article is to present some reflections on this topic, which have led a group of teachers and students from the Laboratory of Architectural, Cultural and Heritage Landscape of the University of Valladolid (LAB/PAP) to develop experimental design proposals for the archaeological site of Tiermes, in Soria, Spain. The method applied is based on field research, case studies, project proposals, workshops and user testing. The resulting proposals emerge from the previous research developed by the LAB/PAP. They will focus on information design to present this extraordinary site in an inclusive way. The final discussion will decide which of these proposals will be easier and more useful to implement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb2ffe999835eb7fad96642d8c7e31db9e444a31612a507b009353dae2e297ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
