Source data on the concentrations of artificial radionuclides in the plant cover were obtained. Quantitative values for <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>241</sup>Am, and <sup>239+240</sup>Pu activity concentrations were determined in plants across the perimeters of the facilities, indicating that these compounds may be present in the associated media from the perspective of accumulative bioindication. The values determined for artificial radionuclides in the ‘soil‒plant’ system around the researched NFC facilities were attributed to radioactive contamination of the STS territory.","author":"Natalya Larionova","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"58a5511171bbb2143c1b48934b968ff4518e2f040015dae549f2057174091c76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
