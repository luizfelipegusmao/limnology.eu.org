{"title":"High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): Principles, Applications, Versatality, Efficiency, Innovation and Comparative Analysis in Modern Analytical Chemistry and In Pharmaceutical Sciences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0057/v1","date":1725260054000,"content":"High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is an advanced analytical technique employed to separate, identify, and quantify components in complex mixtures. The method operates based on the differential affinities of sample molecules for the mobile and stationary phases within a chromatographic column. HPLC is recognized for its high resolution, accuracy, and efficiency, making it indispensable across various fields including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, environmental analysis, and forensic science. The technique's adaptability to different detectors such as UV-visible, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry enhances its versatility and precision in analyzing a wide array of substances. Despite its advantages, HPLC presents challenges such as high operational costs, the need for specialized expertise, and susceptibility to contamination.Nonetheless, its role in modern analytical chemistry is pivotal, providing crucial insights and supporting developments in diverse scientific and industrial domains. This abstract encapsulates the core aspects of the article, highlighting the significance and applications of HPLC while also acknowledging its limitations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95aabe10be10d0c1388690053532c4e4a4bc84b76e3f814037863abfac160be9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
