{"title":"Shewanella xiamenensis‐associated ulcerative dermatitis in koi carp (Cyprinus rubrofuscus)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13942?af=R","date":1710609833000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Ulcerative dermatitis (UD) is common in ornamental fish collections and is typically associated with a wide range of bacterial aetiologies. Clinical reports describing <i>Shewanella xiamenensis</i>-associated UD are limited, however, despite growing attention to pathogenic <i>Shewanella</i> species in fish. Two out of 95 koi carp with UD were presented for clinical assessment by a commercial collection (<i>n</i> = 3000 fish) and subsequently killed on welfare grounds for necropsy. Both specimens exhibited extensive cutaneous ulcers and coelomic fat necrosis with petechial haemorrhages on post-mortem examination. <i>Shewanella xiamenensis</i> was cultured from ulcerated skin tissues taken from both fish, with consistent intralesional gram-negative rod-like bacteria seen on skin scrape cytology. Histology also confirmed intralesional gram-negative rod-like bacteria within multiple ulcerative and erosive dermatitis lesions, plus myofibre necrosis and necrotising coelomic steatitis, in both specimens. Features associated with impaired generalised osmoregulation secondary to UD were detected within the striated muscle underlying the ulcers, the gills, and the caudal aspects of the kidneys. Additional histological features suggestive of sepsis were also seen in one of the fish. In the interim period, morbidity had increased from 3.2% to around 30% of the entire stock. Following culture results, increased pond water changes were implemented (q.2-3d) and the remaining stock was treated with florfenicol, resulting in complete resolution of UD in the collection (as per client). This article highlights the first description of <i>S. xiamenensis</i>-associated UD in koi carp/diseased ornamental fish in the United Kingdom.</p>","author":"Andrew F.
