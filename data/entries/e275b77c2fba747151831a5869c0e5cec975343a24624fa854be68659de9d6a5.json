{"title":"How Cartilage and Bone Talk to Each Other to Allow Bone Grow?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1150/v1","date":1728969532000,"content":"Most of our bone are formed thought a process called endochondral ossification, which is a tiny, regulated process leaded by the chondrocytes of the GP and which require continuous cross talk between these cells and chondrocytes and invading cell populations, including osteoblasts, chondroclasts and vascular cells. The better understanding of these signaling pathways is not only important in the normal growth and maturation of the skeleton but might be highly relevant to pathophysiological processes in bones and joints. Since there is poor information about communication between chondrocytes and other cell types in the developing bones, this review examines the current knowledge of how interactions between chondrocytes and bone forming cells modulate bone growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e275b77c2fba747151831a5869c0e5cec975343a24624fa854be68659de9d6a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
