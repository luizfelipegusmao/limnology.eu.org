Tubular forms offer the advantage of a regulated internal milieu, and Fibonacci forms may offer packing efficiencies. The underlying mechanisms behind the cellular genesis of Fibonacci and tubular forms remain unknown.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3410771f3a4bed3dd3da83651c20632f2ae5087a0eae4079ca06c9b2c2c207f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
