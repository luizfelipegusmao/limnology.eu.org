{"title":"Evaluation of ORC (Organic Rankine Cycles) for Geothermal Power in Kazakhstan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1510/v1","date":1713864364000,"content":"This article explores the geothermal resources of Kazakhstan's Zharkent Basin, with a specific focus on the high-temperature geothermal sources in the Almaty region of Southern Kazakhstan. The research aims to analyze the energy characteristics of the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for harnessing low-enthalpy geothermal energy for small-scale electricity generation. A detailed thermodynamic model was developed, employing R134a as the working fluid. An in-depth analysis of the Zharkunak field (Zharkent, Almaty region) revealed that well 5539, with its notably high temperatures, offers the highest potential for geothermal electricity production, achieving an annual output of approximately 10,371 MWh. The total electric power output from the studied wells in the region is estimated at 20,111 MWh annually, representing a significant contribution towards sustainable energy production and reducing reliance on traditional coal-fired power plants. The study concludes that the Organic Rankine Cycle is not only a viable and efficient technology for utilizing low-enthalpy geothermal resources to generate electricity on a small scale, but also a key player in enhancing energy independence. By leveraging local geothermal energy, the Almaty region can significantly reduce its reliance on external energy sources, thereby fostering sustainable development and reducing environmental impacts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f49653e59f0a4938767af9383e7a53166123a4174c7407680a0286e1b6a8208f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
