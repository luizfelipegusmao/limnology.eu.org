{"title":"Chiral non Aromatic Nitrogen-Heterocycles by Asymmetric Intramolecular Haloamination and Haloamidation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1718/v1","date":1716796687000,"content":"This review deals with the functionalization of double bonds carried out in the presence of a chiral catalyst exploiting the intramolecular attack to haliranium ions by nucleophilic nitrogen of amides or carbamates prepared from achiral aminoalkenes, and the C-N bonds formation leads to highly enantioenriched non-aromatic heterocycles. A range of protocols are reported, emphasizing the synthesis of many natural and biologically active products of pharmacological interest prepared according to this methodology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8721b712a42934dbc3b1046b03ede18df133b4e6580979a3a4784260641db482","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
