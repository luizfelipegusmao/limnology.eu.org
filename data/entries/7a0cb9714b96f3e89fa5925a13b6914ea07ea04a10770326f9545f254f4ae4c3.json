{"title":"Reproducing the Solvatochromism of Merocyanines by PCM Calculations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0514/v1","date":1723032182000,"content":"Polarizable continuum methods (PCM) have been widely employed for simulating solvent effects, in spite of the fact that they either ignore specific interactions in solution or only partially reproduce non-specific contributions. Examples of three solvatochromic dyes with a negative, a positive and a reverse behavior illustrate the achievements and shortcomings of PCM calculations, and the causes for their variable success. As shown with a theoretical model that rationalizes and predicts the solvatochromism of phenolate merocyanines based on structural parameters, PCM shortcomings are to be held responsible for their eventual failure in reproducing experimental data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a0cb9714b96f3e89fa5925a13b6914ea07ea04a10770326f9545f254f4ae4c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
