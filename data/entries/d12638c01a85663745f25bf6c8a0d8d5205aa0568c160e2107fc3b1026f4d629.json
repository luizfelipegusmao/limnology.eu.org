{"title":"Management of Peritoneal Dialysis-associated Emergencies During COVID Pandemic- The Experience of a Center of Excellence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0640/v1","date":1718087679000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemic struck unexpectedly, emergency services and chronic care institutions, including dialysis centers, were overloaded.\n An important problem was the care of positive COVID patients, but also the care of chronically dialyzed patients who  presented emergencies.\nIn our Hospital, which has become a COVID support for dialysis patients with severe forms of the disease, we had to care for PD patients with dialysis-related emergencies.\nWe presented 2 cases of patients managed on an outpatient basis or 1 day hospitalization, treated successfully and without compromising the quality of the care provided. We used remote monitoring, we worked in a multidiscipli-nary team, we shortened the hospitalization of patients (and implicitly the risk of contact).\nIn pandemic conditions, the advantage of PD was represented by the possibility of patient isolation, so that in the first 6 months of the pandemic, we recorded no deaths in this category of patients. In case of hemodialysis patients, in-fection and mortality rates were high.\n\nAlthough we expected an increase in the number of peritoneal dialysis patients in the post-pandemic period, this did not happen. We continue to plead for the popularization of the PD method among patients and doctors, which has proven its advantages under the conditions of the pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d12638c01a85663745f25bf6c8a0d8d5205aa0568c160e2107fc3b1026f4d629","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
