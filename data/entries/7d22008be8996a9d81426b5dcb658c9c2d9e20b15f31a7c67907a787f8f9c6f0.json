{"title":"Solutions of the Mathieu-Hill Equation for the Trapped Ion Harmonic Oscillator. Qualitative Discussion.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0604/v2","date":1724999835000,"content":"We investigate solutions of the classical Mathieu-Hill (MH) equation which characterizes the dynamics of trapped ions, based on the Floquet theory and starting from a well known analytical model. The analytical model we introduce demonstrates that the equations of motion are equivalent to those of the harmonic oscillator (HO). Two independent approaches are used, based on two classes of complex solutions of the MH equation.  The paper addresses both the damped HO and parametric oscillator (PO) for an ion confined in an electrodynamic (Paul) trap.  Stability and instability regions for the periodic orbits associated to the MH equation which describes a HO (PO) confined in an electrodynamic trap are also discussed, depending on the values of the Floquet exponent, for very small values of the $q$ parameter. The main objective of the paper is to identify stable and bounded solutions for the dynamics of a HO levitated in an electrodynamic trap. This paper represents a follow-up of a recently published article in Photonics, 11 (6) 551.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d22008be8996a9d81426b5dcb658c9c2d9e20b15f31a7c67907a787f8f9c6f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
