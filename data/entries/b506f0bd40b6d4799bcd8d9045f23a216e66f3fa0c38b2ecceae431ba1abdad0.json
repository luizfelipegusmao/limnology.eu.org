{"title":"64 Effect of feeding intact protein from soybean meal instead of crystalline amino acids on growth performance, protein synthesis, and immune response of growing pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/45/7664861?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to test the hypothesis that feeding intact protein from soybean meal (SBM) instead of crystalline amino acids (AA) does not affect growth performance, protein synthesis, intestinal morphology, or immune response of growing pigs. A control corn-SBM diet was used. Three additional diets were formulated by reducing the inclusion rate of SBM and adding 3, 4, or 5 crystalline AA (i.e., Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, Val) to the diets, which resulted in reducing the protein concentration from 20.0% to 13.4%. All diets were formulated to meet requirements for standardized ileal digestible indispensable AA. A total of 176 pigs [initial body weight (BW) = 32.2 kg; SD = 4.2] were used. On d 1, 16 randomly chosen pigs were euthanized and body nutrient composition was determined. The remaining 160 pigs were allotted to the 4 diets using a randomized complete block design with 4 pigs per pen and 10 replicate pens per diet. Starting BW was the blocking factor. Individual pig BW and feed consumption were recorded. On d 28, one pig per pen was slaughtered and blood, carcass, and viscera were collected and analyzed for N, fat, and energy to calculate deposition in the body. Ileal mucosa, ileum and colon tissue and digesta were analyzed for blood characteristics, cytokines, tissue morphology, ammonia, and gene expression. Contrasts coefficients were used to determine linear and quadratic effects of reducing dietary protein. Results indicated that average daily gain, average daily feed intake, gain to feed ratio, carcass characteristics, and protein, lipid, and energy depositions were not affected by reducing SBM and increasing crystalline AA in diets (Table 1). However, energy efficiency tended to decrease (quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.083) by reducing dietary protein. Blood urea N was reduced (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) as dietary protein was reduced, but blood total protein was not affected by dietary treatment. Cytokines, ileal and jejunal morphologies, and gene abundance of AA transporters in the ileal mucosa were not affected by dietary protein. Ammonia concentrations in ileal digesta increased and then decreased (quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.043) and colon digesta tended to increase and then decrease (quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.074) as dietary protein was reduced. Bacteria protein in colon digesta was reduced (linear, <span>P</span> = 0.030) by reducing dietary protein. In conclusion, providing AA from intact protein from SBM or from crystalline AA did not affect growth performance, intestinal morphology, and immune response of pigs. However, SBM in diets can provide energy that may be utilized more efficiently than energy from diets with less SBM and crystalline AA. Further research is suggested to elucidate if SBM improves utilization of other nutrients in diets for pigs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"b506f0bd40b6d4799bcd8d9045f23a216e66f3fa0c38b2ecceae431ba1abdad0","category":"Environment"}
