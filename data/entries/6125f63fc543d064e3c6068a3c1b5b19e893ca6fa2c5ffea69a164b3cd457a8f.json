However, at the macroscale (regional to global) it is still unresolved whether (i) specific environmental attributes (e.g., climate, geology, soil types) or (ii) microbial community composition drive key microbial traits and functions directly. To address this knowledge gap, we used 33 grassland topsoils (0–10 cm) from a geoclimatic gradient in Chile. First, we incubated the soils for 1 week in favorable standardized conditions and quantified a wide range of soil microbial traits and functions such as microbial biomass carbon (MBC), enzyme kinetics, microbial respiration, growth rates as well as carbon use efficiency (CUE). Second, we characterized climatic and physicochemical properties as well as bacterial and fungal community composition of the soils. We then applied regression analysis to investigate how strongly the measured microbial traits and functions were linked with the environmental setting versus microbial community composition. We show that environmental attributes (predominantly the amount of soil organic matter) determined patterns of MBC along the gradient, which in turn explained microbial respiration and growth rates. However, respiration and growth normalized for MBC (i.e., specific respiration and growth) were more linked to microbial community composition than environmental attributes. Notably, both specific respiration and growth followed distinct trends and were related to different parts of the microbial community, which in turn resulted in strong effects on microbial CUE. We conclude that even at the macroscale, CUE is the result of physiologically decoupled aspects of microbial metabolism, which in turn is partially determined by microbial community composition. The environmental setting and microbial community composition affect different microbial traits and functions, and therefore both factors need to be considered in the context of macroscale SOC dynamics.</p>","author":"Daniel Wasner, \nJoerg Schnecker, \nXingguo Han, \nYifei Sun, \nAline Frossard, \nErick Zagal Venegas, \nPascal Boeckx, \nSebastian Doetterl","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"6125f63fc543d064e3c6068a3c1b5b19e893ca6fa2c5ffea69a164b3cd457a8f","category":"Environment"}
