Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) is promising, as these memristive systems can not only be used for more efficient non-volatile memory applications, but are also found in logic circuits with integrated memory and neuromorphic architectures [<a href=\"#ozae044.781-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"da1b417649ff59f4ec25d03c30c646212506f420aa22d9c759bb39808e651019","category":"Environment"}
