{"title":"Prognostic value of stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with prediabetes and suspected coronary artery disease","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311875","date":1728568800000,"content":"<p>by Norapat Leungratanamart, Kasinee Wanitchung, Sumet Prechawuttidech, Khemajira Karaketklang, Yodying Kaolawanich</p>\r\nBackground <p>Stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an accurate and comprehensive modality for evaluating patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), but its prognostic value in prediabetic patients is uncertain.</p> Methods <p>This retrospective study included 452 consecutive prediabetic patients without prior diagnoses of CAD who underwent adenosine stress perfusion CMR. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for heart failure, ischemic stroke, and late coronary revascularization (&gt;90 days post-CMR). The secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and hospitalization for heart failure.</p> Results <p>The mean age was 68±11 years (49% male). Over a median follow-up time of 8.1 (IQR 5.7, 10.4) years, 55 patients experienced MACE, and 24 met the secondary endpoint. Patients with inducible ischemia had significantly greater annualized event rates for MACE (5.7% vs. 0.7%, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and for the secondary endpoint (2.0% vs. 0.3%, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) than those without ischemia. Multivariable analysis revealed inducible ischemia as a consistent predictor for MACE (HR 3.36, 95%CI 1.90–5.94, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and for the secondary endpoint (HR 2.89, 95%CI 1.22–6.80, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was an independent predictor of the secondary endpoint (HR 3.56, 95%CI 1.25–10.13; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Incorporating inducible ischemia and LGE data significantly improved the model’s ability to discriminate MACE risk (C-statistic increase from 0.77 to 0.83; net reclassification improvement 0.42; integrated discrimination improvement 0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>Stress perfusion CMR offers substantial independent prognostic value and effectively aids in reclassifying cardiovascular risk among prediabetic patients with suspected CAD.</p>","author":"Norapat Leungratanamart","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"941a0d123c1739d7928eaef6c5f59a1b0e4e31164f98a593aef5377b42d54076","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
