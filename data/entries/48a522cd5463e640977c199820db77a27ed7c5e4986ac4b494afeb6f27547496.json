{"title":"An Eï¬€ect of Boric Acid on the Structure and Luminescence of Yttrium Orthoborates Doped with Europium Synthesized by Two Different Routines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0068/v1","date":1717636440000,"content":"In this paper, we present the characteristics of photoluminescent YBO3 successfully synthesized through a solid-state reaction and microwave-assisted method. We used yttrium oxide and boric acid in excess as starting reagents. The synthesis conditions are reflected in fluorescent characteristics and the structure. Excess boric acid causes structural changes, as observed by the FTIR spectroscopy analysis. The FTIR spectra analysis of the structure provided valuable insights into the phase composition and modifications induced by varying amounts of boric acid and synthesis methods. The identified structural features contribute to the understanding of the synthesized samples' characteristics and their potential applications in various fields such as illumination and displays and narrow-band fluorescent smartphone readable markers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48a522cd5463e640977c199820db77a27ed7c5e4986ac4b494afeb6f27547496","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
