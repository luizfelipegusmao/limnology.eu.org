{"title":"Physiological function and regulation of ascorbate peroxidase isoforms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/9/2700/7609918?rss=1","date":1708128000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O by utilizing ascorbate as a specific electron donor and constitutes the ascorbateâ€“glutathione cycle in organelles of plants including chloroplasts, cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. It has been almost 40 years since APX was discovered as an important plant-specific H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging enzyme, during which time many research groups have conducted molecular physiological analyses. It is now clear that APX isoforms function not only just as antioxidant enzymes but also as important factors in intracellular redox regulation through the metabolism of reactive oxygen species. The function of APX isoforms is regulated at multiple steps, from the transcriptional level to post-translational modifications of enzymes, thereby allowing them to respond flexibly to ever-changing environmental factors and physiological phenomena such as cell growth and signal transduction. In this review, we summarize the physiological functions and regulation mechanisms of expression of each APX isoform.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"614c45803354ebc340e199289769ecb99d568c7699ab9b148818e23bf5860920","category":"Environment"}
