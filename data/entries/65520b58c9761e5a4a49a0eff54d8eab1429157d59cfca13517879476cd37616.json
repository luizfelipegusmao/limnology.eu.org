{"title":"Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP): A Case Study of Al Figrah Road, Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1125/v1","date":1728961372000,"content":"Landslides in the hilly regions of Al‐Madinah Al‐Munawarah are a natural hazard that endangers both infrastructure and human lives. The objective of this work is to create maps that show the likelihood of landslides occurring on the Al Figrah Road, which is a vital road connects the cities of Al‐Madinah and Yanbu. This will be done using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach. The landslide susceptibility maps have been created by taking into account various parameters such as elevation, slope, aspect, drainage density, lithology, soil, and precipitation. Assess the significance of these thematic layers in relation to the frequency of landslides in the research area based on historical landslide data and field verification, in order to allocate suitable weights. The sensitivity maps of the study region delineated areas with low risk (93,552,333 m2), moderate risk (271,180,722 m2), and high risk (33,053,839 m2). 28.63% of the Al Figrah total Road is classified as low risk, 48.09% as moderate risk, and 23.28% as high risk. A total of 10 landslides were identified in areas with steep slopes and denudational hills, confirming the findings of the AHP analysis conducted in high‐risk zones. The integrity of these slide zones was greatly impacted by the presence of joints, faults, foliation, and shear zones within igneous and metamorphic rocks. Examining the susceptibility of landslides in this region enhances our understanding of landslides on other steep routes in Saudi Arabia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65520b58c9761e5a4a49a0eff54d8eab1429157d59cfca13517879476cd37616","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
