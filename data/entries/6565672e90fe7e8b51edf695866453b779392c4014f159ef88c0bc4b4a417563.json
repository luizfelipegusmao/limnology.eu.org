{"title":"Spatio – Temporal Dynamics of Soil Organic Carbon Stock in Greek Croplands: A Long-Term Assessment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2517/v1","date":1722412056000,"content":"This study examines the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) within Greek croplands, offering a comprehensive understanding of its dynamics. SOC, a cornerstone in soil health, nutrient cycling, and global carbon dynamics, assumes critical significance in sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation. Drawing on diverse soil properties, including pH, soil texture as well as different drainage and slope categories, the research explores the nuanced relationships shaping SOC dynamics in the diverse agroecological landscape of Greece. The investigation transcends local boundaries, emphasizing SOC's global role in climate change mitigation by sequestering carbon dioxide. Two maps were used as data sources: 1) SOC stock baseline map (2010) by JRC, 2) SOC stock map (2021) by the Institute of Soil and Water Resources, Hellenic Agricultural Organization – DIMITRA in collaboration with FAO. Greek croplands emerge as a mosaic of agroecological diversity, where anthropogenic activities wield transformative influences on SOC stock, demanding a delicate balance between agricultural productivity and soil health. The study unveils the influence of Soil Order, weaving a tapestry of SOC variability. Microscopic factors, from soil texture to cation exchange capacity, further shape SOC dynamics, emphasizing the role of clayey soils and coarse materials in carbon retention. Although soil organic carbon decreased from 2010 to 2021 the degree of carbon loss varied. This scientific endeavor synthesizes existing knowledge and unveils novel insights, offering a narrative woven from diverse soil properties. The findings contribute valuable insights for sustainable land management practices and climate change mitigation strategies, underscoring the importance of region-specific approaches in addressing global challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6565672e90fe7e8b51edf695866453b779392c4014f159ef88c0bc4b4a417563","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
