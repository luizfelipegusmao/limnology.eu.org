{"title":"Early Fever in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation: Are Presepsin and YKL-40 Valuable Diagnostic Tools?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0518/v1","date":1725620090000,"content":"(1) Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a lifesaving treatment but carries a high infection risk. Diagnosing infections remains challenging due to the limited accuracy of standard biomarkers. (2) Methods: This single-center study aimed to evaluate presepsin (PSP) and YKL-40 as infection biomarkers in febrile patients during the allo-HSCT pre-engraftment phase. Biomarker levels were prospectively measured in 61 febrile episodes from 54 allo-HSCT patients at admission, representing baseline levels and then at Day 1, 3, 5, and 7 following fever onset. The diagnostic value was compared to that of procalcitonin (PCT). (3) Results: PSP showed fair diagnostic value on Day 1 (AUC 0.656; 95% CI: 0.510 – 0.802) and Day 3 (AUC 0.698; 95% CI: 0.559 – 0.837). YKL-40 did not provide any significant diagnostic value across measured time points. PCT outperformed PSP and YKL-40, particularly on Day 3 (AUC 0.712; 95% CI: 0.572 – 0.852). When combining biomarkers, the best model for predicting infection used PSP &gt; 3.144 ng/mL and PCT &gt; 0.28 g/L on Day 3, resulting in R2 of about 31% (p &lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusion: Neither test showed sufficient discriminative power for early infection to recommend their use as individual diagnostic tools in clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c09256607129feac6918a11b037865df3947f01800d76e0f746241753961e16c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
