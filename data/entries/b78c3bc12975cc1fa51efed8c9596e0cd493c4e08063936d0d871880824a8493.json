{"title":"Coccolithophore Assemblage Response to Indian Monsoon–ENSO Teleconnections During the Last Century","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024PA004911?af=R","date":1723009456000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We present a new, annually resolved coccolithophore relative abundance record (1889–1993 CE) from a laminated marine sediment core obtained from the northeastern Arabian Sea to document assemblage variations during the last century. Our analysis revealed that ∼80% of the assemblage is composed of the coccolithophore species <i>Gephyrocapsa oceanica</i>, <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i>, and <i>Florisphaera profunda</i>. Hierarchical clustering of the coccolithophore data delineates time intervals (1889–1909 CE, 1910–1959 CE, 1960–1993 CE) comparable to previously reported interdecadal changes of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)–Indian monsoon variance. We find that <i>F</i>. <i>profunda</i> (Fp%) is positively correlated with central Pacific ENSO (Niño 4 and Niño 3.4). Frequency analyses of Fp% match ENSO quasiperiodicity reported from instrumental data and proxy records and support the existence of previously described ENSO–Indian monsoon teleconnections. Furthermore, the increased variance of Fp% and associated decrease in marine primary productivity starting ∼1960 CE appears to be driven by decreased upward nutrient transport linked to increased surface water stratification due to surface ocean warming. With the predicted increases in frequency and strength of central Pacific El Niño as well as surface ocean warming and upper ocean stratification in the Indian Ocean over the coming century, our results imply further impacts on coccolithophores in the northeastern Arabian Sea that may have cascading effects on the marine food web and global biogeochemical cycles.</p>","author":"Jose Dominick Guballa, \nJörg Bollmann, \nMaryam Akrami, \nAndreas Lückge","siteTitle":"Wiley: Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"69a881e15689378344e2f544f17d899603864e0695b4208841b63784555058e2","entryHash":"b78c3bc12975cc1fa51efed8c9596e0cd493c4e08063936d0d871880824a8493","category":"Environment"}
