{"title":"Taxonomic inflation as a conservation trap for inbred populations","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13677?af=R","date":1715151600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Conservation is prioritized based on accepted taxa. As a consequence, a conservation incentive exists to emphasize inter-population differences to define taxa, potentially leading to taxonomic inflation. But stressing the uniqueness of threatened populations has the side effect of hindering conservation actions that promote inter-population gene flow, such as genetic rescue. These actions may be of critical importance for severely inbred populations involved in extinction vortices, for which an inflated taxonomy can become a conservation trap. Here, we exemplify this scenario with the western capercaillie (<i>Tetrao urogallus</i>, Phasianidae) population in the Cantabrian Mountains, described and legally listed as a subspecies not supported by recent molecular data. The Cantabrian capercaillie population is Critically Endangered after a long-lasting decline and a recent demographic collapse. It shows clear signs of inbreeding depression, including striking clutch size decreases as well as reduced hatchability and chick survival. This critical situation could be alleviated through a genetic rescue, but this possibility is hindered by inertias rooted in the putative uniqueness of the Cantabrian capercaillie. It had been previously argued that poor taxonomy could hamper conservation, through the oblivion of populations deserving, but not having, a taxonomic status. We show that taxonomic inflation can also become an obstacle for effective conservation.</p>","author":"Miguel Clavero, \nJavier Naves, \nMaría Lucena‐Perez, \nEloy Revilla","siteTitle":"Wiley: Evolutionary Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"df2df3df25f90ba55fdf535f13dd2e89e7355c6f34118f20800f9e7201897f76","entryHash":"614063816d2182d685688e73e53ec3010e3d781c1339d2a3f874ebdac5672ea0","category":"Environment"}
