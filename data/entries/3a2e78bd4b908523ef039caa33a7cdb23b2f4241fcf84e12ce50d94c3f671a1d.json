{"title":"INterpolated FLOod Surface (INFLOS), a Rapid and Operational Tool to Estimate Flood Depths from Earth Observation Data for Emergency Management","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0739/v1","date":1723464488000,"content":"The Rapid Mapping (RM) component of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) delivers crisis information within hours or days, during and in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Users of the service have requested the incorporation of flood depth estimates for inundations and related disasters, such as storms and tsunamis. This demand required the development of a quick and operational approach for estimating floodwater depth distribution, which can effectively adapt to a wide range of flood scenarios, remotely sensed data and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs). INFLOS is a tool developed to answer these requirements, within an expedient 30-minute timeframe at most. It uses sample points collected along the edges of flooded areas derived from remotely sensed imagery, and integrates high resolution DTMs and hydrography data to enhance accuracy. Flood depth is then estimated through a multi-step interpolation and filtering process. INFLOS underwent thorough testing across fourteen regions. As it transitioned into production, INFLOS successfully generated a wealth of flood depth products accessible through the CEMS RM portal: https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/list-of-activations-rapid. Currently, INFLOS is operational and its computation time remains consistently within the order of minutes, making it a staple of the RM tooling and portfolio.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a2e78bd4b908523ef039caa33a7cdb23b2f4241fcf84e12ce50d94c3f671a1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
