{"title":"Localization and Quantification of UV-Absorbing Compounds in an Invasive Deciduous Tree Species, Chinese Tallow (Triadica sebifera)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.427/7719949?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Chinese tallow (<span>Triadica sebifera</span>) is a woody, subtropical, broadleaf, deciduous tree native to China, Japan [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B2\">2</a>], Taiwan and northern Vietnam with naturalized populations in Japan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, Europe, Australia, Panama, and Peru [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B4\">4</a>]. In its native range, tallow is cultivated for a variety of uses including oil, food, medicine, and industrial applications [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B5\">5</a>]. Chinese tallow, an invasive species to the United States, has been known to replace all natural habitats, from wet to dry and from sun to shade. It often grows along roadsides, coastal areas, streams, on landownersâ€™ properties and forestry areas in the southeastern coastal states from Texas to South Carolina since the early 1900s [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B7\">7</a>]. The trees out compete the native species by utilizing all the resources, sunlight, and nutrients in the soil, as it alters species composition, community structure, and ecosystem processes in different distribution ranges [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B3\">3</a>]. It has an affinity for growing in crowed places and it eradicates the native or natural grown species and produces monocultures particularly in wetland habitats [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B8\">8</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B10\">10</a>]. The invasion of nonnative plants has become a serious problem and threatened the sustainable development of native forest ecosystems, urban forests, and urban agricultural areas [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B11\">11</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B12\">12</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B13\">13</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B14\">14</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B15\">15</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B16\">16</a>]. Chinese tallow tree species was introduced in the 1900s in the southeast states in the USA by the government (the Foreign Plant Introduction Division) which promoted it as a plantation tree for its waxy oil seeds that were of use in the soap industries [<a href=\"#ozae044.427-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B11\">11</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.427-B12\">12</a>] and is currently favored by beekeepers as forage for honey production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c3d4b61b3b5858d20f596ab1a83a3faf0cbffbe5999b92135fd8a73163601c71","category":"Environment"}
