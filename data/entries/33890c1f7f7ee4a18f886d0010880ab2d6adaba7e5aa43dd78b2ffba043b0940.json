{"title":"Multiplicity of Human Scent Signature in Identification of Persons by Computer-Based Olfactronics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0979/v1","date":1715761118000,"content":"This short report extends our previous paper “Multiplicity of human scent signature” and transfers canine identification to digital processing of data. The question is whether current GCxGC-MS technology and computer-based identification can perform identification as well as canines. This would objectify the identification of persons. Working with digital scent samples enables the use of multiple scent signatures for more exact identification. More differently constructed signatures during the identification process may represent the key point in identification of persons in olfactronics. Several types of scent signatures were considered in this article. The digital scent signatures were constructed based on the relative contents of the chemical compounds in the samples and relative ratios of compounds in the samples. Further on the signatures were made from the parts of the original samples fractioned by the volatility of compounds and by the relative abundance of the compounds in the samples. These results confirm the scent multiplicity phenomenon in digital scent samples. Using differently constructed signatures may be the key point in identification of persons using digital scent samples. This approach enables a transition from subjectivity to objectivity and a change from physical olfactory to olfactronic processing of digital scent samples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33890c1f7f7ee4a18f886d0010880ab2d6adaba7e5aa43dd78b2ffba043b0940","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
