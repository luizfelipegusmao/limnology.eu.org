{"title":"The Plant PTM Viewer 2.0: in-depth exploration of plant protein modification landscapes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/15/4611/7693187?rss=1","date":1718323200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) greatly increase protein diversity and functionality. To help the plant research community interpret the ever-increasing number of reported PTMs, the Plant PTM Viewer (<a href=\"https://www.psb.ugent.be/PlantPTMViewer\">https://www.psb.ugent.be/PlantPTMViewer</a>) provides an intuitive overview of plant protein PTMs and the tools to assess it. This update includes 62 novel PTM profiling studies, adding a total of 112 000 modified peptides reporting plant PTMs, including 14 additional PTM types and three species (moss, tomato, and soybean). Furthermore, an open modification re-analysis of a large-scale <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> mass spectrometry tissue atlas identified previously uncharted landscapes of lysine acylations predominant in seed and flower tissues and 3-phosphoglycerylation on glycolytic enzymes in plants. An extra ‘Protein list analysis’ tool was developed for retrieval and assessing the enrichment of PTMs in a protein list of interest. We conducted a protein list analysis on nuclear proteins, revealing a substantial number of redox modifications in the nucleus, confirming previous assumptions regarding the redox regulation of transcription. We encourage the plant research community to use PTM Viewer 2.0 for hypothesis testing and new target discovery, and also to submit new data to expand the coverage of conditions, plant species, and PTM types, thereby enriching our understanding of plant biology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"bc9f0ad3dc52e1d4401a7c5515141750b91221845160815cbc9d744cbb926ad5","category":"Environment"}
