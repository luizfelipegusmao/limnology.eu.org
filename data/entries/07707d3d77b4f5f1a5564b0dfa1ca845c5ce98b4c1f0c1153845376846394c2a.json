{"title":"Association between Short-Term Air Pollution Exposure and the Risk of Dyslipidemia among Community-Dwelling Adults: Effect Modification by Consumption of Fruits and Vegetables","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2065/v1","date":1721961196000,"content":"Background: Recent studies suggest an association between long-term air pollution, diet, and health outcomes, but there are limited studies on how short-term air pollution affects dyslipidemia in particular. We aimed to investigate this association with modified fruit and vegetable consumption.\nMethods: The Cardiovascular Disease Association Study (CAVAS) included 8,779 participants between 2007 and 2016. Particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were estimated using community multiscale air quality models. Short-term air pollution exposure was defined as a moving average over a lag time from “lag 1 days” to “lag 14 days.” Fruit and vegetable intake was categorized into 'total vegetables (TV),’ 'non-salted vegetables (NSV),' 'salted vegetables (SV),' 'fruits (F),' 'non-salted vegetables + fruits (NSVF),' and 'total vegetables + fruits (TVF).' Dyslipidemia was defined by total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol ≥160 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07707d3d77b4f5f1a5564b0dfa1ca845c5ce98b4c1f0c1153845376846394c2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
