{"title":"In Vitro Screening of Endophytic Micromonospora Strains Associated with White Clover for Biological Control of Phytopathogenic Fungi and Promotion of Plant Growth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1617/v1","date":1711552642000,"content":"Bacteria belonging to the genus Micromonospora are recognized as microorganisms with potential to be used in biotechnology processes, including their beneficial influence on plant growth and biocontrol of phytopathogens. In this study, nineteen Micromonospora isolates originating from root nodules of white clover plants were taxonomically assigned based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and four housekeeping genes. The antifungal properties of the bacteria against phytopathogenic Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium equiseti, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Verticillium albo-atrum were tested with the agar plug test and the dual culture test. The ability to produce various metallophores was determined with the agar plug diffusion test on modified CAS agar medium. ISP2 broth amended with 0.2% L-tryptophan was used to indicate the bacterial ability to produce auxins. Strains belonging to M. tulbaghiae, M. inaquosa, and M. violae showed in vitro potential as antimicrobial agents against the tested fungi. M. inaquosa strain 152, M. violae strain 126, M. violae strain 66 and M. violae strain 45 were recognized as the most efficiency metallophores producers. M. alfalfae strain 55 and M. lupini strain 5052 were identified as the most promising auxin compound producers and, therefore, as potential plant growth promoting bacteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8839ea36d6311516586b58ba545bc5e0d53f294135ab6374589762885b4eef9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
