However, recent developments have shown that wurtzite-type materials, particularly in the form of thin films, do indeed exhibit ferroelectricity. This quality is particularly pronounced in solid solution compositions such as AlScN [<a href=\"#ozae044.626-B1\">1</a>], AlBN [<a href=\"#ozae044.626-B2\">2</a>], ZnMgO [<a href=\"#ozae044.626-B3\">3</a>], and GaScN [<a href=\"#ozae044.626-B4\">4</a>]. These findings have created exciting opportunities for the construction of microelectronic devices that capitalize on the compatibility of wurtzite-based thin films with CMOS-production processes. The ferroelectric properties of these materials, including high spontaneous polarization, exceptional retention, and notable scalability, make them well-suited for low power consumption memory devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"886a0f62a3e1d46eb3ce3c5d68000de7dc2e11a5931b3bdd862a44eb5a8e8023","category":"Environment"}
