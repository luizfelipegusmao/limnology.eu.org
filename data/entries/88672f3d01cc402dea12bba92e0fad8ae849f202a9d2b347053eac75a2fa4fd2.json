{"title":"Effectiveness of Options for the Adaptation of Crop Farming to Climate Change in a Country of the European South","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0835/v1","date":1726015821000,"content":"This study quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of three main options for the adaptation of crop farming to climate change (i.e., shift of planting dates, increase/addition of irrigation, and resilient hybrids/cultivars) in a southern European country (Greece). The potential effect of each option on the yields of several crops in all Greek regions is estimated for 2021-2040 and 2041-2060 and compared with those under the historical local climate of 1986-2005, by using agronomic and statistical regression models, and data from different climatic simulations and climate change scenarios. Our results reveal that all the adaptation options examined have the potential to significantly reduce crop yield losses occurring under no adaptation, particularly during 2021-2040 when for many regions and crops more than half of the losses can be compensated for. Notably, in some cases during this period, the measures examined can lead to crop yields that are higher than those under the historic climate. However, the effectiveness of the measures was found to greatly diminish in 2041-2060 under very adverse climate change conditions, highlighting the dynamic nature of adaptation. The assessment of the effectiveness of combined adaptation options, and the evaluation of additional criteria (e.g., feasibility) represent main areas for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88672f3d01cc402dea12bba92e0fad8ae849f202a9d2b347053eac75a2fa4fd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
