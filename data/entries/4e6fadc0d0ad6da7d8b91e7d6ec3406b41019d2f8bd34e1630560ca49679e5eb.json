{"title":"A single base pair substitution in zebrafish distinguishes between innate and acute startle behavior regulation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300529","date":1710770400000,"content":"<p>by Elelbin A.

Establishment of baseline behavioral thresholds during development is critical for proper responses throughout the animalâ€™s life. Despite the relevance of such innate thresholds, the molecular mechanisms critical to establishing behavioral thresholds during development are not well understood. The acoustic startle response is a conserved behavior whose threshold is established during development yet is subsequently acutely regulated. We have previously identified a zebrafish mutant line (<i>escapist</i>) that displays a decreased baseline or innate acoustic startle threshold. Here, we identify a single base pair substitution on Chromosome 25 located within the coding sequence of the <i>synaptotagmin 7a</i> (<i>syt7a</i>) gene that is tightly linked to the <i>escapist</i> acoustic hypersensitivity phenotype. By generating animals in which we deleted the <i>syt7a</i> open reading frame, and subsequent complementation testing with the <i>escapist</i> line, we demonstrate that loss of <i>syt7a</i> function is not the cause of the <i>escapist</i> behavioral phenotype. Nonetheless, <i>escapist</i> mutants provide a powerful tool to decipher the overlap between acute and developmental regulation of behavioral thresholds. Extensive behavioral analyses reveal that in <i>escapist</i> mutants the establishment of the innate acoustic startle threshold is impaired, while regulation of its acute threshold remains intact. Moreover, our behavioral analyses reveal a deficit in baseline responses to visual stimuli, but not in the acute regulation of responses to visual stimuli. Together, this work eliminates loss of <i>syt7a</i> as causative for the <i>escapist</i> phenotype and suggests that mechanisms that regulate the establishment of behavioral thresholds in <i>escapist</i> larvae can operate independently from those regulating acute threshold regulation.","author":"Elelbin A.
