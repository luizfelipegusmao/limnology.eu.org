{"title":"Joule Heating Effect of Buongiorno Model of Hybrid Nanofluid Flow With Homogeneous-Heterogeneous Reaction and Heat Generation/Absorption","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1553/v1","date":1716459086000,"content":"In this research work the study of Buongiorno Model Darcy Forchheimer flow of Hybrid nanofluid flow on isothermal permeable stretch/shrink sheet with homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction is investigated. The effects of MHD, thermal radiation, viscous dissipation, Joule heating, and heat generation/absorption are taken into account. Hybrid nanofluids can act as a medium for heterogeneous-homogeneous reactions. The nanoparticles dispersed in the fluid can influence reaction kinetics and species transport, potentially, altering reaction rates and pathways. The applications of HNF in reactions, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, lie in leveraging their enhanced thermal properties, catalytic potential, and improved mixing capabilities to optimize reaction efficiency and control reaction conditions. Similarity transformation is used to convert a set of PDEs into a set of ODEs. HAM is used for the solution of the obtained ODEs system.  In a heterogeneous reaction, the concentration gradient is amplified; in a homogeneous reaction, the impact is opposite. Moreover, at higher compositions of HNPs, the concentration and velocity rise while the temperature falls. Furthermore, as the values of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions increase, the concentration falls. It is reliable with the idea that a greater reaction rate lowers the diffusion rate. Nevertheless, these parameters do not affect temperature or velocity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02896fcdc77c8f6f0dfb20f4b2108d19d88f665466886d1452561ce2415b7f55","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
