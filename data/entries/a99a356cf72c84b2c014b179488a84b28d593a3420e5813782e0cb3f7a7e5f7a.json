{"title":"Enhanced Thermal Stability of Conductive Mercury Telluride Colloidal Quantum Dot Thin Films using Atomic Layer Deposition","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1429/v1","date":1721212921000,"content":"Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are valuable for their potential applications in optoelectronic devices. However, they are susceptible to thermal degradation during processing and while in use. Mitigating thermally induced sintering, which leads to absorption spectrum broadening and undesirable changes to thin film electrical properties, is necessary for the reliable design and manufacture of CQD-based optoelectronics. Here, low temperature metal-oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD) was investigated as a method for mitigating sintering while preserving the optoelectronic properties of mercury telluride (HgTe) CQD films. ALD-coated films are subjected to temperatures up to 160oC for up to 5 hours and alumina (Al2O3) is found to be most effective at preserving the optical properties, demonstrating the feasibility of metal-oxide infilling to protect against sintering. HgTe CQD film electrical properties were investigated before and after alumina ALD in-filling, which was found to increase the p-type doping and hole mobility of the films. The magnitude of these effects depended on the conditions used to prepare the HgTe CQDs. With further investigation into the interaction effects of CQD and ALD process factors, these results may be used to guide the design of CQD-ALD materials for their practical integration into useful optoelectronic devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a99a356cf72c84b2c014b179488a84b28d593a3420e5813782e0cb3f7a7e5f7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
