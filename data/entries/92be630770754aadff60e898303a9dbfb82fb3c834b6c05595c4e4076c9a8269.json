{"title":"Outcome-Based Framework for Gig Work: Enhancing Efficiency in a VUCA World","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1938/v1","date":1729777102000,"content":"The Gig Economy (GE) has revolutionized traditional employment structures, emphasizing flexibility and autonomy for workers. However, the absence of a standardized framework often leads to uncertainties regarding work arrangements (WA) and outcomes. In response, we pro-pose an Outcome-Based (O-B) approach tailored to the unique dynamics of the GE in an era marked by high volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA). Drawing from an extensive literature review and industry insights, a comprehensive framework is developed, highlighting the integration of key elements such as task clarity, performance evaluation, and incentive mechanisms. Moreover, this framework considers the implications for various stake-holders, including gig workers, platform operators, and regulatory bodies. By aligning work ex-pectations with measurable outcomes, this approach seeks to enhance efficiency, accountability, and satisfaction within the GE ecosystem. The implications of adopting such a framework are discussed in terms of its potential to foster mutual trust, mitigate conflicts, and promote sus-tainable growth in the evolving landscape of flexible WA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"92be630770754aadff60e898303a9dbfb82fb3c834b6c05595c4e4076c9a8269","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
