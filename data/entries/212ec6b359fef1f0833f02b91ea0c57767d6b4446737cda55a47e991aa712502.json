With their unique chemical properties, such as light absorption at specific wavelengths, these plant pigments play critical roles in various energy homeostasis and adaptive processes in plants (<a href=\"#kiad653-B3\">Delgado-Vargas et al. 2000</a>; <a href=\"#kiad653-B1\">Bryant et al. 2020</a>). To enable strict but flexible pigment production in a tissue-dependent manner and in response to environmental signals, genes governing plant pigmentation are generally subjected to highly complex transcriptional networks to synthesize proper quantities and qualities of pigments at designated sites and times. For example, the biosynthesis of chlorophylls, green pigments that harvest light energy for photosynthetic electron transport, must be coordinated with chloroplast development because of the phototoxicity of protochlorophyllide, an intermediate in chlorophyll <span>a</span> biosynthesis. If protochlorophyllide is mis-accumulated in still-developing tissues where photosynthetic protein complexes are not ready to start photosynthesis, light energy that is absorbed by protochlorophyllide but cannot be utilized for photosynthesis would cause dangerous reactive oxygen species production (<a href=\"#kiad653-B10\">Reinbothe et al. 2010</a>; <a href=\"#kiad653-B1\">Bryant et al. 2020</a>). Therefore, strictly programmed pigmentation is key to successful plant development and fitness.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"212ec6b359fef1f0833f02b91ea0c57767d6b4446737cda55a47e991aa712502","category":"Environment"}
