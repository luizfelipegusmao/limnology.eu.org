Therefore, 1012 specimens were measured by scientific observers on board the commercial trawl fleet operating south of 50° S. The size range of the specimens was from 77 to 292 cm fork length (<i>L</i>\n<sub>F</sub>). The mean size at maturity was estimated to be 153 cm <i>L</i>\n<sub>F</sub> for males and 172 cm <i>L</i>\n<sub>F</sub> for females. Porbeagle shark catches were recorded throughout the year, with the highest frequency occurring between November and June. The presence of pregnant females was observed from December to July, along with an increase in the average size of embryos in each litter. The information presented in this study improves the knowledge of the reproductive biology and allows to propose a migratory pattern of adult porbeagle females in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. The likely seasonal increase in vulnerability of this shark to austral trawl fishery, despite all conservation management measures established in Argentina, underscores the importance of promoting its proper management and conservation given the need to improve understanding of porbeagle population dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>","author":"Jorge H.
