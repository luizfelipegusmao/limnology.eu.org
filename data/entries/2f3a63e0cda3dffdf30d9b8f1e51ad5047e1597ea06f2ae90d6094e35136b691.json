{"title":"Exploring the Relationship Between Inhaled Corticosteroid Usage, Asthma Severity, and Sleep-Disordered Breathing: A Systematic Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0873/v1","date":1718272290000,"content":"Additionally, the characteristics of inhaled corticosteroids (inhaled particle sizes) may influence the risk of sleep apnea. In children, the severity of asthma plays a crucial role in influencing the prevalence of sleep apnea, while using inhaled corticosteroids seems to be a less relevant risk factor compared to adults. The overall risk of bias was categorized as high or with some concerns in 100% of the studies analyzed. Each study identified at least one form of bias that raised significant concerns. Studies showed a complex relationship between inhaled corticosteroids use, asthma severity, and the onset of sleep apnea. Further studies are needed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f3a63e0cda3dffdf30d9b8f1e51ad5047e1597ea06f2ae90d6094e35136b691","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
