{"title":"Assisted cloning of an unknown shared quantum state","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305718","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Dengxin Zhai, Jiayin Peng, Nueraminaimu Maihemuti, Jiangang Tang</p>\r\n\r\nWe first propose a novel protocol to realize quantum cloning of an arbitrary unknown shared state with assistance offered by a state preparer. The initial phase of this protocol involves the utilization of quantum teleportation (QT), enabling the transfer of quantum information from an arbitrary number of senders to another arbitrary number of receivers through a maximally entangled GHZ-type state serving as a network channel, without centralizing the information at any specific location. In the second stage of this protocol, the state preparer performs a special single-qubit projective measurement and multiple <i>Z</i>-basis measurements and then communicates a number of classical bits corresponding to measurement results, the perfect copy or orthogonal-complementing copy of an unknown shared state can be produced at senders hands. Then, using a non-maximally entangled GHZ-type state instead of the aforementioned quantum channel, we extend the proposed protocol from three perspectives: projective measurement, positive operator-value measurement (POVM), and a single generalized Bell-state measurement. Our schemes can relay quantum information over a network without requiring fully trusted central or intermediate nodes, and none of participants can fully access the information.","author":"Dengxin Zhai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7766bcaf7df11e20db7b13f5c735320cd3d0bf42fa8cb1886fbbfb1cc2815a1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
