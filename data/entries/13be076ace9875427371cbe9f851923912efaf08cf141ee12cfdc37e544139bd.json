{"title":"The Biological Characteristics of Mycobacterium Phage Henu3 and the Fitness Cost Associated with Its Resistant Strains","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2581/v1","date":1722427182000,"content":"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an infectious disease that seriously affects human life and health. Despite centuries of efforts to control it, in recent years the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens of M. tuberculosis due to various factors has exacerbated the disease, posing a serious threat to global health. Therefore, a new method to control M. tuberculosis is urgently needed. Phages, viruses that specifically infect bacteria, have emerged as potential biocontrol agents for bacterial pathogens due to their host specificity. In this study, a Mycobacterium phage, Henu3, was isolated from soil around a hospital. The particle morphology, biological characteristics, genomics and phylogeny of Henu3 were characterized. Additionally, to explore the balance between phage resistance and stress response, phage Henu3-resistant strains 0G10 and 2E1 were screened by sequence passage and bidirectional validation methods, which significantly improved the sensitivity of phage to antibiotics (cefotaxime and kanamycin). By whole genome resequencing of strains 0G10 and 2E1, 12 genes involved in cell wall synthesis, transporter-encoded genes, two-component regulatory proteins and transcriptional regulatory factor-encoded genes were found to have mutations. These results suggest that phage Henu3 has the potential to control M. tuberculosis pathogens, and phage Henu3 has the potential to be a new potential solution for the treatment of M. tuberculosis infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13be076ace9875427371cbe9f851923912efaf08cf141ee12cfdc37e544139bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
