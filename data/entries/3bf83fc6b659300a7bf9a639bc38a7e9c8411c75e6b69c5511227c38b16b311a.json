{"title":"Biomechanical testing of ex vivo porcine tendons following high intensity focused ultrasound thermal ablation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302778","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by William Chu Kwan, Ari Partanen, Unni Narayanan, Adam C. Waspe, James M. Drake</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been demonstrated to be able to thermally ablate tendons with the aim to non-invasively disrupt tendon contractures in the clinical setting. However, the biomechanical changes of tendons permitting this disrupting is poorly understood. We aim to obtain a dose-dependent biomechanical response of tendons following magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thermal ablation.</p> Methods <p>Ex vivo porcine tendons (n = 72) were embedded in an agar phantom and randomly assigned to 12 groups based on MRgFUS treatment. The treatment time was 10, 20, or 30s, and the applied acoustic power was 25, 50, 75, or 100W. Following each MRgFUS treatment, tendons underwent biomechanical tensile testing on an Instron machine, which calculated stress-strain curves during tendon elongation. Rupture rate, maximum treatment temperature, Young’s modulus and ultimate strength were analyzed for each treatment energy.</p> Results <p>The study revealed a dose-dependent response, with tendons rupturing in over 50% of cases when energy delivery exceeded 1000J and 100% disruption at energy levels beyond 2000J. The achieved temperatures during MRgFUS were directly proportional to energy delivery. The highest recorded temperature was 56.8°C ± 9.34 (3000J), while the lowest recorded temperate was 18.6°C ± 0.6 (control). The Young’s modulus was highest in the control group (47.3 MPa ± 6.5) and lowest in the 3000J group (13.2 MPa ± 5.9). There was no statistically significant difference in ultimate strength between treatment groups.</p> Conclusion <p>This study establishes crucial thresholds for reliable and repeatable disruption of tendons, laying the groundwork for future in vivo optimization. The findings prompt further exploration of MRgFUS as a non-invasive modality for tendon disruption, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients with musculotendinous contractures.</p>","author":"William Chu Kwan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3bf83fc6b659300a7bf9a639bc38a7e9c8411c75e6b69c5511227c38b16b311a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
