Debates persist between combined single-position surgery and traditional prone-position PSF for optimizing segmental lumbar lordosis.\n\nResearch Question: The study investigates the impact of performing ALIF in the supine position followed by PSF in the prone position on segmental lumbar lordosis.\n\nMaterial and Methods: A cohort of 59 patients underwent ALIF and PSF at a single institution. Preoperative, post-ALIF supine, and post-PSF prone Cobb angles were assessed using x-ray imaging. Statistical analyses, including one-way repeated measures ANOVA and Post-hoc analyses with Bonferroni adjustment, were employed for mean comparisons within subjects.\n\nResults: The mean Cobb angle for the entire cohort showed significant variations over different time points (p).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7da1764912c52a082dc699cf8e78b70181c93ea2716f4498f01fda104c5b2c39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
