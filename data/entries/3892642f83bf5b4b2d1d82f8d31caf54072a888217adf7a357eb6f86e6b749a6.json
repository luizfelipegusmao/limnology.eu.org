{"title":"Total Pain and Fear of Recurrence in Post-treatment Cancer Patients: Serial Mediation of Psychological Flexibility and Mentalization and Gender Moderation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0901/v1","date":1710485046000,"content":"Research indicates that painful experiences can significantly affect the fear of cancer recurrence among cancer survivors, which is a distressing concern that influences both physiological and psychological recovery. Yet, the role of potential factors and mechanisms in these relationships is not fully known. This cross-sectional study aimed to advance our comprehension of the associa-tions between total pain and the fear of recurrence in post-treatment cancer patients by examining two potential mediators: psychological flexibility and mentalization. Three hundred and thirty-five participants (aged 22 to 88, 49.1% female) who had finished their cancer treatment completed self-report assessments of total pain, fear of recurrence, psychological flexibility, and mentalization. The serial mediation analysis showed that all dimensions of total pain were positively related to the fear of recurrence indirectly through psychological flexibility and mentalization, in serial. Additionally, gender moderated these serial mediational effects. In line with the psychological flexibility model, personal capacities to face difficult internal/external problems and interpret one’s behaviour in motivational terms can counterbalance patients’ negative emotions and feelings related to the illness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3892642f83bf5b4b2d1d82f8d31caf54072a888217adf7a357eb6f86e6b749a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
