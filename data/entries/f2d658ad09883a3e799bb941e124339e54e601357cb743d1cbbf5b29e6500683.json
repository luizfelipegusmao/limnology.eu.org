{"title":"Study of Optical Performance and Structure of Yb/Al(1.5wt%Si) and Yb/Al(pure) Multilayers Designed for the 73.6 nm Range","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1805/v1","date":1714274318000,"content":"The Yb/Al multilayer films exhibit excellent theoretical reflectivity in the 54-90nm wavelength range. This study attempted to incorporate 1.5% wt.% of Si impurities into Al to suppress the crystallization of Al, reduce interfacial roughness, and enhance the actual reflectivity of the prepared Yb/Al multilayer films. The internal microstructure changes of the film layers before and after Si impurity doping were investigated using GIXRR, AFM, and XRD techniques. The reflectivity of two types of multilayer films, Yb/Al(1.5wt.%Si) and Yb/Al(pure), was tested to evaluate the effect of Si impurity on the film performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f2d658ad09883a3e799bb941e124339e54e601357cb743d1cbbf5b29e6500683","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
