{"title":"Analytical S/TEM to Understand Structure and Chemistry of Dimensionally Resolved 1D and Quasi-2D van der Waals Sb2S3 Nanocrystals","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.568/7719916?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Physical properties of solids are intrinsically tied to structure. Quasi-one-dimensional van der Waals (q-1D vdW) solids consist of individual chain subunits held together by weak non-covalent forces. For q-1D vdW phases such as Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, the non-covalent interactions between chains are not equivalent, suggesting that energies of different lattice planes are drastically different. Synthetically controlling growth along these crystal directions enables the precise synthesis of nanostructures with axis-specific and high-symmetry crystalline facets. Such ability to control crystal habits and exposed crystal facets in Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> nanostructures can maximize orientation-dependent properties related to fluorescence, electrocatalysis, photovoltaics, and photodetection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ca01b8cd2d8037ce7bf2dd326b315b0600ef90732a17337329767aebfbfe2f17","category":"Environment"}
