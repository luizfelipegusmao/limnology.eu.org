{"title":"Controllable Preparation of Fused Silica Micro Lens Array by Femtosecond‐Laser‐Induced Modification Assisted Wet Etching","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0403/v1","date":1722929261000,"content":"Micro lens arrays (MLAs) play a critical role in optical imaging, new energy technologies, and advanced displays. In this work, high-quality micro lens arrays with controllable profiles using femtosecond-laser-induced modification assisted wet etching (FLIM-WE) were fabricated. The effects of laser single-pulse energy, pulse number, and hydrofluoric acid etching duration on micro lens profiles were systematically studied. Optimization of these parameters enabled the successful preparation of dimensionally controlled micro lens arrays with stable performance and excellent surface quality on fused silica substrates. Ultimately, two types of micro lens arrays were fabricated using femtosecond laser-assisted wet etching. These arrays demonstrated exceptional uniformity and surface quality (Ra~100nm), facilitating clear imaging at various magnifications, with an adjustment range of 1.3X~3.0X. This provides a potential technical support for special micro-optical systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd2013bd611a89fb124d07fb5f6a47c964e8232a18d971fc0354ff273af88f92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
