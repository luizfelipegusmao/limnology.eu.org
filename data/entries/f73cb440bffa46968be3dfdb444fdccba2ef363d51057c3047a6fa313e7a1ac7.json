{"title":"CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Nervous System Tumors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1661/v1","date":1721634205000,"content":"Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) have shown a remarkable efficacy in hematological malignancies, but limited responses in solid tumors. Among solid tumors, CAR-T cell therapy was particularly explored in brain tumors. CAR-T cells have shown a limited clinical efficacy in various types of brain tumors due to several factors that have hampered their activity, including tumor antigen heterogeneity (not all tumor cells express the target antigen), the limited access of CAR-T cells to brain tumor cells, limited CAR-T cell trafficking and in vivo persistence and the presence of a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Despite these considerations, some recent studies have shown promising anti-tumor activity of GD2-CAR-T cells on diffuse midline gliomas and neuroblastomas and of CARv3-TEAM-E cells in glioblastomas. However, strategies are required to improve the effect of CAR-T cells in brain tumors, including advanced CAR-T cell design with multiple antigenic targeting and incorporation of combination therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f73cb440bffa46968be3dfdb444fdccba2ef363d51057c3047a6fa313e7a1ac7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
