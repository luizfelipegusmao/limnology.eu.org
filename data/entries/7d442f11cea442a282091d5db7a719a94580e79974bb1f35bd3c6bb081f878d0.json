{"title":"Bridging Nature and Nanotechnology: Harnessing Plant-Derived Exosome-Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Therapy in Inflammatory Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0357/v1","date":1715069878000,"content":"Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles released by cells that contain nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other bioactive compounds that play a role in the body's physiological and pathological processes. Exosomes have significant and distinct benefits over synthetic carriers such as liposomes and nanoparticles in the realm of illness diagnostics and therapy due to their endogeneity and heterogeneity. Exosomes are classified as either natural or designed, depending on whether they have been deliberately altered. Natural exosomes are further classified as either animal-derived or plant-derived exosomes. Plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (PDENs) are comprised of numerous kinds of bioactive biomolecules. As an alternative cell-free therapeutic strategy, they have the ability to transfer nano-bioactive chemicals to the human body, resulting in diverse anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumour effects. This review focuses on the beneficial effects of plant-derived exosomes against a range of inflammatory conditions, including as periodontitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autoimmune skin disorders, and inflammation of the liver, lungs, and intestines. Inflammatory disorders are a major issue because of their widespread influence on both personal health and public healthcare systems. Since these illnesses are persistent, the affected people's quality of life is negatively impacted and long-term morbidity is exacerbated. The complicated interaction of genetic, environmental, and immunological variables in the development of various disorders makes effective prevention and therapy more challenging. Plant exosomes present a promising avenue for developing novel therapeutic strategies against inflammatory diseases, offering unique advantages over other alternatives. In order to exploit this efficient carrier, future research will concentrate on creating a PELNV delivery system with high stability, transdermal volume, and ease of administration. Plant exosomes have the potential to become reliable therapeutic agents for a range of common disorders if they are targeted and generated with interdisciplinary expertise.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d442f11cea442a282091d5db7a719a94580e79974bb1f35bd3c6bb081f878d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
