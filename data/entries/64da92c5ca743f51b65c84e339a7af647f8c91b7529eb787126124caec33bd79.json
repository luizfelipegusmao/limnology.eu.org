{"title":"Bridging the Divide &ndash; a Review on the Implementation of Personalized Cancer Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0950/v1","date":1713170733000,"content":"The shift towards Personalized Cancer Medicine (PCM) represents a significant transformation in cancer care, emphasizing tailored treatments based on genetic understanding of cancer at the cellular level. This review draws on recent literature to explore key factors influencing PCM implementation, highlighting the role of innovative leadership, interdisciplinary collaboration, and coordinated funding and regulatory strategies. Success in PCM relies on overcoming challenges such as integrating diverse medical disciplines, securing sustainable investment for shared infrastructures, and navigating complex regulatory landscapes. Effective leadership is crucial for fostering a culture of innovation and teamwork, essential for translating complex biological insights into personalized treatment strategies. The transition to PCM necessitates not only organizational adaptation but also the development of new professional roles and training programs, underscoring the need for a multidisciplinary approach and the importance of team science in overcoming the limitations of traditional medical paradigms. The conclusion underscores that PCM's success hinges on creating collaborative environments that support innovation, adaptability, and shared vision among all stakeholders involved in cancer care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64da92c5ca743f51b65c84e339a7af647f8c91b7529eb787126124caec33bd79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
