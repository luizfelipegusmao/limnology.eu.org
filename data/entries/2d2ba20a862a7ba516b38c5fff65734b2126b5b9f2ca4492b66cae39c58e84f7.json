{"title":"Genome-Scale Characterization, and Expression Profiling of TCP Gene Family in Cold Stress Tolerance of Passion Fruit (Passiflora edulis)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0907/v1","date":1715662214000,"content":"Passion fruit is a valued tropical fruit crop that faces environment-related growth strains. TCP genes are important for both growth modulation and stress prevention in plants. Herein, we systematically analyzed the TCP gene family in passion fruit, recognizing 30 members. Genes exhibiting closer phylogenetic relationships exhibited similar protein and gene structures. Gene members of the TCP family showed developmental stage or tissue-specific expression profiles during the passion fruit life cycle. Transcriptome data also demonstrated that many PeTCPs showed induced expression in response to hormonal treatments and cold, heat, and salt stress. Based on transcriptomics data, eight candidate genes were chosen for preferential gene expression confirmation under cold stress conditions. Additionally, four TCP genes exhibited in silico binding with cold stress-related miRNA319s. This study will aid in the establishment of novel germplasm, as well as the further investigation of the roles of PeTCPs and their cold stress resistance characteristics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d2ba20a862a7ba516b38c5fff65734b2126b5b9f2ca4492b66cae39c58e84f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
