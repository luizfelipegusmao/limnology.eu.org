However, variations in plant P acquisition strategies in connection to soil P fraction changes after wetland drainage remain unclear.\n\nTo address this issue, here we conducted a study in six distinct wetlands that experienced long-term (&gt;20 years) artificial drainage, with the adjacent waterlogged wetlands as a control. We analysed plant community composition, biomass and soil P fractions, and identified three plant P acquisition strategies based on soil acid phosphatase activity, plant P resorption efficiency, and soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) content.\n\nWe found that soil calcium-bound P (P<sub>Ca</sub>) and enzyme-extractable P (P<sub>enzyme</sub>) were key factors influencing plant P acquisition. Soil P<sub>Ca</sub> correlated negatively with acid phosphatase activity but positively with AMF content. Soil P<sub>enzyme</sub> negatively impacted P resorption efficiency. The wetlands were categorised into three types based on the change in plant richness and composition, with each exhibiting distinct plant P acquisition strategies. These changes in strategies after drainage corresponded with shifts in soil P fractions.\n\nOverall, our study highlights the role of soil P fractions in explaining plant P acquisition strategies after wetland drainage, suggesting P regulations on plant succession and ecosystem services.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/27/changing-plant-phosphorus-acquisition-strategies-in-relation-to-altered-soil-phosphorus-fractions-after-wetland-drainage/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>\n<h2>湿地排水后植物磷获取策略的变化与土壤磷组分变化的关联</h2>\n<p>\n\n植物磷获取策略是植物演替的内在驱动力之一。然而，湿地排水后植物磷获取策略变化是否与土壤磷组分有关尚不清楚。\n\n本研究选取了经历长期(&gt;20年)人工排水的6个湿地，并以邻近未排水湿地作为对照，分析了植物群落组成、生物量、土壤磷组分以及三种植物磷获取策略(包括土壤酸性磷酸酶活性、植物磷重吸收效率和土壤丛枝菌根真菌含量)。\n\n结果显示，土壤钙结合态磷(P<sub>Ca</sub>)和酶可提取磷(P<sub>enzyme</sub>)是影响植物磷获取策略的主要因素。土壤P<sub>Ca</sub>与酸性磷酸酶活性呈负相关，但与土壤丛枝菌根真菌含量呈正相关，土壤P<sub>enzyme</sub>与植物磷重吸收效率呈负相关。本研究依据植物丰富度和组成的变化将湿地分为三种类型，并发现不同类型湿地排水后，植物磷获取策略的变化与土壤磷组分的变化密切相关。\n\n总体而言，该研究强调了土壤磷组分对湿地排水后植物磷获取策略变化的重要影响，突显了磷在植物演替和生态系统服务中的调控作用。\n</p>","author":"Zhenhui Jiang, \nWanqing Luo, \nErxiong Zhu, \nYunpeng Zhao, \nChengzhu Liu, \nLei Zhou, \nXiaojuan Feng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"d0949ddd8862fe74997b9c6369acfa44d6dcd589c0515920f274f176ad7aece4","category":"Environment"}
