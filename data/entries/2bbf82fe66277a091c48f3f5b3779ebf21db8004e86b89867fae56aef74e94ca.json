{"title":"Virulence Molecular Epidemiology of Clinical Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: \nFirst Report from Jordan","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0330/v1","date":1715062657000,"content":"1) Background: carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that has a significant role in healthcare-associated infections. Unlike several studies on the antibiotic-resistant epidemiology of A. baumanni, virulence molecular epidemiology was less studied. This study aimed to investigate CRAB virulence genes and their ability to form biofilms, and to correlate their biofilm formation ability with both; biofilm-encoding virulence genes and carbapenemase-encoding resistance genes. 2) Methods: 107 CRAB clinical isolates were collected from two hospitals in Jordan between 2018 and 2019 and were screened for virulence genes using PCR. In addition, biofilm formation ability was assessed using the microtiter plate method. 3) Results: the frequencies of the bap, OmpA, surA, PLD, paaE, basD, and traT virulence genes were 99.10%, 98.20%, 98.20%, 95.50%, 89.10%, 86.40%, and 8.20%, respectively. Overall, 86.4% of the tested isolates were biofilm formers with varying degrees; weak (28.2%), moderate (36.4%) and strong (21.8%). A significant relationship was found between the carbapenemase-encoding gene (OXA-23 gene) and biofilm production. 4) Conclusion: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Jordan that inspected CRAB virulence genes and highlighted the importance of improving infection control measures to avoid CRAB outbreaks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bbf82fe66277a091c48f3f5b3779ebf21db8004e86b89867fae56aef74e94ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
