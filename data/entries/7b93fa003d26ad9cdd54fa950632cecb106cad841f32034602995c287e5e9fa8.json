{"title":"Monitoring the Effects of Land Use Land Cover Change on Forest Biomass Carbon&rdquo; in the Western Himalayan of Pakistan, a Study of Ayubia National Park","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1079/v1","date":1718606134000,"content":"Land use land cover change(LULCC) plays a significant role in understanding the global change. Particularly in regions with high population growth and climate change, anthropogenic activities have drastically altered land use and land cover (LULC). The geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing are prominent tools for monitoring LULC changes. The land use land cover(LULC) analysis and carbon loss assessment were carried out in Ayubia national park. The area was classified into five major LULC classes, namely grassland, built-up areas, mixed forests, conifer forests and bare land. Landsat temporal satellite data of Ayubia national park acquired on 1992,2002,2012 and 2022 were analysed to access land use change and Markov’s Chain Model was used to predict the land use land cover changes for 2040. The accuracy of the images were assessed using Kappa matrix. Our results showed that a total of 371.94 ha forest land has been converted into other land uses from 1992 to 2022 and Indicating the increasing scale of anthropogenic pressure on forest resources of the Park. The carbon pool was assessed in two forest types including temperate coniferous forest and Mixed forest. The estimated carbon value recorded in TCF is 135.19 ±9.74 MgC ha-1, whereas it is in 86.43 ±8.25 MgC ha-1 in MF. Using satellite data, a thorough examination of the forest inventory was conducted to determine the LULCC, the rate of biomass carbon loss, and the factors that influenced these trends.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b93fa003d26ad9cdd54fa950632cecb106cad841f32034602995c287e5e9fa8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
