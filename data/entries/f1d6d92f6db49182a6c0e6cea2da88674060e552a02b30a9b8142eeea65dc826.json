For the computational reconstruction of the image contrast from the acquired diffraction patterns, numerous data acquisition parameters, such as camera length, probe semi-convergence angle, scanning step size, etc. must be calibrated and then carefully chosen for optimal imaging conditions. The combinations suitable to a specific experiment may not be intuitively clear for newcomers to the field and lead to suboptimal or even wrongly acquired datasets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f1d6d92f6db49182a6c0e6cea2da88674060e552a02b30a9b8142eeea65dc826","category":"Environment"}
