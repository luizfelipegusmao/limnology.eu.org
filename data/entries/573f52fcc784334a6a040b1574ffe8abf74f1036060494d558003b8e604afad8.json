{"title":"Performance Analysis of a 50 MW Solar PV Installation at BUI Power Authority: A Comparative Study Between Sunny and Overcast Days","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1325/v1","date":1718777353000,"content":"Ghana, blessed with abundant solar resources and has strategically invested in solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies to diversify its energy mix and reduce the environmental impacts of traditional energy technologies. The 50 MW solar PV installation by the Bui Power Authority exemplifies the nation's dedication to utilizing clean energy for sustainable growth. This study seeks to close the knowledge gap by providing a detailed analysis of the system's performance under different weather conditions, particularly on days with abundant sunshine and those with cloudy skies. The research consists of one-year monitoring data of the climatic and AC energy output fed into the grid. This data was used to analyze PV performance on each month's sunniest and cloudiest days. The results show that the total amount of AC energy output fed into the grid each month on the sunniest day varies between 229.3 MWh in December and 278.0 MWh in November, while the total amount of AC energy output fed into the grid each month on the cloudiest day varies between16.1 MWh in August and 192.8 MWh in February. Also, the percentage variation in energy produced between the sunniest and cloudiest days within a month ranges from 16.9% (December) to 94.1% (August). The reference and system yield analysis showed that the PV plant has a high conversion efficiency of 91.3%; however, only the sunniest and overcast days had an efficiency of 38% and 92%, respectively. The BPA plant's performance can be enhanced by using this analysis to identify erratic power generation on sunny days and schedule timely maintenance to keep the plant's performance from deteriorating. Optimizing a solar PV system's design, installation, and operation can significantly improve its AC energy output, performance ratio, and capacity factor on sunny and cloudy days.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"573f52fcc784334a6a040b1574ffe8abf74f1036060494d558003b8e604afad8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
