{"title":"General practitioners’ experiences of providing lifestyle advice to patients with depression: A qualitative focus group study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299934","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Emma Astaire, Laura Jennings, Martina Khundakar, Sergio A. Silverio, Angela C. Flynn</p>\r\nObjective <p>Depression is an increasingly common mental health disorder in the UK, managed predominantly in the community by GPs. Emerging evidence suggests lifestyle medicine is a key component in the management of depression. We aimed to explore GPs’ experiences, attitudes, and challenges to providing lifestyle advice to patients with depression.</p> Method <p>Focus groups were conducted virtually with UK GPs (May-July 2022). A topic guide facilitated the discussion and included questions on experiences, current practices, competence, challenges, and service provision. Data were analysed using template analysis.</p> Results <p>‘Supporting Effective Conversations’; ‘Willing, but Blocked from Establishing Relational Care’; ‘Working Towards Patient Empowerment’; and ‘Control Over the Prognosis’ were all elements of how individualised lifestyle advice was key to the management of depression. Establishing a doctor-patient relationship by building trust and rapport was fundamental to having effective conversations about lifestyle behaviours. Empowering patients to make positive lifestyle changes required tailoring advice using a patient-centred approach. Confidence varied across participants, depending on education, experience, type of patient, and severity of depression.</p> Conclusions <p>GPs play an important role in managing depression using lifestyle medicine and a patient-centred approach. Organisational and educational changes are necessary to facilitate GPs in providing optimal care to patients with depression.</p>","author":"Emma Astaire","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e74712d6a3304639b8477a57892fce89173197cf816b452a5074d937420d417f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
