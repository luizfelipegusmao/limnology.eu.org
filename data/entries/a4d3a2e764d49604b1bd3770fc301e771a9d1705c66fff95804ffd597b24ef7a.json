Due to restrictions from the farmland “red line” policy and territorial spatial planning, scattered urban areas and farmland distributed within NRs form many “skylights”. Perforating NRs alters their shape and continuity and may have negative effects on long-term conservation. Through remote sensing data, we identified urban areas and farmland “skylights” in NRs in Guangdong Province, China. This study evaluated four scenarios: maintaining both urban areas and farmland (current state), maintaining farmland while removing urban areas, maintaining urban areas while removing farmland, and removing both urban areas and farmland. Two indicators, the exposure level and the maximum depth of NRs, were used to preliminarily assess the impacts of “skylights”. We found that urban “skylights” accounted for a relatively low proportion (5.81%) of total “skylights” and farmland “skylights” accounted for 94.19%. The current exposure level of NRs in Guangdong Province was very high, and approximately 82.83% of the NR areas were within 1 km of an unprotected matrix. If “skylights” were removed without exception, the 1 km exposure level would decrease to 61.37%, and the maximum depth would significantly increase. We recommend further assessment of the influence of “skylights” on the conservation effect of NRs and suggest first removing small “skylights” to reduce their negative impact.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>在中国自然保护地整合与优化进程中，自然保护与社会发展的空间矛盾突出。由于耕地“红线”政策和国土空间规划的限制，分散在自然保护区内的城镇和农田形成了很多“天窗”。“天窗”改变了自然保护区的形状和连续性，对长期保护会产生负面影响。通过遥感数据，我们识别了中国广东省自然保护区内城镇和农田类型的“天窗”。我们建立了四种情景，包括保留城镇和农田(维持现状)、保留农田和移除城镇、保留城镇和移除农田、移除城镇和农田。利用暴露水平和最大深度两个指标初步评估“天窗”造成的影响。研究表明，城镇类型的“天窗”占比相对较低(5.81%)，而农田类型的“天窗”占比高达94.19%。目前，广东省自然保护区暴露水平较高，保护区82.83%的区域距离非保护区域小于1千米。假设移除全部“天窗”，1千米的暴露水平将下降到61.37%，最大深度将显著增加。我们建议进一步评估“天窗”对自然保护区保护效率的影响，并且优先移除小型“天窗”，以减少负面影响。【审阅:高海洋、朱頔】</p>","author":"Haiyang Gao, \nDi Zhu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Integrative Conservation: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b2434e359c647f096191c4befea99097fa9394fd28e02b126976eb35d9219c03","entryHash":"a4d3a2e764d49604b1bd3770fc301e771a9d1705c66fff95804ffd597b24ef7a","category":"Environment"}
