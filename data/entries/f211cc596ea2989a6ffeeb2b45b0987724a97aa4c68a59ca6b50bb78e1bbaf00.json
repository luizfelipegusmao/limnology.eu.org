{"title":"Enhancing Marketing Education Through Problem-Based Learning: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1020/v1","date":1718356303000,"content":"The marketing industry is rapidly evolving, necessitating educational programs to adapt and equip graduates with relevant skills and knowledge. This systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis (SLRBA) explores the integration of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in marketing education. PBL is an instructional strategy that empowers students to solve real-life problems by integrating theory and practice, thus fostering critical thinking and decision-making skills. Our review synthesizes data from 71 sources, highlighting the definition of PBL, strategies to promote its implementation in marketing education, and the benefits and challenges associated with this approach. The findings indicate that PBL enhances student engagement, provides hands-on experience, and prepares students for real-world marketing challenges. Strategies such as using social media, serious games, e-learning, and feedback mechanisms are discussed for their effectiveness in promoting active learning and student participation. Despite its advantages, PBL faces challenges such as resource intensiveness, student resistance, and information integrity issues. This review underscores the importance of PBL in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ultimately preparing marketing students to meet the demands of the industry. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and best practices for implementing PBL in marketing education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f211cc596ea2989a6ffeeb2b45b0987724a97aa4c68a59ca6b50bb78e1bbaf00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
