{"title":"Income insecurity and social protection: Examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across income groups","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310680","date":1726840800000,"content":"<p>by Na Chen</p>\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has wrought unprecedented disruption on global economies, leading to widespread income insecurity among individuals and households. This study investigates the impact of the pandemic on income insecurity across different income groups and assesses the role of social protection measures in mitigating these effects. Using cross-country data, we analyze the prevalence of income reduction and the effectiveness of social assistance programs in high-income, upper middle-income, lower middle-income, and low-income countries. Our findings reveal significant variations in income insecurity and social protection responses across these groups. the pandemic had a significant impact on household incomes globally, with lower-middle-income countries experiencing the most significant income reductions. The average per capita transfer amounts show a general decrease over time, which could be due to the economic strain on governments and the need for more sustainable social protection programs. The correlation between transfer amounts and the proportion of households with reduced income indicates that countries with higher income reduction rates tended to have lower average per capita transfer amounts, suggesting a potential lack of adequate support for those in need. The study highlights the importance of robust social safety nets in cushioning the economic blow of the pandemic, particularly for vulnerable populations in lower-income countries.","author":"Na Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"255f0be2434a687eea1cb756620b2aad8c1520ee395233de28cc78606db1d0bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
