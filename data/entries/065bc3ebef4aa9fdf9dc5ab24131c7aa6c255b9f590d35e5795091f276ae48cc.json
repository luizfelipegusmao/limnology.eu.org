{"title":"Structure and Constraints for a Knowledge Architecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1719/v2","date":1724869112000,"content":"Knowledge is not merely the characteristic of certain pieces of information being deemed true, believed and justifiable, but rather a process. The sentences that reaches the status of knowledge forms a universe that provides an interpretation of the reality one aims to describe. Language exchanges information through communication and the justification, if concludes successfully with respect to a sentence, it elevates the information to the status of knowledge. We provide a model where we define the fundamental elements of communication and grammar. As a result, knowledge must be \\open\\ (everyone must be able to acquire it), \\free\\ (everyone must be able to justifiy) and \\tidy\\ (everyone must be able to retrace the justification process in all its parts recursively). Ultimately, the development of knowledge processing, referred to as \\emph{knowmatic}, represents the evolution of the information technologies (\\it).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"065bc3ebef4aa9fdf9dc5ab24131c7aa6c255b9f590d35e5795091f276ae48cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
