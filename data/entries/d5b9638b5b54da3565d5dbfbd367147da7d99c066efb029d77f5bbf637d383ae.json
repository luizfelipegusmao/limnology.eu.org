{"title":"Multi-Material Topology Optimization on Separate Tetrahedral Meshes with Explicit Design Resolution by means of Remeshing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1062/v1","date":1726301201000,"content":"As a method of lightweight design, multi-material design aims to make targeted use of materials in order to reduce CO2 emissions. In this context, it can be described as one of the product development methods used to meet the challenges of climate change. However, since the design of structures in multi-material design is complex, topology optimization can be used to support the product developer. In this article, a multi-material topology optimization method is developed that combines the Velocity Field Level Set method with the Reconciled Level Set method. Furthermore, the current design is explicitly resolved in each iteration by means of multi-material remeshing. The edge collapse phase in the remeshing process is achieved by applying the producer consumer pattern. The developed method is then validated using known examples from the state of research and the influence of parameters of the method on the result is analyzed by means of studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5b9638b5b54da3565d5dbfbd367147da7d99c066efb029d77f5bbf637d383ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
