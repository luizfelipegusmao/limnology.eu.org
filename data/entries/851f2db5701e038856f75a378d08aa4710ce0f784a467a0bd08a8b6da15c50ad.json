{"title":"Towards Sustainable Construction Development: A Qualitative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0643/v1","date":1715333477000,"content":"The construction industry plays a crucial role in shaping the built environment and contributes to the global economy. However, the construction process is associated with negative impacts on the environment and communities. This paper examines the environmental impacts of construction and presents strategies for mitigating them, focusing on sustainable construction practices. The research draws on a comprehensive literature review, case studies, and expert interviews to fully understand the construction industry and its environmental effects. The findings indicate that the implementation of greater supervision of every construction project phase, using alternative design practices, and the use of sustainable construction practices can reduce the negative impacts of construction on the environment and society. The study concludes that sustainable construction practices can contribute to a better environment for a better quality of life and should be embraced by the construction industry. The recommendations for future work include the adoption of green building standards, the use of renewable energy sources, the reduction of waste, and the promotion of stakeholder engagement. Future research should focus on the evaluation of the effectiveness of these strategies and their scalability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"851f2db5701e038856f75a378d08aa4710ce0f784a467a0bd08a8b6da15c50ad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
