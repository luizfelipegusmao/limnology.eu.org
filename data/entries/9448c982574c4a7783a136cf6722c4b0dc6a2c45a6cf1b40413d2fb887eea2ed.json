{"title":"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 interferon gamma release assay in BNT162b2 vaccinated healthcare workers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303244","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Angélica Ramos, Sandra Martins, Ana Sofia Marinho, Pedro Norton, Maria João Cardoso, João Tiago Guimarães</p>\r\n\r\nTo predict protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, cellular immunity seems to be more sensitive than humoral immunity. Through an Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ) Release Assay (IGRA), we show that, despite a marked decrease in total antibodies, 94.3% of 123 healthcare workers have a positive cellular response 6 months after inoculation with the 2nd dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Despite the qualitative relationship found, we did not observe a quantitative correlation between IFN-γ and IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2. Using stimulated whole blood from a subset of participants, we confirmed the specific T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 by dosing elevated levels of the IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. Through a 20-month follow-up, we found that none of the infected participants had severe COVID-19 and that the first positive cases were only 12 months after the 2nd dose inoculation. Future studies are needed to understand if IGRA-SARS-CoV-2 can be a powerful diagnostic tool to predict future COVID-19 severe disease, guiding vaccination policies.","author":"Angélica Ramos","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9448c982574c4a7783a136cf6722c4b0dc6a2c45a6cf1b40413d2fb887eea2ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
