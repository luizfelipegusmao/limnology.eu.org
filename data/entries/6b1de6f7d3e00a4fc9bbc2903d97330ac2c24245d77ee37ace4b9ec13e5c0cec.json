Among various cutting-edge areas, exploiting ambient backscatter communication (Backcom) has recently been devised as one of the foremost solutions for achieving zero energy consumption through the viability of ambient radio frequency. Meanwhile, using short-packet communication (SPC) is the cheapest way to reach the goal of URLLCs. Upon these benefits, we investigate the feasibility of Backcom and SPC for symbiotic wireless sensor networks by analyzing the system performance. Specifically, we provide a highly approximated mathematical framework for evaluating the block-error rate (BLER) performance, followed by some useful asymptotic results. These results provide insights into the level of diversity and coding gain, as well as how packet design impacts BLER performance. Numerical results confirm the efficacy of the developed framework and the correctness of key insights gleaned from the asymptotic analyses.","author":"Quang Vinh Do","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6b1de6f7d3e00a4fc9bbc2903d97330ac2c24245d77ee37ace4b9ec13e5c0cec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
