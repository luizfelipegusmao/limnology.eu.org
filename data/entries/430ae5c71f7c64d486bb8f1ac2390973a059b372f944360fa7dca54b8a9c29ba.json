{"title":"Geographical distribution of mobile genetic elements in microbial communities along the Yucatan coast","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301642","date":1714399200000,"content":"<p>by Francisco Guillén-Chable, Johnny Omar Valdez Iuit, Luis Alejandro Avila Castro, Carlos Rosas, Enrique Merino, Zuemy Rodríguez-Escamilla, Mario Alberto Martínez-Núñez</p>\r\n\r\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a well-documented strategy used by bacteria to enhance their adaptability to challenging environmental conditions. Through HGT, a group of conserved genetic elements known as mobile genetic elements (MGEs) is disseminated within bacterial communities. MGEs offer numerous advantages to the host, increasing its fitness by acquiring new functions that help bacteria contend with adverse conditions, including exposure to heavy metal and antibiotics. This study explores MGEs within microbial communities along the Yucatan coast using a metatranscriptomics approach. Prior to this research, nothing was known about the coastal Yucatan’s microbial environmental mobilome and HGT processes between these bacterial communities. This study reveals a positive correlation between MGEs and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) along the Yucatan coast, with higher MGEs abundance in more contaminated sites. The Proteobacteria and Firmicutes groups exhibited the highest number of MGEs. It’s important to highlight that the most abundant classes of MGEs might not be the ones most strongly linked to ARGs, as observed for the recombination/repair class. This work presents the first geographical distribution of the environmental mobilome in Yucatan Peninsula mangroves.","author":"Francisco Guillén-Chable","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"430ae5c71f7c64d486bb8f1ac2390973a059b372f944360fa7dca54b8a9c29ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
