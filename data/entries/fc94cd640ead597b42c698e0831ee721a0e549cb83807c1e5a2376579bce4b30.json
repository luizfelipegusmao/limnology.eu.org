{"title":"Monitoring Diversity Profiles of Forested Landscapes in Mediterranean Spain: Their Contribution to Local and Regional Vascular Plant Diversity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0138/v1","date":1722588161000,"content":"Biodiversity monitoring is a seminal key for understanding the delivery of ecosystem functions and services. Mediterranean forests and woodlands harbor the vast majority of regional vascular plant diversity, and hence, they are a good surrogate for detecting changes in biodiversity linked to global change. In this work, we present a database resulting from the study of vascular plant diversity in multi-scale plots of 0.1 ha, measured around the first decade of this century and located in Mediterranean forest environments. Diversity profiles are calculated from Hill numbers (0, 1 and 2) for local (α) and regional (ϒ) diversity, as well as multiplicative calculation of differential diversity (β). Main Mediterranean forests sampled had a medium coverage of 51 % and stand dominant height of 10.6 m being monospecific in two thirds of the cases. Local diversity reaches its highest values ​​(around 78 species per 0.1 ha) in Holm oak dehesas, with values ​​below 50 species for the set of the most productive forest stands dominated by species of the genus Pinus. As regards the contribution to regional diversity, it is the broadleaf formations that contribute the most, with stone pine forests and dehesas in an intermediate position, and pine forests contributing the lowest in species richness terms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc94cd640ead597b42c698e0831ee721a0e549cb83807c1e5a2376579bce4b30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
