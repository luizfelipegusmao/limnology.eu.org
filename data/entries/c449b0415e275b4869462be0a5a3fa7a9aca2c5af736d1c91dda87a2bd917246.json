However, the location of pigment cells in the skin structure is uncertain. To determine the pigment cell type in the skin, the vertical order and ultrastructure of pigment cells were examined using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Both dorsal and ventral skins comprise the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Xanthophores, melanophores, and iridophores were observed in the dermis of the dorsal skin, whereas the latter two were in the dermis of the ventral skin. Interestingly, the size of xanthophores in the dorsal skin was significantly smaller than that of xanthophores in the ventral skin; however, the density of dorsal xanthophores was significantly higher than that of ventral xanthophores. The type L-iridophores with large crystalline structures were observed in the uppermost area of the upper pigment layer, which contributed to the strikingly metallic luster shown by the ventral skin. The melanophores were exclusively found in the dorsal skin, offering the purpose of camouflage. Taken together, our results indicated that the pigment cells display different arrangement patterns between dorsal and ventral skin, and the golden color in the ventral skin results from the coexistence of light-reflecting iridophores and light-absorbing xanthophores.</p>","author":"Chenchen Shi, \nShi Xi Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"c449b0415e275b4869462be0a5a3fa7a9aca2c5af736d1c91dda87a2bd917246","category":"Environment"}
