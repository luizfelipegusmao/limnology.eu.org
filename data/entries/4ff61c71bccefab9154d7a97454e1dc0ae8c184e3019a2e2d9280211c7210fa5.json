{"title":"Electrospun Fibers of Ecovio® Polymer Blends with Antimicrobial Tea Tree Essential Oil: Enhanced Chemical and Biological Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0242/v1","date":1719918744000,"content":"This study presents, for the first time, the development of fibers with favorable properties for biodegradable wound dressings made from the Ecovio® (EC) polymer blend, composed of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), incorporated with tea tree essential oil (TTE). TTE presented antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, achieving minimal inhibitory concentrations of 15 and 7.5 mg/mL, respectively. The TTE was mixed with EC in a binary chloroform and formic acid (85/15 v/v) mixture, leading to homogeneous and wettable fibers by electrospinning. The EC/TTE fibers were characterized confirming the TTE in the fibers. The tests showed that TTE (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mL) improved the polymer blend electrospinnability. TTE (1.5 mL or 75 w% concerning the EC) lead to homogeneous fibers with an average diameter of 278 nm. TTE (75 w%) increased the wettability of the EC fibers from 120±2° to 69±1°. Preliminary bacterial adhesion and proliferation assays demonstrated that the EC/TTE fibers have anti-adhesive activity e seems to be more toxic against P. aeruginosa compared to S. aureus after 24 hours of incubation. Compatibility tests with human blood indicated that the EC/TTE fibers accelerate blood coagulation. The EC/TTE fibers exhibit promising chemical and biological properties (in vitro) for the development of wound dressings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ff61c71bccefab9154d7a97454e1dc0ae8c184e3019a2e2d9280211c7210fa5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
