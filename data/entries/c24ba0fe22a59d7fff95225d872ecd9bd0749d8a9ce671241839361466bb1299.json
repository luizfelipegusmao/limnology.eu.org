{"title":"Description of Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) phenological events according to the extended BBCH scale","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1837/v1","date":1711703663000,"content":"Walnut trees are grown worldwide for their edible fruits of high nutritional value. To address climate change, researchers have studied walnut phenology to create cultivars adapted to warmer climates. The standardisation of walnut phenological observations is needed and the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie (BBCH) scale is the most accurate and internationally accepted for this purpose. Here, the principal growth stages (PGS) of Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) are described using stages from a previously available alphanumerical scale. This standardised phenological scale describes Persian walnut growth from the dormant vegetative state through reproductive budding to senescence. This phenological scale is expected to increase the efficiency of walnut phenological monitoring. Fifty-seven stages were used to describe the life cycle of Persian walnut in this BBCH scale. Of these 57 stages, 3 stages are dedicated to seed germination (PGS-0), 4 stages to bud development (PGS-0), 7 stages to leaf development (PGS-1), 4 stages to stem elongation (PGS-3), 8 stages to inflorescence emergence (PGS-5), 5 stages to male flowering (PGS-6), 5 stages to female flowering (PGS-6), 5 stages to fruit development (PGS-7), 12 stages to fruit ripening (PGS-8) and 4 stages to leaf senescence (PGS-9).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c24ba0fe22a59d7fff95225d872ecd9bd0749d8a9ce671241839361466bb1299","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
