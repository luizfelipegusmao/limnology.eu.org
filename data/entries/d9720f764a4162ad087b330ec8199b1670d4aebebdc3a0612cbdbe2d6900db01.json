{"title":"Comparing Physical Activity Barriers and Facilitators in Underrepresented Minorities: Preliminary Outcomes from a Mixed Methods Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0489/v1","date":1725850164000,"content":"Physical activity (PA) benefits are well-established, yet many US adults fail to meet PA guidelines. This is especially true for minorities facing social inequities. This study explored barriers and facilitators to PA among urban Midwestern minorities using a mixed-methods approach framed on the socio-ecological model. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among community-dwelling minorities. Participants were grouped as completing low (LLPA) or high (HLPA) weekly leisure-time PA for comparison. Quantitative analysis included MANOVA, follow-up ANOVAs, and calculation of effect sizes. Qualitative data were assessed using inductive thematic analysis. Twenty-nine adults (44.83% Black, 41.37% Latino) participated in the study. The HLPA group (n = 18) reported higher leisure-time PA (p = 0.001, d = 2.21) and total PA (p = 0.02, d = 1.00) compared to the LLPA group (n = 11). LLPA participants faced more personal barriers to PA (p = 0.02, d = -0.92). Common barriers identified in the interviews  included a lack of time and financial costs. Facilitators included social support and available PA facilities. Both groups achieved USPA guidelines through different PA domains. Increasing social support and lowering PA-related costs could enhance participation. Addressing barriers and leveraging existing facilitators are crucial to increasing PA among minorities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9720f764a4162ad087b330ec8199b1670d4aebebdc3a0612cbdbe2d6900db01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
