{"title":"The Role of the Unbinding Cycle on the Coordination Abilities of the Bi-Cyclopeptides Toward Cu(II) Ions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1255/v1","date":1713442236000,"content":"Bicyclic peptides have attracted the interest of pharmaceutical companies because of their remarkable properties putting them on a new path in medicine. Their conformational rigidity that improves proteolytic stability, leads to rapid penetration into tissues via any possible route of administration and elimination, occurring by renal metabolism, is of great importance for people with a history of liver diseases. In addition, each ring can function independently, making them extremely versatile molecules for further optimization. In this paper we compared the potentiometric and spectroscopic properties studied by UV-Vis, MCD, and EPR, of four synthetic analogues of the bi-cyclic peptide c(PKKHP-c(CFWKTC)-PKKH). In particular we correlated the structural and spectral properties of complexes with coordinating abilities toward Cu(II) ions of MCL (Ac-PKKHPc(CFWKTC)PKKH-NH2) that contains the unbinding cycle and N- and C-terminal linear parts, with two histidine residues, one per part; two monocyclic ligands containing one histidine residue, both in the N-terminal position i.e., MCL2 (Ac-PKKHPc(CFWKTC)PKKS-NH2) and in the C-terminal position i.e., MCL3 (Ac-PKKSPc(CFWKTC)PKKH-NH2), respectively, and the linear structure LNL (Ac-PKKHPSFWKTSPKKH-NH2).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3e224b9415f2b3bf32a05673fc1aa0c0c4a06ae0ed14105489adb88e680bfdce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
