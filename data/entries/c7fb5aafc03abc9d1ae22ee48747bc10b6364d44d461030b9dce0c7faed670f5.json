{"title":"Influence of storage method on the content of photosynthetic pigments of the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05573-8","date":1727740800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Aquatic bryophytes are frequently used as bioindicators of water quality in rivers. Poor water quality increases physiological stress in moss, and stress levels can be estimated by measuring the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments and by calculating pigmentary indices. However, studies collecting many samples in a short time may need to store them until analysis. In the meantime, the pigments may suffer some degradation. Given the lack of studies on this problem for aquatic bryophytes, this one investigates the effect of three storage methods (refrigerated at 6 °C, frozen at − 20 °C and dried at room temperature) on the concentrations of chlorophyll <em>a</em>, chlorophyll <em>b</em>, pheophytin <em>a</em> and the following ratios: chlorophyll <em>a</em>/chlorophyll <em>b</em>, D430/D410, D665/D665<em>a</em>, D430/D665 and D480/D665 (where Dx is the absorbance at x nm) in the aquatic moss <em>Fontinalis antipyretica</em>. The results showed that refrigeration was the most suitable method, freezing might be suitable for some parameters, and drying was inadequate for this purpose. We recommend that all studies on photosynthetic pigments detail the time elapsed from collection to sample analysis, as well as the storage method used.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"c7fb5aafc03abc9d1ae22ee48747bc10b6364d44d461030b9dce0c7faed670f5","category":"Environment"}
