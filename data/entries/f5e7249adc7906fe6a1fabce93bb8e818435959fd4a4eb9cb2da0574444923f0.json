The abrupt change in electrostatic boundary conditions can alter the dielectric properties of a material at the surface, making the identification and characterization of such surface reconstructions especially critical for polar materials. We will discuss such reconstructions in the context of surface relaxation of oxygen octahedral rotations (OOR) in a ferroelectric phase of sodium niobate (NaNbO<sub>3</sub>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f5e7249adc7906fe6a1fabce93bb8e818435959fd4a4eb9cb2da0574444923f0","category":"Environment"}
