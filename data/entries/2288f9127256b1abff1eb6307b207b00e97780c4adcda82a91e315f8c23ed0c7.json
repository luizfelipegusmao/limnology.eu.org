Focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out is the most prevalent method for preparing site-specific TEM lamellas and needles for APT specimens. Although widespread, FIB lift-outs are time-consuming and require a highly skilled operator [<a href=\"#ozae044.046-B2\">2</a>]. Additionally, during probing, the chances of failure at the platinum joints in lift-out are also considerable. Directly preparing needle specimens from bulk sample enhances structural integrity, minimizes fracture risk during APT data acquisition and facilitates easier handling. Laser machining can provide a quick way to produce micrometer-scale features for most materials and hence can be ideal for performing coarse machining of microscopy samples [<a href=\"#ozae044.046-B3\">3</a>]. This article presents a novel workflow to rapidly prepare APT specimens from bulk resin samples using laser ablation for coarse machining and FIB for final nano machining.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2288f9127256b1abff1eb6307b207b00e97780c4adcda82a91e315f8c23ed0c7","category":"Environment"}
