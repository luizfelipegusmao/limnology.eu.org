{"title":"CD70 is a potential prognostic marker and significantly regulates cellular function in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312445","date":1729778400000,"content":"<p>by Kang Liu, Qiuyue Yang, Ping Liu, Kaibo Zhu, Min Zou, Qiang Zhu, Ping Yi, Kun Fang, Zimian Luo</p>\r\n\r\nExtensive research has demonstrated that dysregulation of costimulatory molecule expression plays a pivotal role in cancer biology. However, the impact of intratumoral CD70 on the initiation, progression, and immune response in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the clinical significance of CD70 in DLBCL diagnosis and prognosis, as well as its relationship with the immune microenvironment. We first analyzed CD70 expression across various cancers, including DLBCL, using multiple online databases (TIMER, GEPIA, GENT2, TNMPlot, GSCA, and GEO). We then evaluated the clinical correlations and prognostic value of CD70 in DLBCL. Additionally, we investigated the functional role of CD70 in DLBCL cells. Genomic alterations of CD70 were analyzed using the cBioPortal online tool. Co-expression network analysis was performed to assess the biological functions associated with CD70. Furthermore, we utilized TIMER2.0 to examine the correlation between CD70 expression and immune cell infiltration. Our results revealed that CD70 expression was significantly upregulated in DLBCL tissues compared to matched normal tissues, and high CD70 expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes in DLBCL patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CD70 inhibition promotes apoptosis and induces G1 phase arrest in DLBCL cells. Genomic alteration analysis showed that patients with CD70 alterations exhibited worse overall survival compared to those without such alterations. Co-expression and functional enrichment analyses indicated that CD70 is functionally related to tumor necrosis factor receptor binding and the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that CD70 expression levels were negatively correlated with B cell and NK cell infiltration in DLBCL. In conclusion, this study suggests that CD70 is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for DLBCL. Our findings provide valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting CD70 in DLBCL treatment.","author":"Kang Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3d5afbcdebdbabfe588adcf6957d128604576359888a5eccce969dbc997a923a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
