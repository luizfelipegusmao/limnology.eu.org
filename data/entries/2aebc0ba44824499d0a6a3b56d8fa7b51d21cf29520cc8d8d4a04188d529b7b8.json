{"title":"A transthyretin-like protein acts downstream of miR397 and LACCASE to regulate grain yield in rice","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2893/7670733?rss=1","date":1715558400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Increasing grain yield is a major goal of breeders due to the rising global demand for food. We previously reported that the miR397–LACCASE (OsLAC) module regulates brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and grain yield in rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>). However, the precise roles of laccase enzymes in the BR pathway remain unclear. Here, we report that OsLAC controls grain yield by preventing the turnover of TRANSTHYRETIN-LIKE (OsTTL), a negative regulator of BR signaling. Overexpressing <span>OsTTL</span> decreased BR sensitivity in rice, while loss-of-function of OsTTL led to enhanced BR signaling and increased grain yield. OsLAC directly binds to OsTTL and regulates its phosphorylation-mediated turnover. The phosphorylation site Ser226 of OsTTL is essential for its ubiquitination and degradation. Overexpressing the dephosphorylation-mimic form of OsTTL (OsTTL<sup>S226A</sup>) resulted in more severe defects than did overexpressing OsTTL. These findings provide insight into the role of an ancient laccase in BR signaling and suggest that the OsLAC<strong>–</strong>OsTTL module could serve as a target for improving grain yield.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"2aebc0ba44824499d0a6a3b56d8fa7b51d21cf29520cc8d8d4a04188d529b7b8","category":"Environment"}
