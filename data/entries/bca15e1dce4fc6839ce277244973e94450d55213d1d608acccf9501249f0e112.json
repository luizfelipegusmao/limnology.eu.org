{"title":"SAQ training on sprint, change-of-direction speed, and agility in U-20 female football players","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299204","date":1710338400000,"content":"<p>by Young-Soo Lee, Dayoung Lee, Na Young Ahn</p>\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of an 8-week speed, agility, and quickness (SAQ) training on performance changes in linear sprint speed, change-of-direction (COD) speed, and reactive agility of U-20 female football players. Nineteen female football players randomly served as either experimental (<i>n</i> = 9) or control groups (<i>n</i> = 10). The players were tested for physical fitness tests: linear sprint speed including both short and long distances (5- and 10-m sprints without a ball and 20- and 30-m sprints with and without dribbling), COD speed (arrowhead agility test with and without dribbling a ball, Southeast Missouri [SEMO] agility test, and 22-m repeated slalom dribbling test), and reactive agility. Significant group Ã— time interactions were observed for sprint over long distances and COD speed but not for short sprint and reactive agility performances. Paired t-tests revealed considerable improvements in all performances from the pre-test to post-test for the SAQ group, except for the arrowhead agility (left; <i>p</i> = .07). The control group only exhibited significant improvements in 10-m sprint performance after general football training. Eight weeks of SAQ training were effective at enhancing acceleration, maximum sprint speed, and agility performances amongst highly trained U-20 female football players.","author":"Young-Soo Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bca15e1dce4fc6839ce277244973e94450d55213d1d608acccf9501249f0e112","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
