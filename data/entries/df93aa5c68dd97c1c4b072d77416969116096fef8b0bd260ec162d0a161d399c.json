The thermal stability of this interface is particularly pertinent in emerging microelectronic and plasmonic devices which are subject to local thermal changes during manufacture or in use. Here, we study a 2D-metal contact designed to withstand such temperature changes by minimising dewetting. The contact is based on nanoislands deposited on 2D materials under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, producing reproducible, epitaxial interfaces between the 3D islands and 2D materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.777-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"df93aa5c68dd97c1c4b072d77416969116096fef8b0bd260ec162d0a161d399c","category":"Environment"}
