{"title":"Burden of leprosy and associated risk factors for disabilities in Tanzania from 2017 to 2020","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311676","date":1728568800000,"content":"<p>by George Mrema, Ally Hussein, Welema Magoge, Vida Mmbaga, Azma Simba, Robert Balama, Emmanuel Nkiligi, Paul Shunda, Deus Kamara, Riziki Kisonga, Gideon Kwesigabo</p>\r\nBackground <p>Leprosy is caused by <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> which affects skin, nerves, eyes, and nasal mucosa. Despite global elimination efforts, Tanzania remains among 13 countries reporting more than 1000 leprosy cases annually. In 2021, Tanzania identified 1,511 new cases, with 10% having grade II disability. Moreover, 14 councils recorded leprosy rates exceeding 10 cases per 100,000 population. This study aimed to assess the burden of leprosy and associated risk factors for disabilities in Tanzania from 2017 to 2020.</p> Methodology <p>A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate all registered treated leprosy patients from January 2017 to December 2020. The Leprosy Burden Score (LBS) was used to assess the disease burden, while binary logistic regression was employed to evaluate the risk factors for disability.</p> Result <p>A total of 6,963 leprosy cases were identified from 2017 to 2020. During this period, the point prevalence of leprosy declined from 0.32 to 0.25 per 10,000 people, and the new case detection rate decreased from 3.1 to 2.4 per 100,000 people; however, these changes were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). Independent risk factors for leprosy-related disabilities included male sex (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.38, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.22–1.57), age 15 years and above (AOR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.60–3.67), previous treatment history (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.69–2.82), and positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status (AOR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.11–2.30).</p> Conclusion <p>This study identified male sex, older age, positive HIV status, and prior treatment history as independent risk factors for leprosy-related disabilities. Additionally, despite the observed decline in point prevalence and new case detection rates, these changes were not statistically significant. To address leprosy-related disabilities, it is crucial to implement specific prevention strategies that focus on high-risk groups. This can be accomplished by enhancing screening and contact tracing efforts for early patient identification to prevent delays in intervention. Further research is warranted to analyze the burden of leprosy over a more extended period and to explore additional risk factors not covered in this study.</p>","author":"George Mrema","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6adc96a8ebc2cd14bb0a8c0ac6a25a2d5ddb831138fa599202f1df7ae792d93d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
