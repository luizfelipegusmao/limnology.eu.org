Taking into account factors such as neutral type, fractional-order integrals, and fractional-order derivatives, we employ probability density functions, Laplace transforms, and resolvent operators to formulate a well-defined concept of a mild solution for the specified equation. Following this, by integrating fixed point theorems, we establish the existence of mild solutions under more relaxed conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2824fecd677537d555265e236ce042f91499f89c04377b87689d09c3aef0826c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
