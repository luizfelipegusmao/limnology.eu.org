{"title":"Classification of Kudoa thyrsites infected and uninfected fish using a handheld near‐infrared spectrophotometer, SIMCA and PLS‐DA","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14025?af=R","date":1728280157000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Kudoa thyrsites</i> infection of marine fish typically results in myoliquefaction, which is only apparent 24 to 56 h <i>post-mortem</i>. The traditional methods for the detection of <i>K. thyrsites</i> infected fish are time-consuming and destructive, reducing its marketability. This poses a challenge for the fish industry to remove infected fish before it reaches the market or further processing activities. This study investigated the use of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, in combination with soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), for discriminating <i>K. thyrsites</i> infected fish from uninfected fish. Performance of the classification models was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity and precision. A total of 334 fish samples (200 sardine, 64 hake and 70 kingklip) were used for this study. Infection of <i>K. thyrsites</i> was determined with the use of qPCR assays. Ninety per cent (90%) of the sardine samples, 78% of the hake samples and 37% of the kingklip samples were infected. Class groups of infected and uninfected fish samples were created for the purpose of generating SIMCA and PLS-DA classification models for each species of fish, as well as for a species independent data set. Principal component analysis (PCA) of NIR spectra did not show any clustering for infected and uninfected samples. Calibration and test sample sets were generated for the purpose of building and testing the SIMCA and PLD-DA classification models. SIMCA and PLS-DA were unable to classify test samples correctly into the two classes. The number of misclassifications (NMC) was higher for the SIMCA models than for the PLS-DA models, with more than 60% incorrectly classified. SIMCA classified most of the test samples into both classes. The precision for PLS-DA were 89% for sardine, 81% for hake, 0% for kingklip and 87% for species independent models, however, most samples were classified at infected. The use of NIR spectroscopy and classification models such as SIMCA and PLS-DA showed limited use as a method to distinguish between <i>K. thyrsites</i> infected and uninfected fish samples. Textural and chemical changes during extended frozen storage of the fish samples may have masked the effects associated with <i>K. thyrsites</i> infection. Further studies are suggested where NIR spectroscopy is used in combination with texture analysis and image spectroscopy.</p>","author":"S.
