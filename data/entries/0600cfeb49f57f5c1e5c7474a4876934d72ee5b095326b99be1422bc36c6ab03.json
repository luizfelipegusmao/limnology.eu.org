{"title":"Capillary Rise of Soluble Salts and Its Effect on the Degradation of Calcareous Material Used in Historical Monuments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2304/v1","date":1727598073000,"content":"Crystallization of soluble salts represents a significant deterioration mechanism for porous building materials in cultural heritage, with substantial economic consequences. These salts can originate from geogenic sources (such as soil leachate, sea salt aerosols, and material incompatibilities in historical constructions) or anthropogenic sources (including environmental pollution and organic waste). This study investigates the capillary rise of retained and sustained water within soil, which is subsequently absorbed by calcareous rocks in monuments. This process leads to a range of damages, from superficial staining and efflorescence to more severe material degradation and mass loss. The paper examines the capillary rise phenomenon and analyzes the typology and origin of salts that predominantly impact the durability and mechanical resistance of calcareous rocks used in the construction of historic buildings in Spain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0600cfeb49f57f5c1e5c7474a4876934d72ee5b095326b99be1422bc36c6ab03","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
