{"title":"Tropical Leaf Wax n‐Alkane and n‐Alkanoic Acid Reflect δD of Precipitation During Early Stages of Leaf Growth: Insights From an Isotope Labeling Experiment","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024PA004899?af=R","date":1727931017000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The hydrogen isotopic compositions of leaf-wax <i>n</i>-alkanes (δD<sub>alk</sub>) and <i>n</i>-alkanoic acids (δD<sub>acid</sub>) reflect ambient climatic conditions (including precipitation δD values, δD<sub>precip</sub>). However, the understanding of climatic conditions of exactly which period (i.e., early or entire period of the leaf's lifespan) these biomarkers preserve is still evolving. Previous studies on the δD<sub>alk</sub> and δD<sub>acid</sub> values, done only in extra-tropical regions, mostly indicate that δD<sub>alk</sub> values are biased toward the early growing season whereas δD<sub>acid</sub> values are not biased toward any season. To decipher the seasonal bias in δD<sub>alk</sub> and δD<sub>acid</sub> records from tropics, we conducted a long-duration experiment wherein deciduous and evergreen species were grown using normal water (δD = −2‰) during early stages of the leaf growth and later using isotopically labeled water (δD = 1,000‰). Our experiment revealed (a) in deciduous and evergreen species, δD<sub>alk</sub> and δD<sub>acid</sub> values reflect δD<sub>precip</sub> during early stages of the leaf growth, (b) synchronous synthesis of <i>n</i>-alkanes and <i>n</i>-alkanoic acids, and (c) in deciduous species, minor incorporation of the previous year's photosynthates in leaf wax pool of the current year's mature leaves. Our study suggests that δD<sub>alk</sub> and δD<sub>acid</sub> records in the tropics are biased toward the climatic conditions prevailing during early stages of leaf growth. This bias should be considered while comparing the δD<sub>precip</sub> values generated from leaf wax proxy records and isotope-enabled atmospheric circulation models.</p>","author":"Amrita Saishree, \nShreyas Managave, \nM.
