{"title":"Review of Integrated Gate Driver Circuits in Active Matrix Thin-Film Transistor Display Panels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2150/v1","date":1717150228000,"content":"Many advanced technologies have been employed in the high performance active matrix displays including liquid crystal displays, organic light emitting diode displays, and micro light emitting diode displays. On the other side, there have existed the strong demand on the cost reduction and it is one of low cost schemes to integrate the driver circuit in a panel based on thin film transistor technologies. This paper reviews overall concept, operation principles, and various circuit approaches in shift registers for the scanning pulse generation. In addition, it deals with the implementation of additional functionalities in gate drivers to support pixel compensation, multi-line driving, in-cell capacitive touch screen, pixel sensing, and adaptive scanning region control.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e1e9c0fefc0e3a572a5a19fc045c60688bf6767109d02a9cd3159f4f5eddf9c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
