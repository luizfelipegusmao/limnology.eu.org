{"title":"One-Dimensional Relativistic Self-Gravitating Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0782/v1","date":1718242801000,"content":"One of the oldest problems in physics is that of calculating the motion of N particles under a specified mutual force: the N-body problem. Much is known about this problem if the specified force is non-relativistic gravity, and considerable progress has been made by considering the problem in one spatial dimension. Here I review what is known about the relativistic gravitational N-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature that gravitational radiation is absent, thereby allowing for a clear comparison between the physics of one-dimensional relativistic and non-relativistic self-gravitating systems. After describing how to obtain a relativistic theory of gravity coupled to N point particles, I discuss in turn the 2-body, 3-body, 4-body, and N-body problems. Quite general exact solutions can be obtained for the 2-body problem, unlike the situation in general relativity in 3 spatial dimensions for which only highly specified solutions exist. The 3-body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relativistic chaos can be studied. For N4 other interesting features emerge. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring relativistic many-body systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a48ced3f4cb358c94319748a48e819bbbdfbe6988603ebb94430624908404f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
