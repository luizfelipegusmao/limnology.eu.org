{"title":"Cotton Fabric-Reinforced Hydrogels with Excellent Mechanical and Broad-Spectrum Photothermal Antibacterial Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0743/v1","date":1712756893000,"content":"Hydrogel wound dressings hold great potential in eliminating bacteria and accelerating the healing process. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate hydrogel wound dressings that simultaneously exhibit excellent mechanical and photothermal antibacterial properties. Here we report the development of polydopamine-functionalized graphene oxide/calcium alginate/Polypyrrole cotton fabric-reinforced hydrogels (abbreviated as rGO@PDA/CA/PPy FHs) for tackling bacterial infections. The mechanical properties of hydrogels were greatly enhanced by cotton fabric reinforcement and an interpenetrating structure, while excellent broad-spectrum photothermal antibacterial properties based on the photothermal effect were obtained by incorporating PPy and rGO@PDA. Results indicated that rGO@PDA/CA/PPy FHs exhibited superior tensile strength in both the warp (289±62.1N) and weft directions (142±23.0N) similar to cotton fabric. By incorporating PPy and rGO@PDA, the swelling ratio was significantly decreased from 673.5% to 236.6%, while photothermal conversion performance was significantly enhanced with a temperature elevated to 45.0 ℃. Due to the synergistic photothermal properties of rGO@PDA and PPy, rGO@PDA/CA/PPy FHs exhibited excellent bacteria-eliminating efficiency for S. aureus (0.57%) and E. coli (3.58%) after exposure to NIR for 20 min. We believe that the design of fabric-reinforced hydrogels could serve as a guideline for developing hydrogel wound dressings with improved mechanical properties and broad-spectrum photothermal antibacterial properties for infected wound treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f76892a5f83ac89a99ee18802f3f17d11b19d195a14c343186795c8a81f31064","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
