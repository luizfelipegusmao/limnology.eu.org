However, certain processes of biology can be truly complex, making it challenging to quantify. Plant phenotyping is the science of characterizing plants' physiological, anatomical, or biochemical properties (<a href=\"#kiae387-B4\">Walter et al. 2015</a>). While some phenotypes arise purely from the genetic makeup of the plant, others may develop as a result of an organism's interactions with its environment, which is determined by various genetic and environmental factors (<a href=\"#kiae387-B3\">Pieruschka and Schurr 2019</a>). Therefore, certain plant phenotypes, like plant growth, are dynamic by nature and constantly build on feedback mechanisms between the environment and the organisms' genetic makeup. The “living” nature of these plant phenotypes, dependent on time and space, makes it particularly difficult for quantification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"88d58589ec49c74e8b2735a61cc4c83305200d46e5f2cb0d042be91cc9fa1739","category":"Environment"}
