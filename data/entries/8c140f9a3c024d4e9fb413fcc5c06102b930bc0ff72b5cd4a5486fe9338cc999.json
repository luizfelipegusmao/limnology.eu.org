{"title":"Improving Pitch Rate Control Performance of an F-16 Aircraft Using Fractional Order Direct-MRAC Adaptive Control Instead of Using the Classic Direct-MRAC Adaptive Control","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0595/v1","date":1712653087000,"content":": This paper presents a comparison between direct integer orders or classical model reference adaptive control (IO-DMRAC) versus its fractional orders counterpart (FO-DMRAC) applied to the F-16 aircraft longitudinal model pitch rate control. A substantial improvement is achieved when using fractional order adaptive control, since, in addition to performance indices, such as Integral Square-Error criterion (ISE) and Integral Square-Input criterion (ISU) being lower, the oscillations of the system output (pitch rate) in the transient period, are eliminated. Moreover, it is the first attempt in literature of adaptive control that a FO-DMRAC is applied to the pitch rate control of an aircraft. A F-16 short-period model, whose relative degree is equal to 1 (n^*=1) is analyzed by mean of simulations with good results. A FO-DMRAC is designed, for a specific operating flight conditions and compared with its IO-DMRAC counterpart. Furthermore, the boundedness of all signals, including the internal ones Ï‰(t) are assured.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c140f9a3c024d4e9fb413fcc5c06102b930bc0ff72b5cd4a5486fe9338cc999","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
