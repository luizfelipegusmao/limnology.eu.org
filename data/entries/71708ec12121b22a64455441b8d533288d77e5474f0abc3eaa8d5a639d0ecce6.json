{"title":"Advances in Compounds Targeting Regulatory Mechanisms of Biofilm Formation in Unicellular Eukaryotes: Insights from 2024 Research and Applications in Vietnam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1406/v1","date":1726656608000,"content":"Biofilm formation by unicellular eukaryotes presents major challenges in healthcare, agriculture, and food industries, primarily due to enhanced resistance to environmental stressors and antimicrobial agents. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of biofilm formation, such as quorum sensing (QS) and cyclic di-GMP signaling, has led to the discovery of novel compounds that can inhibit biofilm development. In 2024, significant advancements were made in identifying compounds like betulinic acid, methyl anthranilate, and pulmonarin B analogues that target these pathways. This review explores the potential applications of these compounds, especially in Vietnam's agriculture and food industries, where biofilm formation contributes to contamination and antimicrobial resistance. The findings underscore the global relevance of biofilm-disrupting technologies and their role in combating biofilm-associated infections and resistance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71708ec12121b22a64455441b8d533288d77e5474f0abc3eaa8d5a639d0ecce6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
