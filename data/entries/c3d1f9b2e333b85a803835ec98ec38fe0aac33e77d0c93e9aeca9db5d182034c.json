However, analysis of XAS/EELS data often relies on matching the spectra of an unknown experimental sample to a series of simulated or experimental spectra of standard samples. This limits analysis throughput and the ability to extract quantitative information from a sample.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c3d1f9b2e333b85a803835ec98ec38fe0aac33e77d0c93e9aeca9db5d182034c","category":"Environment"}
