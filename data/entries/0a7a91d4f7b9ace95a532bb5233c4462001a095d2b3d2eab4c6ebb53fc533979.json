{"title":"Bridging the Gap: Public Perception and Acceptance of Hydrogen Technology in the Philippines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1711/v2","date":1727775910000,"content":"The study examines the effects of transitioning to hydrogen production in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Palawan Province, Philippines, focusing on technology, environment, and stakeholder impact. The research, conducted through a July 2022 survey, aimed to assess public awareness, knowledge, risk perception, and acceptance of hydrogen and its environmentally friendly variant, green hydrogen, infrastructure. Disparities were found between urban NCR and rural Palawan, with lower awareness in Palawan. Safety concerns were highlighted, with NCR respondents generally considering hydrogen production safe, while Palawan respondents had mixed feelings, particularly regarding nuclear-based hydrogen generation. The report emphasizes the potential ecological advantages of hydrogen technology but highlights potential issues concerning water usage and land impacts. It suggests targeted public awareness campaigns, robust safety assurance programs, regional pilot projects, and integrated environmental plans to facilitate the seamless integration of hydrogen technology into the Philippines' energy portfolio. This collective effort aims to help the country meet climate action obligations, foster sustainable development, and enhance energy resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0a7a91d4f7b9ace95a532bb5233c4462001a095d2b3d2eab4c6ebb53fc533979","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
