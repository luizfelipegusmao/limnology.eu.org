{"title":"Variations &amp;amp; Claims in International Construction Contracts (FIDIC) from Statistical Perspective in MENA Region for the Last Decade","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2016/v1","date":1714529048000,"content":"This study delves into the dynamics of 'Variations' and 'Claims' within construction projects, specifically under the FIDIC-Red Book 1999 (FIDIC 1999) framework. It aims to identify, categorize, and devise mitigation strategies for key types of Variations and Claims, aligning with the FIDIC Conditions of Contract. The research, drawing on inputs from construction industry professionals including Contract Administrators and Project Managers, focuses on the MENA re-gion. This choice is driven by the region's extensive adoption of FIDIC standards and its rapidly growing construction sector.\nData collection encompassed a questionnaire distributed to 80 industry experts, predominantly through interviews, focusing on countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Egypt. These locations were chosen to reflect diverse construction practices and the involvement of international firms. Utilizing SPSS-V.25 for statistical analysis, the study uncovers the most prevalent and impactful causes of Variations and Claims, highlighting the critical need for managerial intervention.\nA key feature of this study is the integration of Scientometric Analysis for a quantitative review of current literature, providing a comprehensive academic context. A significant addition to the methodology is the implementation of a k-means clustering analysis. This advanced statistical technique further classifies the data into distinct clusters, each representing unique combinations of 'Frequency' and 'Impact' of Variations and Claims. The k-means analysis elucidates intricate patterns and potential solutions, offering profound insights into effectively managing these issues. These analytical advancements are crucial in identifying significant and manageable responses to reduce the frequency and impact of Variations and Claims in construction projects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e224458400bed0609f96226f871041ddac95b25f60ce99f63f07ebc4f18d3e41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
