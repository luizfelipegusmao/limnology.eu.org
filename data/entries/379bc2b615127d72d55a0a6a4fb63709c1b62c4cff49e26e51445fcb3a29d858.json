{"title":"Widespread occurrence of Tilapia parvovirus in farmed Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus from India","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13871?af=R","date":1697019039000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Tilapia parvovirus (TiPV) has been associated with heavy mortalities in tilapia as a single infection or in co-infection with Tilapia lake virus (TiLV). In this study, TiPV was detected in farmed Nile tilapia, <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>, from two geographical regions of India, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. TiPV-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported earlier was used in the screening. Tilapia collected from Maharashtra showed characteristic clinical signs, and TiPV was detected along with TiLV and/or <i>Aeromonas</i> spp. However, fish from Uttar Pradesh were apparently healthy and only TiPV could be detected in these samples. A high prevalence of TiPV was recorded from both the geographical locations, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh (59.6% and 95.0% respectively). The virus could be detected in tissues such as the spleen, liver, kidney, brain and mucus. The spleen appeared to be the best tissue for detecting TiPV in apparently healthy tilapia. The presence of TiPV was further confirmed through sequencing the PCR products, isolation of the virus in the cell line and electron microscopy. Sequences of the NS1 gene of the two TiPV isolates showed similarity to the earlier reported TiPV isolates. The virus could be successfully propagated in <i>O. niloticus</i> Liver (OnL) cell line, and cytopathic effect was observed as early as 3 days post-infection. Furthermore, the presence of non-enveloped icosahedral to round virus particles measuring about 26–35 nm could be demonstrated in the cytoplasm and nucleus of infected OnL cells in transmission electron microscopy. With this confirmation of the presence of the virus, India is the third country to report TiPV after China and Thailand. The detection of TiPV in co-infection cases with TiLV and in apparently healthy Nile tilapia suggests its wide distribution and potential synergistic effect in co-infection cases. Therefore, this emerging virus needs holistic attention to understand its virulence, host-specificity and epidemiological risk factors.</p>","author":"Kooloth Valappil Rajendran, \nNeeraj Sood, \nB.
