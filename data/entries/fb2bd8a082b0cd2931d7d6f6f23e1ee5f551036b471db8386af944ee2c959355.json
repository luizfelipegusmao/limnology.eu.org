{"title":"Factors Contributing to Alzheimer's Disease in Older Adult Populations: A Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1892/v1","date":1719406904000,"content":"Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, predominantly affecting older adults. Understanding the multifaceted factors contributing to AD is crucial for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. This narrative review synthesizes current literature on the various factors influencing the development and progression of AD in older adult populations.Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO using relevant keywords such as \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"risk factors,\" \"genetics,\" \"environmental factors,\" and \"lifestyle.\" Studies published between 2000 and 2023 were included, focusing on factors associated with AD in individuals aged 65 years and older.Results: The review identified several key factors contributing to AD in older adults. Genetic predisposition, particularly the presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele, emerged as a significant risk factor. Environmental factors such as air pollution, pesticides, and heavy metals were also implicated. Furthermore, lifestyle factors including physical inactivity, poor diet, and smoking were associated with increased AD risk. Chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were found to exacerbate cognitive decline in older adults.Conclusion: This narrative review highlights the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease among older adults. Understanding these factors is crucial for targeted interventions aimed at reducing AD risk and improving cognitive health outcomes in aging populations. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and personalized medicine approaches to elucidate specific mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and to develop effective preventive strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb2bd8a082b0cd2931d7d6f6f23e1ee5f551036b471db8386af944ee2c959355","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
