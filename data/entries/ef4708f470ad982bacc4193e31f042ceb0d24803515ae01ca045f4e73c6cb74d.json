{"title":"451 Establishing producer research sites for the development of beef and bison climate-smart agriculture","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/305/7757365?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and livestock production are topics that are increasingly intertwined. While livestock production is frequently presented as harmful to the environment, this perception fails to consider the carbon sequestration that takes place in livestock grazing systems and the role that grazing ruminants have in maintaining healthy grassland ecosystems. Grazing lands, which are often unsuited to row crop agriculture, are estimated to account for 25% of the global soil sequestration potential for soil carbon storage. Grazing livestock producers are often overlooked in the GHG reduction conversation, despite over 70% of beef GHG emissions being attributed to the cow-calf sector, which is primarily grazing. Furthermore, there is a relative lack of data surrounding the implementation of climate-smart agriculture practices on grazing operations and a lack of cost-effective methods to measure carbon/GHG sinks and sources on these landscapes. The potential climate benefits are considerable, with nearly 940 million acres of rangelands in the U.S. supporting forage-based livestock production. South Dakota State University recently received funding to support a large-scale climate-smart project focused on grazing beef and bison. For this project, we are utilizing the Cottonwood Field Station that has over 80 yr of historical grazing data, along with six grazing beef and bison ranching operations in the Northern Great Plains. The work on these ranches will focus on measuring and monitoring the impacts of climate-smart NRCS land practices, including cover crops, improved pasture and range seedings, prescribed grazing, and prescribed burning. A significant focus will be extensive, annual soil sampling across these operations to continuously monitor changes in soil organic carbon, bulk density, texture, pH, and soil microbiome community profiles. Each operation will have GreenFeed methane pasture units deployed for 5 yr to monitor changes in beef cattle and bison methane emissions in response to climate-smart practice adoption. We are also assessing biodiversity pre and post climate-smart practice adoption, as biodiversity improvements may be one of the most overlooked and yet most important responses to climate-smart land practice implementation. Over the duration of this project, a large-scale, comprehensive data collection will be achieved and used to refine GHG and carbon sequestration estimates associated with range livestock systems. Data resulting from this project will be used to inform research protocols and prediction models, fill knowledge gaps, and shape science-based discussions and marketing strategies for climate-smart agricultural commodities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"ef4708f470ad982bacc4193e31f042ceb0d24803515ae01ca045f4e73c6cb74d","category":"Environment"}
