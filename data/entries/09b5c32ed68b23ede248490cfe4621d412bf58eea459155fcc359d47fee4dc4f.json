{"title":"Barley Seed Germination and Seedling Growth Responses to PEG-Induced Drought Stress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0723/v1","date":1725948774000,"content":"Drought negatively affects the growth and development of barley. To explore the genetic variation in barley under drought stress, ten breeding genotypes were tested using polyethylene glycol-6000 to simulate drought conditions. We observed that drought stress adversely affected germination-related traits across all barley genotypes and this impact varied between genotypes, suggesting genotype-specific drought tolerance. The drought tolerance index was an ideal criterion for selecting drought-tolerant genotypes as it well characterized the gradient responses of barely genotypes to drought stress. Based on this indicator, genotype OB1878-ON-50 is recommended as a significant germplasm resource for breeding programs under lower precipitation conditions due to its superior tolerance to drought stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09b5c32ed68b23ede248490cfe4621d412bf58eea459155fcc359d47fee4dc4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
