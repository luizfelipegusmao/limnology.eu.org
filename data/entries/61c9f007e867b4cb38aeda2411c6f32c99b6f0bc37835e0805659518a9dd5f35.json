{"title":"Equitable evaluation of supply-demand and layout optimization of urban park green space in high-density linear large city","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310015","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Shibao Yu, Peng Zeng, Xiaoling Xie, Dandan Chen</p>\r\n\r\nEquitable and effective planning of urban park green spaces (UPGSs) is an important way to promote green and healthy urban development and improve citizens’ quality of life. However, under the background of rapid urbanization, linear large cities, with their unique spatial forms and high-density population agglomerations, have brought special challenges for the planning and management of urban public green spaces. This study takes Lanzhou, a typical representative of high-density linear large cities in China, as a case study. Based on the improvement of the traditional Gaussian Two-Step Floating Catchment Area method (G2SFCA), combined with the Gini coefficient and the Lorentz curve, the social equity and spatial equity of UPGS supply-demand in the central urban area of Lanzhou were evaluated at the city and district scales. Meanwhile, the areas with shortage of UPGS supply-demand were accurately identified as the key areas for future optimization. The results show that: (1) There are significant differences in the equity of UPGS supply-demand in the linear large Lanzhou at the social and spatial levels, and most UPGS resources are enjoyed by a few people; (2) The spatial accessibility of UPGSs has an obvious “string of beads” distribution Characteristics, and the areas with high accessibility are mainly concentrated along rivers; (3) The equity of UPGS supply-demand exhibits a spatial gradient effect, which is characterized by a circle distribution. From the inside to the outside, it is as follows: good supply—dense population, good supply—sparse population, supply shortage—dense population, supply shortage—sparse population. Finally, based on the concept of “progressive micro-regeneration” and the Location Allocation model (LA), the optimal sites for new UPGSs were determined, maximizing the equity of UPGS supply-demand. This provides a practical reference for relevant management departments to optimize park layouts in the future.","author":"Shibao Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"61c9f007e867b4cb38aeda2411c6f32c99b6f0bc37835e0805659518a9dd5f35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
