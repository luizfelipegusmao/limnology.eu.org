{"title":"Ameliorative Potential of Bone Marrow–Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Versus Prednisolone in a Rat Model of Lung Fibrosis: A Histological, Immunohistochemical, and Biochemical Study","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/3/539/7675988?rss=1","date":1715904000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease of unknown origin with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. The encouraging findings from preclinical investigations utilizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) indicated that they could serve as a promising therapeutic alternative for managing chronic lung conditions, such as IPF. The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of bone marrow–derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) versus prednisolone, the standard anti-inflammatory medication, in rats with bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis. Four groups were created: a control group, a BLM group, a prednisolone-treated group, and a BM-MSCs-treated group. To induce lung fibrosis, 5 mg/kg of BLM was administered intratracheally. BLM significantly increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers. The disturbed lung structure was also revealed by light and transmission electron microscopic studies. Upregulation in the immune expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and Bax was demonstrated. Interestingly, all findings significantly regressed on treatment with prednisolone and BM-MSCs. However, treatment with BM-MSCs showed better results than with prednisolone. In conclusion, BM-MSCs could be a promising approach for managing lung fibrosis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2158c16465baae4d1874c1408f91f4b8bf9addf01af03c46757652e0c67d8c9d","category":"Environment"}
