{"title":"Effect of Proton Irradiation in Thin-Film YBa2Cu3O7-δ Superconductor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0606/v1","date":1723130866000,"content":"We investigated the effect of 0.6 MeV proton irradiation on the superconducting and normal state properties of thin-film YBa2Cu3O7−δ superconductors. A thin-film YBCO superconductor (≈ 567 nm thick) was subject to a series of proton irradiations with a total fluence of 7.6×1016p/cm2. Upon irradiation, Tc was drastically decreased from 89.3 K towards zero with a corresponding increase in its normal state resistivity above Tc. This increase in resistivity which indicates the increase of defects inside the thin-film sample can be converted to the dimensionless scattering rate. We found that the relation between Tc and dimensionless scattering rate obtained during proton irradiation approximates the generalized d-wave Abrikosov-Gor’kov theory better than the previous results obtained from electron irradiations. This is an unexpected result since the electron irradiation is known to be most effective to suppress superconductivity over other heavier ion irradiations such as proton irradiation. It suggests that the type of defects created by proton irradiation evolves from cascade defects (in bulk single crystals) to point-like defects (in thin-film single crystals) as the thickness decreases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d6613fe6223b5d51ef152309cf56b3984f0cc32b212c409a99691227a174406","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
