{"title":"A Trandisciplinary Overview about the Electronic Nose","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0570/v1","date":1720422262000,"content":"The mechanism by which the human nose perceives an odor is complex and involves various chemical reactions in the transformation of the odorous molecule into an electrical impulse sent to the brain that returns the sensation of smell. The smell is classified and quantified, and its instrumental detection can be carried out through the “electronic nose”, an interactive device that lends itself to various applications. In the agri-food sector, the development of portable devices makes possible to smell foods and measure their level of deterioration and maturation; this is undoubtedly useful for reducing waste, identifying the best moment for food consumption, and improving the level of food safety. With regard to the environmental compatibility of materials and techniques for packing and laying conglomerates (for example bituminous), the problem of olfactory nuisance for the population residing in the neighborhood is still an unresolved problem. The approach based on electronic noses is very effective. The electronic nose also represents an important resource in the screening of respiratory pathologies, where there is the need to identify a rapid and reliable diagnostic test for pathologies such as pneumonia or seasonal flu. Environmental monitoring of pollutants is of particular relevance today and the electronic nose is an important candidate for the use in this field. The gas sensor market leverages physics, chemistry and materials engineering to develop highly sensitive, reliable and stable sensor platforms, capable of detecting very small amounts of gas molecules in the environment. To develop competitive gas sensing platforms, new materials are being considered, including polymers, nanostructured metal oxides and nanostructured carbon-based materials (CNTs). In addition to the experimental aspects, in particular Raman and electron spectroscopy techniques together with atomic force microscopy, theoretical-mathematical modeling plays an extremely important role in this sector, with particular attention to the case of micro and nanometric dimensions. Many efforts are now aimed in improving the sensitivity of these devices and this is related to the diffusion of carriers in them. The paper also offers an overview of the mathematical models relating to mechanical processes and dynamics at the micro-nanometric scale, lastly focusing on the Drude-Lorentz type models, with related more recent generalizations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58b34b551ae2dfbc248dc025d205e3684daa21a4c97db4b6304b84a63bcbd1f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
