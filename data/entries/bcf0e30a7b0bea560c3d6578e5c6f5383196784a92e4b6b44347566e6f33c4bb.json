Field evaporation is initiated by either pulsing the electric field (voltage-pulse, VP mode) or the specimen temperature via a pico-second laser pulse (LP mode). Fundamental field-evaporation characteristics of model materials (mainly metals) have been studied and reported over the years [<a href=\"#ozae044.053-B2\">2</a>], but few modern studies have attempted to expand understanding using modern instrumentation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bcf0e30a7b0bea560c3d6578e5c6f5383196784a92e4b6b44347566e6f33c4bb","category":"Environment"}
