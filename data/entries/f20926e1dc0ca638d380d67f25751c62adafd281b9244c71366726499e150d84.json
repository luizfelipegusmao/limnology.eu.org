{"title":"Investigating the Effects of Fast Charging and Flash Charging Protocols on Battery Health and Economic Viability in Electric Buses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0212/v1","date":1719908105000,"content":"Transportation contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, with electrification offering a promising solution. This study evaluates the degradation of State of Health (SOH) over 2.5 years for electrified buses under different charging protocols: DC Fast charging and Flash charging. The vehicles’ models, charging protocols, and financial implications are discussed. High-level simulations reveal that after 2.5 years, the Flash charging vehicle’s SOH reaches 88.93%, while the DC fast charging vehicle reaches 89.46%, showing a 0.47% difference. This slight variance is attributed to Flash charging vehicles avoiding full charge/discharge cycles, reducing battery aging impact.\nConsidering this minimal SOH degradation difference, the choice between DC Fast charging and Flash charging primarily hinges on capital expenditure disparities. Flash charging, with its lower initial battery capacity and reduced capital costs, presents a compelling alternative for city busoperators seeking to electrify their fleets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f20926e1dc0ca638d380d67f25751c62adafd281b9244c71366726499e150d84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
