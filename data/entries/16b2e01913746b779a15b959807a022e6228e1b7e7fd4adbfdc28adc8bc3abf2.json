{"title":"Immunotherapy For PD and AD: A Promising Disease Modifying Therapy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2156/v1","date":1721993294000,"content":"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) are two neurodegenerative diseases posing a significant disease burden due to their increasing prevalence and socio-economic cost. Traditional therapeutic approaches for these diseases exist but provide limited symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying pathologies. This review examines the potential of immunotherapy, specifically monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as disease-modifying treatments for AD and PD. We analyze the pathological mechanisms of AD and PD, focusing on the roles of amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau (τ), and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) proteins. We discuss the latest advancements in mAbs therapies targeting these proteins, evaluating their efficacy in clinical trials and preclinical studies. We also explore the challenges faced in translating these therapies from bench to bedside, including issues related to safety, specificity, and clinical trial design. Additionally, we highlight future directions for research, emphasizing the need for combination therapies, improved biomarkers, and personalized treatment strategies. This review aims to provide insights into the current state and future potential of antibody-based immunotherapy in modifying the course of AD and PD, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16b2e01913746b779a15b959807a022e6228e1b7e7fd4adbfdc28adc8bc3abf2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
