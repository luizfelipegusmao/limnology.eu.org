{"title":"Strategies and Actions&rsquo; Definition for the New Territorial Government Plan of Voghera, Italy: Towards a Healthier City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0463/v1","date":1715157273000,"content":"Cities require flexible and participatory planning methodologies to address complex and evolving urban challenges. In Italy, the legislative framework is defined at the Regional level, according to the National laws and jurisprudence. The Lombardy region introduced the Planning Document (PD) in the Territorial Government Plan (PGT), as a strategic tool capable of adapting to changes. Based on a strategic vision, this document is useful to guide concrete actions for urban transformation, actively involving stakeholders, including citizens. The PD has the role to translate the political program into an urban planning design. So, the role it has is both technical and political. The political dimension is usually deepened in the strategic component of the document. Following the formation process of the whole city plan, the authors define the key strategies in the PD for a healthier urban future for the city of Voghera. It emerges as a balanced urban development that combines economic growth, environmental preservation, and community well-being. In the paper the authors synthesize the Vogheraâ€™s PD as an example of strategic planning that interacts with the practical planning actions and that guides both the public and the private decisions about the city development towards a healthier city.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a98876f4cf94fe704895d74e3137018805b1473cc4668a634acd4bab7bc17b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
