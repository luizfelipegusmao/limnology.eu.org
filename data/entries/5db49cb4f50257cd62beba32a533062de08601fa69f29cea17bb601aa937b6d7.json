{"title":"Noncharismatic species also need protection | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado4937","date":1714654860000,"content":"Global biodiversity decline is a pressing environmental challenge in the 21st century (1), and both international platforms, such as the United Nations Conference of the Parties (2), and regional development plans [e.g., (3)] focus on biodiversity conservation. However, because of the public appeal of charismatic species, research resources are predominantly invested in birds and mammals (4) and often exclude noncharismatic species, such as fish, insects, and plants. Contrary to perceptions, the ecological and economic consequences of noncharismatic species are often substantial. Researchers must study noncharismatic species to inform balanced biodiversity goals (5).","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"5db49cb4f50257cd62beba32a533062de08601fa69f29cea17bb601aa937b6d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
