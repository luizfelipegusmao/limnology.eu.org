{"title":"A Comparative Analysis of Na&iuml;ve Exosomes and Enhanced Exosomes with a Focus on the Treatment Potential in Ovarian Disorders","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0003/v1","date":1711958002000,"content":"Exosome-based therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing diverse disorders, indicating the need for further exploration of the potential therapeutic effects of the exosome cargos. This study introduces \"enhanced exosomes,\" a novel type of exosomes developed through a novel cell culture system. These specific exosomes may become potent therapeutic agents for treating ovarian disorders. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the protein and miRNA cargo compositions of enhanced exosomes and na√Øve exosomes. Our findings revealed distinct cargo compositions in enhanced exosomes, featuring upregulated proteins such as EFEMP1, HTRA1, PAM, RSU1, and SDF4, suggesting their potential for treating ovarian disorders. MicroRNA profiling revealed that miR-1-3p, miR-103a-3p, miR-122-5p, miR-1271-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-184, miR-203a-3p, and miR-206 are key players in regulating ovarian cancer and chemosensitivity by affecting cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and cell development. We examined polycystic ovary syndrome and premature ovarian insufficiency and identified altered expression of various miRNAs, such as miR-106a-5p, miR-130b-5p, and miR-130b-3p, for diagnostic insights. This study highlights the potential of enhanced exosomes as new therapeutic agents for women's reproductive health, offering a detailed understanding of the impact of their cargo on ovarian disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b9bb36a65c5db89c4cc02f1b6e15d6b7b1ba5a754474dc8841ce3f04c9a6995","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
