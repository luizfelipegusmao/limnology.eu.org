{"title":"Post-Pandemic Comparative Analysis of Quality of Life and Declared Physical Activity in Individuals With and Without Osteoarthritis.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0086/v1","date":1722512020000,"content":"This study aimed to compare the levels of physical activity and quality of life reported by Chileans with and without osteoarthritis (OA). Educational level and monthly income data were collected from eighty-two participants (62 women and 20 men), of whom 41 had OA. Concerning the medical information of the persons suffering from OA, diseases, and date of diagnosis were indicated. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and its Elderly version (IPAQ-E) estimated physical activity levels. The Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) assessed health-related quality of life. The findings indicate that non-OA subjects scored higher on all dimensions of the SF-36, including physical function, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role, and mental health. Individuals with OA reported better physical function and role, general health, vitality, social function, and mental health when they walked more. However, no associations were found between any physical activity levels and the degree of pain in people with OA. Our findings underscore the critical role of investigating physical activity in OA patients to enhance their quality of life, particularly in light of the increased sedentary behavior observed post-pandemic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f89743f484b556c98d0cf2d3b656847fcf1496b092bbf7a299f7f2d2578d0e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
