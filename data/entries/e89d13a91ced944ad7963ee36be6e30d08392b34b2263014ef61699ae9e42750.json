{"title":"Research on Large-Scale Urban 3D Geological Modeling &ndash; A Case Study of Wuhan Metropolitan Development Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1279/v1","date":1721127371000,"content":"Three-dimensional (3D) geological modeling technology offers intricate geological information services and technical support for the research of urban geological conditions and their evolutionary mechanisms. It further facilitates the analysis of environmental geological problems, encompassing their distinguishing features and genetic mechanisms. The precision of such three-dimensional models is predominantly influenced by the caliber of modeling data, the chosen modeling methodologies, and the intricacy of the modeled geological objects. This research, exemplified by the three-dimensional geological structure modeling of the Wuhan metropolitan development area, aims to explore a comprehensive three-dimensional modeling framework for urban geology, particularly in scenarios with large-scale and complex geological conditions. This study holds significant technical value in enhancing the application of 3D geological modeling, as well as practical importance for urban geological investigations and research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e89d13a91ced944ad7963ee36be6e30d08392b34b2263014ef61699ae9e42750","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
