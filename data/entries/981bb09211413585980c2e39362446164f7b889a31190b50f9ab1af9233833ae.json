{"title":"A Novel Adjoint Based Reduced Order Model for Depletion Calculations in Nuclear Reactor Physics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1682/v1","date":1711545134000,"content":"The licensing of new reactors implies the use of verified and validated neutronics codes. Numerical validation can rely on sensitivity and uncertainty studies but they require repeated execution of time-consuming neutron flux and depletion calculations. The computational costs can be shortened by using perturbation theories. However, Depletion Perturbation Theory is restricted to single integral values such as a nuclide density. Relying on reduced basis approaches, which reconstruct the whole nuclide densities at once, is one way to get around this restriction. Furthermore, the adjoint-based reduced-order model uses the direct and adjoint equations for the projection. For diffusion or transport calculations, Exact-to-Precision Generalized Perturbation Theory has been developed. Still, no models for depletion calculations are readily available. Therefore, this paper describes a novel adjoint-based reduced order model for the Bateman equation. It uses a range-finding algorithm to create the basis and the Depletion Perturbation Theory for the reconstruction of the nuclide densities at first order. Our paper shows that for several perturbed cases, the depletion reduced-order model successfully reconstructs the nuclide densities. As a result, this serves as a proof of concept for our adjoint-based reduced order model which can perform sensitivity and uncertainty burn-up analysis in a shorter time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"981bb09211413585980c2e39362446164f7b889a31190b50f9ab1af9233833ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
