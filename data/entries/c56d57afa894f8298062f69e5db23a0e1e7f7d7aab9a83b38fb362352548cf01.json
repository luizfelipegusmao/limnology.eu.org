{"title":"Selection of Improved Banana Diploid Resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Races 1 and Subtropical 4","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0870/v1","date":1713147942000,"content":"Bananas, a staple food globally and a key agricultural commodity, face a severe threat from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum form specialis cubense (Foc), significantly impacting production. Genetic improvement to develop resistant cultivars stands out as a crucial strategy to mitigate this disease. This study focused on assessing and recommending enhanced diploid banana varieties for resistance against Foc subtropical race 4 (ST4) and Foc race 1 (R1). Twenty-five improved diploids developed by Embrapa, Brazil, underwent evaluation. Utilizing a scale for internal symptoms at 90 days post-inoculation, genotypes were categorized from highly resistant to highly susceptible based on the internal symptom index. The diploid M53 exhibited high resistance to R1 and resistance to Foc ST4, while only the diploid CNPMF 0534 demonstrated complete resistance to both R1 and ST4, with resistance to the latter likely associated with penetration. These findings provide valuable insights for banana and plantain breeding programs, offering selected diploids for crossbreeding with commercial cultivars to develop new, resistant genotypes against Foc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c56d57afa894f8298062f69e5db23a0e1e7f7d7aab9a83b38fb362352548cf01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
