Several species are capable of rapidly changing the color of their skin, including some fish, cephalopods, reptiles, and amphibians. This dynamic color change has been repeatedly linked to dermal photoreception, as demonstrated in studies of excised skin preparations. Despite the widespread prevalence of dermal photoreception, both its physiology and its function in regulating color change have remained poorly understood. Recently, an elegant study by a large team led by Lorian Schweikert at the University of North Carolina Wilmington described a sensory feedback system that explains this phenomenon.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"5a83269f2c9bd53ecbe17609c410c8d0f9c7e4b8abd70a72ced256a0d3c384a9","category":"Environment"}
