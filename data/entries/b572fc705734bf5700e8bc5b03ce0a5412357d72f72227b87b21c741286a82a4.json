{"title":"Exploring habitat use and movement patterns of humpback whales in a reoccupation area off Brazil: A comparison with the Abrolhos Bank","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13139?af=R","date":1728664220000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>After the worldwide moratorium on whaling, humpback whale populations began to recover, reoccupying former areas of use, as also observed on the Brazilian coast. Abrolhos Bank represents the area of greatest humpback whale concentration but the number of individuals to the north has increased, as has happened in the region of Serra Grande. To compare relative abundance, habitat use, and movement patterns between a well-established breeding and a reoccupation area, visual monitoring from land-based stations was performed: 160 days in the Abrolhos Archipelago located on the Abrolhos Bank and 133 days in Serra Grande in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019. While relative abundance varied annually in the Abrolhos Archipelago, it gradually increased in Serra Grande, surpassing the number registered in Abrolhos in 2019. Group composition frequency was similar between areas except for mother and calf accompanied by one or more escorts, which were more frequent in Abrolhos. Despite similar movement speed and linearity values, whales in Serra Grande had a higher reorientation rate. Monitoring different areas occupied by this population supports decisions about spatial management of the Brazilian coast in relation to the implementation of anthropogenic activities, especially in areas where whales have recently returned to occupy.</p>","author":"Bianca M.
