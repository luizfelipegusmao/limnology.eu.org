{"title":"Circulating miR-16 and miR-21 Levels in Multiple Myeloma: Prognostic Significance of Survival and Response to Lenalidomide Treatment.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1056/v1","date":1713261698000,"content":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), particularly miR-16 and miR-21, play a crucial role in mul-tiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis by regulating gene expression. This study evalu-ated the prognostic significance of circulating miR-16 and miR-21 expression levels in 48 patients with MM at diagnosis treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone (LD) compared with 15 healthy individuals (HI). All patients were treated with LD, 13 at first line and 35 at relapse, of whom 21 were tested twice at diagnosis and before LD initiation. The results revealed significantly lower levels of miR-16 and miR-21 in patients than in HIs, both at diagnosis and relapse, with decreased miR-16 levels at diagnosis, indicating improved overall survival (OS) (p value 0.024). Furthermore, miR-16 and miR-21 levels were associated with disease markers, while both corre-lated with the depth of response and mir-16 with sustained response to LD treatment. The ratios of both miR-16 and miR-21 expression levels (prior to LD treat-ment/diagnosis) below 2 predicted a shorter time to response (P = 0.027) and a longer time to next treatment (P = 0.042), respectively. These findings suggested a prognostic value for serum miR-16 and miR-21 levels in MM, as their expression levels corre-lated with disease variables and treatment outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a346a87c4aa5065f64a7c0b3dc256fa8d038b2adf068cfab70a16c2fb14439bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
