{"title":"Is adaptation associated with long-term persistence beyond a geographic range limit?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/9/1527/7692907?rss=1","date":1718236800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Adaptation to new habitats might facilitate speciesâ€™ range shifts in response to climate change. In 2005, we transplanted experimental populations of coastal dune plant <span>Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia</span> into 4 sites within and 1 site beyond its poleward range limit. Beyond-range transplants had high fitness but often delayed reproduction. To test for adaptation associated with experimental range expansion, we transplanted descendants from beyond- and within-range populations after 10 generations <span>in situ</span> into 2 sites within the range, 1 at the range edge, and 2 sites beyond the range. We expected to detect adaptation to beyond-range conditions due to substantial genetic variation within experimental populations and environmental variation among sites. However, individuals from beyond-range experimental populations were not fitter than those from within the range when planted at either beyond-range site, indicating no adaptation to the beyond-range site or beyond-range environments in general. Beyond-range descendants also did not suffer lower fitness within the range. Although reproduction was again delayed beyond the range, late reproduction was not favored more strongly beyond than within the range, and beyond-range descendants did not delay reproduction more than within-range descendants. Persistence in beyond-range environments may not require adaptation, which could allow a rapid response to climate change.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"2a4b0114a498b0068feea0178b945caa5bf30ec484086505fac808b13d2b3e5d","category":"Environment"}
