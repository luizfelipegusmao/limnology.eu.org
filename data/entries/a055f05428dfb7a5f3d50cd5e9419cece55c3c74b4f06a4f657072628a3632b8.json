{"title":"Molecular Surveillance of Artemisinin-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum Parasites in Mining Areas of the Roraima Indigenous Territory in Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1822/v1","date":1714280964000,"content":"Multidrug Artemisin-resistant (ART-R) Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) parasites represent a challenge for malaria elimination worldwide. Molecular monitoring in the Kelch domain region (pfk13) gene allows tracking mutations in parasite resistance to artemisinin. The increase of illegal miners in Roraima Yanomami indigenous land (IYL) could favor ART-R parasites. Thus, the study aimed to investigate ART-R in patients from illegal gold mining in the YIL of Roraima, Brazil. A questionnaire was applied and blood was collected from 48 patients diagnosed with P. falciparum or mixed malaria (Pf +P. vivax). The DNA was extracted and the pfk13 gene was amplified by PCR. The amplicons were subjected to DNA Sangers sequenced; the entire amplified fragment was analyzed. Among patients, 96% (46) were from illegal mining areas of the YIL. All parasite samples carried the wild-type genotypes / ART-sensitive phenotypes. These data reinforce the continued use of ACTs in Roraima as well as the maintenance of systematic monitoring for early detection of parasite populations resistant to ART, mainly in areas exposed to the individualâ€™s influx from mining areas, such as the YIL. This is especially true when the achievement of falciparum malaria elimination in Brazil is planned and expected by 2030.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a055f05428dfb7a5f3d50cd5e9419cece55c3c74b4f06a4f657072628a3632b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
