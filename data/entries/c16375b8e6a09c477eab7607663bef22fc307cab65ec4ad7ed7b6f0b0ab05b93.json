{"title":"Root plasticity improves maize nitrogen use when nitrogen is limiting: an analysis using 3D plant modelling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5989/7708568?rss=1","date":1720224000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in nitrogen (N) acquisition and use under nitrogen-limited conditions. However, this role has never been quantified as a function of N availability, leaving it unclear whether plastic responses should be considered as potential targets for selection. A combined modelling and experimentation approach was adopted to quantify the role of plasticity in N uptake and plant yield. Based on a greenhouse experiment we considered plasticity in two maize (<span>Zea mays</span>) traits: root-to-leaf biomass allocation ratio and emergence rate of axial roots. In a simulation experiment we individually enabled or disabled both plastic responses for maize stands grown across six N levels. Both plastic responses contributed to maintaining a higher N uptake, and plant productivity as N availability declined compared with stands in which plastic responses were disabled. We conclude that plastic responses quantified in this study may be a potential target trait in breeding programs for greater N uptake across N levels while it may only be important for the internal use of N under N-limited conditions in maize. Given the complexity of breeding for plastic responses, an <span>a priori</span> model analysis is useful to identify which plastic traits to target for enhanced plant performance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"c16375b8e6a09c477eab7607663bef22fc307cab65ec4ad7ed7b6f0b0ab05b93","category":"Environment"}
