Such wax layers are known to comprised of long carbon chain fatty acids and other organic compounds which incorporate carbonyl functional groups [<a href=\"#ozae044.417-B1\">1</a>]. Waxes are commonly used in the food industry as coatings to help retain moisture and prevent spoilage and they also have applications in many other areas such as cosmetics, pharmaceutical, textiles, lubricants, automobiles, and furniture [<a href=\"#ozae044.417-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8f869d265ab31ae538adcce805f533a7971179ce2fa8bdd7cfe459989162df88","category":"Environment"}
