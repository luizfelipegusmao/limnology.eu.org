{"title":"Planning Studies of Driver Behavior at Pedestrian Crossings Using Whole-Vehicle Simulators","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1164/v1","date":1710856249000,"content":"The process involved in preparing driving simulator tests is a labor intensive one, and the nature of this complexity depends on the sophistication of the tests to be carried out, as well as the number of participants. Which has an impact on the duration of the research itself. The very solution of using driving simulators is a research tool that has been in use for many years and with great success. They are used in a very wide range of areas of human functioning. They replicate in a very realistic way the conditions that can occur in the external environment, offer the possibility of repetition of particular conditions and insight into certain behaviors that could be very difficult to initiate in real life. This article also describes the dis- ease of using simulators to conduct research activities, along with the workflow from assumptions to finalizing the research. An algorithm is also presented for the study of individual participants, with examples for separate research scenarios concerning driver behavior in the vicinity of pedestrian crossings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"56ae099328a9eb5514bc236ecaba65ebd84171a8b77f1e41c349c5ddeceefd2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
