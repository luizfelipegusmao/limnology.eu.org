{"title":"Anterior cruciate ligament injury should not be considered a contraindication for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: Finite element analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299649","date":1710252000000,"content":"<p>by Deyan Ou, Yongqing Ye, Jingwei Pan, Yu Huang, Haisheng Kuang, Shilin Tang, Richao Huang, Yongxin Mo, Shixin Pan</p>\r\nPurpose <p>The research objective of this study is to use finite element analysis to investigate the impact of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury on medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and explore whether patients with ACL injuries can undergo UKA.</p> Methods <p>Based on the morphology of the ACL, models of ACL with diameters ranging from 1 to 10mm are created. Finite element models of UKA include ACL absence and ACLs with different diameters. After creating a complete finite element model and validating it, four different types of loads are applied to the knee joint. Statistical analysis is conducted to assess the stress variations in the knee joint structure.</p> Results <p>A total of 11 finite element models of UKA were established. Regarding the stress on the ACL, as the diameter of the ACL increased, when a vertical load of 750N was applied to the femur, combined with an anterior tibial load of 105N, the stress on the ACL increased from 2.61 MPa to 4.62 MPa, representing a 77.05% increase. Regarding the equivalent stress on the polyethylene gasket, a notable high stress change was observed. The stress on the gasket remained between 12.68 MPa and 14.33 MPa in all models. the stress on the gasket demonstrated a decreasing trend. The equivalent stress in the lateral meniscus and lateral femoral cartilage decreases, reducing from the maximum stress of 4.71 MPa to 2.61 MPa, with a mean value of 3.73 MPa. This represents a reduction of 44.72%, and the statistical significance is (P &lt; 0.05). However, under the other three loads, there was no significant statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>This study suggests that the integrity of the ACL plays a protective role in performing medial UKA. However, this protective effect is limited when performing medial UKA. When the knee joint only has varying degrees of ACL injury, even ACL rupture, and the remaining structures of the knee joint are intact with anterior-posterior stability in the knee joint, it should not be considered a contraindication for medial UKA.</p>","author":"Deyan Ou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"aaefdc159fdbc52ea8faf55998e6da3a43ed341c4a13987f6025b5167b9bc58a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
