{"title":"Pharmacokinetic Analysis of the Bioavailability of AQUATURM&reg;, a Water-Soluble Curcumin Formulation in Comparison to a Conventional Curcumin Tablet, in Human Subjects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1977/v1","date":1727279738000,"content":"Curcumin, extracted from the Curcuma longa rhizome, has gained substantial attention for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. Despite these potential benefits, its low bioavailability limits its usage and potential in clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, novel formulations have been developed using liposomal, nanoparticular and micellization technologies to improve bioavailability. The current randomized, double-blind, crossover, pharmacokinetic study compared AQUATURM®, a novel, patented water-soluble formulation, to another commercially available and widely used curcumin supplement in 12 human subjects over a 12-hour period separated by a 7-day washout period. Plasma samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-MS/MS). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve indicated that the bioavailability of AQUATURM® was over 7-fold greater than that of the other curcumin supplement, reaching concentrations up to 20 ng/mL for up to 12-hours. This study demonstrates AQUATURM®’s superior bioavailability to that of another, conventional, widely used curcumin supplement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e748d22daa6329b64b8909e865af7bb066fa0a67bf94785dd8d09ed6ea201de3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
