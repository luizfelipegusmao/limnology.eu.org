{"title":"Brake Wear and Airborne Particle Mass Emissions from Passenger Car Brakes in Dynamometer Experiments based on Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles Test Procedure Brake Cycle","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0928/v1","date":1715676219000,"content":"Brake wear particles, as the major component of non-exhaust particulate matter, are known to have different emissions, depending on the type of brake assembly and the specifications of the vehicle. In this study, brake wear and wear particle mass emissions were measured under realistic vehicle driving and full friction braking conditions using current commercial genuine brake assemblies. Although there were no significant differences in either PM10 or PM2.5 emissions between the different cooling air flow rates, brake wear decreased and ultrafine particle (PM0.12) emissions increased with increasing cooling air flow rate. Particle mass measurements were collected on filter media, allowing chemical composition analysis to identify the source of brake wear particle mass emissions. The iron concentration in the brake wear particles indicated that the main contribution was derived from disc wear. Using a systematic approach that measured brake wear and wear particle emissions, this study was able to characterize correlations with elemental compositions in brake friction materials, adding to our understanding of the mechanical phenomena of brake wear and wear particle emissions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b28d4b6ade3545a5b0ec5ad62731dea8cfc384eb1110df0a432882fe9c23f1ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
