{"title":"Performance Study on the Use of Genetic Algorithm for Reducing Feature Dimensionality on an Embedded Intrusion Detection System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0182/v1","date":1714721947000,"content":"Intrusion Detection Systems play a crucial role in a network. They can detect different network attacks and raise warnings on them. Machine learning-based IDSs are trained on datasets that, due to the context, are inherently large, since they can contain network traffic from different time periods and often include a large number of features. In this paper, we present two contributions: the study of the importance of feature selection when using an IDS dataset, while striking a balance between performance and the number of features; and the study of the feasibility of using a low-capacity device, the Nvidia Jetson Nano, to implement an IDS in a low-capacity network. The results, comparing the GA with other well-known techniques in feature selection and reduction, show that the GA has a higher F1-score of 76%, although the time to find the optimal set of features surpasses other methods; the reduction of the number of features reduces the processing time without a significant impact in f1-score. The Jetson Nano allows the classification of network traffic with an overhead of 10 times in comparison to a traditional server.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b79b0d11a6488a0a484008ad8b0de9c5cb1597650dd021973705804389443e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
