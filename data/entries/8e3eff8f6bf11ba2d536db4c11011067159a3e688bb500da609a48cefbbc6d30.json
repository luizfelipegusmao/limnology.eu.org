{"title":"Kiwifruit Vine Decline Syndrome (KVDS) Alters Soil Enzyme Activity and Microbial Community","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0685/v1","date":1728466465000,"content":"Kiwifruit Vine Decline Syndrome (KVDS) has recently become a concern in Italy, impacting plant health and production. This study aims to investigate the influence of KVDS on soil health indi-cators and the composition of soil microbial communities by comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic kiwifruit orchards located in two areas in Latium, Italy. Soil samples were collected in spring and autumn to evaluate the seasonal variations in soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities, and microbial biomass. The results revealed that KVDS impacted soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity, and water-soluble carbon and nitrogen contents, though these effects varied by orchard and season. Moreover, KVDS significantly affected soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass assessed through PLFAs analysis, particularly showing an increase in fungal biomass in symptomatic areas. In addition, metabarcoding revealed differences in the microbial communities between symptomatic and asymptomatic soils, with notable shifts in their diversity and relative abundance. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between plant-soil-microbiome in KVDS, suggesting that KVDS is multifactorial and is likely associated with an imbalance of soil microbial communities at the rhizosphere level, which can negatively affect soil health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e3eff8f6bf11ba2d536db4c11011067159a3e688bb500da609a48cefbbc6d30","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
