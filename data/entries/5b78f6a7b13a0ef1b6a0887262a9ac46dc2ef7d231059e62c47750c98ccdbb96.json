{"title":"Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Ammonia Concentration and Their Abundancy in Korea","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0619/v1","date":1723155906000,"content":"In this study, it was analyzed that the characteristics of ammonia and their effects on secondary particulate matter (PM) formation by region in Korea during 2020. The NH3 concentration was high in GJ (11.4 ppb) neighboring agricultural area followed by DJ (9.0 ppb) and SE (8.6 ppb) locating in the urban area. On the other hand, BI (2.6 ppb) and JI (4.5 ppb), which are background regions, were lower than other area. Seasonally, ammonia was high in spring and summer, and it generally increased when human activities are active. Therefore, it is believed that ammonia in the atmosphere changes depending on not only local emissions but also temperature-dependent phase distribution characteristics. For SE and GJ, regions with relatively high ammonia concentrations, the effect of ammonia on secondary PM formation was conducted. In both regions, the ammonium-to-sulfate mole ratio tended to increase with an ammonia or PM2.5 concentration increasing. It can be assumed that PM2.5 concentration increases as nitrates are formed under the ammonia sufficient condition. The adjusted gas ratio is generally greater than 4, indicating that there is a lot of free ammonia. Thus, it is estimated that reduction of ammonia would not effective to restrain the nitrate formation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b78f6a7b13a0ef1b6a0887262a9ac46dc2ef7d231059e62c47750c98ccdbb96","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
