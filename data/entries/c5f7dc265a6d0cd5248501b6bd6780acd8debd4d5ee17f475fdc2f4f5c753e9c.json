{"title":"Receptor-like kinases OsRLK902-1 and OsRLK902-2 form immune complexes with OsRLCK185 to regulate rice blast resistance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1565/7425588?rss=1","date":1700179200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are major regulators of the plant immune response and play important roles in the perception and transmission of immune signals. RECEPTOR LIKE KINASE 902 (RLK902) is at the key node in leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase interaction networks and positively regulates resistance to the bacterial pathogen <span>Pseudomonas syringae</span> in Arabidopsis. However, the function of RLK902 in fungal disease resistance remains obscure. In this study, we found that the expression levels of <span>OsRLK902-1</span> and <span>OsRLK902-2</span>, encoding two orthologues of RLK902 in rice, were induced by <span>Magnaporthe oryzae</span>, chitin, and flg22 treatment. <span>osrlk902-1</span> and <span>osrlk902-2</span> knockout mutants displayed enhanced susceptibility to <span>M. oryzae</span>. Interestingly, the <span>osrlk902-1 rlk902-2</span> double mutant exhibited similar disease susceptibility, hydrogen peroxide production, and callose deposition to the two single mutants. Further investigation showed that OsRLK902-1 interacts with and stabilizes OsRLK902-2. The two OsRLKs form a complex with OsRLCK185, a key regulator in chitin-triggered immunity, and stabilize it. Taken together, our data demonstrate that OsRLK902-1 and OsRLK902-2, as well as OsRLCK185 function together in regulating disease resistance to <span>M. oryzae</span> in rice.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"c5f7dc265a6d0cd5248501b6bd6780acd8debd4d5ee17f475fdc2f4f5c753e9c","category":"Environment"}
