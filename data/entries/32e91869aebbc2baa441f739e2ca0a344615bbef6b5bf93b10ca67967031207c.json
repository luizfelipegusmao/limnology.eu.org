{"title":"Effect of Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride on Corrosion Inhibition Properties of Mild Steel in Acidic Medium","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1187/v2","date":1714482666000,"content":"The corrosion inhibition behavior of cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) on mild steel (MS) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was examined using the weight loss method and potentiodynamic polarization method. The experimented MS surface was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Corrosion rate and corrosion efficiency was calsulated via weight loss and potentiodynamic polarization methods where the corrosion rate in 0.5 M H2SO4 , 0.000192 M, and 0.0077 M of CPC solution was 12.09×10-3,  8.23×10-3, 6.63×10-5 (mm/Year), respectively and the inhibition efficiency  of 94.42% and 98.54%. FESEM studies demonstrated the corrosion attack on MS surface. Also, the EDX showed the presence of nitrogen of CPC. Thus, CPC acts as an important corrosion inhibitor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32e91869aebbc2baa441f739e2ca0a344615bbef6b5bf93b10ca67967031207c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
