{"title":"Screening and Industry of Bacterial L-glutaminase as an Anticancer Agent from Different Soil Environments in Egypt","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1087/v1","date":1715853334000,"content":"Background:\nBreast cancer and other neoplasms like acute lymphocytic leukemia pose a serious threat to public health worldwide. Treatment for malignancies including acute lymphocytic leukemia and breast cancer requires enzymes that break down L-glutamine. An amidohydrolase called L-glutaminase can be an effective chemotherapeutic tool for treating various cancers.\nMethods:\nOn mineral L-glutamine agar selective medium (MGA), a few bacterial isolates were examined in the current investigation to see if they produced L-glutaminase. However, the most effective positive bacterial isolates generating L-glutaminase were identified using morphological and biochemical testing. Molecular detection using the direct Southern blotting approach was also used to determine the main positive isolate that produces L-glutaminase. L-glutaminase synthesis by bacteria was evaluated for its characteristics. Using an MTT test, the anticancer activity was evaluated.\nResults:\nexclusive bacterial isolates that used L-glutamine as their sole source of metabolic nitrogen exhibited favorable growth on MGA. PH 7.4 and a temperature of 37 0C were the ideal environmental and physiological conditions for developing positive bacterial isolates. From the soil samples taken from various soil conditions in Egypt, the morphological and biochemical analyses showed that Bacillus cereus 14579 was the main positive bacterial generating L-glutaminase isolate. At a pH of 7.4 and a temperature of 37 °C, the following activators—KCL, ZnSO4, FeSO4, K2HPO4, and MgSO4—provided the high-grade circumstances for characterizing L-glutaminase synthesis. Bacillus cereus-produced L-glutaminase has shown excellent bioavailability and effectiveness as an anticancer therapy.\n\n\nThe yield [productivity] was 5.2 U/ml during the original manufacture from MGA, but it increased to 42.96 U/ ml by bacterial recombinant DNA manufacturing. The molecular mass of L-glutaminase was roughly 37 KDa. L-glutaminase was purified, yielding final enzyme recovery of 55 1.23%, total activity 12,990± 19.76 ( U), specific activity 384.66± 8.92( U/ mg of protein), and purification fold 2± 2.99. Furthermore, the L-glutaminase activity was raised by 19%, 23%, 15%, and 9%, respectively, by the enzymatic activators Mn2+, K+, Na+, and Fe3+. It demonstrated strong DPPH scavenging activity (IC50 = 61 μg/ mL) and anticancer activity( IC50 = 40.72, 9.7, 7.39, 20.61, 51.28, and 11.55 μg/ mL, respectively) against human liver (HepG-2), colon ( HCT-116), breast ( MCF-7), lung( A-549), lymphocytic( CCL-120), and cervical( Hela) cancer cell lines. A stronger affinity for its substrate was shown by the kinetic parameters of Km and Vmax, which were 13.2 10-5 M and 119.86 μmol/ ml/ min, respectively.\nConclusion:\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia and breast cancer are examples of auxotrophic malignancies for which L-glutamine serves as the only metabolic source, and L-glutaminase generated by Bacillus cereus was an appropriate enzyme in the therapy of these diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ea565aa7e6dd1befc462d9d4aec2e56fb2baf2a446b403f52c9a284c743564c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
