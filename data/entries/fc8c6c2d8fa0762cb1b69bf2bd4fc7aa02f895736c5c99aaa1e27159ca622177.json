{"title":"Quantum-Inspired Data Embedding for Unlabeled Data in Sparse Environments: A Theoretical Framework for Improved Semi-Supervised Learning without Hardware Dependence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0663/v1","date":1728455912000,"content":"This paper introduces an innovative theoretical framework for quantum-inspired data embeddings, grounded in foundational concepts of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. This approach aims to advance semi-supervised learning in contexts characterized by limited labeled data by enabling more intricate and expressive embeddings that capture the underlying structure of the data effectively. Grounded in foundational quantum mechanics concepts such as superposition and entanglement, this approach redefines data representation by enabling more intricate and expressive embeddings. Emulating quantum superposition encodes each data point as a probabilistic amalgamation of multiple feature states, facilitating a richer, multidimensional representation of underlying structures and patterns. Additionally, quantum-inspired entanglement mechanisms are harnessed to model intricate dependencies between labeled and unlabeled data, promoting enhanced knowledge transfer and structural inference within the learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional quantum machine learning methodologies that often rely on quantum hardware, this framework is fully realizable within classical computational architectures, thus bypassing the practical limitations of quantum hardware. The versatility of this model is illustrated through its application to critical domains such as medical diagnosis, resource-constrained natural language processing, and financial forecastingâ€”areas where data scarcity impedes the efficacy of traditional models. Experimental evaluations reveal that quantum-inspired embeddings substantially outperform standard approaches, enhancing model resilience and generalization in high-dimensional, low-sample scenarios. This research marks a significant stride in integrating quantum theoretical principles with classical machine learning, broadening the scope of data representation and semi-supervised learning while circumventing the technological barriers of quantum computing infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc8c6c2d8fa0762cb1b69bf2bd4fc7aa02f895736c5c99aaa1e27159ca622177","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
