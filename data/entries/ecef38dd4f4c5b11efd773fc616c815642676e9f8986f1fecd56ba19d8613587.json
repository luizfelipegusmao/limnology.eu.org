{"title":"IoT Irrigation System Using Arduino","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1642/v1","date":1716544403000,"content":"The increasing demand for water in agriculture and the need for more efficient irrigation systems has led to the development of smart irrigation systems based on the Internet of Things. In this system, an Arduino microcontroller is used to control and monitor the watering of crops. The system is equipped with sensors that measure soil moisture which are used to optimize the irrigation process. The data collected by the sensors is transmitted to the Arduino, which then adjusts the watering schedule based on the information received. The use of IoT in smart irrigation systems provides several benefits, including reduced water waste, increased crop yields, and improved plant health. The implementation of this system using an Arduino platform is relatively simple, cost-effective, and can be easily integrated into existing irrigation systems. Overall, the use of IoT in smart irrigation using an Arduino platform has the potential to revolutionize the way we manage water resources in agriculture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecef38dd4f4c5b11efd773fc616c815642676e9f8986f1fecd56ba19d8613587","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
