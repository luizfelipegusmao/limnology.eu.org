{"title":"Evaluation of Corrosion Resistance of 904L Composite Plate in High Temperature and High Pressure Gas Field Environment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1622/v1","date":1724308389000,"content":"In order to study the corrosion resistance of 904L composite plate pressure vessel under high temperature and high pressure gas field environment, the pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking resistance of 904L composite plate body and weld material were compared with those of 2205 composite plate and 825 composite plate, which have been used in high temperature and high pressure gas field environment. The results showed that the pitting resistance of 904L composite plate was lower than that of 825 composite plate and higher than that of 2205 solid solution pure material plate and 2205 composite plate. The corrosion resistance of welds on 904L composite plate with different materials was very different. The corrosion rate of 904L composite plate body, welding seam and surfacing welding were all slight corrosion, and the sensitivity of chloride stress corrosion cracking was low in the simulation of the corrosion environment of high temperature and high pressure gas field. 904L composite plate met the requirements of corrosion resistance of pressure vessel material in high temperature and high pressure gas field environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"13ffe2eb9798048059e610e3b2d33e225078665bc45ad70f9d4d892566f8e266","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
