{"title":"Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus Can Be Transmissible through a Greenhouse Hydroponic System and Virus Inactivation Using a Cold Plasma Ozone Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1283/v1","date":1711010808000,"content":"Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an emerging tobamovirus infecting tomatoes and peppers.  Due to its ability to trigger seed contamination, efficient mechanical transmission, and to break the popular resistance genes (Tm-1, Tm-2 and Tm-22), the virus has resulted in a global pandemic on greenhouse tomato production in recent years despite the implementation of strict hygiene and disinfection measures. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether ToBRFV can be transmissible through recirculating hydroponic systems and search for effective approach to contain its spread under such circumstances. We not only detected the presence of ToBRFV in the runoff water solutions collected from ToBRFV-infected tomato greenhouses, but also demonstrated the infectivity of detected virus through initiating ToBRFV infection on tomato plants using bioassay. We then conducted treatment using cold plasma-generated ozone on ToBRFV-contaminated water reservoir and further assessed the efficacy of the treatment to inac-tivate the virus. Results showed the effectiveness of the cold-plasma ozone treatment was de-pendent on the ozone concentrations (0.1 mg/L to 1.0 mg/L), the periods of exposure (24 min to 72 min), and the relative virus titers (1:100 to 1:10,000 - dilution of virus-infected tissue extract), demonstrating the cold-plasma ozone treatment could offer a promising solution to cope with the potential ToBRFV spread through a recirculating hydroponic system in a greenhouse.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c841a7c4875e799fc80e61b5c9a92a97fa8ae7d04215959483170d12d7a5dc2f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
