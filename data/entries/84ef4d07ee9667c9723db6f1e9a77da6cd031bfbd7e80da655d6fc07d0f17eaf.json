{"title":"Microwave-Assisted Morphological Evolution and Thermal Behavior of Expanded Graphite Interlayered Compounds","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.273/7719887?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Graphite is a crystalline allotropic form of carbon, occurs naturally and is the most stable phase under standard conditions. Some of its intrinsic properties are low specific gravity and high chemical inertness (preserved ∼ 900 K). However, for oxygen, graphite reacts with it above this temperature but doesn't get degraded [<a href=\"#ozae044.273-B1\">1</a>]. Expanded graphite (EG) is a carbon vermicular layered structured material prepared by treating natural graphite with some ions and compounds such as sulfate, nitrate, perchlorate etc., forming a graphite intercalation compound (GIC). Then, GIC is heated from 300–1150°C to obtain a fully expanded material [<a href=\"#ozae044.273-B2\">2</a>]. EG is a promising candidate for numerous applications because of its low cost, high thermal resistance and increased surface area provided by the galleries between the interlayer separation and pores [<a href=\"#ozae044.273-B3\">3</a>]. GIC thermal processing can be performed using microwave heating, showing high heating rates and a notable reduction in processing time. The mechanism is the conversion of electromagnetic energy to thermal energy. Graphite is a microwave-absorbing solid that can easily reach high temperatures with sparks and microplasma [<a href=\"#ozae044.273-B4\">4</a>]. GIC microwave heating induces a sudden decomposition of intercalated groups into gases, increasing the pressure between the GIC interlayered structure, enlarging the graphitic spacing and consuming carbon from the graphitic structure. This work deals with the EG preparation using microwave heating to compare the graphitic degradation as a function of heating intensity. 150 mg of GIC was expanded using a 700 W commercial microwave oven for 30 and 60 s cycles. The weight loss of both samples was gravimetrically calculated. The morphological and chemical studies were performed with a Hitachi SU3500 microscope. Thermogravimetric studies were conducted in a simultaneous SDT-TG calorimeter from TA instruments (model Q600). In thermograms of Fig. 1a, the Gr sample exhibits its chemical inertness; the curve is almost constant until 600°C, reaching a single step (I) related to carbon combustion. Meanwhile, the GIC sample showed three weight variations: 1) corresponds to the sorbed water releasing and gas desorption (&lt;200°C), 2) is related to oxygen functional groups remotion above 200°C and 3) is associated with carbon pyrolysis (&gt;550°C). Fig. 1b shows the effect of microwave heating intensity on the GIC, generating reactions of intercalation groups vaporization and carbon pyrolysis in the air; this increases pores and internal channel density. Even though there is only a slight difference in mass loss (4%), micrographs of Fig. 2 showed a massive difference in the sample morphology. In Fig. 2a. the sample expansion is evident due to a selective expansion along the c-axis of the graphitic layer separation after 30 seconds of microwave heating. In Fig. 2b, the sample further heated (60 s) showed the characteristic vermicular aspect with a network formed by several interconnected channels and degraded etches resulting from extended carbon oxidation during microwave heating. According to the above results, there is a notable difference in the morphology and border oxidation of the GIC samples as a function of the heating intensity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"84ef4d07ee9667c9723db6f1e9a77da6cd031bfbd7e80da655d6fc07d0f17eaf","category":"Environment"}
