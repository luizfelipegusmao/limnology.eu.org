{"title":"Maturity Testing of the Industry 4.0 Technology Adaptability in Procurement Process: A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1064/v1","date":1710855096000,"content":"Currently, many manufacturing industries use machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain technologies as process-streamlining instruments of industry 4.0. Before implementing industry 4.0 tools in any process of a manufacturing industry's supply chain, it is essential to evaluate their adaptability. In this paper, the adaptability of industry 4.0 procurement tools to an oil and gas-related manufacturing company's procurement process is evaluated to determine the company's level of maturity. The active participation of participants is evaluated to determine the level of maturity of the main procurement process areas. The results identified the areas of the procurement process that can be improved by implementing the suggested industry 4.0 tools and techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"195faac9071c9246f07b5150e936347fd14618344b568d14b3e4372a90f63f65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
