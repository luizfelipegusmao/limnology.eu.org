{"title":"Assessing Hydrodynamic Resistance in Microfluidics: A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0049/v1","date":1717393750000,"content":"Hydrodynamic resistance is a critical parameter in microfluidics, affecting device functionality and performance. However, quantifying hydrodynamic resistance in microfluidics is a challenge due to many influencing factors and the difficulties associated with the precise measurements of low flow rates (&lt; 10 L/min) and pressure drops (&lt; 5 kPa). This article presents a simple experimental test method for assessing hydrodynamic resistance, correlating with theoretical and numerical calculations. The results demonstrate good agreement between benchtop and theoretical data, suggesting a potential standardized method for assessing hydrodynamic resistance in microfluidic devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"038585e08ac9537d321becbdaf23129b60ca59cebc15ed6676c8c6cf9eaed7b7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
