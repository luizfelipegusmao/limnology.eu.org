Accordingly, this study proposed four-stage hybrid intelligent models based on empirical wavelet transform (EWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR), and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) for PM<sub>10</sub> forecasting. The proposed models, including EWT-VMD-PSR-BPNN, EWT-VMD-PSR-MARS, EWT-VMD-PSR-RBFNN and EWT-VMD-PSR-GMDH, were tested in five different communities using accuracy assessors such as correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>), root mean square error (RMSE), normalised root mean square error (NRMSE), the variance accounted for (VAF), performance index (PI) and Taylor diagram. The results showed that the proposed models could predict the PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations to various acceptable accuracies for the five mining communities considered. However, model inter-comparison revealed the supremacy of EWT-VMD-PSR-MARS by producing the best r, RMSE, NRMSE, VAF and PI values in the range of 0.91–0.99, 1.34–4.56, 0.06–0.14, 73.66–97.84%, and 1.5–1.90 respectively for the five studied mining communities. The Taylor diagram also showed the EWT-VMD-PSR-MARS model’s prediction superiority, making it a promising tool for complex time series forecasting.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"e1cb312252f3ad28b874f71eba71f17b5e2d027bba7faebb0e52296bccbf9905","category":"Environment"}
