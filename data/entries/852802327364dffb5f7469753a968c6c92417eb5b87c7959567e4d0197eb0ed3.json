{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Individual Level and Community Level Approach for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals for Under-Five Mortality Rate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0610/v1","date":1712647475000,"content":"Introduction: United Nations General Assembly has set the target of bringing down under-five child mortality to 25 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030. Understanding the determinants that bring down preventable deaths in children is important. Design: Anonymized, publicly available data from the India National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) is collected. The sample consisted of 724,115 women in the age group of 15-49 years has been sub-grouped as urban and rural women. For better analysis of data, the country is divided into regions. Union territories are grouped in these regions as per their geographical locations. Descriptive statistical analysis and linear regression analysis was done.Result: Compared to NFHS-4 (2015-16) U5MR has reduced in almost all states of the country. The study shows more urban women have access to the Internet as compared to rural women. Child mortality is higher in rural areas in every state as compared to urban areas.Conclusion: Urban women have more access to health information because of internet access which may be the reason for lesser child mortality in urban areas compared to rural areas. Internet access for women (individual level) is far more effective in bringing down U5MR if compared to the community-level approach of Daycare centers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"852802327364dffb5f7469753a968c6c92417eb5b87c7959567e4d0197eb0ed3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
