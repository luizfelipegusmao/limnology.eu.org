{"title":"An Analysis Comparing the Taguchi Method for Optimizing the Process Parameters of AA5083/Silicon Carbide and AA5083/Coal Composites That Are Fabricated via FSP","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1163/v1","date":1726473610000,"content":"Aluminium matrix compositeâ€™s overall quality is impacted by the friction stir process parameters, which have a major impact on the microstructure, soundness, and particle dispersion inside the stir zone. Although it requires a lot of experimentation, optimizing these factors is vital. For the purpose of optimizing the ultimate tensile strength and microhardness of the AA5083/Silicon carbide and AA5083/Coal composites fabricated by FSP, this work used the Taguchi L9 design of experiments. Three process parameters were investigated at three levels each. For the AA5083/Silicon carbide composite, the results of the ANOVA analysis showed rotational speed has a larger impact on ultimate tensile strength while forAA5083/coal tilt angle has a larger impact on ultimate tensile strength. On the other hand, rotating speed had a greater effect on microhardness and percentage elongation of the AA5083/Coal and AA5083/Silicon carbide composite joints, according to ANOVA analysis. The need for specific process optimization for each composite was highlighted by the fact that different combinations of parameters were best for obtaining the necessary attributes in the AA5083/Silicon carbide and AA5083/Coal composites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d3424d2790485e71b7a3a0818b950e9a65d1e7891e1b7f4e88abe61677bcecd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
