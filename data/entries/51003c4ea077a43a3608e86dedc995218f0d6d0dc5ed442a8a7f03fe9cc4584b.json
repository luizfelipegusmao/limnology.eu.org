{"title":"Tumor Lysis Syndrome with Venetoclax/Carfilzomib/Dexamethasone for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1597/v1","date":1729511671000,"content":"We present a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with t(11;14) treated with venetoclax, carfilzomib and dexamethasone (VenKd), resulting in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with subsequent renal failure. Repeat marrow biopsy showed no monoclonal plasma cells but extensive fibrosis. Venetoclax was reintroduced after two months with marrow recovery. Venetoclax was titrated from 200 to 400 mg daily alongside IV fluids and allopurinol without TLS recurrence. Here, we highlight the importance of risk stratification, dose titration, and TLS prophylaxis with venetoclax use in RRMM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51003c4ea077a43a3608e86dedc995218f0d6d0dc5ed442a8a7f03fe9cc4584b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
