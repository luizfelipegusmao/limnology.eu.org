{"title":"248 Impacts of sprouted barley on the performance and carcass traits in finishing Angus steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/359/7757496?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The growing population, coupled with unpredictable weather patterns, demands that livestock producers think innovatively to improve sustainability. Producers are interested in innovative practices and technology, such as controlled environment farming to sprout cereal grains that can be fed to livestock. However, little research has determined the effects of giving these feeds to finishing beef steers. As such, Angus steers (n = 60) were stratified by body weight (BW; 385 kg ± 10.3) to receive two different diets (n = 30/diet). The control (CON) diet was a traditional finishing ration for the region, whereas the other included 20% (dry matter; DM) sprouted barley (SB) in place of corn silage. Animals were fed for 128 d in pens with Vytelle units to measure intake and feeding behavior. On d 0, 30, 60, 90, and 128 BW, ruminal fluid, and ultrasound measurements were taken. Liver score (LS) and typical carcass data were collected from a commercial harvest facility. Statistical analyses used the MIXED procedure of SAS to assess the main effect of diet for all measurements collected over time. Dry matter intake (DMI), feed efficiency (gain to feed; G:F), ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) composition, and feeding behavior were run as repeated measures. No differences (<span>P</span> = 0.37) in BW gain were found between steers receiving different diets, but steers receiving SB had decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) DMI throughout the trial compared with CON. This decrease in DMI drove a diet × day effect (<span>P</span> = 0.004) for G:F such that SB had increased (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.04) G:F on d 0 and 60, but no effect (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.52) was observed at d 90 or 128. Steers receiving the CON diet spent more (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.0001) time at the feed bunk than those receiving the SB diet, which supports the observation that steers receiving the CON had an increased DMI. Ruminal pH, total VFA concentration, acetate:propionate, percent propionate, and percent butyrate were each impacted by diet × day (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.007). The only carcass trait impacted by diet was yield grade (YG), where steers receiving the SB diet had an increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) YG compared with CON. These results demonstrate that replacing corn silage with SB in the ration of finishing steers has some effect on ruminal VFA composition, DMI, G:F, and USDAYG. Due to decreased DMI, SB steers had increased feed efficiency which could potentially have a positive economic impact for producers. However, additional analysis is needed to further determine if these systems are economically viable in a production setting.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"634272e47e8e72f8e1a6c7e1e645c1e8f106dfce8ccf983e6cb9fa284db9d60e","category":"Environment"}
