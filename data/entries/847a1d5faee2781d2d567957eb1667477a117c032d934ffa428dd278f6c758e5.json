{"title":"Nanofibrous &epsilon;-Polycaprolactone Matrices Containing Nano-Hydroxyapatite and Humulus lupulus L. Extract: Physicochemical and Biological Characterization for Drug Delivery Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0783/v1","date":1710342300000,"content":"Oral bone defects occur as a result of trauma, cancer, infections, periodontal diseases, and caries. Autogenic and allogenic grafts are the gold standard used to treat and regenerate damaged or defective bone segments. However, these materials do not possess the antimicrobial properties necessary to inhibit the invasion of the numerous deleterious pathogens present in the oral microbiota.\nIn the present study poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL), nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp), and a commercial extract of Humulus lupulus L. (hops) were electrospun into polymeric matrices to assess their po-tential for drug delivery and bone regeneration. \nThe fabricated matrices were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FT-IR assay, and in vitro hydrolytic degradation. The antimi-crobial properties were evaluated against the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The cytocompatibility was proved by the MTT assay. SEM analysis proved the nanostructured matrices have suitable fiber size. \nThe present research provides new information about the interaction of natural compounds with ceramic and polymeric biomaterials. The hop extract and other natural or synthetic medicinal agents can be effectively loaded into PCL fibers and has the potential to be used in biomedical applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"847a1d5faee2781d2d567957eb1667477a117c032d934ffa428dd278f6c758e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
