{"title":"Synergistic Theoretical and Experimental Insights into NH₄⁺-Enhanced Vanadium Oxide Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0878/v1","date":1715612469000,"content":"This study explores the enhancement of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) using ammonium-enhanced vanadium oxide cathodes. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal that NH₄⁺ incorporation into V₆O₁₆ lattices significantly facilitates Zn²⁺ ion diffusion by reducing electrostatic interactions, acting as a structural lubricant. Subsequent experimental validation using (NH₄)₂V₆O₁₆ cathodes synthesized via a hydrothermal method corroborates the DFT findings, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical stability with a capacity retention of 90% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g⁻¹. These results underscore the potential of NH₄⁺ in improving the performance and longevity of AZIBs, providing a pathway for sustainable energy storage solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b73b1e8a2f85dca39874a4c5087f1a723bdbb5e77e7dd68dc125aeeab334e3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
