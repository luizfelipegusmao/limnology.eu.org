{"title":"Exploring the Functionality of Kr&uuml;ppel-Like Factors in Kidney Development, Metabolism, and Diseases.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0615/v1","date":1728463509000,"content":"The kidneys contribute to the overall health of the organism by maintaining systemic homeostasis. This process involves the regulation of various biological mechanisms, in which the Kr√ºppel-like factor (KLF) transcription factors are essential for regulating development, differentiation, proliferation, and cellular apoptosis. They also play a role in the metabolic regulation of essential nutrients, such as glucose and lipids. The dysregulation of these transcription factors is associated with the development of various pathologies, which can ultimately lead to renal fibrosis, a process that severely compromises the function of these organs. In this context, the present article provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature, offering an enriching analysis of the findings related to the role of KLFs in the renal field, while also highlighting their potential therapeutic role in the treatment of renal diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"001724a18a58b7c3e05da73bbac8746783c84d8a977cd7f2d14c0e359269c97c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
