{"title":"The Activation of the NF-κB Pathway in Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Alters the Deposition of Epigenetic Marks on H3K27 and is Modulated by Fish Oil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1970/v1","date":1729786091000,"content":"Background: Chronic low-grade inflammation in obesity is linked to white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction. Plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), triggering NF-κB and worsening these disturbances. Previously, we showed that H3K27 epigenetic modifications affect WAT gene expression in high-fat diet mice, identifying key pathways in adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). This study explores whether NF-κB influences H3K27 modifiers in human ASCs and evaluates fish oil (FO) as a modulator. Methods: Human visceral WAT ASCs were stimulated with LPS and treated with FO enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Flow cytometry, PCR array, RT-PCR, and Western blot assays were used. Results: LPS increased NF-κB activity, elevating KDM6B demethylase levels and H3K27 acetylation. These epigenetic modifications in LPS-stimulated ASCs were associated with persistent changes in the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, metabolic regulation, and inflammation, even after LPS removal and cell differentiation. FO mitigated these effects, reducing H3K27 acetylation and promoting methylation. Conclusions: FO demonstrates potential in modulating inflammation-induced epigenetic changes and preserving adipocyte function.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"948ad0534cef7e6183f1ffa9aedc0dd4087f179e67f6b75707f5a7409ffe70f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
