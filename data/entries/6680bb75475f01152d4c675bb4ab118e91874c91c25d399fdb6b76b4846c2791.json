{"title":"Perceptions regarding the recreational cobia fishery in relation to manta ray conservation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4147?af=R","date":1713306964000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nUnderstanding fisheries requires not only traditional modelling approaches but also the incorporation of local ecological knowledge (LEK) which can provide other types of essential contextualizing knowledge.\nRecreational anglers within the cobia fishery on the east coast of central and northern Florida target cobia by seeking out the manta rays cobia often follow and associate with, and casting at or near them. Results suggest this fishery poses a threat of entanglement, injury and disturbance to mantas in the region, especially associated with the practices and behaviours of inexperienced anglers.\nExpert angler responses in interviews described changes in manta and cobia habitat use and reductions in cobia abundance\nExperienced anglers pointed to social media as a key driver of the expansion of this fishery and as an explanation for their perception of the growing presence of novice anglers engaged in these practices. Respondents proposed best practices and potential management interventions and generally supported conservation action, including through willingness to engage with researchers and support management and enforcement measures related to the fishery.\n</p>","author":"Raquel Braun, \nJulia Wester, \nCatherine Macdonald, \nJessica H.
