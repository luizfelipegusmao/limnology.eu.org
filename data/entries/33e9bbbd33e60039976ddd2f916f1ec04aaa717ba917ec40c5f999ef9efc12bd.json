Due to the country-wide lockdown, most activities in the hotel, motel, restaurant, and transportation sectors have been postponed. Consequently, the article investigates four research issues by examining the consequences of global tourism in the private sector before and after COVID-19. As an analytical method, the article suggested qualitative research methodologies to collect information from tourism employees. The opinions of the respondents were gathered through online emails in the questionnaire survey. Further, the article considers people’s future desire for specific tourism destinations based on visitor arrivals. Forecasting tourist demand is an essential component of good and efficient tourism management. Consequently, the article proposes an attention-based long short-term memory model for exact demand forecasting. The experimental findings reveal that the model’s minimal prediction error accuracy is 0.45%, which indicates that it has a more robust prediction effect, a faster convergence rate, and a greater prediction accuracy. Seasonality has emerged as one of the most distinguishing and defining characteristics of the global tourist business. Accordingly, the article mandated to compare the seasonal and non-seasonal effects of the tourist sector throughout the years 2020–2021. Moreover, Governments must analyse the crises’ long-term consequences and, as a result, define the components that constitute government advantages supplied to the tourist sector during the pandemic era. As a result, many governmental policies, especially those about social welfare, may perceive a fresh start during the post-pandemic period, respectively.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"33e9bbbd33e60039976ddd2f916f1ec04aaa717ba917ec40c5f999ef9efc12bd","category":"Environment"}
