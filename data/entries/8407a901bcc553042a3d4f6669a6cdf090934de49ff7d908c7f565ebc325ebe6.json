{"title":"Cognitive Strategy Instruction in Vocabulary Learning Task: the Role of Intelligence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0852/v2","date":1715747778000,"content":"In paired-associate vocabulary learning task, second language learners employ different cognitive strategies, associated with either elaborative or rote rehearsal, resulting in different recall performance. The current study investigated the role of intelligence, measured with Ravenâ€™s Advanced Progressive Matrices, in strategy effects on performance and eye movement parameters. The Keyword method, which is regarded as a more effective cognitive strategy in paired-associate task, was induced on a sample of 32 healthy participants with normal or corrected to normal vision. Effective cognitive strategy use, mentioned in a structured post-hoc report, was found to improve performance after strategy induction. Higher intelligence score was associated with higher recall performance in case the Keyword method was reported, but not in the cases when no rote rehearsal was reported. No effect of cognitive strategy use on eye movement measures after explicit cognitive strategy instruction was revealed, which is supposed to be connected with lack of self-sustained strategy use immediately after strategy instruction. The findings emphasize the role of intelligence in cognitive strategy instruction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8407a901bcc553042a3d4f6669a6cdf090934de49ff7d908c7f565ebc325ebe6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
