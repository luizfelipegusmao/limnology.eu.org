The diverse combinations of the number of Au atoms and various types of capping ligands provide a versatile platform, allowing the Au nanoparticles to exhibit tunable optical [<a href=\"#ozae044.844-B1\">1</a>] and electronic properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.844-B2\">2</a>]. Thiolate-protected AuNPs manifest notable stability in solution, attributed to robust sulfur-gold bonds and aurophilic interactions among Au(I) atoms. The synthesis of AuNPs has been widely investigated and precisely controlled on AuNPs or Au nanoclusters of smaller sizes have been actively studied [<a href=\"#ozae044.844-B3\">3</a>], however, the reason why certain sizes of thiolate-protected AuNPs can be successfully crystallized and structurally characterized, while others present challenges in this regard, is currently unknown. Liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) is a cutting-edge microscopy technique, which can enable researchers to capture images of a thin liquid layer using conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the past decades, such imaging progress made by LPTEM has created opportunities for microscopists to study dynamic chemical processes such as biomolecular assemblies, polymer mechanics, and colloidal phase nanoparticle growth [<a href=\"#ozae044.844-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"26e75d6601e2fd27357fbf08feb980291f286a61141de468329ffa992e2bd3dc","category":"Environment"}
