This study proposes a machine learning approach to recommend a university degree based on high school and university standardised test results, incorporating students' socioeconomic information as input variables. The objective is to develop a tool for studentsâ€™ decision-making, supporting the sustainable development goal of Quality Education by providing a data schema to maximise the likelihood of a successful match between the student's profile and the academic program. With its focus on equity in education, this study provides a data-driven approach to assist students in selecting suitable university degrees, aiming to improve educational outcomes and inspire a more equitable education system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b99bff28ab33eb3427f6f8888092bfbf1d9d295206d1ce25f398c41d6e50d53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
