{"title":"Therapeutic Effect of Nerium oleander in Acetic Acid-Induced Ulcerative Colitis Model in BALB-C Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1237/v1","date":1718757182000,"content":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disorder that poses significant challenges in terms of prevention and treatment due to its complex etiology. The multifaceted nature of IBD's underlying causes means that developing effective interventions requires a nuanced understanding and innovative approaches. As a result, research into new drugs and treatment strategies has become a critical area of focus in the scientific community.Among the promising areas of research are phenolic acids, which are abundant in plant-based diets. These compounds have garnered attention because of their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which have shown potential in alleviating colitis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of phenolic acids, highlighting their structures and primary dietary sources, specifically focusing on benzoic acid and cinnamic acid.We delve into the role of phenolic acids as a nutritional therapy for the prevention and treatment of IBD. The review synthesizes findings from animal and cell experiments, which have demonstrated that phenolic acids can effectively mitigate IBD symptoms induced by drug exposure or genetic predispositions. The mechanisms through which phenolic acids exert their beneficial effects include enhancing intestinal mucosal barrier function, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting the overactivation of the immune response, and regulating the balance of intestinal microbiota.The evidence from these studies underscores the therapeutic potential of Nerium oleander in Acetic acid-induced Ulcerative Colitis in BALB-C mice and its amelioration. However, our observations also highlight the necessity for further basic and clinical research to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of phenolic acids and their derivatives as novel therapeutic agents for IBD. Comprehensive investigations will be essential to translate these promising findings into practical treatments for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c701f37d6625fff6414f6e7d72cbebdce0b482164e088fcbeb9435d3bfd315a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
