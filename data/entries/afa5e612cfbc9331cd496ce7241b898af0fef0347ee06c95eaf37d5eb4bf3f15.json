{"title":"Advances on Catalyst Support Modification and their Effect on Fischer Tropsch Synthesis: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1617/v1","date":1716537151000,"content":"One important goal of research on heterogeneous catalysis for Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is to understand the connection linking catalyst morphology and its activity. Development of these effective catalysts highlights the potential for understanding the effectiveness of promoted supported catalysts and revealing their complex and dynamic effects in FTS. The metal-support interaction (MSI) is influenced by the physicochemical and textural features provided by the modified support and can directly influence the sizes of active metal crystallites, reactants and/or products mass transfer, dispersion, mechanical strength, stability and consequently the adsorption-desorption characteristics of the catalyst. Herein, this article explores the general strategies for modifying silica supports (achieved through doping, coating, or promoting the support or support precursor) and how these strategies can be manipulated to further alter catalyst performance and product selectivity by enhancing the amount of active metal species and improving the intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF). Furthermore, the review emphasises a new strategy (the inverse model of the silica support modification) aiming at overcoming the challenges posed by active metal coating or coverage, as well as pore blockages by promoters that occur during conventional preparation of  promoted silica supported FT catalysts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"afa5e612cfbc9331cd496ce7241b898af0fef0347ee06c95eaf37d5eb4bf3f15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
