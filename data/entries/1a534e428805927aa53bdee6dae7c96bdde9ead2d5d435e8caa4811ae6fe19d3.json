{"title":"Seeing across variable ecological and social environments: comparative eye morphology of marine and terrestrial hermit crabs (Decapoda: Anomura: Coenobitidae, Paguridae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae025/7698211?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Vision is a ubiquitous sensory modality adapted to vastly different environments, which place variable selection pressures on both macro- and microscopic dimensions of external eye morphology. The hermit crab clade (Crustacea: Decapoda: Anomura) spans environments from sea to land, yet, no systematic comparisons in eye morphology have been made between any species. We compared three species of hermit crabs inhabiting different ecological and social environments: two terrestrial species, one of which (<span>Coenobita compressus</span><a href=\"#CIT0047\">H. Milne Edwards, 1837</a>) is highly social and inhabits a flat, open diurnal habitat, and another (<span>C. clypeatus</span> Herbst, 1791) is its sister species that inhabits a rugged forested nocturnal habitat; and a third (<span>Pagurus longicarpus</span><a href=\"#CIT0054\">Say, 1817</a>) inhabits a marine intertidal habitat and is less social. We compared macroscopic eye morphology between species as well as microscopic differences in ommatidium-facet density and diameter within eyes. We found that eye dimensions (length, width, and thickness), but not overall volume, differed significantly between marine and terrestrial species. Furthermore, the highly social <span>C. compressus</span> had a significantly larger eye volume compared to its sister species, <span>C. clypeatus</span>, which is not as social. Larger eyes in <span>C. compressus</span> might be linked to its social lifestyle, where vision has been shown to be critical to finding conspecifics. All three species had a higher density of facets in the ventral compared to dorsal region of the eye. Our comparisons of external eye morphology revealed microscopic similarities but notable macroscopic variation between species, thus laying a foundation for future phylogenetically controlled tests within this species-rich clade, including comparisons of internal eye morphology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"1a534e428805927aa53bdee6dae7c96bdde9ead2d5d435e8caa4811ae6fe19d3","category":"Environment"}
