{"title":"Does visual or mechanosensory disruption influence risk assessment in coral reef fishes: a preliminary study","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15941?af=R","date":1726904629000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Interpreting and responding to environmental cues from different modalities has survival value. In fish, the role of multimodal perception has been studied in regard to both foraging and risk assessment, with modalities including vision, olfaction, and mechanoreception via lateral lines. We studied reef fish boldness by placing novel objects that obstructed vision, lateral line use, or both into a coral reef environment with native algal samples inside, and then quantifying exploration as a function of obstruction type and as a function of functional diet groups (herbivores, omnivores, carnivores). Fish were more neophobic with more sensory obstructions, displaying longer latencies to visitation across all novel objects. Fish were also less likely to pass by objects that blocked multiple perceptual modalities. Across diets, there is early evidence that different functional groups respond differently to novelty. However, this conclusion requires further study. Overall, our findings provide key insights into perceptual ecology. In turn, this knowledge can be applied to understanding the effects of novel anthropogenic modifications in the marine environment. Such modifications may include positive activities like the construction of substrates to restore coral reefs, coral transplantation to restore reefs, as well as the negative consequences of construction and pollution.</p>","author":"Riley Bowers, \nNicholas Burgos, \nRyan Meshanko, \nSapna Thaker, \nAllison Yan, \nSean O'Fallon, \nDaniel T.
