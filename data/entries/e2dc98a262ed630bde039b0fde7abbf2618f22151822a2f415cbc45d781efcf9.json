{"title":"Common Chemical Plasticizer di(2-Ethhylhexyl) Phthalate 1 Exposure Exacerbates Coxsackievirus B3 Infection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1523/v1","date":1726769320000,"content":"Di(2-ethhylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a common plastic rubberizer. DEHP leaches from plastic matrices and is under increasing scrutiny as numerous studies have linked it to negative human health manifestations. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) is a human pathogen that typically causes subclinical infections but can sometimes cause severe diseases such as pancreatitis, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis. Though CVB infections are common, severe illness is relatively rare, and it is unclear what factors mediate severity of disease. Here we show that DEHP drastically increases CVB infection in a variety of human cell types. While not entirely clear what cellular processes underly DEHPâ€™s proviral properties, we observe that DEHP may subvert CVB-induced interferon signaling and elevate levels of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins which appear to bolster CVB infection. We hypothesize that DEHP may represent a major environmental factor associated with the severity of CVB infection. Further understanding how DEHP exacerbates infection may better elucidate its potential role as a proviral environmental factor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2dc98a262ed630bde039b0fde7abbf2618f22151822a2f415cbc45d781efcf9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
