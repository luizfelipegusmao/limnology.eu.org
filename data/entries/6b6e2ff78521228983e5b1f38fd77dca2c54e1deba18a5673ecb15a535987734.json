{"title":"An Enhanced Adaptive Ensemble Kalman Filter for AUV Integrated Navigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1800/v1","date":1729732843000,"content":"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are highly efficient tools for underwater exploration, capable of carrying various payloads to perform specific missions as needed. To ensure the success of these missions and the spatiotemporal accuracy of sampled data, integrated navigation systems and appropriate filtering algorithms are essential. These systems process and merge motion data to provide accurate positioning information. The most commonly used algorithms in integrated navigation systems are Kalman filter and its nonlinear derivatives. Of these, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is particularly notable for its ability to handle nonlinear systems by incorporating Monte Carlo methods. This study proposes an enhanced adaptive EnKF algorithm to improve the smoothness and accuracy of the filtering process. Instead of the conventional Gaussian distribution, this algorithm employs a Laplace distribution to construct the system state vector and observation vector ensembles, enhancing stability against non-Gaussian noise. Additionally, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the number of vector members in the ensemble using adaptive mechanism by specifying thresholds during filtering, to adapt the requirements of real-world observational settings. Using measured data from field trials, including DVL, GPS, and electronic compass data, we examine the effects of various parameter settings on the algorithm's performance. Optimal parameter settings are identified to fine-tune and verify the filtering algorithm as well as its adaptive capability. The results demonstrate that the enhanced adaptive EnKF algorithm exhibits superior filtering performance in terms of both accuracy and smoothness compared to the conventional EnKF and EKF algorithms. This indicates the significant advantages of our proposed algorithm for AUV navigation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b6e2ff78521228983e5b1f38fd77dca2c54e1deba18a5673ecb15a535987734","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
