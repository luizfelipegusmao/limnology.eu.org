The study was designed to assess the burden of poor mental health and wellbeing among persons affected by leprosy or BU in Nigeria</p> Methods <p>A community based cross-sectional study design was employed. The study involved persons affected by leprosy or BU. Ten local government areas with the highest number of notified leprosy or BU cases between 2014 and 2018 in southern Nigeria were purposively selected. Information were obtained using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 (GAD-7), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) and OSLO Social Support Scale. Outcome measure was poor mental health/wellbeing and was determined by proportion of respondents who had depressive symptoms, anxiety disorder and poor mental wellbeing.</p> Results <p>A total of 635 persons affected by leprosy or BU participated in the study. The mean age of respondents was 43.8±17.0 years and highest proportion, 22.2% were in age group, 40–49 years. Majority of respondents, 50.7% were males. A higher proportion of respondents, 89.9% had depressive symptoms, 79.4% had anxiety disorders and 66.1% had poor mental wellbeing. Majority, 57.2% had poor mental health/wellbeing. Among the respondents, there was a strong positive correlation between depression and anxiety scores, (r = 0.772, p&lt;0.001). There was a weak negative correlation between depression score and WEMWBS score, (r = -0.457, p&lt;0.001); anxiety score and WEMWBS score, (r = -0.483, p&lt;0.001). Predictors of poor mental health/wellbeing included having no formal education, (AOR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.1–3.3), being unemployed, (AOR = 3.4, 95%CI: 2.2–5.3), being affected by leprosy, (AOR = 0.2, 95%CI: 0.1–0.4) and having poor social support, (AOR = 6.6, 95%CI: 3.7–11.8).</p> Conclusions <p>The burden of poor mental health/wellbeing among persons affected by leprosy or BU is very high. There is need to include mental health interventions in the management of persons affected with leprosy or BU. Equally important is finding a feasible, cost-effective and sustainable approach to delivering mental health care for persons affected with leprosy or BU at the community level. Improving educational status and social support of persons affected by leprosy or BU are essential. Engaging them in productive activities will be of essence.</p>","author":"Edmund Ndudi Ossai","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"551cbe135a928f63b52e323dbbc59414841197cc35605a1c6ecbb7b4dff17d45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
