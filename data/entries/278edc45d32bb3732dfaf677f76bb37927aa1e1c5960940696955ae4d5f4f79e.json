Faster cameras and detectors have made it possible to acquire this data rapidly, but to achieve an optimal field of view and resolution in both real and reciprocal space, large data volumes are necessary. Adding the fifth dimension of time to capture an entire series of 4D data cubes during an <span>in-situ</span> experiment leads to even larger data volumes [<a href=\"#ozae044.1085-B1\">1</a>]. The mostly manual recording and processing of continuous 4D STEM (5D) datasets has resulted in only a few labs pursuing this approach in the past.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"278edc45d32bb3732dfaf677f76bb37927aa1e1c5960940696955ae4d5f4f79e","category":"Environment"}
