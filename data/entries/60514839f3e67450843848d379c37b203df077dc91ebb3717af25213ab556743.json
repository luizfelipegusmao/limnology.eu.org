{"title":"Evaluation of Bonding Properties Between Cfrp Laminate and Concrete Using Externally Bonded Reinforcement on Transverse Grooves (Ebrotg) Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1891/v1","date":1727166183000,"content":"The external bonding system using CFRP composite was widely used for strengthening of different structures worldwide. However, premature debonding in this strengthening technique is the critical failure that leads to the fiber not reaching its ultimate capacity. In order to enhance the capacity of the externally bonded (EB) FRP and to slow the premature debonding failure mechanism, numerous anchoring techniques have been applied to improve the bonding capacity. The externally-bonded reinforcement on grooves (EBROG) technology is one of the strategies that have been recently developed to postponing the debonding issue. Although the extensive studies have been conducted in literature on (EBROG) method, most of these studies have been focused on the bonding characteristics of longitudinal grooves direction, and there is lack in studies about effect of different design and configurations (width, height, and spacing) of transverse grooves direction. In present study, an experimental investigation was carried out to study the bond behavior of the externally bonded reinforcement on transverse grooves (EBROTG) technique on the CFRP-to-concrete joints involving different parameters, including groove width, depth, spaces between grooves, strain values, and bond stress-slip relationships. 24 concrete prisms, divided into 8 groups of three specimens, were tested using a single-lap shear test set-up. The result of testing proved that the EBROTG method furnished a proper anchor system and highly enhanced the bonding force of the tests.  The increasing range in bond strength with the specimens reinforced by the transverse grooving method was ranging from 11 to 86 % compared with the externally bonded reinforcement (EBR) reflecting the effect of different width, depth and distance between grooves","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"60514839f3e67450843848d379c37b203df077dc91ebb3717af25213ab556743","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
