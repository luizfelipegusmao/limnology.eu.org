{"title":"Percutaneous Thoracic Duct-Cistena Chyli Coil and Glue Embolization via Antgrade Sublumbar Cisterna Chyli Access in a Cat with Chylothorax","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1297/v1","date":1718787996000,"content":"An 8-year-old, entire male, Domestic Shorthair cat was presented due to acute onset of dyspnoea/tachypnoea. Thoracic x-ray revealed presence of significant amount of bilateral pleural effusion. Fluid analysis indicated chylous effusion. The CT examination revealed many thoracic and abdominal abnormalities without a clear explanation for chylothorax. CT-lymphangiogram followed by surgical management were recommended. These options were declined by the owner due to high cost, however, a consent was given for attempt at percutaneous thoracic duct embolization. A percutaneous access to the cisterna chyli was successfully performed with an 18G vascular access needle via a right-sided sublumbar approach under ultrasound guidance. Subsequently, a 3F microcatheter and a 0.014-inch guidewire were introduced through the needle to canulate the thoracic duct. Thoracic duct lymphangiography was performed with 50:50 iohexol: 0.9% sodium chloride mixture revealing presence of dilated, tortuous and leaky cranial mediastinal lymphatics. Two helical microcoils were deployed within the caudal thoracic duct. Embolization of both the thoracic duct and the cisterna chyli was completed with mixture of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate: ethiodized oil mixture in 1:2 (glue-to-oil) ratio using a ‘pull-back’ technique. The cat recovered uneventfully from the procedure with immediate resolution of chylothorax.  However, the patient continued to suffer from non-chylous pleural effusion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63222e4ab9715ebec5cfa221a116648e82ba011a5c3474c145d50bee36f512e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
