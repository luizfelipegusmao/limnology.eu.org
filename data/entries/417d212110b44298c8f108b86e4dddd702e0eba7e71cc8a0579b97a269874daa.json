{"title":"Novel Diagnostic and Immunotherapeutic Approaches for Wheat Allergy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0885/v1","date":1715612743000,"content":"Wheat, a component of the staple diet globally, is a common food allergen in children. The symptoms of wheat allergy (WA) range from skin rash to shortness of breath, significantly impairing quality of life. Following initial clinical suspicion, individuals may undergo wheat allergen-specific skin prick test (SPT), blood test for serum immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels or oral food challenge. Conventional management of WA lies in wheat avoidance, yet accidental consumption may be inevitable owing to the ubiquity of wheat in various food products. This article aims to provide an overview of the immunologic pathway of WA, followed by its novel diagnostic methods, namely alcohol-soluble SPT extracts, component-resolved diagnosis and basophil activation test (BAT). The mechanisms underlying wheat allergen-specific oral immunotherapy (OIT) as well as a summary of the efficacy, tolerability and safety of related clinical trials will then be discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"417d212110b44298c8f108b86e4dddd702e0eba7e71cc8a0579b97a269874daa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
