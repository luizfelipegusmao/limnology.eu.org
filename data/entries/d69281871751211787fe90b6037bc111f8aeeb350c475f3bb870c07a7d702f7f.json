{"title":"Predictive Approach to the Phase Behavior of Polymer-Water-Surfactant-Electrolyte Systems Using a Pseudosolvent Concept","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1645/v1","date":1716544283000,"content":"A predictive approach to the phase behavior of four-component poly-mer-water-surfactant-electrolyte systems is formulated, by viewing the four-component system as a binary polymer-pseudosolvent system, with the pseudosolvent representing water, surfactant, and the electrolyte. The phase stability of this binary system is examined using the framework of the lattice fluid model of Sanchez and Lacombe. In the lattice fluid model, a pure component is represented by three equation of state parameters, the hard-core volume of a lattice site ( ), the number of lattice sites occupied by the component (r) and its characteristic energy ( ). We in-troduce the extra thermodynamic postulate that r and   for the pseudosolvent are the same as for water and all surfactant-electrolyte composition dependent characteristics of the pseudosolvent can be represented solely through its characteristic energy parameter.  The key implication of the postulate is that the phase behavior of polymer-pseudosolvent systems will be identical for all pseudosolvents with equal values of the characteristic energy, despite their varying real compo-sitions.  Based on the pseudosolvent model, illustrative phase diagrams have been computed for several four-component systems containing alkyl sulfonate/sulfate surfactants, electrolytes and anionic or nonionic polymers. The pseudosolvent model is shown to describe all important trends in experimentally observed phase behavior, pertaining to polymer and surfactant molecular characteristics. Most importantly, the pseudosolvent model allows one to construct a priori phase diagrams for any polymer-surfactant-electrolyte system, knowing just one experimental com-position data for a system at the phase boundary, using available thermodynamic data on sur-factants and electrolytes and without requiring any information on the polymer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d69281871751211787fe90b6037bc111f8aeeb350c475f3bb870c07a7d702f7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
