In high-N-requiring crops, for example, maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.), N limitation lowers grain yields (<a href=\"#kiae296-B2\">Swarbreck et al. 2019</a>). Unfortunately, applying excess N fertilizer cannot always be the solution because it is a source of pollution in the form of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and by excess N leaching into soil and water (<a href=\"#kiae296-B1\">Schulte-Uebbing et al. 2022</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"0647fc29f6d6e1c938ccd3c4465b5e1dffec2801b879d8d13430953f0da6368a","category":"Environment"}
