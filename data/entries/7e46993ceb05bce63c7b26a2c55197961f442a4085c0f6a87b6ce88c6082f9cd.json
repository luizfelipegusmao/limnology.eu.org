The prospective observational cohort study included patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease. Psychologic evaluation through social-demographic question-naires was obtained before surgery (T1), postoperatively (T2), and 3 months after surgery (T3). The HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) was used to evaluate anxious-depressive symptoms and the PCL-5 (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5) compared the on-set of post-surgical distress and anxiety and depressive symptoms.
