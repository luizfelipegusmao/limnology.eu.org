{"title":"A Novel Hashcode-based Duplication Reduction via Thresholding Approach for Large-scale Web Documents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0443/v1","date":1722952592000,"content":"Modern search engines encounter a significant challenge when it comes to handling duplicate and nearly identical web pages, particularly during the indexing process for vast amounts of web content. This issue can lead to slow search results and increased costs due to the accumulation of storage space necessary for storing indexes. To tackle this issue, different techniques have been proposed to find similar websites. However, it has long been a challenge in research to distinguish between web pages. In the current study, sentence-level features i.e., hashcode and thresholding are used to determine the nearly identical web pages. We employ an adaptive threshold that enables the application of our model in both large- and small-scale settings. The benchmark datasets consisting of Shakespeareâ€™s collections, free text, job descriptions, and Reuters-21578 are used to test the proposed approach. With an accuracy of 0.99 and an F1-score of 0.97, the proposed technique outperforms existing methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5549418d5faffffc7fbe3fd44309dfdbaa1442e20e0ffd378d56c577cf38b8f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
