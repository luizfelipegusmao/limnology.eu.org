Developments in STEM-EELS over the last two decades include development of high-performance electron monochromators, improved spectrometer electron optics and introduction of new detectors with a high detector quantum efficiency (DQE) [<a href=\"#ozae044.973-B2\">2</a>]. For example, using a STEM equipped with a thermally assisted field emission source enables EELS to be performed with an energy resolution (DE) in the range 0.5-0.8eV. Introduction of a commercially available monochromated instrument at the turn of the century enabled DE&lt;0.2eV. [<a href=\"#ozae044.973-B3\">3</a>]. While subsequent improvements in electronics and electron optics delivered incremental advances, it was the introduction of the a-design that revoultionized performance [<a href=\"#ozae044.973-B4\">4</a>]. This design initially delivered DE in 10-20meV range, but improvements in electron optics and detectors have enabled &lt;4 meV to be achieved [<a href=\"#ozae044.973-B2\">2</a>]. This opens new opportunities for the study of vibrational excitations using STEM-EELS.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4d8abb3727402d22aa9578ac744f205f72bfdd1a9eed7a2c3d7227a3ad5cef1d","category":"Environment"}
