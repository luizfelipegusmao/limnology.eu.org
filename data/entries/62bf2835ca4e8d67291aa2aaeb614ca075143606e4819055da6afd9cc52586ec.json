Owing to the distinctive characteristics of this device, the past few years have witnessed the consistent increase on the application of this system in a variety of cultural heritage materials. In fact, the technique has been useful to understand microbial biodeteriogens diversity and some of their metabolic and biodeteriogenic features. Considering the immense potential for application of this system, this manuscript explores and discusses further possibilities of the technique, focusing on helping understand critical questions on the cultural heritage biodeterioration area. Its application in various differential contexts, has opened doors for prospective applications on other interesting sub-areas of research meriting future investigations, including: biodeteriogens genome and transcriptome analysis, metatranscriptomics, biodeteriorative metabolism studies, inter and intra kingdom interactions analysis, resistome profiling, object history and context studies, in situ applications, bioprospecting and biotechnology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62bf2835ca4e8d67291aa2aaeb614ca075143606e4819055da6afd9cc52586ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
