{"title":"Structural constraints of pyocin S2 import through the ferripyoverdine receptor FpvAI","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae124/7632795?rss=1","date":1711497600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) mediate energized transport of essential nutrients into gram-negative bacteria. TBDTs are increasingly being exploited for the delivery of antibiotics to drug-resistant bacteria. While much is known about ground state complexes of TBDTs, few details have emerged about the transport process itself. In this study, we exploit bacteriocin parasitization of a TBDT to probe the mechanics of transport. Previous work has shown that the N-terminal domain of <span>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>â€“specific bacteriocin pyocin S2 (PyoS2<sub>NTD</sub>) is imported through the pyoverdine receptor FpvAI. PyoS2<sub>NTD</sub> transport follows the opening of a proton-motive force-dependent pore through FpvAI and the delivery of its own TonB box that engages TonB. We use molecular models and simulations to formulate a complete translocation pathway for PyoS2<sub>NTD</sub> that we validate using protein engineering and cytotoxicity measurements. We show that following partial removal of the FpvAI plug domain which occludes the channel, the pyocin's N-terminus enters the channel by electrostatic steering and ratchets to the periplasm. Application of force, mimicking that exerted by TonB, leads to unraveling of PyoS2<sub>NTD</sub> as it squeezes through the channel. Remarkably, while some parts of PyoS2<sub>NTD</sub> must unfold, complete unfolding is not required for transport, a result we confirmed by disulfide bond engineering. Moreover, the section of the FpvAI plug that remains embedded in the channel appears to serve as a buttress against which PyoS2<sub>NTD</sub> is pushed to destabilize the domain. Our study reveals the limits of structural deformation that accompanies import through a TBDT and the role the TBDT itself plays in accommodating transport.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"242f21be34db5e645c0b3be9cb62f584ddfb8d804ab15d1d463e4c5b0196b64d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
