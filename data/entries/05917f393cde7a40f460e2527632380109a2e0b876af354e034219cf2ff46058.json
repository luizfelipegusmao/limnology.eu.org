The methodology integrates numerical simulations with modern neural network techniques, particularly focusing on the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) method. This innovative approach combines artificial neural networks (ANNs) with physical equations, offering a more efficient and accurate way to model various complex processes and phenomena. The proposed mathematical model, based on the Euler equation, has been meticulously implemented using the Python language. Verification with analytical solutions ensures the accuracy and reliability of the computations. In the research, a comprehensive comparative analysis was conducted between results obtained using the PINN method and those from conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches. The analysis highlighted the advantages of the PINN method, which produced smoother pressure and velocity fluctuation profiles while reducing computation time, demonstrating its potential as a transformative modeling tool. The data derived from this study are of paramount importance for ensuring ongoing energy supply reliability and can also be used to create predictive models related to gas behavior in pipelines. The application of modeling techniques for gas flow simulation has the potential to revolutionize the integrity of our energy infrastructure and utilization of gas resources. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the effectiveness of such models relies on continuous monitoring and frequent updates to ensure alignment with real-world conditions. This research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of compressible gas flows but also underscores the crucial role of advanced modeling methodologies in the sustainable management of gas resources for both current and future generations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05917f393cde7a40f460e2527632380109a2e0b876af354e034219cf2ff46058","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
