{"title":"Complementing the Western Scientific Approach with Indigenous Knowledge","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ae/article/70/1/9/7633253?rss=1","date":1710979200000,"content":"<span>Conservation practices play a critical role in protecting the ecosystems surrounding us, which helps ensure the survival of insect species that we cherish as entomologists.
