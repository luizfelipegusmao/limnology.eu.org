{"title":"Geomorphic context in process‐based river restoration","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4236?af=R","date":1709626003000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Process-based river restoration seeks to restore processes such as channel-floodplain connectivity that create and maintain river corridor functions. Process-based restoration can fail to produce the desired results if geomorphic context is not effectively incorporated into restoration design. Geomorphic context of a river reach refers to the controls on contemporary river form and process. Controls at the catchment- to reach-scale include geologic history, biophysical characteristics, legacies of past human alterations, position within the river network, river corridor geometry, base level stability, disturbance regime, and contemporary human alterations of the river corridor. We conceptualize a river corridor as reflecting the interactions among fluxes of material and the geomorphic context. We discuss how an understanding of geomorphic context can be used to select a restoration approach and provide examples of how restoration can fail to achieve desired outcomes when geomorphic context is not considered. Within the toolbox of methods used to implement process-based restoration, we differentiate the alteration of inputs to the river corridor and fluxes of material through the corridor from alteration of form and/or connectivity within the river corridor. Historical, biotic, geologic/geomorphic, and reference sites can be used to inform process-based restoration targets. Restoration is strongly influenced by human perceptions of what is appropriate and achievable at a site and diverse communities influencing restoration at a site may differ in their perceptions. Geomorphically based conceptual guidelines, such as the River Styles Framework, provide an effective platform for incorporating an understanding of geomorphic context into process-based river restoration.</p>","author":"Ellen Wohl, \nSara Rathburn, \nSarah Dunn, \nEmily Iskin, \nAaron Katz, \nAnna Marshall, \nMickey Means‐Brous, \nJulianne Scamardo, \nShayla Triantafillou, \nHiromi Uno","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"cae73fe7ec5dde7e899c10e7a5d81ea840e6e48786a43c10e532fece8ac1457f","category":"Environment"}
