{"title":"Mitigating Threats in LoRaWAN Air Pollution Monitoring: Blockchain-Integrated Wireless Security for Azores Archipelago","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1601/v1","date":1713951961000,"content":"The Azores Archipelago is a collection of volcanic islands near northwestern Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of the importance of accurate environmental monitoring for the advancement of research, transportation and tourism, a LoRaWan Sensor Network was developed to monitor levels of air pollution across these islands. This study presents an approach to the implementation of a blockchain network that is both lightweight and scalable, with the goal of preventing man-in-the-middle attacks on the design of sensor networks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"544914ac7c6fc814e21ad29321825ef5b77bc9c90812dacf7dbe83f5ed9f1c4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
