{"title":"Túngara frog call-timing decisions arise as internal rhythms interact with fluctuating chorus noise","link":"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/doi/10.1093/beheco/arae034/7658575?rss=1","date":1714089600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>For chorusing males, optimally timing their calls relative to nearby rivals’ calls and fluctuations in background chorus noise is crucial for reproductive success. A caller’s acoustic environment will vary by chorus density and the properties of his chorus-mates’ calls and will fluctuate unpredictably due to chorusing dynamics emerging among his chorus-mates. Thus, callers must continuously monitor moment-to-moment fluctuations in the acoustic scene they perceive at the chorus for advantageous times to call. In live experimental choruses, we investigated the factors influencing túngara frog call-timing responses to chorus-mates’ calls on an interaction-by-interaction basis, revealing that intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced call-timing decisions. Callers were more likely to overlap calls from smaller chorus-mates and chorus-mates at intermediate distances, as well as calls containing lower frequencies and exhibiting lower final amplitude minima. Consequently, variation among males in call properties led to variation in levels of call-interference received when calling in the same social environment. Additionally, callers were more likely to overlap chorus-mates’ calls after experiencing extended periods of inhibition and were less likely to overlap synchronized chorus-mates’ calls relative to single calls. In chorusing species, female choice is influenced by inter-caller dynamics, selecting for male call-timing strategies which, in turn, constitute the selective environment further refining these same strategies. Thus, understanding the specific factors driving call-timing decisions is essential for understanding how sexual selection operates in chorusing taxa.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Behavioral Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"1db0533e04d0549951ccffff4320904ff6ab62ef3f2aa22718600b7dc255e125","entryHash":"975c1a87ada2ad73a5e46f4ba1fdb30b898653e4ebf8dda4bf428da0929cc57f","category":"Environment"}
