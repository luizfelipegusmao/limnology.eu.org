{"title":"Green synthesis of zero‐valent copper nanoparticles for removal of D‐yellow 119 textile dye from aqueous medium","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14473?af=R","date":1727083930000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Zero-valent copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) were beneficially green synthesized via Ficus Benjamina leaves. Applying scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Ficus Benjamina nano zero-valent copper (FB-nZVCu), an innovative adsorbent, was examined. The obtained zero-valent CuNPs have a size range of 16–18 nm. The removal of D-yellow 119 dye from textile wastewater was tested using this novel adsorbent. Many operating parameters were examined and tested to control the adsorbent's maximum removal efficiency. These variables included dye concentration, stirring rate, time, pH, and adsorbent dosage. Different adsorption mechanisms have been tested, and the Langmuir isotherm (<i>q</i>\n<sub>max</sub> = 21.83 mg g<sup>−1</sup>) and (<i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.9993) represent adequate for the adsorption process. The FB-nZVCu green adsorbent is a promising material for eliminating D-yellow 119 from simulated and real samples, according to the data obtained and the fruitful analysis. The impact of different operating factors was examined using IBM SPSS Statistics software. They were shown to be responsible for approximately 94% of the factors influencing the removal process.</p>","author":"Mohamed A. Zayed, \nSoha A. Abdel‐Gawad, \nHossam M.
