The Chinese pond mussel <em>Sinanodonta woodiana</em> is a fast-growing, high-filtering, and highly fecund unionid bivalve that has expanded rapidly throughout Europe in the last several decades. Human-mediated vectors such as fish aquaculture and pet shop trade are believed to be primary drivers of the musselâ€™s spread, but the specific dispersal pathways of <em>S. woodiana</em> remain unclear. We analyzed eleven microsatellites in 245 <em>S. woodiana</em> individuals from seven wild populations and three pet shops to assess genetic relatedness potential sources, and dispersal pathways of <em>S. woodiana</em> in Bavaria, Germany. Wild populations shared a single mitochondrial haplotype present in all European populations and shop-sourced individuals were genetically similar to wild populations. Only one wild population was structurally different than all other populations, which may be explained by its dispersal trajectory. Our results provide the first genetically informed insights into <em>S. woodiana</em> dispersal in the context of human activity. We underscore the value of genetic tools in invasive species management, which can uncover patterns of dispersal even on local scales.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"79f756ea99b12f1973b615d326c2f6ecb5002b6056701fe81e1bd38c1ae90d4a","category":"Environment"}
