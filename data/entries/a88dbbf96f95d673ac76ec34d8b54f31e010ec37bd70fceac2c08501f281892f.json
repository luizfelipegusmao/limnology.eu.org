{"title":"Female migrants into Fukushima: A qualitative approach to their migration-support needs after the nuclear accident","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309013","date":1723816800000,"content":"<p>by Tomoyuki Kobayashi, Tomoo Hidaka, Rie Mizuki, Akemi Kobayashi, Masaharu Maeda</p>\r\n\r\nWe aimed to examine the support needs of women who migrated to Fukushima Prefecture after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. In recent years, the presence of migrants has become an important part of the government’s reconstruction policy for affected areas. However, there is insufficient research on the status of migrants in these areas, and it is unclear what kind of support the migrants, especially females, require to encourage further migration to the area. We conducted three semi-structured interviews each with four women who had migrated to Fukushima after the accident. The narratives obtained from the interviews were summarized into categories through open coding and were finally presented as support needs in the form of a four-quadrant diagram. Four needs were identified for female migrants in areas affected by the radiation disaster: “soft adaptation needs,” “lifestyle constancy needs,” “female empowerment needs,” and “community participation needs.” Female migrants in the affected areas may be marginalized in terms of receiving migrant support. Key strategies for supporting female migrants in radiation disaster areas include providing an environment in which they can relax, interact with Fukushima and its residents, and address intersectionality.","author":"Tomoyuki Kobayashi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a88dbbf96f95d673ac76ec34d8b54f31e010ec37bd70fceac2c08501f281892f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
