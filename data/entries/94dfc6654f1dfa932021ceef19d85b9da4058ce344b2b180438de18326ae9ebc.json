The 20 proteinogenic amino acids constitute the set of building blocks for the diverse array of proteins responsible for nearly all cellular tasks. But far from being just pieces to assemble proteins, amino acids are crucial in many aspects of plant physiology (<a href=\"#koad322-B4\">Trovato et al. 2021</a>). They have an active role in plant development not only as important nitrogen donors but also by being involved in plant biotic and abiotic stress responses. This highlights the essential need for a comprehensive understanding of amino acid biology, including their transport routes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"94dfc6654f1dfa932021ceef19d85b9da4058ce344b2b180438de18326ae9ebc","category":"Environment"}
