{"title":"Immune Responses of Mango Callus Infected by Agrobacterium tumefaciens Inhibited Transformation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0715/v1","date":1720507589000,"content":"Mango industry played important roles in the economy of tropical and subtropical regions in China. Embryo abortion, flesh rotten, pericarp stain and so on always result in heavy loss. Transgenic breeding is a potential way for solving these problems. However, dependable protocol for mango transgene has not been reported until now. In this research, we found that after mango embryogenic callus were infected by Agrobacterium, most callus necrotized and died. No seedling was differentiated from the survived callus. Contents of 106 compounds in mango callus infected by Agrobacterium were found significantly different from those in control. The top 7 up-regulated compounds were gallic acid, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, dihydrotricetin, ubiquinone, dihydrokaempferol, D-erythrose-4-phosphate and cyanidin. The expressions of ROS-related genes, gallic acid synthesis genes, and defense related genes in callus infected by Agrobacterium were significantly higher than those in control. The growth of Agrobacterium on culturing plate pipetting gallic acid was inhibited. Mango callus infected by Agrobacterium transformed with type III secretion system gene cluster (T3SS) and effector gene AvrPto isolated from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 brown and necrotize slower than those infected by Agrobacterium transformed with net vector (NV). The contents of ROS in callus in-fected by Agrobacterium (T3SS-AvrPto) were less than those in callus infected by Agrobacterium (NV). The expressions of genes participated in immune responses in mango callus infected by Agrobacterium (T3SS-AvrPto) were also less than those in mango callus infected by Agrobacterium (NV). The transformation rate of mango callus infected with Agrobacterium (T3SS-AvrPto-gfp) was 1.6 %. No callus infected with Agrobacterium (NV-gfp) was transformed successfully. The efficiency of mango transformation can be improved by constructing Agrobacterium strains harboring type III secretion system gene cluster and its effector gene.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6d7cac8d7de07f5fad0e5bafedf755a040def93e739614d989fcb1b36e0730b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
