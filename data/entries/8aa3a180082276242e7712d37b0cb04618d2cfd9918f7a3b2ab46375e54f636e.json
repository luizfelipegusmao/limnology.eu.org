{"title":"Combining multivariate statistical analysis to characterize changes in amino acids and volatiles during growth of Lou onion pseudostems","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13671?af=R","date":1725860041000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The main edible part of the Lou onion is the pseudostem, which is highly valued for its distinctive flavour. However, harvesting decisions for the pseudostem are often based on size and market price, with little consideration given to flavour. By clarifying the growth of flavour in pseudostems, farmers and consumers may benefit from evidence-based insights that help optimize harvesting time and maximize flavour quality.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>This study employed amino acid analysis and gas chromatography–ion migration spectroscopy (GC–IMS) to elucidate the compounds of the pseudostem across different growth phases, and 17 amino acids and 61 volatile substances. Subsequently, analysis revealed that 18 compounds, including arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), valine (Val), (<i>E</i>)-2-nonenal, decanal, 2,4-nonadienal, 2-octenal, (<i>Z</i>)-4-decenal, 2,4-decadienal benzeneacetaldehyde, linalool, eugenol, (<i>Z</i>)-6-nonen-1-ol, methyl anthranilate, 2-acetylpyridine, 3-<i>sec</i>-butyl-2-methoxypyrazine, and 2,6-dichlorophenol, were the key compounds in determining the flavour characteristics of the pseudostems, as assessed by taste activity value and relative odour activity value calculations. In addition, correlation analysis, focusing on five amino acids and 38 volatile compounds with variable importance for predictive components scores of &gt;1, identified anisaldehyde, eugenol, (<i>Z</i>)-6-nonen-1-ol, 2,4-decadienal, 3-<i>sec</i>-butyl-2-methoxypyrazine, Arg, Asp, and Val as the key differentiators and contributors to the pseudostems flavour profile.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>During the rapid growth of Lou onions just before the emergence of flower stems, the pseudostem exhibited the most prominent flavour, making this stage most suitable for harvesting compared to the regreening growth stage and the rapid growth period of the aerial bulbs. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xiaojian Hou, \nJianglong Wang, \nGuangdi Zhang, \nYu Wang, \nTing Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"8aa3a180082276242e7712d37b0cb04618d2cfd9918f7a3b2ab46375e54f636e","category":"Environment"}
