For this purpose, the deammonifying sludge available at the side stream was investigated for nitrogen (N) removal with respect to the operational factors temperature (15–30°C), pH value (6.0–8.0) and chemical oxygen demand (COD)/N ratio (≤1.5–6.0). The highest and lowest N-removal rates of 0.13 and 0.045 kg/(m<sup>3</sup> d) are achieved at 30 and 15°C, respectively. Different conditions of pH and COD/N ratios in the SBRs of Partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) significantly influenced both the metabolic processes and associated N-removal rates. The scientific insights gained from the current work signifies the possibility of mainstream PN/A at WWTPs. The current study forms a solid basis of operational window for the upcoming semi-technical trails to be conducted prior to the full-scale mainstream PN/A at WWTP Kaster and WWTPs globally.</p>","author":"Dheeraja Cheenakula, \nSvea Paulsen, \nFabian Ott, \nMarkus Grömping","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"3c66f9fc47c6c54de32ae778d5a11efe5f4321b29be28646a6688b1e550e753c","category":"Environment"}
