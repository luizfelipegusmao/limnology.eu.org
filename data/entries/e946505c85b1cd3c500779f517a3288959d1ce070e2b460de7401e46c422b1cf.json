{"title":"Water Footprint and Water Sustainability of Agroindustrial Avocado Production in a Warm Tropical Climate Municipality; A Case Study in the Michoacan Avocado Belt in Central M&eacute;xico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1384/v1","date":1716286662000,"content":"Water is a fundamental resource for ecosystems, humans, and the development of all economic sectors; it is necessary to identify and evaluate its environmental pressures or impacts. The water footprint (WF) is an appropriate indicator for the consumption of water used to produce a product. The present study uses this tool to evaluate the green and blue water requirements and the sustainability of irrigation water use for agroindustrial avocado production in Ziracuaretiro, Michoacán (2012-2021). Our analysis was based on aggregating weather and soil data at the municipal level and official government databases of avocado cultivated surface, fruit production, and water rights concessions. The analysis considers the homogeneity of information throughout the study area. We estimated that rainfed plantations require 839.03 m³/ton and irrigated plantations require 2355.80 m³/ton, with an average of 1597.47 m³/ton. In addition, we determined that avocado cultivation can demand up to 124.3% of agricultural water concessions in this municipality. In addition to the WF estimates, the analysis indicates that such studies are fundamental for decision-makers to develop and implement water use-efficiency strategies and shows the need for further research related to water consumption of avocado as a crop at more detailed scales to reduce uncertainty.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e946505c85b1cd3c500779f517a3288959d1ce070e2b460de7401e46c422b1cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
