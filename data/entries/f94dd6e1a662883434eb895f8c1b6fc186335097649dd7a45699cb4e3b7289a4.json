Following a sharp decline, aerobic heterotrophs and cellulose decomposing bacterial population recovered and the population density remained significantly higher than the pre-treatment level, indicating strong heterotrophic potential of both the phyto-piscicides in the culture system. Among the nutrient mineralizers, the sustained negative effect of both the piscicides was observed in denitrifying and ammonifying bacteria, whereas population of nitrifying and phosphate solubilizing bacteria was not affected. Because of narrower C: N ratio, CBC underwent faster decomposition thereby expressed it is manurial value quicker than MOC after exerting toxicity at the beginning. However, with distinctly higher N:P ratio CBC treatment might result in P limitation and toxicity when acting as manure in the culture system.</p>","author":"Bithilekha Mondal, \nShib Kinkar Das","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"f94dd6e1a662883434eb895f8c1b6fc186335097649dd7a45699cb4e3b7289a4","category":"Environment"}
