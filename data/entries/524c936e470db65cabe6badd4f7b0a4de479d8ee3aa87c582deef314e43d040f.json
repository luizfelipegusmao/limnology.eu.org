Lessons learned from past transformations","link":"https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/article?id=10.1371/journal.pstr.0000068","date":1687788000000,"content":"<p>by Annina Guthauser, Marco Pütz, Irmi Seidl, Roland Olschewski</p>\r\n\r\nTransformations–defined as deep, radical, non-linear, multi-dimensional, systemic processes of change–are required to avert serious threats to humanity and the environment. In this study, we have analysed past transformations in Switzerland in four environmental domains, with the aim to draw conclusions for current challenges, such as the net-zero transformation. Firstly, we have conceptualised and defined transformations. Secondly, we have applied and further developed two theoretical frameworks to (i) identify actual transformations in the four domains, and (ii) analyse crucial characteristics of these profound changes. Furthermore, we have examined relevant enabling and hindering factors for transformations. Our study is based on literature review and expert interviews, as well as triangulation workshops to align the collected information. We conclude that providing general blueprints for transformations is not possible due to the complexity and context-specific nature of these processes. However, for the net-zero transformation to be successful, we found that unprecedent efforts are needed with respect to pace, sectors involved, levels of initiative, mindset change in the broader population, and involvement of technology and research. Specifically, we recommend fast action to (i) implement a steering committee combined with citizens’ assemblies and cross-sectoral discussion platforms, (ii) encourage different actors to take initiatives at multiple levels, and (iii) enable a broad mindset change across different societal groups.","author":"Annina Guthauser","siteTitle":"PLOS Sustainability and Transformation","siteHash":"5acd099bb614e5ebff1e724af0cad6ab2b3ef1c50ce1616dc0b5d51f3d4a8e96","entryHash":"524c936e470db65cabe6badd4f7b0a4de479d8ee3aa87c582deef314e43d040f","category":"Environment"}
