{"title":"Dynamics between Classical Mechanics and Relativistic Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0706/v1","date":1715343639000,"content":"This study delves into the intricate dynamics of classical mechanics, exploring the interplay between force, mass, and energy. Through fundamental principles and mathematical formulations, it elucidates key relationships governing physical systems. Beginning with an overview of classical mechanics, the study establishes the foundational principles laid down by Newton, emphasizing concepts such as inertia, acceleration, and the relationship between force and motion. Central to the investigation is Newton's second law of motion, highlighting the direct proportionality between force and acceleration, and the inverse relationship between acceleration and mass when acted upon by a force. The study extends to the concept of effective mass, elucidating how the application of force influences the inertial mass of an object and contributes to its effective mass through the acquisition of kinetic energy. Furthermore, the study examines the total energy composition of systems, emphasizing the holistic nature of energy as a combination of potential and kinetic forms. Through the work-energy theorem, a direct link between force and kinetic energy is established, revealing how mechanical work done on an object results in changes in its kinetic energy and effective mass. Mathematical formulations and conceptual analyses provide deeper insights into the intricate relationships between force, mass, and energy, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms governing classical mechanical systems. Through validation against empirical observations and experimental data, the study ensures the accuracy and reliability of derived equations, contributing to a richer understanding of classical mechanics and paving the way for further exploration in the field of physics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b98c9cf30d5d213f9559af7aad3c004d697f39d8e06fe0eba214a008f5dee1d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
