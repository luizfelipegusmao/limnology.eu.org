{"title":"Subtilisin-like proteases from Fusarium graminearum induce plant cell death and contribute to virulence","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1681/7628148?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by <span>Fusarium graminearum</span>, causes huge annual economic losses in cereal production. To successfully colonize host plants, pathogens secrete hundreds of effectors that interfere with plant immunity and facilitate infection. However, the roles of most secreted effectors of <span>F. graminearum</span> in pathogenesis remain unclear. We analyzed the secreted proteins of <span>F. graminearum</span> and identified 255 candidate effector proteins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Five subtilisin-like family proteases (FgSLPs) were identified that can induce cell death in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> leaves. Further experiments showed that these FgSLPs induced cell death in cotton (<span>Gossypium barbadense</span>) and Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). A signal peptide and light were not essential for the cell death-inducing activity of FgSLPs. The I9 inhibitor domain and the entire C-terminus of FgSLPs were indispensable for their self-processing and cell death-inducing activity. FgSLP-induced cell death occurred independent of the plant signal transduction components BRI-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1 1 (SOBIR1), ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1), and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4). Reduced virulence was observed when <span>FgSLP1</span> and <span>FgSLP2</span> were simultaneously knocked out. This study reveals a class of secreted toxic proteins essential for <span>F. graminearum</span> virulence.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"686ae8d2d0afe9ca2399d142ceda7f0c077cd16876d13eeb3b694a1577f4a90a","category":"Environment"}
