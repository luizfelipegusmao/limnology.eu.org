{"title":"A Comparative Study on the Quality of Large Yellow Croaker (Larimichthys crocea) of Different Sizes Cultured in Different Cage Systems","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/6628371?af=R","date":1699516800000,"content":"<p>This study analyzed the quality of large yellow croaker (<i>Larimichthys crocea</i>) of different sizes cultured in farmed floating sea-cage (common cage, CC) or deep-water cage (DWC) models. The quality was assessed based on several factors: condition factors, ventral color, texture, protein and lipid content, and fatty acid composition. In addition, we analyzed and identified taste characteristics and volatile substances. The results showed that large yellow croaker cultured in DWC had a better body shape than CC with lower condition factors and higher body length-to-height ratio. The DWC cultured fish were yellower with lower lipid content than the CC cultured fish. The springiness of the flesh from fishes cultured in DWC was significantly higher than those cultured in CC. The level of immobilized water and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid was higher in DWC. The DWC culture model contributed to the sweetness, saltiness, and umami of the flesh. The flesh from DWC had a higher content of aldehydes, such as pentanal, heptanal, and hexanal. The results demonstrated that the DWC culture model is a better choice to improve the quality of large yellow croaker in terms of organoleptic properties, nutritional value, and taste.</p>","author":"Banghong Wei, \nShengyang Zheng, \nYan Gao, \nYao Zheng, \nXu Yang, \nZhongquan Jiang, \nQuanyou Guo, \nHouguo Xu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"a9fd4b452b5fe8a23bd671f3f17c6802fb6604b78c4dc9499afd4380d3cf3973","category":"Environment"}
