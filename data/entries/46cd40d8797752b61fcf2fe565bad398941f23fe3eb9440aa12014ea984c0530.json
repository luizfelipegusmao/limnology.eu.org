{"title":"Sustainable Fashion Consumption: The Narrative Documented from Fast Fashion Brands and Factors Influencing Consumers’ Purchase Intentions in Türkiye","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2037/v1","date":1717058932000,"content":": This study aims at exploring Turkish consumers’ behaviors toward purchasing green fashion. A mixed-methods approach was used in this study. Six experts from the main brands in the fashion industry in Türkiye were interviewed. A total of 268 questionnaires were collected from Turkish consumers, and their responses were analyzed. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) informed the theoretical framework of this study. The main components of the TPB were extended to include perceived consumer effectiveness. A thematic analysis was conducted to analyze and code the interviews. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted. The findings show that the key factors of the TPB, i.e., attitudes (ATTs), subjective norms (SNs), and perceived behavioral control (PBC), as well as perceived consumer effectiveness, significantly impact the intentions of Turkish consumers to purchase sustainable fashion. However, the results highlight some inconsistencies, gaps, and barriers that discourage the purchase intentions of consumers, including a lack of information, misinformation, greenwashing, green skepticism, a lack of trust, and the high cost of sustainable fashion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46cd40d8797752b61fcf2fe565bad398941f23fe3eb9440aa12014ea984c0530","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
