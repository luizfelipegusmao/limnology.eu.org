{"title":"A network comprising ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5, microRNA397b, and auxin-associated factors regulates root hair growth in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1460/7686070?rss=1","date":1717113600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) is a major light-associated transcription factor involved in plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), the role of HY5 is very well defined in regulating primary root growth and lateral root formation; however, information regarding its role in root hair development is still lacking, and little is known about the genetic pathways regulating this process. In this study, we investigated the role of HY5 and its associated components in root hair development. Detailed analysis of root hair phenotype in wild-type and light signaling mutants under light and dark conditions revealed the importance of light-dependent HY5-mediated root hair initiation. Altered auxin levels in the root apex of the <span>hy5</span> mutant and interaction of HY5 with promoters of root hair developmental genes were responsible for differential expression of root hair developmental genes and phenotype in the <span>hy5</span> mutant. The partial complementation of root hair in the <span>hy5</span> mutant after external supplementation of auxin and regaining of root hair in <span>PIN-FORMED 2</span> and <span>PIN-FORMED 2</span> mutants after grafting suggested that the auxin-mediated root hair development pathway requires HY5. Furthermore, miR397b overexpression (miR397bOX) and CRISPR/Cas9-based mutants (<span>miR397bCR</span>) indicated miR397b targets genes encoding reduced residual arabinose (RRA1/RRA2), which in turn regulate root hair growth. The regulation of the miR397b-(RRA1/RRA2) module by HY5 demonstrated its indirect role by targeting root hair cell wall genes. Together, this study demonstrated that HY5 controls root hair development by integrating auxin signaling and other miRNA-mediated pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4aeb36ac3d4d8ca2ed6715d7f21caa89957cbff4b19046c5de21c07caf06db6e","category":"Environment"}
