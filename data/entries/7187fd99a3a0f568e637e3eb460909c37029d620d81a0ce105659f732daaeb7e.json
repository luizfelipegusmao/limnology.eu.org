{"title":"Performance and hydrodynamic study of a new multi‚Äêstage solar photoreactor with immobilized ZnO for synthetic wastewater treatment","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14444?af=R","date":1717944805000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study aims to design a new multi-stage photoreactor with immobilized ZnO and assess its performance in reducing textile wastewater toxicity using solar energy. The electric conductivity measurement is retained as a detection method to obtain the residence time distribution (RTD) function. The RTD is then used to characterize the hydrodynamic behavior of the photoreactor and to evaluate its deviation from the distribution curves of ideal reactors. Solar experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of this multistage reactor towards the degradation of a textile azo dye namely Solophenyl Red 3BL (SR 3BL). The influence of the flow rate and the SR 3BL initial concentration (C<sub>O</sub>) are considered. The variation of the flow rate slightly influences the SR 3BL photodegradation efficiency and it is inversely proportional to its concentration. The study of the reuse of the immobilized catalyst shows that the degradation efficiency of 98% is reached even after multiple photocatalytic cycles. The figure of merit collector area per order was in the range of 35 to 110 m2/m3order$$ {m}^2/{m}^3 order $$. This result provides useful information for scaling up and estimating energy efficiency of the reactor.</p>","author":"Belgassim Boutra, \nAicha Sebti, \nSarah Mahidine, \nMohamed Trari","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"7187fd99a3a0f568e637e3eb460909c37029d620d81a0ce105659f732daaeb7e","category":"Environment"}
