Herein, we report the development of a versatile DNA-based kinase assay platform for high-throughput profiling of plant protein kinase activities and substrate preferences. Our approach employs DNA-linked peptide substrates, facilitating quantitative and specific kinase activity detection through next-generation DNA sequencing. Leveraging DNA barcodes as quantitative readouts, our approach establishes a high-throughput, sensitive, and specific platform for dissecting kinase–substrate networks in plants, representing a powerful tool for elucidating signaling mechanisms in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"4d1e259d292c64e8107d9e1160066b9d93bdc71bdaa889c56885192d7501edca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
