{"title":"Evaluating the Anti-cancer Potential of Ganoderma lucidum: A Critical Analysis of Clinical Evidence and Methodological Advances.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0119/v1","date":1719849619000,"content":"Rationale: A wide range of bioactive phytoconstituents from edible fungi, especially therapeutic mushrooms, have the potential to improve health, especially in the case of chronic illnesses. Known for its anti-cancer qualities, ganoderma lucidum has been the focus of multiple clinical studies. Existing systematic reviews imply that more clinical research and methodological refinement are necessary to support its usage as a primary cancer treatment.Objective: The objective of this research is to evaluate the anti-cancer potential of the bioactive phytoconstituents found in mushrooms, specifically Ganoderma lucidum, in a thorough manner. The aim is to conduct a critical assessment of the extant literature, pinpoint any deficiencies, and offer valuable perspectives on the methodological excellence and research requirements in this domain.Method(s): A thorough analysis of published clinical trials was carried out, with a focus on studies that examined the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum and other products derived from mushrooms in treating cancer. The study's design, stated results, and methodological rigor were all carefully examined to evaluate the validity and reliability of the conclusions.Results: Despite Ganoderma lucidum's potential against cancer, the evaluation finds insufficient data to support its widespread usage as a primary cancer treatment. Products made from mushrooms, which are frequently sold as dietary supplements, have anti-cancer claims. But since pre-approval is not required under US regulatory framework in order to market food supplements, these statements raise questions regarding their scientific validity.Conclusions/Recommendations: The study's result emphasizes the necessity of more methodological advancement in clinical studies examining Ganoderma lucidum's potential as an anti-cancer agent. It also highlights the significance of thorough scientific validation for goods made from mushrooms that make health claims. To establish accurate claims regarding their anti-cancer effects, recommendations include developing technological methods for the purification of bioactive substances and undertaking thorough studies of mushroom products from different geographical regions. The goal of this thorough analysis is to direct future investigations and support the ethical promotion and use of products derived from mushrooms for medical purposes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"115baec4bfa74a34de4d2b9a437af9ee6dd18b126d151728ce81228c3b496dee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
