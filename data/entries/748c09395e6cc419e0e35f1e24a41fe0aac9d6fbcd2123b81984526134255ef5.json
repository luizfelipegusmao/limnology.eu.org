{"title":"Antennas for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs): Reviewing the Challenges of Underwater Communication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1814/v1","date":1716882241000,"content":"Underwater communication for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) faces challenges due to the unique underwater environment. This review explores these challenges (attenuation, multipath propagation, limited bandwidth) across acoustic, optical, and radio frequency (RF) communication channels. It highlights how innovative antenna designs are crucial to mitigate these limitations and enable efficient data transmission. The review analyzes monopole, dipole, and helical antennas, discussing their trade-offs in radiation pattern, efficiency, and mitigating multipath effects. Advancements in materials, metamaterials, and reconfigurable antennas offer promising solutions for improved signal propagation, reduced attenuation, and better environmental adaptability. Research gaps include material exploration for low-conductivity antennas and optimizing antenna designs. Rigorous performance evaluation remains essential. Overall, advancements in underwater antenna technology are key to unlocking the full potential of UWSNs and enabling breakthroughs in marine applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"748c09395e6cc419e0e35f1e24a41fe0aac9d6fbcd2123b81984526134255ef5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
