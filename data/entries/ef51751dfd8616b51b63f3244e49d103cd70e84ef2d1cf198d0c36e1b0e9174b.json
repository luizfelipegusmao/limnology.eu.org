{"title":"The Hydroxyapatite-Filled Acrylonitrile-Butadiene Rubber Composites with Improved Cure Characteristics and Reduced Flammability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1035/v1","date":1720778903000,"content":"The goal of this work was to develop the acrylonitrile-butadiene (NBR) elastomer composites filled with hydroxyapatite (HAP), which were characterized with improved cure characteristics and burning resistance. Silane, i.e., (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane, ionic liquid, i.e., 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and surfactant, i.e., cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, were used to improve the fillerâ€™s dispersibility in the elastomer matrix and to reduce the time and temperature of vulcanization. The effect of HAP and dispersants on the cure characteristics, crosslink density and physico-chemical properties of NBR composites was explored. The additives used, especially the ionic liquid and surfactant, effectively improved the dispersion of HAP in NBR matrix. The amount of HAP and the dispersant used strongly affected the cure characteristics and crosslink density of NBR. The optimal vulcanization time significantly increased with HAP content and was pronouncedly reduced when ionic liquid and surfactant were applied. In addition, ionic liquid and surfactant significantly lowered the onset vulcanization temperature, improved the crosslink density and hardness of the vulcanizates, while impairing their elasticity. HAP and dispersants did not significantly affect the damping properties and chemical resistance of NBR vulcanizates. Above all, application of HAP considerably enhanced the resistance of vulcanizates to thermo-oxidative aging and reduced their flammability compared to the unfilled NBR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef51751dfd8616b51b63f3244e49d103cd70e84ef2d1cf198d0c36e1b0e9174b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
