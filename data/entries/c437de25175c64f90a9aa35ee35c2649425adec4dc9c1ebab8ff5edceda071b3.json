{"title":"The Effect of Positive Self-Talk on Standing Long Jump Training in Healthy Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1043/v1","date":1723683940000,"content":"The abstract should be an objective representation of the article and it must not contain results that are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions. This study investigated whether positive self-talk (ST) over 4 weeks would improve standing long jump (SLJ) performance in men and women in their 20s. The participants of this study were 36 men and 28 women, selected through interviews with male and female students. The test subjectsâ€™ performance was measured 10 times over a 4-week period, 2-3 sessions per week. In the experimental group, participants performed SLJ while reciting positive ST; the control group performed SLJ without any specific conditions. A pre-and post-intervention survey was conducted using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE). The results revealed a significant difference in the performance of experimental group (p &lt; 0.05), while no significant difference was observed in the control group. RSE survey results also showed a significant difference only in the experimental group (p &lt; 0.05). These findings indicate that self-affirmation yields positive effects on SLJ performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c437de25175c64f90a9aa35ee35c2649425adec4dc9c1ebab8ff5edceda071b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
