{"title":"Photoaging Protective Effects of Green Ball Apple Peel Isolated Quercitrin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1750/v1","date":1729609230000,"content":"Premature skin aging, also known as photoaging, refers to the changes of the structure and function of the skin caused by chronic sun exposure. The ultraviolet radiation in the sunlight is one of the key factors that causes photoaging. Thus, MMPs, TGFB1, and NF-κB signaling can be an effective therapeutic strategy for UVB exposure. In this study, we used human dermal fibroblast and mouse macrophage cells to identify the mediators of skin photoaging. Quercitrin isolated from ‘Green Ball’ apple peel was treated to UVB-irradiated fibroblast cell and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages to identify photoaging prevention effect of quercitrin. Genes that are associated with photoaging was determined by using ELISA, western blot, and qPCR. Quercitrin increased collagen biosynthesis in UVB-irradiated fibroblast cell via regulating MMPs, TIMP-1, TGFB1, HAS2, and COL1A2. In addition, quercitrin regulated p-65, iNOS, COX-2, and mediators (PGE2 and NO), in the NF-κB signaling process, and inhibited the production of cytokines in LPS-induced macrophages. These results indicates that quercitrin can improve photoaging damaged skin by regulating MMPs, TGFβ, and NF-κB signaling pathway modulators.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"708c803f1284144096167b98f06d24da1d03b35babcea61dffe349bd940767d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
