{"title":"Reducing nitrogen fertilizer usage coupled with organic substitution improves soil quality and boosts tea yield and quality in tea plantations","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13913?af=R","date":1727259040000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The utilization of chemical fertilizers is a key measure for maintaining tea yield and quality, but excessive use has negative environmental impacts. The substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer has been promoted to sustain crop yield and soil quality. However, knowledge gaps regarding the effects of organic substitution on soil quality and tea yield in tea plantations still exist.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A field experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of organic substitution treatments (i.e. 25% partial substitution: biogas slurry + green manure + formula fertilizer, BFG; sheep manure + formula fertilizer, OFF; 100% complete substitution: sheep manure + green manure, OG) on the soil quality, tea yield and quality, and nitrogen utilization efficiency in southwestern China. Results showed that all organic substitution treatments slightly increased soil pH, and significantly increased soil organic matter by 13.22–14.88% compared to conventional fertilization (CF). The BFG treatment was the most effective in enhancing the soil quality index, showing increases of 16.80%, 8.37% and 24.87% higher than the CF, OFF and OG treatments, respectively. Tea yield significantly increased under the BFG, OFF and OG treatments by 11.97%, 13.58% and 5.90% compared to CF, respectively. The BFG treatment increased the amino acid content by 7.78% and decreased the tea polyphenol/amino acid ratio by 6.87%. Additionally, the BFG, OFF and OG treatments greatly increased the nitrogen utilization efficiency of young sprouts by 70.71%, 82.54% and 34.28%, respectively.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Overall, partial organic substitution could effectively improve soil quality while maintaining tea yield. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Biao Wang, \nShang Wang, \nGuangyun Li, \nLibo Fu, \nHua Chen, \nMei Yin, \nJianfeng Chen","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4f938346d4d3cdc553c98143f23c640564a899f47c1d9d728654dab8b68bbef5","category":"Environment"}
