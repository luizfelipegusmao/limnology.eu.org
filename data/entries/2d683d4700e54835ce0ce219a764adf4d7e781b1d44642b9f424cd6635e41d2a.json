{"title":"A Combined Protection System for Wind Generators","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1341/v1","date":1726636344000,"content":"This article presents the results of analyzing emergency situations that lead to substantial economic losses during recovery efforts. Various technical solutions are explored that can identify the onset and, in some cases, the duration of natural or technical factors influencing the occurrence of such emergencies. The relevance of developing a combined protection system for wind generators is substantiated. The system comprises a three-tier structure. The first, lowest level, collects real-time data on monitored parameters. The second level stores this data, calculates missing coordinates using observers, and generates warning messages for wind generator operators about potential emergency situations. The third, highest level, includes the operator's computer. This combined protection system plays a crucial role in reducing emergency occurrences and enhancing the reliability and lifespan of wind generators.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2d683d4700e54835ce0ce219a764adf4d7e781b1d44642b9f424cd6635e41d2a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
