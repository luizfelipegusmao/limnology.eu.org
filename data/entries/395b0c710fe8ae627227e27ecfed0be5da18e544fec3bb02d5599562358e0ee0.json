{"title":"Stochastic Plantwide Optimizing Control for an Acrylic Acid Plant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0351/v1","date":1725434575000,"content":"This work addresses the relevant control system design issue for an acrylic acid plant through the lens of plant-wide stochastic optimization control (S-PWOC). The S-PWOC framework involves stochastic optimization methods. An evaluation comparison between the proposed S-PWOC model and two conventional models, specifically the two-level identification method and the typical plant-wide decentralized control structure, is performed. Despite the increasing computational demands associated with S-PWOC, experimental results highlight its effectiveness in handling different forms of uncertainty. Notably, S-PWOC demonstrates improvements in economic viability, control efficiency, and reduction of safety risks during plant operations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"395b0c710fe8ae627227e27ecfed0be5da18e544fec3bb02d5599562358e0ee0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
