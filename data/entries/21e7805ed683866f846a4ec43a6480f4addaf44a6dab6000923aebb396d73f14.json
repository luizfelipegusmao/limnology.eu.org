The fixed point theorems in the framework of Kransnoselskii and Banach are utilized to discuss the existence and uniqueness of the results. In addition, the stability criteria of Ulam-Hyers, generalize Ulam-Hyers, Ulam-Hyers-Rassias, and generalize Ulam-Hyers-Rassias are investigated by non-linear analysis besides fractional calculus. Finally, illustrative examples are reinforced by tables and graphics to describe the main achievements.","author":"Sabri T. M.
