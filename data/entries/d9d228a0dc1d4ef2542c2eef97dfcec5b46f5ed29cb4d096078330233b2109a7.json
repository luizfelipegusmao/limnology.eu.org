{"title":"Real-Time Chatbot: Microservices Implementation in Distributed System Architecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0028/v1","date":1719816704000,"content":"The development of a real-time chatbot using microservices architecture has been proposed as a solution to overcome the main challenges faced by single-service chatbots, namely limited scalability and performance. In this research, Agile Methodology is used as a development approach that allows the team to flexibly build and update each microservices service iteratively, according to the changing needs that occur. The results show that the implementation of microservices on a chatbot can result in faster responses to user requests, significantly improving system efficiency. The microservices architecture provides advantages in terms of modularity, where system components such as session management, business logic, and user interface can be organized and developed separately. This makes it possible to upgrade and improve certain parts without disrupting the entire system, as well as providing flexibility in customizing features and scaling services as needs evolve. Future research is expected to further explore the broader integration potential of this microservices system in chatbot applications, as well as evaluate the security and reliability aspects in a broader context of use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9d228a0dc1d4ef2542c2eef97dfcec5b46f5ed29cb4d096078330233b2109a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
