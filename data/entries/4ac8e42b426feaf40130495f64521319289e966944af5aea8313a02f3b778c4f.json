{"title":"Self-advocacy for young African scientists | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp0406","date":1715864460000,"content":"Knowledge resources and financial capital are mainly concentrated in the Global North (1), whereas the Global South, particularly Africa, lacks both investment in research (2, 3) and researchers (4). As a result, less than 1% of the global research output is produced by African institutions (5). Moreover, the majority of scientific articles reporting research conducted in Africa include foreign coauthors (6, 7), and African researchers rarely attain prestigious first or last authorship positions (8). Intra-African cooperation is also rare (5). Although research investment is a systemic problem that will require changes by the governments and institutions in African countries, individual African researchers can still take steps to improve the quality and quantity of research conducted in Africa by Africans.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"4ac8e42b426feaf40130495f64521319289e966944af5aea8313a02f3b778c4f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
