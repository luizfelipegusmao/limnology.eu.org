Currently, the energy resolution has reached a few meV due to the improvement of instrumental stability [<a href=\"#ozae044.713-B1\">1</a>], and the measurable energy range thereby has been expanded to the IR region. On the other hand, to observe lattice vibration phenomena at energies much lower than a few meV, an energy resolution on the order of Î¼eV is required, and has not been achieved at present. Therefore, it is a necessity to develop a new electron spectroscopic technique.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"dc8af5e1de1e050cf29c98f133e00664929522dedf791be69db34b95712bd528","category":"Environment"}
