{"title":"Nordic Exercise Effects on the Explosive and Absolute Strength of Lower Limbs in Different Sports Modalities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1523/v1","date":1716450952000,"content":"Abstract: Nordic exercises aim to improve physical abilities and prevent injuries; However, it is not clear in what type of sports modalities to use it, so this study arises from the interest of ana-lyzing its effect in different sports modalities. Objective: To analyze Nordic exercises effects on the lower limbs, and their relationship with the explosive and absolute strength inherent to demands of different sports modalities (football, athletics, basketball, sport climbing, cycling and taekwondo). Method: quasi-experimental research, identifying 122 athletes (18±3 years old) from: football (n=24), athletics/speed (n=20), sport climbing (n=20), basketball (n=24), taekwondo (n=14) and cycling (n=20); classified into a control group CG (n=57) and an experimental group EG (n=65). Results: dominant absolute strength of the initial (12.4±0.51) and final (14.5±0.98) EG, in greater proportion in basketball (P= &lt; 0.05); explosive strength of the initial (42.4±1.2) and final (45.8±1.5) EG, with a significant difference in all modalities between before and after (p≤0.05), except in cy-cling and taekwondo; no major changes were found in the GC. Conclusion: Nordic exercises are recommended as part of training to improve levels of explosive strength with emphasis on the modalities of football, basketball, athletics/speed and sport climbing, being applicable to increase absolute strength in basketball.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94dc60f2638f1e573006dd79375f2e1231dac939e297def585f93d907560b01e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
