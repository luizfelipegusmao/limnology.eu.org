They are associated with several modifiable and metabolic risk factors and are therefore prone to significant regional variations on different scales. However, only few intra-urban studies examined spatial variation in NCDs and its association with social circumstances, especially in Germany. Thus, the present study aimed to identify associations of personal risk factors and local social conditions with NCDs in a large German city.</p> Methods <p>This study is based on a population-based cohort of the Hamburg City Health Study including 10,000 probands. Six NCDs were analyzed (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], coronary heart disease [CHD], diabetes mellitus, heart failure, depression, and hypertension) in 68 city district clusters. As risk factors, we considered socio-demographic variables (age, sex, education) and risk behaviour variables (smoking, alcohol consumption). Logistic regression analyses identified associations between the district clusters and the prevalence rates for each NCD. Regional variation was detected by Gini coefficients and spatial cluster analyses. Local social condition indexes were correlated with prevalence rates of NCDs on city district level and hot-spot analyses were performed for significant high or low values.</p> Results <p>The analyses included 7,308 participants with a mean age of 63.1 years (51.5% female). The prevalence of hypertension (67.6%) was the highest. Risk factor associations were identified between smoking, alcohol consumption and education and the prevalence of NCDs (hypertension, diabetes, and COPD). Significant regional variations were detected and persisted after adjusting for personal risk factors. Correlations for prevalence rates with the local social conditions were significant for hypertension (r = 0.294, p &lt; 0.02), diabetes (r = 0.259, p = 0.03), and COPD (r = 0.360, p &lt; 0.01).</p> Conclusions <p>The study shows that regional differences in NCD prevalence persist even after adjusting for personal risk factors. This highlights the central role of both personal socio-economic status and behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco consumption. It also highlights the importance of other potential regional factors (e.g. the environment) in shaping NCD prevalence. This knowledge helps policy- and decision-makers to develop intervention strategies.</p>","author":"Valerie Andrees","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"afff49cdae1014245e845c5b5b8987a71d0fb5b108dd65aac97fdad8cd70f276","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
