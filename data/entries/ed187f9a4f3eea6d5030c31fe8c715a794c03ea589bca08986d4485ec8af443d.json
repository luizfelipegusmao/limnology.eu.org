{"title":"The Direct and Indirect Effect of Academic Self-Efficacy on the Association between Students&rsquo; Feedback Sensitivity and Adjustment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0966/v1","date":1726112386000,"content":"Empirical findings support the important role played by prosocial behavior and scholastic per-formance in significantly affecting adolescents’ long term psychosocial adjustment. Furthermore, several studies showed the positive impact of academic self-efficacy in affecting adolescents’ social and academic functioning; however, no studies have investigated the effect of other important personality structures, such as students’ feedback sensitivity. The present study aims at investi-gating the effects of adolescents’ feedback sensitivity (reward sensitivity/punishment sensitivity) on their prosocial behavior and scholastic performance also examining the potential indirect effect of academic self-efficacy on the association between reward/punishment sensitivity and prosocial behavior/scholastic performance. Participants were 132 adolescents (53.1% males; Mage = 16.42, SD) from Rome (Italy). Students’ reward/punishment sensitivity, academic self-efficacy, prosocial behavior and scholastic performance were self-reported. A path analyses model showed a positive and significant effect of academic self-efficacy on scholastic performance, a positive significant ef-fect of punishment sensitivity on prosocial behavior, a positive significant effect of reward sensi-tivity on academic self-efficacy and a significant indirect effect of academic self-efficacy on the association between reward sensitivity and scholastic performance. Results of this study are useful in term of practical implications to promote students’ adjustment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed187f9a4f3eea6d5030c31fe8c715a794c03ea589bca08986d4485ec8af443d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
