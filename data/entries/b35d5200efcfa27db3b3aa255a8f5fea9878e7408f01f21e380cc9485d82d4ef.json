{"title":"Spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem services in response to climate variability in Maze National Park and its environs, southwestern Ethiopia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307931","date":1722002400000,"content":"<p>by Mestewat Simeon, Desalegn Wana, Zerihun Woldu</p>\r\n\r\nClimate variability is one of the major factors affecting the supply of ecosystem services and the well-being of people who rely on them. Despite the substantial effects of climate variability on ecosystem goods and services, empirical researches on these effects are generally lacking. Thus, this study examines the spatiotemporal impacts of climate variability on selected ecosystem services in Maze National Park and its surroundings, in southwestern Ethiopia. We conducted climate trend and variability analysis by using the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, Sen’s slope estimator, and innovative trend analysis (ITA). Relationships among ecosystem services and climate variables were evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), while partial correlation was used to evaluate the relationship among key ecosystem services and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The MK tests show a decreasing trend for both mean annual and main rainy season rainfall, with Sen’s slope (β) = -0.721 and β = -0.1.23, respectively. Whereas, the ITA method depicted a significant increase in the second rainy season rainfall (Slope(s) = 1.487), and the mean annual (s = 0.042), maximum (s = 0.024), and minimum (s = 0.060) temperature. Spatial correlations revealed significant positive relationships between ecosystem services and the mean annual rainfall and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), while negative correlations with the mean annual temperature. Additionally, temporal correlations highlighted positive relationships among key ecosystem services and the main rainy season rainfall. The maximum and minimum temperatures and ecosystem services were negatively correlated; whereas, there was strong negative correlations between annual (r = -0.929), main rainy season (r = -0.990), and second rainy season (r = -0.814) PET and food production. Thus, understanding the spatiotemporal variability of climate and the resulting impacts on ecosystem services helps decision-makers design ecosystem conservation and restoration strategies to increase the potential of the ecosystems to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate variability.","author":"Mestewat Simeon","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b35d5200efcfa27db3b3aa255a8f5fea9878e7408f01f21e380cc9485d82d4ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
