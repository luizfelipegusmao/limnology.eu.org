{"title":"PSIX-28 Optimization of feeding trial length for evaluating feed efficiency in sheep","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/804/7757845?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Feed efficiency tests are well established for beef cattle, but testing for sheep remains rare due to the lack of appropriate equipment and standardized protocols. To explore the optimum trial length for evaluating feed efficiency in sheep, freshly weaned Rideau Arcott ewe lambs [n = 80; 4to 5 mo of age and body weights (BW) of 16 to 25 kg] were enrolled in a 65-d feeding trial, following a 20-d adaptation period. A mixed ration containing barley gain and protein supplement pellets were offered twice daily, and lambs had ad libitum access to feed, water and bedding straw during the trial period. Daily feed intake of individual lambs was monitored with Vytelle SENSE feed bunks, BW was recorded biweekly, as well as on two consecutive days at the start and end of the trial. Lambs that had died or had abnormal growth patterns from sickness were removed, resulting in 62 lambs remaining in the final dataset. Optimum trial length for measuring feed intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) were evaluated with R Software (v. 4.3.3) via a post-hoc analysis of constructing shortened trial lengths from the regular test. The DMI and ADG values from the shortened trial datasets were compared with those from regular trial days with correlation (Pearson and Spearman tests) and linear regression analyses. There were 64 shortened trial lengths for DMI by 1 d increments, and 15 sub-datasets for ADG consisting of trial lengths between every two BW measurements. Residual feed intake (RFI), residual average daily gain (RADG), and residual intake and BW gain (RIG) were calculated for and compared between the regular trial length (65 d) and favorable shortened trial lengths based on DMI and ADG evaluations. Correlation, regression and agreement analyses were used to determine the optimum trial lengths for RFI, RADG and RIG evaluations. Results showed that DMI and ADG measurements could be shortened to 42 (r &gt; 0.95, R2 &gt; 0.90, β &gt; 0.95, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) and 56 d (r &gt; 0.96, R2 &gt; 0.93, β &gt; 0.96, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), respectively. Additionally, trial length for RFI, RADG, and RG evaluations could be reduced to 56 d (r &gt; 0.95, R2 &gt; 0.91, β &gt; 0.95, CCC &gt; 0.95, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), primarily due to the trial length requirement for accurate ADG measurement. Reducing the duration of trials for evaluating feed efficiency in sheep not only reduces testing costs, fostering greater uptake among sheep producers, but also allows for the evaluation of more lambs annually, thereby enhancing the overall productivity and profitability of the sheep industry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"41102bfcc4c714ab47754bd34cedd0ea528f9b17ecdc0169fd6c3dcd5a7271c4","category":"Environment"}
