{"title":"Bibliometric Studies as a Publication Strategy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1347/v1","date":1729146823000,"content":"The number of bibliometric studies published in the scientific literature has been increasing in recent years. Some authors publish more bibliometric studies than others do. To identify authors who focus on bibliometric studies and their publication strategy is based on these studies. To determine whether the focus on bibliometric studies can be considered a successful publication strategy. A bibliometric analysis, including a citation analysis, was used to determine the results. The Scopus database was chosen as the source of bibliometric data. In total, 100 authors who frequently publish bibliometric studies were identified. For almost half of them, bibliometric studies can be considered the main or important part of their publication portfolio. A relatively small group of authors widely publishes bibliometric studies. The bibliometric indicators of these authors indicate that this specialization in bibliometric studies is quite successful.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ccdfc3e8a390c8e30e398d5e752c307f3d59f4f6d566fb9847305b909480abfd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
