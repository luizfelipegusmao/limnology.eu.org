{"title":"Network-Independent Grid Synchronous Stability Boundary and Spontaneous Synchronization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1791/v5","date":1712838409000,"content":"The synchronization of complex networks is believed to be closely related to network topology. How to study synchronization of real network without clear topology and parameters? In this Letter, a synchronized stability boundary equation is derived that is system- and disturbance-independent and applicable to arbitrarily coupled grids. The results imply that spontaneous synchronization in a network may be network independent. These conclusions provide new research paths for network synchronization and analyze the synchronization stability of grids in a unified way.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8e3d254d1359c3876212cda9ec57f035dbfcd96699515fde60c41e166c9200d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
