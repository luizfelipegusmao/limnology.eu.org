{"title":"Host-Pathogen Interactions during STEC Adherence and Colonization in the Bovine Gut: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0379/v1","date":1725488838000,"content":"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a significant public health threat due to its ability to cause severe gastrointestinal diseases in humans, ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening conditions such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). As the primary reservoir of STEC, cattle play a crucial role in its transmission through contaminated food and water, posing a considerable risk to human health. This comprehensive review explores host-pathogen interactions during STEC colonization of the bovine gut, focusing on the role of gut microbiota in modulating these interactions and influencing disease outcomes. We integrated findings from published transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics studies to provide a thorough understanding of how STEC adheres to and colonizes the bovine gastrointestinal tract. The insights from this review offer potential avenues for the development of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling STEC colonization in cattle threby reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"833a959bdb956737e02787055b6e33f29b90397304266d66245dcefba7e428fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
