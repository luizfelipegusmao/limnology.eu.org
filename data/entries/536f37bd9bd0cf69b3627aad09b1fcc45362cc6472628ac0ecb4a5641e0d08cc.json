{"title":"How physicochemical and nutritional traits of potatoes may vary under field conditions over long periods","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13266?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Potato is the most important non-grain crop worldwide, whose quality characteristics are always affected by temporal and spatial variability. Knowledge of the performance consistency of quality characteristics over long periods could prove very important to identify which quality traits are less variable over time, and therefore provide greater guarantees of stability. In this research, variations in physicochemical and nutritional traits of tubers over five consecutive growing seasons of two potato genotypes (Arizona and Vogue) were monitored in two locations.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Although qualitative performances of genotypes fluctuated across the seasons in both locations, two physicochemical traits (pH and dry matter content) and starch content showed less variability throughout the five seasons compared to total soluble solids and most of the nutritional traits (namely reducing sugars, citric acid, vitamin C, total phenolics and antioxidant capacity), which were considerably influenced by weather conditions.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results suggest that pH, dry matter content and starch content traits could be used advantageously in studies of temporal stability in potatoes. This approach could prove useful in providing scientific support for the setup of potato protected geographical identifications.
