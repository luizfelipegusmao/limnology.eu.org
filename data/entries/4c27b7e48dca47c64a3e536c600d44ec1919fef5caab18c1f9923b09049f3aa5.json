After all, if things were plenty fast to start with, why complicate things? On the other hand, knowing that my client services not just Waushara County, but much of central Wisconsin, even a barebones Service Worker could be the kind of progressive enhancement that adds resilience in the places it might be needed most.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first Service Worker I wrote for my client’s website—which I’ll refer to henceforth as the “standard” Service Worker—used three <a href=\"https://web.dev/offline-cookbook/\">well-documented caching strategies</a>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Precache CSS and JavaScript assets for all pages when the Service Worker is installed when the window’s load event fires.</li><li>Serve static assets out of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage\"><code>CacheStorage</code></a> if available. If a static asset isn’t in <code>CacheStorage</code>, retrieve it from the network, then cache it for future visits.</li><li>For HTML assets, hit the network first and place the HTML response into <code>CacheStorage</code>. If the network is unavailable the next time the visitor arrives, serve the cached markup from <code>CacheStorage</code>.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These are neither new nor special strategies, but they provide two benefits:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Offline capability, which is handy when network conditions are spotty.</li><li>A performance boost for loading static assets.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That performance boost translated to a 42% and 48% decrease in the median time to <a href=\"https://web.dev/fcp/\">First Contentful Paint (FCP)</a> and <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a>, respectively.

A similar benefit is realized when we rely on the HTTP cache, only the FCP and LCP improvements I just described are in comparison to pages with a primed HTTP cache without an installed Service Worker.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re wondering why <a href=\"https://blog.yoav.ws/tale-of-four-caches/\"><code>CacheStorage</code> and the HTTP cache aren’t equal</a>, it’s because the HTTP cache—at least in <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/#pattern-2-mutable-content-always-server-revalidated\">some cases</a>—may still involve a trip to the server to verify asset freshness. <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/01/using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web/\">Cache-Control’s <code>immutable</code> flag gets around this</a>, but <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cache-control_immutable\"><code>immutable</code> doesn’t have great support</a> yet. A long max-age value works, too, but the combination of Service Worker API and <code>CacheStorage</code> gives you a lot more flexibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Details aside, the takeaway is that the simplest and most well-established Service Worker caching practices can improve performance. Potentially more than what well-configured <code>Cache-Control</code> headers can provide. Even so, Service Worker is an incredible technology with far more possibilities. It’s possible to go farther, and I’ll show you how.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>A better, faster Service Worker</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The web <em>loves</em> itself some “innovation,” which is a word we equally love to throw around. To me, true innovation isn’t when we create new frameworks or patterns solely for the benefit of developers, but whether those inventions benefit people who end up using whatever it is we slap up on the web. <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies\">The priority of constituencies</a> is a thing we ought to respect. Users above all else, always.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Service Worker API’s innovation space is considerable. How you work within that space can have a big effect on how the web is experienced. Things like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload\">navigation preload</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream#examples\"><code>ReadableStream</code></a> have taken Service Worker from great to killer. We can do the following with these new capabilities, respectively:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Reduce Service Worker latency by parallelizing Service Worker startup time and <a href=\"https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request\">navigation requests</a>.</li><li>Stream content in from <code>CacheStorage</code> and the network.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, we’re going to combine these capabilities and pull out one more trick: precache header and footer partials, then combine them with content partials from the network. This not only reduces how much data we download from the network, but it also improves perceptual performance for repeat visits. That’s innovation that helps everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Grizzled, I turn to you and say <em>“let’s do this.”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Laying the groundwork</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the idea of combining precached header and footer partials with network content on the fly seems like a Single Page Application (SPA), you’re not far off. Like an SPA, you’ll need to apply the “app shell” model to your website. Only instead of a client-side router plowing content into one piece of minimal markup, you have to think of your website as three separate parts:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>The header.</li><li>The content.</li><li>The footer.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For my client’s website, that looks like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":7172792,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fig-3.png?resize=490,1024\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Weekly Timber website color coded to delineate each partial that makes up the page.

The only thing that counts in the final sense is that the combination of these partials must be valid markup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To start, you’ll need to precache separate header and footer partials when the Service Worker is installed. For my client’s website, these partials are served from the <code>/partial-header</code> and <code>/partial-footer</code> pathnames:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>self.addEventListener(\"install\", event =&gt; {\n  const cacheName = \"fancy_cache_name_here\";\n  const precachedAssets = &#091;\n    \"/partial-header\",  // The header partial\n    \"/partial-footer\",  // The footer partial\n    // Other assets worth precaching\n  ];\n\n  event.waitUntil(caches.open(cacheName).then(cache =&gt; {\n    return cache.addAll(precachedAssets);\n  }).then(() =&gt; {\n    return self.skipWaiting();\n  }));\n});</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every page must be fetchable as a content partial minus the header and footer, as well as a full page with the header and footer. This is key because the initial visit to a page won’t be controlled by a Service Worker. Once the Service Worker takes over, then you serve content partials and assemble them into complete responses with the header and footer partials from <code>CacheStorage</code>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your site is static, this means generating a whole other mess of markup partials that you can rewrite requests to in the Service Worker’s <code>fetch()</code> event. If your website has a back end—as is the case with my client—you can use an HTTP request header to instruct the server to deliver full pages or content partials.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hard part is putting all the pieces together—but we’ll do just that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Putting it all together</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Writing even a basic Service Worker can be challenging, but things get real complicated real fast when assembling multiple responses into one. One reason for this is that in order to avoid the Service Worker startup penalty, we’ll need to set up navigation preload.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Implementing navigation preload</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Navigation preload addresses the problem of Service Worker startup time, which delays navigation requests to the network. The last thing you want to do with a Service Worker is hold up the show.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Navigation preload must be explicitly enabled. Once enabled, the Service Worker won’t hold up navigation requests during startup. Navigation preload is enabled in the Service Worker’s <code>activate</code> event:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>self.addEventListener(\"activate\", event =&gt; {\n  const cacheName = \"fancy_cache_name_here\";\n  const preloadAvailable = \"navigationPreload\" in self.registration;\n\n  event.waitUntil(caches.keys().then(keys =&gt; {\n    return Promise.all(&#091;\n      keys.filter(key =&gt; {\n        return key !== cacheName;\n      }).map(key =&gt; {\n        return caches.delete(key);\n      }),\n      self.clients.claim(),\n      preloadAvailable ? self.registration.navigationPreload.enable() : true\n    ]);\n  }));\n});</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_navigationpreloadmanager\">Because navigation preload isn’t supported everywhere</a>, we have to do the usual feature check, which we store in the above example in the <code>preloadAvailable</code> variable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Additionally, we need to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all\"><code>Promise.all()</code></a> to resolve multiple asynchronous operations before the Service Worker activates. This includes pruning those old caches, as well as waiting for both <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clients/claim\"><code>clients.claim()</code></a> (which tells the Service Worker to assert control immediately rather than waiting until the next navigation) and navigation preload to be enabled.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A ternary operator is used to enable navigation preload in supporting browsers and avoid throwing errors in browsers that don’t. If <code>preloadAvailable</code> is <code>true</code>, we enable navigation preload. If it isn’t, we pass a Boolean that won’t affect how <code>Promise.all()</code> resolves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With navigation preload enabled, we need to write code in our Service Worker’s <code>fetch()</code> event handler to make use of the preloaded response:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>self.addEventListener(\"fetch\", event =&gt; {\n  const { request } = event;\n\n  // Static asset handling code omitted for brevity\n  // ...\n\n  // Check if this is a request for a document\n  if (request.mode === \"navigate\") {\n    const networkContent = Promise.resolve(event.preloadResponse).then(response =&gt; {\n      if (response) {\n        addResponseToCache(request, response.clone());\n\n        return response;\n      }\n\n      return fetch(request.url, {\n        headers: {\n          \"X-Content-Mode\": \"partial\"\n        }\n      }).then(response =&gt; {\n        addResponseToCache(request, response.clone());\n\n        return response;\n      });\n    }).catch(() =&gt; {\n      return caches.match(request.url);\n    });\n\n    // More to come...\n  }\n});</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though this isn’t the entirety of the Service Worker’s <code>fetch()</code> event code, there’s a lot that needs explaining:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The preloaded response is available in <code>event.preloadResponse</code>. However, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload\">as Jake Archibald notes</a>, the value of <code>event.preloadResponse</code> will be <code>undefined</code> in browsers that don’t support navigation preload. Therefore, we must pass <code>event.preloadResponse</code> to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve\"><code>Promise.resolve()</code></a> to avoid compatibility issues.</li><li>We adapt in the resulting <code>then</code> callback. If event.<code>preloadResponse</code> is supported, we use the preloaded response and add it to <code>CacheStorage</code> via an <code>addResponseToCache()</code> helper function. If not, we send a <code>fetch()</code> request to the network to get the content partial using a custom <code>X-Content-Mode</code> header with a value of <code>partial</code>.</li><li>Should the network be unavailable, we fall back to the most recently accessed content partial in <code>CacheStorage</code>.</li><li>The response—regardless of where it was procured from—is then returned to a variable named <code>networkContent</code> that we use later.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How the content partial is retrieved is tricky. With navigation preload enabled, a special <code>Service-Worker-Navigation-Preload</code> header with a value of <code>true</code> is added to navigation requests. We then work with that header on the back end to ensure the response is a content partial rather than the full page markup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, because navigation preload isn’t available in all browsers, we send a different header in those scenarios. In Weekly Timber’s case, we fall back to a custom <code>X-Content-Mode</code> header. In my client’s PHP back end, I’ve created some handy constants:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n\n// Is this a navigation preload request?\ndefine(\"NAVIGATION_PRELOAD\", isset($_SERVER&#091;\"HTTP_SERVICE_WORKER_NAVIGATION_PRELOAD\"]) &amp;&amp; stristr($_SERVER&#091;\"HTTP_SERVICE_WORKER_NAVIGATION_PRELOAD\"], \"true\") !== false);\n\n// Is this an explicit request for a content partial?\ndefine(\"PARTIAL_MODE\", isset($_SERVER&#091;\"HTTP_X_CONTENT_MODE\"]) &amp;&amp; stristr($_SERVER&#091;\"HTTP_X_CONTENT_MODE\"], \"partial\") !== false);\n\n// If either is true, this is a request for a content partial\ndefine(\"USE_PARTIAL\", NAVIGATION_PRELOAD === true || PARTIAL_MODE === true);\n\n?&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From there, the <code>USE_PARTIAL</code> constant is used to adapt the response:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n\nif (USE_PARTIAL === false) {\n  require_once(\"partial-header.php\");\n}\n\nrequire_once(\"includes/home.php\");\n\nif (USE_PARTIAL === false) {\n  require_once(\"partial-footer.php\");\n}\n\n?&gt;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The thing to be hip to here is that you should specify <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary\">a <code>Vary</code> header</a> for HTML responses to take the <code>Service-Worker-Navigation-Preload</code> (and in this case, the <code>X-Content-Mode</code> header) into account for HTTP caching purposes—assuming you’re caching HTML at all, which may not be the case for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With our handling of navigation preloads complete, we can then move onto the work of streaming content partials from the network and stitching them together with the header and footer partials from <code>CacheStorage</code> into a single response that the Service Worker will provide.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Streaming partial content and stitching together responses</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the header and footer partials will be available almost instantaneously because they’ve been in <code>CacheStorage</code> since the Service Worker’s installation, it’s the content partial we retrieve from the network that will be the bottleneck.

It also means you’ll need to update the navigation state in JavaScript to reflect the current page if that’s something you do on your website. Note that this shouldn’t cause indexing issues, as Googlebot crawls pages with an unprimed cache.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may also be some challenges on sites with authentication. For example, if your site’s header displays the current authenticated user on log in, you may have to update the header partial markup provided by <code>CacheStorage</code> in JavaScript on each navigation to reflect who is authenticated. You may be able to do this by storing basic user data in <code>localStorage</code> and updating the UI from there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are certainly other challenges, but it’ll be up to you to weigh the user-facing benefits versus the development costs. In my opinion, this approach has broad applicability in applications such as blogs, marketing websites, news websites, ecommerce, and other typical use cases.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All in all, though, it’s akin to the performance improvements and efficiency gains that you’d get from an SPA. Only the difference is that you’re not replacing time-tested navigation mechanisms and grappling with all the messiness that entails, but <em>enhancing </em>them. That’s the part I think is really important to consider in a world where client-side routing is all the rage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“What about <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox\">Workbox</a>?,” you might ask—and you’d be right to. Workbox simplifies a lot when it comes to using the Service Worker API, and you’re not wrong to reach for it. Personally, I prefer to work as close to the metal as I can so I can gain a better understanding of what lies beneath abstractions like Workbox. Even so, Service Worker is hard. Use Workbox if it suits you. As far as frameworks go, its abstraction cost is very low.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regardless of this approach, I think there’s incredible utility and power in using the Service Worker API to reduce the amount of markup you send. It benefits my client and all the people that use their website. Because of Service Worker and the innovation around its use, my client’s website is faster in the far-flung parts of Wisconsin. That’s something I feel good about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Special thanks to </em><a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/\"><em>Jake Archibald</em></a><em> for his valuable editorial advice, which, to put it mildly, considerably improved the quality of this article.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","author":"","siteTitle":"A List Apart: The Full Feed","siteHash":"09b09f389b84b264a6ebab120b6208479961d3fe7df4850a75b103b2b9c8a950","entryHash":"4c27b7e48dca47c64a3e536c600d44ec1919fef5caab18c1f9923b09049f3aa5","category":"Tech"}
