{"title":"The New Buffer Salt Protected Sodium Butyrate Promotes Growth Performance by Improving Intestinal Histomorphology, Barrier Function, Antioxidative Capacity, and Microbiota Community of Broilers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0186/v1","date":1712055888000,"content":"In this study, a commercial sodium butyrate protected by a new buffer salt solution (NSB) was tested to determine whether it can be used as an antibiotic alternative in broiler production. 192 1-day-old broilers were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments: soybean meal diet (CON), antibiotic diet (ANT, basal diet + 100 mg/kg aureomycin), and NSB (basal diet + 800 mg/kg NSB). The growth performance, serum anti-inflammatory cytokines, intestinal morphology, gut barrier function, antioxidative parameters, SCFAs content, and cecal microbiota were analyzed. The result showed that NSB significantly improved ADFI, ADG (p &lt; 0.01), and decreased FCR (p &lt; 0.01). Serum anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was up-regulated (p &lt; 0.01), and pro-inflammatory TNF-Î± was down-regulated (p &lt; 0.05) by NSB supplementation. H&amp;E results showed that VH and VH: CD ratio significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the jejunum and ileum in the NSB group. Furthermore, ZO-1 (p &lt; 0.01), claudin-1 (p &lt; 0.01), and occludin (p &lt; 0.05) in the jejunum and claudin-1 (p &lt; 0.01) and mucin-2 (p &lt; 0.05) in the ileum significantly up-regulated in the NSB group, respectively. Additionally, SOD (p &lt; 0.05) and T-AOC/MDA ratio (p &lt; 0.01) in the jejunum and SOD in the ileum were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the NSB group. The MDA level also significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) in the ANT group in the jejunum. Propionic acid (p &lt; 0.05) and butyric acid (p &lt; 0.01) content significantly increased in the NSB group in the jejunum and ileum segments. The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in alpha and beta diversity among the groups. LEFSe analysis also indicated that Peptostreptococcaceae, Colidextribacter, Firmicutes, Oscillospira, and Erysipelatoclostridiaceae, which promote SCFA production (p &lt; 0.05), were identified as dominant taxon-enriched bacterial genera in the NSB group. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed that Colidextribacter with ADFI, ADG, VH, claudin-1 (p &lt; 0.05), and unclassified_f__Peptostreptococcaceae with ADFI, IL-10, and ZO-1 were positively correlated (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, ADFI and ADG with IL-10, claudin-1, SOD, T-AOC, and butyric acid (p &lt; 0.05), and similarly, ADG with VH (p &lt; 0.05) showed a positive correlation. In conclusion, NSB enhanced the growth performance by improving jejunum and ileum morphology, serum anti-inflammatory cytokines, regulating intestinal barrier function and antioxidant capacity, SCFAs content, and cecum microbiota, showing its potential use as an alternative to antibiotics in poultry nutrition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4aad0506179946eb126138c05c9922359a9728e164006f98493a99b08a12c6ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
