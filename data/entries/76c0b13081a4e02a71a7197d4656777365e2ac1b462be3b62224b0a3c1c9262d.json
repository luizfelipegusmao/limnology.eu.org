The shark exhibited a partial reduction in pigmentation, resulting in an overall pale appearance with white-greyish patches. Since the retinal pigmentation appeared normal, the shark was considered leucistic. This represents the first documented case of leucism in this species and the first colour disorder reported in the family Oxynotidae Gill, 1912. Despite the atypical appearance, the physical health of the shark seemed unaffected, supporting the notion that pigment disorders in deep-sea sharks do not inherently impair survival and growth. Full morphometric characteristics are presented and compared with those of a normal individual of the same sex caught in the same area, showing no differences.</p>","author":"Andrej A.
