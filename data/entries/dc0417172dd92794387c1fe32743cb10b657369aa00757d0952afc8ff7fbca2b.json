{"title":"Clip Closure and PuraStat for Prevention of Clinically Significant Delayed Bleeding after Colorectal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection: A Prospective, Observational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1562/v1","date":1713945497000,"content":"Background and aims. Clinically significant delayed bleeding (CSDB) may complicate endoscopic colorectal submucosal dissection (ESD). \nMethods. We assessed the results of a prospective registry of colorectal ESD. We evaluated the effect of clip closure and PuraStat application for prevention of CSDB.\nResults. 40 patients with 41 colorectal ESD were included. ESD was successful in 38 lesions (92.7%), 35 with R0 resection (92.1%) and 33 with curative resection (86.8%). CSDB occurred in 3 out 38 lesions (7.9%, 95% CI [1.7 â€“ 21.4%]), exclusively after rectal ESD (3 of 22 rectal lesions vs. 0 of 16 colonic lesions, p = 0.249). \nClip closure was more frequently used after colonic ESD (12 of 16 colonic lesions vs. 2 of 22 rectal lesions, p &lt; 0.001) and was not protective for CSDB in univariate analysis, even though no events occurred after clip closure (0 of 14 lesions with clip closure vs. 3 of 27 lesions without, p = 0.283). \nPuraStat was more frequently applied after ESD for rectal lesions (16 of 22 rectal lesions vs. 2 of 16 colonic le-sions, p &lt; 0.001) and was not protective for CSDB, all three events occurring after PuraStat application (3 of 21 lesions with PuraStat application vs. 0 of 20 lesions without, p = 0.097). \nConclusions. CSDB occurred exclusively after rectal ESD, and no predictive factors were identified in uni-variate analysis. Clip closure and PuraStat application were not protective for CSDB.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc0417172dd92794387c1fe32743cb10b657369aa00757d0952afc8ff7fbca2b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
