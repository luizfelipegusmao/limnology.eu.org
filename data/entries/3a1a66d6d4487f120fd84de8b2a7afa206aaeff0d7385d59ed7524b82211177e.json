{"title":"Globalization, Digitalization, and Sustainable Development Goals:A Roadmap for Equitable Progress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1800/v1","date":1714284406000,"content":"Globalization and digitalization have been associated with a number of challenges and opportunities. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the impact of globalization and digitization on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and provide recommendations for achieving sustainable development. The study used a multidisciplinary approach that combined diverse research methods. This included a literature review, case studies, and empirical research findings. The findings suggest that while globalization has had both positive and negative impacts on the SDGs, it also poses challenges to social and environmental sustainability. Globalization's impact on sustainable development goals is complex and multifaceted, requiring policymakers to implement diverse measures to mitigate negative effects and promote sustainable development, particularly in less developed regions and marginalized communities. In conclusion, this chapter highlights the need for a coordinated and holistic approach to sustainable development that prioritizes the Sustainable Design Goals in policy and decision-making.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a1a66d6d4487f120fd84de8b2a7afa206aaeff0d7385d59ed7524b82211177e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
