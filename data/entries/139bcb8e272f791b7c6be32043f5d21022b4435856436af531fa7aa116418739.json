Experimental rotifers groups were fed Protein-Plus® (PP treatment), Inactive Beaker's Yeast® (INBY treatment), Algome® (Algome treatment), freshly cultured <i>N. oculata</i> (FA treatment), and spray-dried <i>N. oculata</i> (SDN treatment). At the end of the experiment, seven essential vitamins, nine macro- and micro-minerals, and two pigments were analyzed in diets and rotifers. All the treatments tested provided adequate levels of Ca, P, Mg, and Co to the rotifers, but insufficient levels of I, Zn, and vitamins B2 and E. Moreover, PP diet produced rotifers with high levels of vitamins B1, B3 and B9, and P; the SDN diet produced rotifers with high levels of P and Cu; the Algome diet produced rotifers high in vitamins B3 and B9, and Ca; the INBY diet produced rotifers with high levels of vitamin B1 and Ca; and the FA diet produced rotifers with more vitamin B6, Se, and Cu. In conclusion, specific minerals or vitamins corrections are required in these feeds for rotifers to adequately meet the nutritional needs for marine larvae.</p>","author":"Kamil Mert Eryalçın, \nDavid Dominguez, \nMarisol Izquierdo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"139bcb8e272f791b7c6be32043f5d21022b4435856436af531fa7aa116418739","category":"Environment"}
