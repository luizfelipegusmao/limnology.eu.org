{"title":"Emerging Environmental Contaminats of High Concern: Trends, Potential Sources, Friendly Treatment Technologies and Future Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1848/v1","date":1714293752000,"content":"Due to various industrial developments and artificial inputs, there are emerging environmental contaminats(ECs) of serious concern in a wide range of environmental media. With recent advancements in scientific knowledge and industrial technology, the definition of emerging environmental contaminats has expanded. Among them, emerging contaminants are typically present in trace amounts and pose serious ecological risks and potential hazards to human health, animals and plants, with cumulative effects on organisms. However, Traditional treatment techniques have proven ineffective in eliminating and preventing subsequent environmental problems from new pollutants such as microplastics, antibiotics and fluorocarbons. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to address these issues. Effective removal methods prioritize not only removal efficiency, but also environmental friendliness and regenerative capacity. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the sources, forms of presence, environmental and human health hazards, and removal technologies of ECs, and to provide various examples of different sources.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"924775c700b813059a87c47d7547fd76f2f3bb48466393be2392e5ba29221c4a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
