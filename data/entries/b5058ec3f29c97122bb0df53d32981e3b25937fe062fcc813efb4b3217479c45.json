{"title":"MicroRNA Nobel Prize: A Timely Recognition, and a High Anticipation&mdash;A Detailed Analysis to Assist","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1972/v1","date":1729778631000,"content":"microRNAS (miRNAs) maintain cellular homeostasis by blocking mRNAs through binding with t-RNA to fine-tune the expression of genes across numerous biological pathways. The 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for the discovery of miRNA was long overdue and now we anticipate a deluge of research work involving miRNA to repeat the history with other RNA prizes. While miRNA therapies include several complex diseases, the realization that miRNA regulates genes, its role in addressing therapies of hundreds of diseases is expected but with advancement in drug discovery tools, we anticipate faster entry of new drug entities; to promote this, we provide details of the current science, logic, intellectual property, formulations and regulatory process with anticipation that now many more researchers will deliver novel therapies based on the discussion and advice provided in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5058ec3f29c97122bb0df53d32981e3b25937fe062fcc813efb4b3217479c45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
