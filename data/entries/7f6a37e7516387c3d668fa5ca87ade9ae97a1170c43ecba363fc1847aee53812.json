Among diabetic patients, lean type 2 diabetes is a severe subtype with higher microvascular complication risks. While studies on the prevalence, variations and risk factors of diabetes are increasingly available, there has been limited research on the prevalence, variations, and socioeconomic disparities of lean diabetes in India. This study used NFHS-5 microdata, and lean diabetes is defined as those with a BMI level of under 25 and random blood glucose levels of over 200 or under diabetic medication. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted to understand lean diabetes variations and related factors. Socioeconomic disparities were measured using concentration curves and the concentration index. The study unveiled important insights into lean diabetes in India. 8.2% of men and 6.0% of women had elevated blood glucose levels, indicating a significant diabetes burden. Notably, 2.9% of men and 2.4% of women were diagnosed with lean diabetes. Among type 2 diabetics, 52.56% of males and 43.57% of females had lean type 2 diabetes. Lean diabetes prevalence varied from 11.6% in the poorest quintile to 1.1% in the richest. The odds of lean type 2 diabetes among those in the poorest quintile was 6.7 compared to the richest quintile. The concentration index of lean type 2 diabetes was -0.42 for men and -0.39 for women, suggesting a disproportionate impact on lower socioeconomic groups. This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors and lean type 2 diabetes in India. To address the rising burden of lean diabetes among lower socioeconomic strata, policymakers and healthcare professionals must prioritise initiatives enhancing healthcare access, promoting healthy lifestyles, and ensuring effective diabetes management. By addressing socioeconomic disparities and implementing interventions for vulnerable populations, India can reduce diabetes-related mortality and enhance its citizens’ overall health.","author":"Surama Manjari Behera","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"7f6a37e7516387c3d668fa5ca87ade9ae97a1170c43ecba363fc1847aee53812","category":"Environment"}
