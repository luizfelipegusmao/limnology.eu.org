{"title":"Global analysis of key post-transcriptional regulation in early leaf development of Limonium bicolor identifies a long non-coding RNA that promotes salt gland development and salt resistance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/5091/7682285?rss=1","date":1716595200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Limonium bicolor</span>, known horticulturally as sea lavender, is a typical recretohalophyte with salt glands in its leaf epidermis that secrete excess Na<sup>+</sup> out of the plant. Although many genes have been proposed to contribute to salt gland initiation and development, a detailed analysis of alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation patterns, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been lacking. Here, we applied single-molecule long-read mRNA isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) to explore the complexity of the <span>L. bicolor</span> transcriptome in leaves during salt gland initiation (stage A) and salt gland differentiation (stage B) based on the reference genome. We identified alternative splicing events and the use of alternative poly(A) sites unique to stage A or stage B, leading to the hypothesis that they might contribute to the differentiation of salt glands. Based on the Iso-seq data and RNA <span>in situ</span> hybridization of candidate genes, we selected the lncRNA Btranscript_153392 for gene editing and virus-induced gene silencing to dissect its function. In the absence of this transcript, we observed fewer salt glands on the leaf epidermis, leading to diminished salt secretion and salt tolerance. Our data provide transcriptome resources for unraveling the mechanisms behind salt gland development and furthering crop transformation efforts towards enhanced survivability in saline soils.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"46cecdc5b52777efd31f7a030b39f07598653d53fc2dd59cdc800aae97506b20","category":"Environment"}
