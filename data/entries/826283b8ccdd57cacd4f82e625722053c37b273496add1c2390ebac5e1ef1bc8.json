{"title":"Current Management of Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer in Italy: A National Survey on Behalf of Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2202/v1","date":1727428363000,"content":"Background: Extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) treatment has recently been revolutionized by the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This survey was conducted to evaluate the current pattern of care among Italian clinicians, in particular about the integration with radiation therapy (RT). Methods: In June 2023, 225 Italian cancer care professionals were invited to 21-question web-based survey about the ES-SCLC management through personal contacts and the Italian Association for Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) network. Results: We received 90 responses, the majority were radiation oncologists (89%) with more than 10 years of experience (51%). Preferred management of ES-SCLC in patients with a good performance status was concomitant chemo-immunotherapy (84%). Almost all respondents recommended prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (85%), taking into account age and thoracic response; PCI was performed mainly between the end of chemotherapy before starting immunotherapy (37%), with three-dimensional conformal technique (46%). Furthermore, 83% of respondents choose to deliver thoracic RT in case of both intrathoracic and extrathoracic response with a RT schedule of 30 Gy/10 fractions. Stereotactic RT is increasingly being used in oligoprogressions. Conclusions: Our analysis showed the variability of real-world management of ES-SCLC. Future clinical trials and developments are needed to improve the multidisciplinary treatment of these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"826283b8ccdd57cacd4f82e625722053c37b273496add1c2390ebac5e1ef1bc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
