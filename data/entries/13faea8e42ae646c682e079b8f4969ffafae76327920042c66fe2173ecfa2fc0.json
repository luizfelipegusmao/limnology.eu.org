{"title":"Influence of metabolizable protein and methionine supplementation on growth-performance of Holstein steer calves during the initial 112-d feedlot growing phase","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae003/7513006?rss=1","date":1704672000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to examine the effects of metabolizable protein (MP) and ruminal-protected methionine supplementation on growth performance of Holstein steer calves during the initial feedlot growing phase (112 d). One hundred eighty Holstein steer calves (122 ± 7 kg) were blocked by weight and assigned to 30 pens (6 steers per pen). Five treatments were applied: 1) control, a diet based on steam-flaked corn containing urea and dry distillers grains plus solubles as supplemental N sources with no amino acid addition; 2) control diet plus blood meal supplementation; 3) diet from treatment 2, with 0.064% Smartamine M (70% methionine; Adisseo, Alpharetta, GA) supplementation; 4) diet from treatment 2 with 0.096% Smartamine M supplementation; 5) diet from treatment 2 with 0.128% Smartamine M supplementation. All diets were formulated to exceed the estimated MP requirements. The estimated metabolizable lysine, as well as methionine, was deficient in the control diet. Blood meal was added to the control diet to meet estimated lysine requirements (diet 2), the other diets had increasing concentrations of supplemental methionine. Supplemental MP enhanced (10%, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.02) interim and overall 112-d average daily gain (ADG). Additional effects of supplemental methionine on ADG were not appreciable (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). Supplemental MP did not affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) dry matter intake (DMI) during the first 56-d period; however, it tended to increase (<span>P</span> = 0.08) DMI during the subsequent 56-d period. Overall, supplemental MP or methionine had no appreciable effect (P &gt; 0.10) on DMI. Supplemental MP improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) gain efficiency and estimated dietary net energy (NE) values during the initial 56-d period (11 and 7%, respectively) and overall (7 and 4%, respectively). Supplemental MP did not affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) gain efficiency during the second 56-d period, although it tended to enhance (<span>P</span> = 0.08) estimated dietary NE. Supplemental methionine did not appreciably affect (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) gain efficiency or estimated dietary NE. Therefore, adding MP to cover the estimated limiting amino acid supply in diets may enhance the gain efficiency and dietary energetics of growing Holstein calves. However, amino acid addition supplementation beyond the requirements may not produce extra productive performance of steer calves.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"13faea8e42ae646c682e079b8f4969ffafae76327920042c66fe2173ecfa2fc0","category":"Environment"}
