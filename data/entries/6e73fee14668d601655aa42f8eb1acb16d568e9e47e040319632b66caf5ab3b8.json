{"title":"Flood Risk Assessment for the Ancient Sites in Henan Province Considering Multiple types of Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0981/v1","date":1728956838000,"content":"Presently, the recurrent flood disasters resulting from global extreme weather have inflicted damage upon the Chinese ancient site. Considering the complexity of the materials consist of the Chinese ancient sites, a flood risk assessment method for the ancient sites in Henan province considering multiple types of materials is proposed in this paper. Within the framework, the hazard, sensitivity and vulnerability of the ancient sites are selected and calculated by the selected indicators respectively. To overcome the complexity of the materials, we regard the types of ancient sites as the material score to calculate vulnerability of ancient site. Subsequently, the weight of each indicator is captured based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Finally, 157 ancient sites in Henan province are selected for the flood disasters risk calculation and analysis in this paper. The results demonstrate our proposed method can obtain more accurate rainstorm and flood risk of the ancient sites.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e73fee14668d601655aa42f8eb1acb16d568e9e47e040319632b66caf5ab3b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
