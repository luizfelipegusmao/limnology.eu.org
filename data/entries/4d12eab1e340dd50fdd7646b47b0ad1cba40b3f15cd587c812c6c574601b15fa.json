Personality characteristics were assessed with the Rorschach test coded according to Exner’s comprehensive system and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-II).</p> Results <p>Thirty-one patients with FMDs (27 women; age 40.2±15.5 years; education 11.7±3.2 years; disease duration 2.3±2.5 years) and 24 patients affected by OND (18 women; age 35.8±16.3 years; education 11.9±2.9 years; disease duration 3.4±2.8 years) were enrolled. At the Rorschach, FMDs presented a significantly higher frequency of Popular (P) and sum of all Human content codes (SumH&gt;5) responses and avoidant coping than OND.</p> Conclusion <p>FMDs presented “conformity behaviors”, excessive interest in others than usual a maladaptive avoidant style of coping and a difficulty in verbalizing emotional distress. These psychopathological characteristics may favor the occurrence of FMDs.</p>","author":"Antonina Luca","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4d12eab1e340dd50fdd7646b47b0ad1cba40b3f15cd587c812c6c574601b15fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
