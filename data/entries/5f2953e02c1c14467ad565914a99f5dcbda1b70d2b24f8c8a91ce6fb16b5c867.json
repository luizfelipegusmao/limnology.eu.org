However, the ongoing climate changes subject crops to important environmental stress that for some varieties leads to high production losses. Therefore, selection of species and varieties more versatile and adaptable to different environmental conditions can be important. However, the characteristics of some cereals are not completely known, this is a priority before to improve their cultivation. The aim of this study is to characterize select species of potential suitable for local environmental conditions, nutritional value.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f2953e02c1c14467ad565914a99f5dcbda1b70d2b24f8c8a91ce6fb16b5c867","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
