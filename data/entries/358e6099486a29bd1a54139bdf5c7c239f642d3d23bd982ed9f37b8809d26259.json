ELISpot was performed to detect <i>Aspergillus</i>-specific T cells producing Interleukin-10.</p> Results <p>In the discovery cohort, a derived cut-off of 40 spot forming cells (SFCs)/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs has shown to correctly classify IA cases with a sensitivity and specificity of 89.5% and 88.6%, respectively. This cut-off is lowered to 25 SFC when considering the subset of possible IA patients, with sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 93%, respectively. The application of the 40 SFCs cut-off to the validation cohort resulted in a positivity rate of 83.3% in proven/probable cases and a negativity rate of 92.5% in possible/non-IA cases. Adopting the 25 SCFs cut-off, the assay resulted positive in 83.3% of proven/probable cases while it resulted negative in 66.7% of possible/non-IA cases.</p> Conclusions <p>ELISpot shows promises in the diagnosis of IA and the possibility to use two distinct cut-offs with similar diagnostic performances according to patients’ different pre-test probability of infection can widen its use in patients at risk.</p>","author":"Francesca Bettelli","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"358e6099486a29bd1a54139bdf5c7c239f642d3d23bd982ed9f37b8809d26259","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
