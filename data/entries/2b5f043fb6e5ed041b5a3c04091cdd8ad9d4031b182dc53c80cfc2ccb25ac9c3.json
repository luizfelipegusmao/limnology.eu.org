{"title":"Derangetropy in Probability Distributions and Information Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0611/v1","date":1725864197000,"content":"We introduce derangetropy, a novel functional measure designed to characterize the dynamics of information within probability distributions. Unlike scalar measures such as Shannon entropy, derangetropy offers a functional representation that captures the dispersion of information across the entire support of a distribution. By incorporating self-referential and periodic properties, it provides deeper insights into information dynamics governed by differential equations and equilibrium states. Through combinatorial justifications and empirical analysis, we demonstrate the utility of derangetropy in depicting distribution behavior and evolution, providing a new tool for analyzing complex and hierarchical systems in information theory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b5f043fb6e5ed041b5a3c04091cdd8ad9d4031b182dc53c80cfc2ccb25ac9c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
