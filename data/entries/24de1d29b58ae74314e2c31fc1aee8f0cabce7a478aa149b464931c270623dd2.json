{"title":"Synovial Sarcoma of the Ethmoid Sinus with Extension to the Cavernous Sinus: A Case Report and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0822/v1","date":1712890440000,"content":"Synovial sarcomas are rare soft tissue tumors that infrequently occur in the ethmoid sinus, posing diagnostic challenges. Herein, we report a case of a 38-year-old male with a 7-month history of recurrent throbbing headaches, left eye pain, and facial nerve palsy, evolving into multiple stroke episodes. Radiological studies showed extension to the cavernous sinus, raising an initial suspicion of vasculitis. Histological findings of an endoscopic biopsy, however, confirmed a monophasic synovial sarcoma. Consequently, the patient was referred to a specialized center for comprehensive management. This case underscores the rarity of ethmoid sinus synovial sarcomas, their diverse clinical presentations, and the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach for accurate diagnosis and tailored therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24de1d29b58ae74314e2c31fc1aee8f0cabce7a478aa149b464931c270623dd2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
