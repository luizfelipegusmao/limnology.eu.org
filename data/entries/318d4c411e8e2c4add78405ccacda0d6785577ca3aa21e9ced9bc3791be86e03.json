{"title":"189 Association of the liver phosphoproteome with divergent dry matter intake in finishing beef steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/351/7757045?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>As the need for improving the sustainability of the beef industry increases, optimizing feed efficiency is of the utmost importance. The liver has a central role in nutrient metabolism, and for ruminants particularly, it is essential for providing glucose through gluconeogenesis via substrates such as propionate, lactate, and glycerol. Further, through cell signaling and vagal afferent signals, the liver acts to stimulate and inhibit dry matter intake (DMI). Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate alterations in the phosphoproteome of finishing beef steers in relation to divergent DMI to identify changes in the abundance of signaling proteins. Angus steers [n = 57; initial body weight (BW) = 518 Â± 27 kg] underwent a 63-d intake trial utilizing an Insentec Roughage Intake Control System (Hokofarm Group, Emmeloord, The Netherlands). Prior to beginning the trial, liver biopsy samples were collected from all steers. Samples from steers with the greatest and least DMI (n = 8 each) were utilized for phosphoproteomic analysis. Liver protein was isolated and labeled with isobaric tandem mass tagging reagents. Samples were enriched for phosphopeptides using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and subsequently analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Spectral data were searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information <span>Bos taurus</span> protein database using MaxQuant (version 2.2.0.0; Max Planck Inst., Munich, Germany), and the data were analyzed using Perseus (version 2.0.10.0; Max Planck Inst.). Two sample t-tests were conducted to determine the difference in phosphopeptide abundance between steers with high and low DMI. A total of 16,365 phosphopeptides were identified, and 287 were differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate &lt; 0.05). In addition, 2,777 phosphopeptides were differentially expressed based on an unadjusted <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 which were used for enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. The background for this analysis was all identified phosphopeptides. Gene ontology terms enriched included processes related to phosphorylation activity, intracellular signal transduction, response to insulin, kinase activity, and signaling protein binding. Enriched KEGG pathways included pathways related to insulin signaling, such as AMPK signaling, mTOR signaling, and MAPK signaling. Further, pathways related to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, glucagon signaling, insulin resistance, carbon metabolism, and various other signaling pathways were also enriched. These results suggest a link between the liver phosphoproteome and DMI, indicating that divergent DMI is associated with alterations in signaling pathways related to nutrient uptake and metabolic processes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"318d4c411e8e2c4add78405ccacda0d6785577ca3aa21e9ced9bc3791be86e03","category":"Environment"}
