{"title":"Characterizing the 3D Polar Texture of Ferroelectric Relaxors using Multislice Electron Ptychography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.550/7720027?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit exceptional piezoelectric and dielectric properties, attributed to their intricate polar structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.550-B1\">1</a>]. Since their discovery, the theoretical models of relaxor behavior have evolved considerably, starting from polar nano domains described by random field theory [<a href=\"#ozae044.550-B2\">2</a>] to the description characterized by slush-like polar texture [<a href=\"#ozae044.550-B3\">3</a>]. However, the validation of the atomic-scale model and efforts to unravel the interplay of chemical and structural order/disorder have been significantly hindered due to the lack of characterization techniques that can access sub-surface structure. For example, while scanning transmission electron microscopy offers localized exploration of nanoscale features [<a href=\"#ozae044.550-B4\">4</a>], the projection of the three-dimensional (3D) crystal into 2D image introduces challenges in unambiguously determining chemistry and polar structure, as well as their correlation. In contrast, multislice electron ptychography (MEP) has emerged as a powerful tool to overcome these challenges [<a href=\"#ozae044.550-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.550-B6\">6</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"59c8c0fb4507c45b4013d7d8868f0968058a2b835c5def4261461149b1326bc2","category":"Environment"}
