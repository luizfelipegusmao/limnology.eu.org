{"title":"Insights of Gravitational Phenomena: A Study Applying Thermodynamic Properties of Gases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0350/v3","date":1709908292000,"content":"Laboratory experiments and investigations into natural phenomena in this research series have unveiled the presence of a gravitational repulsion force that permeates our environment on both microscopic and macroscopic scales, contingent upon the thermal energy present.  This paper presents a study exploring novel properties of gravitational forces among gas molecules, employing principles of thermodynamics.  A model has been devised based on the interactions between pairs of gas molecules.  While traditional models treat gravitational interaction as a singular force, our experimental approach validates it as the composite of two distinct forces: gravitational repulsion and attraction.  By utilizing established experimental data on gas thermodynamics, our model demonstrates robust performance both analytically and experimentally.  It verifies the coexistence of gravitational repulsion and attraction forces among gas molecules, showcases their Inverse-Cube relationship with distance, and elucidates the direct proportionality of the repulsion force to absolute temperature.  This bridges a crucial gap between energy and fundamental forces.  The order of magnitudes of gravitational repulsion and attraction forces are found to be considerably large, contrasting with the low values predicted by classical theory, which results from their amalgamation. Recognizing these forces as substantial in magnitude promises unprecedented outcomes and advancements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef08631011a217ea99b3d23358aea8d9b9737c36db358403e8f7b87edb0676aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
