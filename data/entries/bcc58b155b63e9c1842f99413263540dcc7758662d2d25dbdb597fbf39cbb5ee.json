Resolving these conflicts requires conservation-compatible livelihoods, such as through agroecology. Here, we built a comprehensive social–psychological framework to explore and understand farmers' intentions to adopt agroecological approaches in tea management in Wuyishan National Park, China.\n\nWe extended the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) by integrating household livelihood assets (LAs) as a material precondition for the social–psychological decision-making process. We proposed geographical location (GL) and livelihood strategy (LS) as moderating factors for this agroecology intention. We collected 369 valid household samples through structured interviews. We then used partial least square-structural equation (PLS-SEM) modelling to explore the determinants that affect tea farmers' agroecological intentions.\n\nLivelihood assets were a material foundation influencing the intention to adopt agroecology and were also mediated by three psychological constructs to take effect. Perceived behavioural control explained the largest proportion of the variance for intention and exerted the most significant mediation effects. Subjective norm was another vital independent predictor and exerted a positive influence on both perceived behavioural control and attitude. The direct and mediating impacts of attitude on the intention were weaker but showed that farmers' ecological rationality outweighed value rationality.\n\nLivelihood strategies measured by operational scale and livelihood diversity were able to moderate farmers' psychology. Subjective norm had positively significant influence on perceived behavioural control and attitude, indicating that social support to farmers enhanced their feeling of control over adopting agroecology and that important referent groups as sources of information helped farmers' attitude formation. Perceived behavioural control positively and significantly influences farmers' attitudes as well.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. Our findings provide evidence of the necessity to optimise rural farmers' livelihood assets to enhance their confidence and control over agroecology. Resolving the conservation-development dilemma in protected areas through agroecology should aim at comprehensive support that respects bioculture and improves farmers' ability. We suggest knowledge co-production of traditional wisdom and modern technologies, reducing management costs and risks, strengthening park-people communication and diversifying incentives to farmers with different livelihood strategies.\n</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>\n\n人类活动与生物多样性价值引发的冲突会影响自然保护地的保护成效。解决这些冲突需要通过生态农业等方式实现保护兼容性生计。我们整合发展了一个全面的社会心理框架来探索和理解中国武夷山国家公园农户在茶叶管理中采用生态农业方式的行为意向。\n\n我们通过整合家庭生计资产作为决策的社会心理过程的物质先决条件，扩展了计划行为理论；提出了地理位置和生计策略作为采用生态农业这一方式的行为意愿的调节因素；通过结构化访谈收集了369个有效的家庭样本；使用偏最小二乘结构方程建模来探索影响茶农从事生态农业的行为意向的决定因素。\n\n生计资产是直接影响生态农业行为意向的物质基础，同时它也受到三项因素的间接调节。知觉行为控制对于意向最具有解释力，并发挥了最显著的中介作用；主观规范是另一个对于意向而言重要的独立预测因素。态度对意向的直接和间接影响较弱，但它体现出农民在选择生态农业方式时表现出生态理性比价值理性更重要。\n\n以经营规模和生计多样性衡量的生计策略能够调节农民的心理。主观规范对知觉行为控制和态度有积极显著的影响，既表明对农民的社会支持增强了他们对采用生态农业方式的可控性，也表明作为信息来源的重要群体能够帮助农民形成积极的态度。知觉行为控制对农民的态度也有积极显著的影响。\n\n总结和应用:我们的研究结果证明了优化乡村农户生计资产的必要性，以增强他们对生态农业的信心和控制力。通过生态农业方式解决自然保护地的保护与发展困境，应基于尊重当地生物文化来提供全面的支持以提高农民的能力。我们建议进行传统智慧和现代技术的知识共同生产，降低管理成本和风险，加强国家公园与农户的沟通，并为不同生计策略的农民提供多样化的激励措施。\n</p>","author":"Siyuan He, \nBojie Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"bcc58b155b63e9c1842f99413263540dcc7758662d2d25dbdb597fbf39cbb5ee","category":"Environment"}
