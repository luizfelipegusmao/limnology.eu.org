{"title":"Development and Comprehensive Characterization of Magnetic Chitosan Particles for Clean Removal of Pollutants from Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0748/v1","date":1710346127000,"content":"A single water pollution by dyes is a huge environmental problem; there is a necessity to produce new decolorization methods that are effective, cost-attractive, and suitable in industrial use. Magnetic chitosan polymers offer the advantage of easy separation from the dye solution. In this work, a Chitosan-Fe polymer was synthesized, characterized, and tested for removal of the azo dye Direct Red 83:1 from water. The polymer was characterized in terms of surface morphology (SEM), elemental analysis (EA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared spectrophotometry (IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and density functional theory (DFT). The reported results hint that 1 g and pH 7.0 were the best conditions to carry out both kinetic and isotherm models. To understand the adsorption behavior of Direct Red 83:1 onto the polymers, adsorption rate and maximum adsorption capacity were calculated using kinetic tests and isotherm curves respectively. The kinetic data and mechanism of the adsorption process were analyzed by three models and the equilibrium data by three adsorption isotherms. The results indicated that the adsorption process follows a pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2= 0.999) and fits the Temkin isotherm (R2= 0.946), indicating that the adsorption occurred on heterogeneous surfaces. The newly synthesized Chitosan-Fe polymer exhibited good adsorption properties and easy separation of cleaned water.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c471001c1776fc4a644633148cdbf158d100a518058b2ec4abf795849ccff153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
