{"title":"Estimation and Compensation of the Ionospheric Path Delay Phase in PALSAR-3 and NISAR-L Interferograms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0444/v1","date":1715168550000,"content":"Spatial and temporal variation of the free electron concentration in the ionosphere affects SAR interferograms, in particular at low radar frequencies. In this work the identification, estimation and compensation of ionospheric path delay phases in PALSAR-3 and NISAR-L interferograms is discussed. Both these L-band sensors acquire simultaneously SAR data in a main spectral band and in an additional, spectrally separated, narrower second band to support the mitigation of ionospheric path delays. The methods presented permit separating the dispersive and the non-dispersive phase terms based on the double-difference interferogram between the two available spectral bands and the differential interferogram of the main band. The applicability of the proposed methods is demonstrated using PALSAR-3-like data that was simulated based on PALSAR-2 SM1 mode data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"077ec6d38e5c7944d476656f505d8779f9a33c7b97248e174e013780a0626d22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
