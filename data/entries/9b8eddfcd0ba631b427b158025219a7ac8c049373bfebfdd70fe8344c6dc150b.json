{"title":"Dynamics of Halogen Molecule Vibrations in Molecular Crystals: Temperature and Halogen Dependency","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0995/v1","date":1713245497000,"content":"Raman spectra of [TeX6](Y2) (X, Y - Cl, Br, I) were recorded in the temperature range 5-300 K. The vibration frequency of molecular halogens as function on temperature and the type of halogen X- in the [TeX6]2- complex was obtained. The vibration frequency of the molecular halogen Y2 depends on the type of halogen X- complex [TeX6]2- The temperature dependence of the Y2 frequency is anomalous compared to what was expected for a conventional anharmonic oscillator. It is shown that the interpretation of the experimental results based on the concept of traditional chemical bonding is quite satisfactory in all cases. The study was motivated by the need to consider the mechanism of interaction in the X-Y2 contacts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b8eddfcd0ba631b427b158025219a7ac8c049373bfebfdd70fe8344c6dc150b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
