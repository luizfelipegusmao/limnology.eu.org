{"title":"Enhancing Dengue Outbreak Predictions Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1847/v1","date":1714293203000,"content":"Dengue, a perilous fever-type illness transmitted by mosquitoes, remains a significant global health concern. The incidence of dengue outbreaks is primarily influenced by climate factors, contributing to fluctuating dengue cases. Therefore, this study aims to develop predictive models for dengue outbreaks employing Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Four distinct ML models, namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and Support Vector Regressor (SVR), were employed in this study. Prior to model analysis, thorough data preprocessing was conducted. In some instances, certain attributes exhibiting sparse correlations with dengue occurrence were eliminated based on correlation analysis. Upon finalizing the models, performance evaluation was executed through comparison based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. The findings of this comparative analysis revealed that the KNN model exhibited significantly superior performance compared to the other three models. This outcome underscores the potential of KNN in enhancing the accuracy of dengue outbreak predictions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9e5b1ee3a6541847e9f98b077d6790cdd065c390ef386644692be8081e796cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
