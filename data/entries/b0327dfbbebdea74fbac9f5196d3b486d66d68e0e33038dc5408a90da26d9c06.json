{"title":"Border Interceptions Reveal Variable Bridgehead Use in the Global Dispersal of Insects","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13924?af=R","date":1727768464000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>The global, human-mediated dispersal of invasive insects is a major driver of ecosystem change, biodiversity loss, crop damage and other effects. Trade flows and invasive species propagule pressure are correlated, and their relationship is essential for predicting and managing future invasions. Invaders do not disperse exclusively from the species' native range. Instead, the bridgehead effect, where established, non-native populations act as secondary sources of propagule, is recognised as a major driver of global invasion. The resulting pattern of global spread arises from a mixture of global interactions between invasive species, their vectors and, their invaded ranges, which has yet to be fully characterised.</p>\n<h2>Location</h2>\n<p>Global.</p>\n<h2>Time Period</h2>\n<p>1997–2020.</p>\n<h2>Major Taxa Studied</h2>\n<p>Insects.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>We analysed 319,283 border interception records of 514 insect species from a broad range of taxa from four national-level phytosanitary organisations. We classified interceptions as coming from species native range or from bridgehead countries and examined taxonomic autocorrelation of global movement patterns between species.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>While 65% of interceptions originated from bridgehead countries, highlighting the importance of the bridgehead effect across taxa, patterns among individual species were highly variable and taxonomically correlated. Forty per cent of species originated almost exclusively from their native range, 28% almost exclusively from their non-native range and 32% from a mix of source locations. These patterns of global dispersal were geographically widespread, temporally consistent, and taxonomically correlated.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Dispersal exclusively from bridgeheads represents an unrecognised pattern of global insect movement; these patterns emphasise the importance of the bridgehead effect and suggest that bridgeheads provide unique local conditions that allow invaders to proliferate differently than in their native range. We connect these patterns of global dispersal to the conditions during the human driven global dispersal of insects and provide recommendations for modellers and policymakers wishing to control the spread of future invasions.</p>","author":"Thom Worm, \nAriel Saffer, \nYu Takeuchi, \nChelsey Walden‐Schreiner, \nChris Jones, \nRoss Meentemeyer","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Ecology and Biogeography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3c0e5aaffe8fee3c8550c0a05a71fc802d704add877621e55c59b91462c01050","entryHash":"b0327dfbbebdea74fbac9f5196d3b486d66d68e0e33038dc5408a90da26d9c06","category":"Environment"}
