{"title":"The Effect of Monthly Disposable Soft Contact Lenses on Retinal Straylight","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0555/v1","date":1720434098000,"content":"Purpose of research was to determine changes in optical quality for monthly disposable soft contact lenses (SCL) wearers with new and monthly worn SCL. Retinal straylight was assessed in SCL wearers using a C-Quant straylight meter. The study included 33 participants (age 22 ± 1.4 years) who wore monthly disposable silicone hydrogel contact lenses. Measurements were taken with month-old SCL that had been worn for no more than 4 hours. Participants then replaced the old lenses with new ones. After a 15-minute adaptation period, straylight measurements were taken with the new SCL. A questionnaire was administered to all participants, inquiring about vision complaints and the type of contact lens material used. The decimal logarithm of the stray-light parameter, log(s), was notably higher with month-old SCL (log(s) = 0.97±0.17) than with brand-new SCL (log(s) = 0.86±0.15), p &lt; 0.001. The average increase in retinal straylight after a month of SCL use was log(s) = 0.11 ± 0.08. The questionnaire revealed that 35% of participants observed a reduction in visual quality after wearing the contact lenses for a month. Results showed that monthly disposable soft contact lenses could reduce visual quality when scheduled replacement time has been reached.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7034a08ffd6228731a8d308f61e15918006d915678e857790d48c5011bbc9aa5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
