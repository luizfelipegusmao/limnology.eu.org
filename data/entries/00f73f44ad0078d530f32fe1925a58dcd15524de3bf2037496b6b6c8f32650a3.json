{"title":"Consumers&rsquo; Purchase Intention of Electric Vehicles from the Perspective of Perceived Green Value: An Empirical Survey from China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1796/v1","date":1716881056000,"content":"This study aims to broaden the current understanding of the antecedents and consequences of green purchase intention within the realm of perceived green value (PGV) A mixed-method approach is deployed, integrating PLS-SEM and Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) to examine the role of influence and interaction as key precursors to perceived responsibility and perceived self-efficacy, and explores how perceived responsibility and perceived self-efficacy impacts green purchasing intention, mainly through the mediation of perceived responsibility (PER) and perceived self-efficacy (PSE) using survey data gathered from consumers participating. The results indicate that PGV positively influences green purchase intention (GPI). Moreover, PER and PSE exhibit significant chain mediation effects, with the mediation effect of perceived environmental responsibility being particularly strong. It is recommended that the government intensify green disseminate and education, promote the establishment of certification and evaluation systems for electric vehicle products, and that electric vehicle factories emphasize the environmental attributes and economic interest of their products to encourage green purchasing behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00f73f44ad0078d530f32fe1925a58dcd15524de3bf2037496b6b6c8f32650a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
