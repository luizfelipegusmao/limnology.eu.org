Thought experiments, including one by Deutsch and one by Frauchiger and Renner, are discussed and modeled using quantum circuits. Terminology is suggested which helps avoid contradictions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"517aa9f9203a2c0e12322c9b26247971eca2119e00cae814bd1de93ee4b62566","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
