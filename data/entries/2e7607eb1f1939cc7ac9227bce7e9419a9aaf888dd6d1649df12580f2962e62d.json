{"title":"4DOF Maneuvering Motion of a Container Ship in Shallow Water Based on CFD Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1368/v1","date":1713773830000,"content":"With the continuous increase in ship size combined with the generally slower increase in the size of waterways, the need for the prediction of ship maneuvering in shallow waterways continues to attract attention from the international scientific community. Ship behavior in shallow water is relevant in seabed effects that result in changing the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship. In this study, the maneuvering characteristics of container ship with four degrees of freedom in shallow water are analyzed. The Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes approach in Ansys Fluent code is used to produce the maneuvering coefficients through the simulations of forward running, static drift, static heel, circular motion, the combined motions, and the pure roll motion of the Kriso container ship. The maneuvering characteristics of the ship are estimated for evaluating the ship behaviors in shallow water condition. The obtained results show that the roll has a significant decrease and the shipâ€™s turning diameter has a significant increase when the ship operates in the shallow waterway. The prediction of maneuvering characteristics of the ship are in good agreement with those of free running model tests, indicating that the numerical simulation based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics method has compromising capability to predict the maneuvering derivatives and the 4-DOF ship maneuvering motion in shallow water as well.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e7607eb1f1939cc7ac9227bce7e9419a9aaf888dd6d1649df12580f2962e62d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
