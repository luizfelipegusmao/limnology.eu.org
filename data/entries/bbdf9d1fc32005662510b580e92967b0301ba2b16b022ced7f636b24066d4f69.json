To overcome these obstacles, we developed cryo-TomoSim (CTS), a software package that builds coarse grained models of macromolecular mixtures embedded in vitreous ice, and then simulates electron tilt series for tomogram calculation. Using simulated data, we first probe the impact of different tunable microscope parameters on the robustness of deep learning models. We then use CTS outputs to train U-Net models for both regression denoising and semantic segmentation and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of real tomographic inputs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bbdf9d1fc32005662510b580e92967b0301ba2b16b022ced7f636b24066d4f69","category":"Environment"}
