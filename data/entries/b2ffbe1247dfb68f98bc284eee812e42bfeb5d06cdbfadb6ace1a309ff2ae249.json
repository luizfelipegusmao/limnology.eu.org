{"title":"Improving Extreme Precipitation Reanalysis Data by Using the Observed Clausius-Clapeyron Relationships","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2586/v1","date":1722428165000,"content":"Climate change is a crucial issue of the 21st century, leading to more frequent and severe extreme precipitation events globally. These events result in significant social and economic disruptions, including flooding, loss of life, and damage to infrastructure. Projections suggest that extreme rainfall will intensify in the latter half of the century, underscoring the need for accurate and timely forecasting. Despite advancements in meteorological and climate models that offer high accuracy for various weather parameters, these models still struggle to detect extreme values, particularly for precipitation. This research examines the sensitivity of extreme precipitation events to temperature, based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, focusing on Thessaloniki, Greece. It also evaluates the effectiveness of reanalysis data in identifying extreme precipitation and explores how rainfall-temperature relationships can enhance prediction accuracy. The findings are vital for improving the estimation of extreme rainfall events and informing the design of flood-resilient infrastructure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2ffbe1247dfb68f98bc284eee812e42bfeb5d06cdbfadb6ace1a309ff2ae249","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
