By this method, the parametric families of continuous beam components and key construction machinery are established, and the rapid modeling of overall continuous beam bridge and the simulation of critical construction process are realized as well. Taking the Caoxian-Shangqiu bridge of Xiongâ€™an-Shangqiu HSR as a case study, the parametric modeling method is applied to conduct the engineering application on the prestressed duct layout and rebar clash detection. The results indicate that the modeling efficiencies of HSR continuous beam bridge and construction machinery are significantly increased by the established parametric modeling method. Based on the BIM model of continuous beam bridge, the improvement in the precision of prestressed duct layout and the elimination of rebar clash points can be achieved. The research achievement can guide the visualization of construction disclosure, enhance construction efficiency, and provide reference and technical support for the construction management and control of HSR continuous beam bridges.","author":"Hanwen Jiang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9b0ee1c98cc80b7f40706097f86c5cb35084289df38bee06474ce6fbf4ee6297","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
