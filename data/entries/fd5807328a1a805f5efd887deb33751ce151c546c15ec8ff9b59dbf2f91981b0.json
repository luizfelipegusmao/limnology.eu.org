{"title":"Hockey youth in Canada: Parents’ and coaches’ beliefs towards the half-ice game model for U9 hockey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305750","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Jean Lemoyne, Charles-Antoine Tardif</p>\r\n\r\nDespite the advantages of small area games in youth sport, some challenges remain regarding the implementation of the half-ice gameplay model in Canada. In youth sport, establishing a good line of communication between parents and coaches is a crucial step for a positive environment. The purpose of this study is to provide further knowledge on the mechanisms associated with parents’ and coaches’ perceptions regarding the half-ice model in Canada. Data came from a national survey distributed across Canada (N = 6 372). Parents and coaches completed questionnaires that assessed attitudes, norms and perceived facilitators-obstacles to half-ice hockey. Parents-coaches’ preferences towards the playing format and sociodemographic variables were also measured. Structural equation modelling was performed to verify associations between each variable. Beliefs were a key factor in parents-coaches’ preferences regarding the playing format. Previous sport background and knowledge about half-ice hockey were associated with favorable predispositions. Hockey associations administrators should consider parents and coaches’ predispositions in program implementation and should design promotional campaigns adapted to their members’ predispositions towards half-ice hockey. This research underlines the key factors to consider in successful program implementation in youth sport.","author":"Jean Lemoyne","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fd5807328a1a805f5efd887deb33751ce151c546c15ec8ff9b59dbf2f91981b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
