{"title":"Cerebral microvascular changes in healthy carriers of the APOE-ɛ4 Alzheimer's disease risk gene","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae369/7739966?rss=1","date":1724371200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>APOE-ɛ4 is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and with microvascular changes that limit the transport of oxygen from blood into brain tissue: reduced microvascular cerebral blood volume and high relative transit time heterogeneity (RTH). Healthy APOE-ɛ4 carriers reveal brain regions with <span>elevated</span> CBF compared with carriers of the common ɛ3 allele. Such asymptomatic hyperemia may reflect <span>microvascular dysfunction</span>: a vascular disease entity characterized by suboptimal tissue oxygen uptake, rather than limited blood flow per se. Here, we used perfusion MRI to show that elevated regional CBF is accompanied by reduced capillary blood volume in healthy APOE-ɛ4 carriers (carriers) aged 30–70 years compared with similarly aged APOE-ɛ3 carriers (noncarriers). Younger carriers have elevated hippocampal RTH and more extreme RTH values throughout both white matter (WM) and cortical gray matter (GM) compared with noncarriers. Older carriers have reduced WM CBF and more extreme GM RTH values than noncarriers. Across all groups, lower WM and hippocampal RTH correlate with higher educational attainment, which is associated with lower AD risk. Three days of dietary nitrate supplementation <span>increased</span> carriers' WM CBF but caused older carriers to score <span>worse</span> on two of six aggregate neuropsychological scores. The intervention improved late recall in younger carriers and in noncarriers. The APOE-ɛ4 gene is associated with microvascular changes that may impair tissue oxygen extraction. We speculate that vascular risk factor control is particularly important for APOE-ɛ4 carriers' healthy aging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"6dd11435f8a060b1e03b350d44ac9c40b7c4afa757952dc28187a3e633e7170e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
