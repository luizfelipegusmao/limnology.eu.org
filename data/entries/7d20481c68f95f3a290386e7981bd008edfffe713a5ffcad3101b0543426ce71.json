{"title":"EEG Signal Correlation Study Towards Possible Epileptic Foci Localization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2078/v1","date":1727363135000,"content":"The precise localisation of epileptic foci with the help of EEG or ECoG signals is still a clinical challenge that is rarely successful, except in the case of foci that are very close to the surface and allow a clear assignment to a single electrode. On the research side, dipole reconstruction of instantaneous excitation fields via the lead-field matrix or the evaluation of time-dependent phase shifts in the measurements seem to be still possible and are under development. For the latter, we have investigated the necessary correlation of signals in the time range up to a few hundred milliseconds in an EEG of a healthy subject (self-experiment). We find periods of up to 190 msec in length in which a correlation over short latencies succeeds very well, alternating with periods in which long-range correlations occur while the short latencies come to a standstill. An automatic propagation time focus localisation to be developed therefore appears possible if an underlying state monitoring system independently recognises the suitable time periods and then successfully performs the comparatively shortest-range triangulation calculations over these.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d20481c68f95f3a290386e7981bd008edfffe713a5ffcad3101b0543426ce71","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
