{"title":"Multimethod Approach to Uncover the Capacity Loss in Silicon-Based Lithium-Ion Batteries","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.116/7719526?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The surge in electrification, driven by the increasing prominence of electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics, has propelled lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) into the forefront of energy storage technologies. However, the relentless pursuit of electrification demands continuous improvements in energy densities, cycling stability, and overall endurance for the next generation of Li-ion batteries. A promising avenue for revolutionizing energy storage lies in the integration of silicon (Si) with a high weight percentage into LIB anodes, offering not only an impressive theoretical specific capacity, surpassing traditional graphite anodes, but also boasting cost-effectiveness, natural abundance, and non-toxic behaviour [<a href=\"#ozae044.116-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.116-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.116-B3\">3</a>]. Nevertheless, the implementation of Si in LIB anodes introduces challenges due to its repeated volume expansion and shrinkage during Li-ion insertion and extraction. This dynamic lithiation mechanism, based on amorphization and conversion of silicon into a high-lithium-content Li<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub> alloy, results in the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The significant volume swing impacts SEI formation at the silicon-electrolyte interface, leading to fractures in the SEI layer. Electrochemical cycling exacerbates these effects, causing repeated SEI growth and the formation of the silicon electrolyte composite (SEC). This continuous process depletes active lithium and electrolyte, ultimately diminishing the cell's capacity. Moreover, the volumetric changes in lithiated silicon regions exert pressure on the crystalline silicon core, generating mechanical stresses that affect the entire silicon binder matrix. This process is believed to result in particle pulverization, disrupting both Li-ion and electron conduction pathways, isolating silicon particles and rendering them inactive within the anode structure [<a href=\"#ozae044.116-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.116-B5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.116-B6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.116-B7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.116-B8\">8</a>]. Despite substantial progress in understanding the electrochemical aspects of Si-based anodes, a critical knowledge gap remains in comprehending the material science perspective of the electrochemically induced volume swing and associated mechanical loading on silicon crystals. Bridging this gap is imperative for advancing the development of the next generation of anode materials and pathing the way for their upscale integration into industrial settings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"17f854fb3d73ab979ac33c94ea8f99998012ebd3a6b93041f61dffcf2d849259","category":"Environment"}
