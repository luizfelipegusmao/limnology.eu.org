{"title":"Ecological barriers: An approach to ecological conservation and restoration in China","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13280-024-01988-8","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The Chinese government has pursued comprehensive ecological conservation and restoration by establishing an ecological barrier system. However, the majority of international research tends to focus on the connectivity between habitats, overlooking the functions that ecological barriers play in ecological conservation and restoration. The existing literature lacks a systematic exploration of the theory and practice of ecological barriers. This study employed the literature analysis tool CiteSpace to present the theoretical and developmental trends in ecological barriers from various perspectives, including research fields, historical evolution, research hotspots, and major research nations. By analyzing the differences in the understanding of ecological barriers between China and other countries, examining the ecological barriers construction history in China, and exploring the types and functions of ecological barriers, this study summarizes the framework of China’s ecological barriers construction system as “features–functions–problems.” Constructing an ecological barrier system can help achieve ecological conservation and restoration goals in China.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"83714d8d91df540abf8af2a385290f6d96c393b2441c482d886561676936950b","category":"Environment"}
