{"title":"Individualized social niches in animals: Theoretical clarifications and processes of niche change","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/3/146/7603031?rss=1","date":1707264000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>What are social niches, and how do they arise and change? Our first goal in the present article is to clarify the concept of an individualized social niche and to distinguish it from related concepts, such as a social environment and a social role. We argue that focal individuals are integral parts of individualized social niches and that social interactions with conspecifics are further core elements of social niches. Our second goal in the present article is to characterize three types of processes—social niche construction, conformance, and choice (social NC<sup>3</sup> processes)—that explain how individualized social niches originate and change. Our approach brings together studies of behavior, ecology, and evolution and integrates social niches into the broader concept of an individualized ecological niche. We show how clarifying the concept of a social niche and recognizing the differences between the three social NC<sup>3</sup> processes enhance and stimulate empirical research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"dd1ad1aad865d1f3de6515a9a0c64f4612f9cf6e398b10f23cb34a1d7bb23ff5","category":"Environment"}
