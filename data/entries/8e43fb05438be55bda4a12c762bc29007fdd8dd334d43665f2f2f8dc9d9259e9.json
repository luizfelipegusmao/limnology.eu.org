{"title":"Unveiling the Nexus: Influence of learning motivation on organizational performance and innovative climate of Chinese firms","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304729","date":1717164000000,"content":"<p>by Yu Zhang, Caizhi Liao, Jialei Liu, Yihe Zhang, Shiquan Gui, Qing Wei</p>\r\n\r\nThis study delves into the interplay between learning motivation, organizational performance, and the innovative climate within Chinese firms. It is a subject of frequent discussion in literature but there is little concrete evidence supporting this viewpoint within the context of small and medium size enterprises in China. Drawing upon a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data gathered, this research aims to uncover the connections between employee learning motivation and its impact on the organizational dynamics in the context of Chinese firms. A cross sectional survey is used to collect the data of 115 Chinese firms and structural equation modelling (SEM) is used for empirical analysis. The results show that success of firms in terms of innovation is significantly influenced by organizational learning motivation. Moreover, innovative environment of the firms increases the overall performance of the organizations. It is also found that factors affecting the innovations have a significant impact on organizational performance. The findings of the study suggest that firms should develop organizational learning motivation to boost their innovation capability and overall performance. This study offers insights and recommendations for organizations and policymakers seeking to harness the potential of learning motivation to drive sustainable growth, competitiveness, and innovation in Chinese firms.","author":"Yu Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8e43fb05438be55bda4a12c762bc29007fdd8dd334d43665f2f2f8dc9d9259e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
