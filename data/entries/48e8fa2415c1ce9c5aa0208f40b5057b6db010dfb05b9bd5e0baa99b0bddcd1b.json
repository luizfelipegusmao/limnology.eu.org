We examine data from a multidecade grassland experiment to show that species interactions in mixtures amplify the biomass response of plant FGs to N and/or CO<sub>2</sub> additions. Our results suggest that previous studies that considered responses to global changes in monocultures may underestimate biomass changes in diverse communities where interspecific interactions can amplify responses.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Plant functional groups (FGs) differ in their response to global changes, although species within those groups also vary in such responses. Both species and FG responses to global change are likely influenced by species interactions such as inter-specific competition and facilitation, which are prevalent in species mixtures but not monocultures. As most studies focus on responses of plants growing in either monocultures or mixtures, but rarely both, it remains unclear how interspecific interactions in diverse ecological communities, especially among species in different FGs, modify FG responses to global changes. To address these issues, we leveraged data from a 16-species, 24-year perennial grassland experiment to examine plant FG biomass responses to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and N inputs at different planted diversity. FGs differed in their responses to N and CO<sub>2</sub> treatments in monocultures. Such differences were amplified in mixtures, where N enrichment strongly increased C3 grass success at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and C4 grass success at elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Legumes declined with N enrichment in mixtures at both CO<sub>2</sub> levels and increased with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in the initial years of the experiment. Our results suggest that previous studies that considered responses to global changes in monocultures may underestimate biomass changes in diverse communities where interspecific interactions can amplify responses. Such effects of interspecific interactions on responses of FGs to global change may impact community composition over time and consequently influence ecosystem functions.</p>","author":"Neha Mohanbabu, \nForest Isbell, \nSarah E.
