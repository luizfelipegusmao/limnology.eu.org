{"title":"A comparative analysis of weekly internal and external workloads between starting and non-starting professional soccer players: A retrospective 21-week examination","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309475","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Philipp Kunz, Peter Düking, Billy Sperlich</p>\r\nObjectives <p>Aims of the present investigation encompassed: (i) the quantification of training and match loads experienced by starters and non-starters within a professional soccer team; (ii) the identification of variations in these loads across different training modalities, namely, Preparation Training (PT), Match and Match Compensation Training (M&amp;MCT), and their cumulative sum (Total Load; TL); and (iii) the formulation of guidelines aimed at harmonizing the weekly workloads between the groups.</p> Methods <p>Internal and external load of training sessions (n = 97), competitive matches (n = 21) and running based sessions (n = 4) were recorded for 21 weeks to investigate possible heterogeneity between starters and non-starters across PT, M&amp;MCT and TL.</p> Results <p>During PT, time spent in heart rate zone 5 (HRZ5) was increased for non-starters (+46.1%). During M&amp;MCT, lower loads for non-starters were found in the rate of perceived exertion (sRPE) (-45.6%), HRZ4 (-54%) and HRZ5 (-77.8%), total distance (TD) (-37%), number of sprints (-58.1%), distance in speed zone 1 (-51.1%), zone 3 (-61.5%) and zone 4 (-59.8%) (SZ1, SZ3&amp;4) and all acceleration and deceleration zones (Acc1-4; Dec1-4) (Acc1: -53.1%; Acc2: -56.3%; Acc3: -59.2%; Acc4: 57.8%) (Dec1: -45.9%; Dec2: -55.2%; Dec3: -63.2%; Dec4: -67.7%). Regarding TL, the non-starters’ loads remain lower compared to starters for sRPE (-19.2%), HRZ4 (-21.6%) and HRZ5 (-41.4%), number of sprints (-26.7%), SZ3 (-34.2%), Acc3 (-24.4%), Acc4 (-26.1%), Dec2 (-18.7%), Dec3 (-24%) and Dec4 (-31.2%).</p> Conclusions <p>By implementing a running-based regimen on matchday and MCT the day after (MD+1), TD, distances in SZ1, SZ2, SZ4, SZ5, and counts of accelerations in Acc1&amp;2, as well as Dec1, were effectively replicated for non-starters. All other variables remained unaligned for the non-starters. Given the prevalent emphasis on Small-Sided Games (SSGs) during MCT at MD+1, the incorporation of an additional running-based session for non-starters on MD is advised to address gaps in TD, sprint counts, and high-intensity load variables, such as HRZ4&amp;5 and SZ 3 to 5.</p>","author":"Philipp Kunz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2520e4208b44704785cdc55bf2b00c109b747161e1e3fc7b2e1fdb3f48ffeeb7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
