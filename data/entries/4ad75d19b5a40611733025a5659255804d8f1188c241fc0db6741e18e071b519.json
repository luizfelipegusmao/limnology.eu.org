{"title":"Why keep monitoring coral reefs?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/8/552/7727350?rss=1","date":1723161600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The high demand for information on how coral reefs are changing often exceeds the capacity of the scientific community to deliver the data necessary to meet this need. However, given the degraded state of coral reefs and the poor prognosis for their recovery, it is reasonable to ask whether coral reef monitoring should continue. Using my experiences from a 37-year study in the US Virgin Islands, I highlight the information that monitoring conveys on the changing state of coral reefs, and underscore how the interpretation of ecological trends matures with increasing longevity of records. Because the past is an imperfect predictor of the future, monitoring coral reefs remains an important endeavor. It offers the only opportunity to understand how reefs will continue to change, to connect patterns of change to the processes causing them to occur, and to create opportunities for management to best ensure their future.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"4ad75d19b5a40611733025a5659255804d8f1188c241fc0db6741e18e071b519","category":"Environment"}
