{"title":"Diet, feeding, and niche overlap of west coast steenbras (Lithognathus aureti) and silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus) in the northern Benguela","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15914?af=R","date":1724481231000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this study, we described and compared the diet, monthly feeding intensity, and condition of west coast steenbras (<i>Lithognathus aureti</i>) and silver kob (<i>Argyrosomus inodorus</i>) caught at a unique habitat in the northern Benguela. Stomach contents of 179 west coast steenbras and 114 silver kob caught from October 2020 to September 2022 were investigated. The peak in feeding intensity of west coast steenbras appeared to be opportunistic during winter and summer periods depending on food availability. The fish condition, however, peaked at the beginning (October) and at the end (April) of the austral summer spawning period, with the hepatosomatic index (HSI) at 1.5% and the condition factor (CF) at 0.022%. Seven prey taxa were found in the diet of west coast steenbras (bivalves, bony fishes, other mollusks, algae, crustaceans, cnidaria, and polychaetas) and six taxa in the diet of silver kob (bivalves, crustaceans, bony fishes, algae, starfish, and zooplankton), indicating generalist feeding behavior in both the species. The bivalves were the most important prey items in the diet of west coast steenbras (95.9% index of relative importance [IRI]). The most important prey items in the diet of silver kob were crustaceans (83.1% IRI) and bony fishes (16.0% IRI). Crustaceans were most important in the diet of small-to-medium-sized silver kob, whereas bony fishes were most important in the diet of larger silver kob (&gt;75 cm), with significant differences of IRI% by size class. Schoener's index of niche overlap indicated a relatively low overall niche overlap (0.11) between west coast steenbras and silver kob. This allows them to coexist as their feeding habits allow them to occupy unique niches in the coastal reef and sandy habitat and reduce competition for resources.</p>","author":"Arariky S.
