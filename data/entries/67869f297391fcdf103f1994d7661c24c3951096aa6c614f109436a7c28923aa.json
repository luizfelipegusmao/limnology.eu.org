Interplay between brassinosteroid signaling and the phosphate starvation response","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/6/2059/7628170?rss=1","date":1710288000000,"content":"<span>Phosphorus is an essential plant macronutrient. However, the abundance of inorganic phosphate (Pi), the phosphorus form most readily absorbed by plants, is often depleted in intensively farmed soil. While the application of Pi-based fertilizer can remedy this, this short-term solution has detrimental long-term environmental impacts. Researchers are therefore interested in enhancing the innate mechanisms plants possess to cope with Pi deficiency.
