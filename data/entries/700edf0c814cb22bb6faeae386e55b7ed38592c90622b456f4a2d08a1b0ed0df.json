The existing methods for obtaining SFCCs often involve either costly experiments or heuristic inference from water retention data. Here, we propose a pore-morphology-based method for simple and efficient estimation of the freezing characteristic curve of water-saturated porous media, whereby the pore-scale configurations of water and ice phases are simulated in a digital image of porous microstructure. Idealizing the pore space as a system of overlapping spherical pores, the method simulates the freezing process with the Gibbs-Thomson equation that can consider freezing-point depression—a decrease in the freezing point due to spatial confinement—based on thermodynamics. For validation, we apply the proposed method to estimate the SFCC of a field soil for which the experimental freezing characteristics data are available. Results show that even with a digital pore image extracted from a surrogate discrete-element packing of the soil, the proposed method provides an SFCC very close to the experimental data.</p>","author":"Hyoung Suk Suh, \nSeonHong Na, \nJinhyun Choo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"700edf0c814cb22bb6faeae386e55b7ed38592c90622b456f4a2d08a1b0ed0df","category":"Environment"}
