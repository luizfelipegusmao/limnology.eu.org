Postbiotics have emerged as a promising alternative as they can provide similar or even enhanced efficacy to probiotics, even under inactivated conditions. This review introduces the ingredients, preparation, and identification techniques of postbiotics, focusing on the comparison of the advantages and limitations between probiotics and postbiotics based on their mechanisms and applications. Inactivation treatment is the most significant difference between postbiotics and probiotics. We highlight the use of emerging technologies to inactivate probiotics, optimize process conditions to maintain the activity of postbiotics, or scale up their production. Postbiotics have high stability which can overcome unfavorable factors, such as easy inactivation and difficult colonization of probiotics after entering the intestine, and are rapidly activated, allowing continuous and rapid optimization of the intestinal microecological environment. They provide unique mechanisms, and multiple targets act on the gut–organ axis, co-providing new clues for the study of the biological functions of postbiotics. We summarize the mechanisms of action of inactivated lactic acid bacteria, highlighting that the NF-κB and MAPK pathways can be used as immune targeting pathways for postbiotic modulation of host health. Generally, we believe that as the classification, composition, and efficacy mechanism of postbiotics become clearer they will be more widely used in food, medicine, and other fields, greatly enriching the dimensions of food innovation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ruonan Yan, \nXiaoqun Zeng, \nJiamin Shen, \nZhen Wu, \nYuxing Guo, \nQiwei Du, \nMaolin Tu, \nDaodong Pan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"dbe66fcae397e0a42d7f9e6bb3c6faca7360ded3b2e9204ba5fb584e501a02e5","category":"Environment"}
