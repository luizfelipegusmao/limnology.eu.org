{"title":"Validating the Accuracy of a Patient-Facing Clinical Decision Support System in Predicting Lumbar Disc Herniation: Diagnostic Accuracy Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1412/v1","date":1721206774000,"content":"Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a major cause of disability globally, and the diagnosis of LBP is challenging for clinicians. Objective: This study aimed to assess the accuracy level of arti-ficial intelligence as a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) called Therapa compared to MRI in predicting lumbar disc herniated patients. Methods: One hundred low back pain patients aged ≥18 years old were included in the study. The study was conducted in 3 stages, at first, a case se-ries was conducted by matching MRI and Therapha diagnosis for 10 patients. Subsequently, Delphi methodology was employed to establish a clinical consensus. Lastly, to determine the ac-curacy of the newly developed software, a cross-sectional study was undertaken, involving 100 patients. Results: The software showed a significant diagnostic accuracy with the area under the curve in the ROC analysis determined as 0.84 with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 80%. Conclusion: The study’s findings revealed that CDSS using Therapha has a reasonable level of ef-ficacy, and this can be utilized clinically to acquire faster and more accurate screening of patients with lumbar disc herniation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8dfd48500acf05d6dfbb6608f18ee143350d371977dc060c6ae374807a98a89a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
