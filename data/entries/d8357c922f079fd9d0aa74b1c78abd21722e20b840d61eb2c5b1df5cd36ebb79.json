{"title":"Quantifying Carbon Sequestration of Forest Ecosystem Using GIS and Remote Sensing; the Case of Yeraba State Forest East Gojjam Zone Amhara Regional State","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0571/v1","date":1720420342000,"content":"By sinking and storing carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis, forests play a significant role in combating climate change. Global warming is currently the most pressing global issue. Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, covering 30% of the world's terrestrial land area and conserving 81% of the earth's terrestrial carbon biomass. The aim of the study was to quantify and map the Carbon Sink and Stock Values of the Yeraba state forest ecosystem. Primary and secondary data sources were used in this study. Primary data such as plot length and width, DBH (diameter at breast height), soil data, and ground control point (GCP) were obtained in the field using a Garmin 72 GPS, a clinometer, and a diameter tape. Diameter tape, caliper and Soil ogre materials. Beside from this sentimental 2 satellite image, there was also another important primary data. In addition to the primary data source, secondary data sources were used. It includes published books, journals and studies, reports, website sources, and other materials that are publicly available. The systematic sampling technique for identifying each intersection point in the area at regular intervals was the most appropriate sampling design for this study. The study used data from four forest carbon pools, including AGB, BGB, soil, and litter, to calculate the carbon sink and stock values of the Yeraba state forest ecosystem. A total of 17 quadrats, each measuring 20m x 20m and spaced 428 m apart, were used to collect vegetation data. For litter and soil sample collection, five 1 m x 1 m sub-quadrats were established at each quadrat's four corners and center. This data was correlated with five Sentinel 2A level 1c imagery data derived vegetation indices of 2023 to obtain a model and estimate of AGB and AGC at the study site. The total mean carbon stock density of Yeraba state Forest was 404.895 t/ha, with 223.656t/ha, 58.15t/ha, 3.41t/ha, and 119.679 t/ha in the above ground carbon, below ground carbon, litter carbon, and soil carbon pools, respectively. The three environmental factors that influence the distribution of different carbon pools in the forest are altitudinal gradient, slope, and aspect. Standing from the result and inputs the researcher recommended that, Future research may find that using LiDAR and Radar imageries, which can address the saturation and canopy penetration issues, will increase the accuracy of carbon stock estimation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8357c922f079fd9d0aa74b1c78abd21722e20b840d61eb2c5b1df5cd36ebb79","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
