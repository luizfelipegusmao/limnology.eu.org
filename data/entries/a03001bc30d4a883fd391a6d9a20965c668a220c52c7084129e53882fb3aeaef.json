{"title":"Magnetic Ion Modulation (MIM) Theory: A Novel Approach to Controlling Ion Behavior via Magnetic Fields in Biological and Non-Biological Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1786/v1","date":1727146016000,"content":"e Magnetic Ion Modulation (MIM) Theory presents a unified and groundbreaking mathematical framework for controlling and predicting ion behavior in both biological and non-biological systems using external magnetic fields. Central to the theory is the **Ion Modulation Constant** (Tn), a context-specific scaling factor that quantifies the number of ions modulated under specific conditions. This constant, although not universal, allows for accurate modeling of ion modulation in systems ranging from neuronal ion channels to plasma physics and quantum computing. The MIM equation incorporates ion properties such as magnetic moment and permeability, providing insights into neuromodulation for treating chronic pain and epilepsy, plasma confinement in fusion research, and stabilization of ion qubits in quantum computing. This paper includes detailed derivations of the Ion Modulation Constant, examples of its application to specific ions, and a comprehensive exploration of potential experimental validations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a03001bc30d4a883fd391a6d9a20965c668a220c52c7084129e53882fb3aeaef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
