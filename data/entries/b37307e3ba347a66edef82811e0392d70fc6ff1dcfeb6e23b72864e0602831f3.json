{"title":"Consequences of Immunoglobulin Domain-Containing Protein Retro-Proteins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1001/v1","date":1718371634000,"content":"Amino acid sequences of native proteins are generally not palindromic. The protein molecule obtained as a result of reading the amino acid sequence backwards, i.e., a retro-protein, having the same amino acid composition and the same hydrophobicity profile as the native sequence may behave as a different molecule. Here we have used R4, a directed evolution product of Scfv-13, a protein that binds Î²-galactosidase, and report the properties of the retro-R4 (rR4). rR4 remains a binding protein and its new target is Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (GLMS), a native E. coli protein. Additionally, a tight junction immunoglobulin domain- containing membrane protein, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAMA) retro-protein retains the ability to drive cell-cell interactions. Thus, protein engineering suggests a new potential application to retro-proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b37307e3ba347a66edef82811e0392d70fc6ff1dcfeb6e23b72864e0602831f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
