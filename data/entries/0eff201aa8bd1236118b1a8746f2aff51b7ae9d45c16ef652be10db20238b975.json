{"title":"α-Pyrrolidinohexanophenone (α-PHP) vs. α-pyrrolidinoisohexanophenone (α-PiHP): A toxicological investigation about plasma concentrations and behavior in forensic routine cases","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/48/5/299/7630422?rss=1","date":1708992000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>New psychoactive substances (NPS), like pyrrolidinophenones, are still very present on the illegal drug market. The presented study reports on two members of this substance group, α-pyrrolidinohexanophenone (α-PHP) and α-pyrrolidinoisohexanophenone (α-PiHP), which occurred in forensic routine cases in the last 6 years. α-PHP could be detected predominantly by a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS) method in 33 authentic human plasma samples and α-PiHP in 8. α-PHP concentrations ranged from ca. 0.75 to 128 µg/L (mean: 23.2, median: 16.3) and α-PiHP concentrations from 7.33 to 118 µg/L (mean: 44.7, median: 33.7, quantified via α-PHP). Individuals were predominantly male and middle aged. As different studies have shown, some pyrrolidinophenones are able to cause aggressive behavior. Therefore, we set out to investigate the relation of α-PHP and α-PiHP plasma concentrations and the behavior of the consumers, reported by police and medical experts. Part of the subjects showed aggressive behavior, including agitation and restlessness. Lethargic and unremarkable behavior might be explained by co-consumption of other drugs, such as opiates/opioids, benzodiazepines, pregabalin or alcohol as well as by drug tolerance and subacute effects of stimulants. Multi-drug use could be detected in all cases; also stimulating substances and multiple different pyrrolidinophenones were determined. Nevertheless, users of α-PHP and α-PiHP showed a tendency to act aggressively, possibly triggered by a high selectivity for dopamine transporter inhibition. In accordance, committed offenses were often violent crimes. This might be considered in terms of toxicological assessment of criminal responsibility and driving ability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology Current Issue","siteHash":"684cff8c881f5537e121ec409f4017c5ba6630e2a004f9595c9e918ac4254c23","entryHash":"0eff201aa8bd1236118b1a8746f2aff51b7ae9d45c16ef652be10db20238b975","category":"Environment"}
