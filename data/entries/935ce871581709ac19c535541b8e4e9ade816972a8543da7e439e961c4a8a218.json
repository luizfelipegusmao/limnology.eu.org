{"title":"Barriers and enablers that influence the uptake of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311114","date":1728482400000,"content":"<p>by Veronica Martinez Martinez, Hermen Ormel, Eline L. M. Op de Coul</p>\r\nBackground <p>Heterosexual migrant men and women in the Netherlands often face barriers to accessing health services, including HIV testing, that may lead to late-stage HIV diagnoses. This study explored factors of influence in the usage of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants.</p> Methods <p>Qualitative evaluation with semi-structured interviews at the Amsterdam-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Checkpoint and one focus group discussion (FGD) conducted during June-July 2023 with 19 participants: interviews with 12 heterosexual migrants from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) and FGD (n = 5) and interviews (n = 2) with 7 key informants from the (public) health sector. Recorded interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed, using the framework of Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model of Health Services Use.</p> Results <p>In total, 55 themes emerged from the interviews and the FGD. Examples include insufficient availability of information on HIV and testing services, and difficulty in accessing these services (e.g. the barrier of the online appointment system of the Centre for Sexual Health (CSH)). HIV test participants expressed free, rapid testing, no appointment required, and a positive experience during their HIV test as enablers to test in the future. Results from key informants showed that poor health literacy and lack of clarity on the healthcare system’s guidelines were barriers for heterosexual migrants in accessing information on HIV and testing services. It also revealed past initiatives and interventions that were successful in reaching at-risk groups such as the integration of HIV testing into sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, but that were subsequently discontinued due to financial constraints.</p> Conclusion <p>Factors contributing to a low HIV test uptake were participants’ perception of limited accessibility of CSH facilities, insufficient available information on HIV (testing) services, and low perception of HIV risk. Unclear policies on accessing HIV/STI testing services at CSHs, and potential missed opportunities for HIV testing at general practitioners were contributing factors identified by key informants.</p>","author":"Veronica Martinez Martinez","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"935ce871581709ac19c535541b8e4e9ade816972a8543da7e439e961c4a8a218","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
