Mesoporous materials are those with a range of pores between 2 and 50 nm. Mesoporous materials find applications in catalysis and molecular sieves [<a href=\"#ozae044.644-B1\">1</a>]. The synthesis of mesoporous materials began in 1992 with the creation of mesoporous silica by scientists at Mobil Company [<a href=\"#ozae044.644-B2\">2</a>]. Praseodymium oxide with mesoporosity was prepared using a procedure similar to that described in our previous research on cerium oxide [<a href=\"#ozae044.644-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.644-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bb35ba47e7897f3ef3af0852910cb3eb3c69be68f32db3cd9d187d3ae55f4519","category":"Environment"}
