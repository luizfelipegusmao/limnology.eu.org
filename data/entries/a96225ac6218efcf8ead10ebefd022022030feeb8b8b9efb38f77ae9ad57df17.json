Cesium lead halide nanocrystals are well known for their fluorescence in the visible region with extremely high internal quantum efficiencies; thus making them highly suitable for the fabrication of efficient light-emitting diodes, transistors and photodetectors. Although perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are more fluorescent compared to their bulk counterpart, there have been very few reports on the synthesis and characterization of CsPbX<sub>3</sub> perovskite NCs. In this work, we have synthesized and investigated the CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> and CsPbBr<sub>2</sub>I NCs to understand the fundamental optoelectronic properties and structural integrity in mixed halide perovskite NCs. We have estimated ~10 nm average particle size of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) while CsPbBr<sub>2</sub>I has ~16 nm average particle size with slightly higher polydispersity. Most interestingly, we do not observe any phase segregation of bromide and iodide ions in mixed halide perovskite quantum dots due to finite size effect. This is also confirmed by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping data. However, CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals are relatively more stable than the mixed halide perovskite nanocrystals due to fewer defects. Anomalous behavior is observed in the photoluminescence intensity with the variation of precursor concentration indicating a complex nature nanoparticle synthesis.</p>","author":"Atif Suhail, \nGunadeep Teron, \nAnkur Yadav, \nMonojit Bag","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"a96225ac6218efcf8ead10ebefd022022030feeb8b8b9efb38f77ae9ad57df17","category":"Environment"}
