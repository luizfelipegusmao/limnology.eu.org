{"title":"Exploring the Structure of the Chiral, One-Dimensional Semiconductor InSeI Via High-Resolution Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.751/7719716?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>InSeI is a one-dimensional semiconductor that consists of an InSe backbone with iodide ions attached in a spiral. Each individual InSeI “chain” has a handedness due to the chirality of the iodine spiral. While synthesis of this material was first reported in 1980 by Swaitzki et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.751-B1\">1</a>], very few studies were performed on InSeI in the years following, with most being computation-based. Very recently, experimental studies on InSeI were completed by Choi et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.751-B2\">2</a>] and Cordova et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.751-B3\">3</a>]. However, atomic-resolution structure images in this system have yet to be realized, as this was not the purpose of any of the previously mentioned studies. In this work, we studied the structure of InSeI nanoribbons through high-resolution electron microscopy, specifically aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM). These measurements were collected in an FEI Titan 80/30 ETEM operated at 300kV using a BM OneView camera.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a0b17f6dd5987c0c8c3fef69ed57fb9c7a68e688d90c1fae946681cdaa7757d1","category":"Environment"}
