{"title":"Digital Genome and Self-Regulating Distributed Software Applications with Associative Memory and Event-Driven History","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1622/v1","date":1719211456000,"content":"Biological systems have a unique ability inherited through their genome. It allows them to build, operate, and manage a society of cells with complex organizational structures where autonomous components execute specific tasks and collaborate in groups to fulfill systemic goals with shared knowledge. The system receives information from various senses, makes sense of what is being observed, and acts using its experience, while the observations are still in progress. We use the General Theory of Information (GTI) to implement a digital genome, specifying the operational processes that design, deploy, operate, and manage a cloud-agnostic distributed application that is independent of IaaS and PaaS infrastructure, which provides the resources required to execute the software components. The digital genome specifies the functional and non-functional requirements that define the goals and best-practice policies to evolve the system using associative memory and event-driven interaction history to maintain stability and safety while achieving the systemâ€™s objectives. We demonstrate a structural machine, cognizing oracles, and knowledge structures derived from GTI used for designing, deploying, operating, and managing a distributed video streaming application with autopoietic self-regulation that maintains structural stability and communication among distributed components with shared knowledge while maintaining expected behaviors dictated by functional requirements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f92f83ae66b362d6051fe9d7515b480f50b82a69de5abaefbfaf7c32d99a3b18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
