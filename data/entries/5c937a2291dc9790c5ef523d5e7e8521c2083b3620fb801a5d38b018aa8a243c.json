As conveyed in the Commission’s report by \nthe FTC’s own staff, Khan seems to be engaged in an activist \ncrusade moored to a very specific ideological worldview — “Big is \nde facto Bad” — that has resulted in a series of defeats. </p>\n\n<p>The excesses of Big Tech should be constrained. But that has yet \nto be achieved with the cases brought by the FTC, many of which, \nto my mind, are predicated on a confused understanding of the way \nthat consumers engage with and benefit from technology. I think \nthis is especially true concerning the economics of digital \nadvertising and the freemium economy more broadly. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless I’m missing something, under Khan’s leadership the FTC has accomplished nothing. It’s all for show. She ought to be one of the first appointees to be replaced if Biden wins another term. (Merrick Garland first, though.
