{"title":"Low Vitamin D Concentration is Associated with Increased Depression Risk in Adults 20-44 Years-Old, an NHANES 2007-2018 Data Analysis with a Focus on Perinatal and Breastfeeding Status","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0679/v1","date":1715364178000,"content":"The objective was to investigate associations of serum vitamin D concentration with depressive symptoms and assess the impact vitamin D concentration has on the occurrence of depressive symptoms in 20â€“44-year-old pregnant mothers, postpartum mothers, women (non-pregnant/postpartum women), and men, including a separate subgroup analysis of postpartum breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mothers. The study populations were selected from 2007-2018 NHANES public data. Subjective interview data and objective laboratory data, including depressive symptoms, serum vitamin D concentration, nutrient intake, and demographic information were utilized. Two diet patterns were created using principal component analysis and a Bayesian multinomial model was fit to predict depression outcomes for each subpopulation. The estimates for the log vitamin D slope parameter were negative for all cohorts; as vitamin D increased, the probability of having no depression increased, while the probability of depression decreased. The pregnant cohort had the steepest vitamin D slope, followed by postpartum, then other women and men. Higher vitamin D concentration had more impact on decreasing depression risk in pregnant and postpartum mothers compared to other women and men. Among postpartum mothers, higher vitamin D concentration had a greater influence on decreasing breastfeeding mothers' depression risk than non-breastfeeding mothers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e3d3212567f1b50c94cfe4c2f6e6b353cb6ab807b7598cadf7c0370daad6328","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
