{"title":"A Coordination Approach to Support Crowdsourced Software Design Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1694/v1","date":1729758263000,"content":"Crowdsourcing software design (CSD) is the completion of specific software design tasks on behalf of a client by a large, unspecified group of external individuals who have the specialized knowledge required by an open call. Although current CSD platforms have provided features to improve coordination in the CSD process (such as email notifications, chat, and announcements), these features are insufficient to solve the coordination limitations. A lack of appropriate coordination support in CSD activities may cause delays and missed opportunities for participants, and thus the best quality of design contest results may not be guaranteed. This research aims to support the effective management of the CSD process through identifying the key activity dependencies among participants in CSD platforms and designing a set of process models to provide coordination support through managing this activity. In order to do this, a five-stage approach is used: First, the current CSD process is investigated by reviewing 14 CSD platforms. Second, the review resulted in the identification of 17 possible suggestions to improve CSD. These suggestions were evaluated in stage 3 through distributing a survey to 41 participants who have experience of using platforms in the field of CSD. In stage 4, we designed ten process models that can meet the requirements of suggestions, while in stage 5, we evaluated these process models through interviews with domain experts. The result shows that coordination support in the activities of the CSD can add valuable contribution to the development of CSD platforms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4097a49648ad4285bc80a4b40c87ec2ac66adaa195cdfbb876ffb8fdb49fe56d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
