{"title":"Toward Probing Molecular Radiolysis Behavior in Gas Cell Electron Microscopy","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.839/7719925?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The radiolytic decomposition of materials is inevitable in electron microscopy, alongside knock-on effects, electrical charging, and heating damage. Especially with the radiation-susceptible chemistry in the fluidic phase (liquid and gas), consideration of mitigating or leveraging these phenomena is particularly important. Early studies on aqueous phase electron microscopy provides mathematical models of homogeneous and non-homogeneous radiolysis under various conditions [<a href=\"#ozae044.839-B1\">1</a>], demonstrating the evolution of gas, pH changes, and switching of oxidative/reductive conditions can occur during liquid-cell TEM experiments. On the other hand, radiolysis in gas phase TEM (GP-TEM) experiments, particularly in open-cell environmental TEM, is usually ignored due to the low reachable gas pressure. The much smaller initial radiolytic yield from lower atomic concentration and higher diffusivity prevent the accumulation of generated species in low-pressure gas conditions, thus not intervening the solid-gas interactions significantly. However, the recently emerged closed-cell gas phase TEM can create near- to full-atmospheric pressure gas within the nanosized reactor. Therefore, the effect of radiolysis in this experimental setup needs to be well understood (Fig. 1).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b8c2f3bed49ed48467eb23fdab4d9f95e4eaae91bef34811e0ad06392750c582","category":"Environment"}
