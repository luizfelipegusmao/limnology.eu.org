{"title":"Exploring the Role of Transition Metal Complexes in Artistic Coloration through a Bottom-Up Scientific Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1729/v1","date":1711601687000,"content":"Transition metal complexes have historically played a pivotal role in creating vibrant pigments utilized across artistic mediums such as ceramics, paintings, and glass mosaics. Despite their extensive historical use, our understanding of the mechanisms governing transition metal complex behavior has predominantly emerged in recent times, leaving numerous aspects of this process ripe for exploration. These complexes exhibit striking color variations under diverse conditions when employed in pigment formulations. This review utilizes a bottom-up scientific approach, spanning from microscopic to macroscopic scales, to unravel the molecular origins of the colors generated by transition metal complexes in pigments and ceramic glazes. Advanced spectroscopy techniques and computational chemistry play pivotal roles in this endeavor, highlighting the significance of understanding and utilizing analytical data effectively, with careful consideration of each technique's specific application. Furthermore, the review investigates the influence of processing conditions on color variations, providing valuable insights for artists and manufacturers aiming to enhance the precision and quality of their creations while mitigating environmental impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"107eea09f1eba75a54a754995429a8c414312cd0fc79288c1e4c14c3a3585842","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
