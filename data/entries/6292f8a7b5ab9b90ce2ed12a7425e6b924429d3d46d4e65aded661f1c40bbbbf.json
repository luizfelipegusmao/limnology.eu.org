{"title":"Exploration of alive-and-ventilator free days as an outcome measure for clinical trials of Resuscitative interventions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308033","date":1722434400000,"content":"<p>by Ari Moskowitz, Xianhong Xie, Michelle Ng Gong, Henry E. Wang, Luke Andrea, Yungtai Lo, Mimi Kim, for the Hospital Airway Resuscitation Trial Investigators </p>\r\nBackground <p>Outcome selection is a critically important aspect of clinical trial design. Alive-and-ventilator free days is an outcome measure commonly used in critical care clinical trials, but has not been fully explored in resuscitation science.</p> Methods <p>A simulation study was performed to explore approaches to the definition and analysis of alive-and-ventilator free days in cardiac arrest populations. Data from an in-hospital cardiac arrest observational cohort and from the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial were used to inform and conduct the simulations and validate approaches to alive-and-ventilator free days measurement and analysis.</p> Findings <p>Alive-and-ventilator-free days is a flexible outcome measure in cardiac arrest populations. An approach to alive-and-ventilator free days that assigns -1 days when return of spontaneous circulation is not achieved provides a wider distribution of the outcome and improves statistical power. The optimal approach to the analysis of alive-and-ventilator free days varies based on the expected impact of the intervention under study on rates of return of spontaneous circulation, survival, and ventilator-free survival.</p> Conclusions <p>Alive-and-ventilator free days adds to the armamentarium of clinical trialists in the field of resuscitation science.</p>","author":"Ari Moskowitz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6292f8a7b5ab9b90ce2ed12a7425e6b924429d3d46d4e65aded661f1c40bbbbf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
