{"title":"Olive reproductive biology: implications for yield, compatibility conundrum, and environmental constraints","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4300/7657973?rss=1","date":1714003200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Olive (<span>Olea europaea</span> L.) is an important Mediterranean tree species with a longstanding history of cultivation, boasting a diverse array of local cultivars. While traditional olive orchards are valued for their cultural and aesthetic significance, they often face economic sustainability challenges in the modern context. The success of both traditional and newly introduced cultivars (e.g. those obtained by cross-breeding) is hindered by self-incompatibility, a prevalent issue for this species that results in low fruit set when limited genetic diversity is present. Further, biological, environmental, and agronomic factors have been shown to interlink in shaping fertilization patterns, hence impacting on the final yield. Climatic conditions during pollination, such as excessive rainfall or high temperatures, can further exacerbate the problem. In this work, we provide an overview of the various factors that trigger the phenomenon of suboptimal fruit set in olive trees. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay among these factors, shedding light on potential mechanisms and pathways that contribute to the observed outcomes in the context of self-incompatibility in olive.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"d9349a081a895fe5bad714f3b5bfb0320416b9d1f50139eca4322dc40c1db881","category":"Environment"}
