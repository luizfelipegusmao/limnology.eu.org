{"title":"Waste Management and Technological Advancement: Insights from Europe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0645/v1","date":1723181544000,"content":"The paper analyzes the relationship between urban waste recycling and technological innovation systems in Europe. Data from the Global Innovation Index for 34 European countries in the period 2013-2022 was used. To analyze the characteristics of European countries in terms of waste recy-cling capacity, the k-Means algorithm optimized with the Elbow method and the Silhouette Coef-ficient was used. The results show that the optimal number of clusters is 3. Panel data results show that waste recycling increases with domestic market scale, gross capital formation, and the diffu-sion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), while it decreases with the infra-structure index, business sophistication index, and the average expenditure in research and devel-opment of large companies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f4183aa8e200c580cf834a22580605589c879c1863799f113f628d4ff22ce88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
