{"title":"The Effects of Competition on Exercise Intensity and the User Experience of Exercise, during Virtual Reality Bicycling for Young Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1020/v1","date":1726284547000,"content":"Background: Regular moderate-vigorous intensity exercise is recommended for adults as it can improve longevity and reduce health risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, there are barriers to achieving intense exercise that may be addressed using virtual reality (VR) as a tool to promote exercise intensity and adherence, particularly through visual feedback and competition. The purpose of this work is to compare visual feedback and competition within fully-immersive VR to enhance exercise intensity and user experience of exercise for young adults; and to describe and compare visual attention during each of the conditions. Methods: Young adults (21- 34 years old) bicycled in three 5-minute VR conditions (visual feedback, self-competition and competition against others). Exercise intensity (cycling cadence and % of maximum heart rate) and visual attention (derived from a wearable eye tracking sensor) were measured continuously. User experience was measured by an intrinsic motivation questionnaire, perceived effort and participant preference. A repeated measures ANOVA with paired t-test post-hoc tests was conducted to detect differences between conditions. Results: Participants exercised at a higher intensity and had higher intrinsic motivation in the two competitive conditions compared to visual feedback. Further, participants preferred the competitive conditions and only reached a vigorous exercise intensity during self-competition. Visual exploration was higher in visual feedback compared to self-competition. Conclusion: For young adults bicycling in VR, competition promoted higher exercise intensity and motivation compared to visual feedback.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99bc28a4cd6399df92154dc0ea3886fd6f7e1c33b85a1bd5a085b4c62d6910d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
