{"title":"Physicochemical Quality and Application Potential of Pereskia spp. Flours in Pasta Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0121/v1","date":1725293067000,"content":"This study investigates the use of flours derived from the leaves of Pereskia aculeata and Pereskia grandifolia, commonly known as ora-pro-nóbis, in pasta products. The motivation stems from the search for nutritious and affordable dietary alternatives that promote food security. The objective is to produce flours from the leaves of these species through convection drying and to assess their physicochemical quality and potential application in spaghetti-type pasta. The leaves were dehydrated and processed into flour, which was then incorporated into pasta formulations in varying concentrations from 1% to 7%. The resulting samples underwent physicochemical, antioxidant, toxicity, and mineral composition analyses. Significant differences were observed between the flours of P. aculeata and P. grandifolia in terms of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and bioactive compound content. P. grandifolia was noted for its higher protein and mineral content, while P. aculeata exhibited superior antioxidant activity. The pasta enriched with these flours demonstrated improvements in nutrient content and changes in colorimetric properties. The study concludes that ora-pro-nóbis flours possess high nutritional value and are viable for application in pasta products, contributing to a healthier and more diversified diet without compromising the sensory characteristics of the products.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3af9cabe3378d554ff80cb2c18da25088bd6b2553c3882d5c3c6b7e83bd34b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
