{"title":"Evaluation of Short-Term Stability of Different Nitazenes in Dried Blood Spots by Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1902/v1","date":1729762230000,"content":"Nitazenes represent a New Synthetic Opioids sub-class, belonging to the New Psychoactive Substances (NPS). Their high pharmacological potency has led to numerous intoxications and fatalities, even at minimum doses. The aim of this study was to assess the stability of four nitazenes (etazene, flunitazene, isotonitazene and protonitazene) in dried blood spot (DBS) samples at different storage temperatures (room temperature and 4°C), using a newly developed and validated liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry method. Two concentrations, 1 and 5 ng/mL were chosen based on the available data on nitazene-related intoxications and stability was evaluated at day 0 (control), 1, 7 and 30. Results showed that all analytes at 1 ng/mL were not detectable after 30 days at room temperature; a similar pattern was observed for 1 ng/mL etazene and isotonitazene samples when stored at 4°C, whereas flunitazene and protonitazene decreased to a mean of 66% and 69% initial concentration, respectively, at day 30. Differently, all analytes at 5 ng/mL were quantified above 44% and 41% initial concentration at room temperature and 4°C, respectively, showing a higher stability. The study of nitazenes stability in DBS represents an important tool to determine the optimal samples storage conditions, such as temperature and time between sample collection and analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1aa8b127915e97a5b842eb1223e67bd8bdcb9925a6d727c947fac34cd5c78169","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
