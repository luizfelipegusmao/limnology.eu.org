{"title":"Evaluation of the Presence, Frequency, and Distribution Range of Vegetal Invasive Alien Species in an Urban Area of Southern Spain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2387/v1","date":1727682192000,"content":"Invasive species represent an important agent of change and threat to native biological diversity due to their high ability to enter and establish themselves in natural or semi-natural ecosystems. Urban and peri-urban areas are an easy entrance door for invasive vegetal species firstly used as ornamental that can become naturalized. In this study, it was analysed the presence, frequency and distribution of invasive alien plant species in the urban, peri-urban and natural area surrounding the city of CÃ³rdoba, Southern Spain. Our research reveals the presence of 17 invasive plant species from 10 different families. It supposes the 35% of the invasive plant species detected in the Andalusia region, and 27% of Spain. The highest number was located in ruderal areas, following by abandoned crop fields, being phanerophytes the most abundant life-form. Regarding the native source area, the highest percentage come from the America continent. Data indicates that the use of non-native species as ornamental can enhance invader establishment, spread, and ecological impact, which can facilitate subsequent alien species success aided by global change conditions. Additionally, our results are a strong knowledge base for effective management strategies in the area and will help to addressing data gaps related to the distribution of alien species on a regional scale in the Mediterranean area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b32e814b1889790173f81a1da1a02eb8cc0412f99f0a6f447172803eb9d2bd2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
