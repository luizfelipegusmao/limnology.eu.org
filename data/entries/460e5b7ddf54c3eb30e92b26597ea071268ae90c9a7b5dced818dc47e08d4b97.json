{"title":"Combined effects of border irrigation and super-absorbent polymers on enzyme activity and microbial diversity of poplar rhizosphere soil","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303096","date":1715090400000,"content":"<p>by Fangchun Liu, Ruonan Zhuang, Yanhui Qiao, Dawei Jing, Yufeng Dong</p>\r\n\r\nFast-growing poplar plantations are considered a great benefit to timber production, but water availability is a key factor limiting their growth and development, especially in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Super-absorbent polymers facilitate more water retention in soil after rain or irrigation, and they are able to release water gradually during plant growth. This study aimed to examine the effects of reduced irrigation (60% and 30% of conventional border irrigation) co-applied with super-absorbent polymers (0, 40 kg/ha) on root exudates, enzyme activities, microbial functional diversity in rhizosphere soil, and volume increments in poplar (<i>Populus euramericana</i> cv. ‘Neva’). The results showed that 60% border irrigation co-applied with super-absorbent polymers significantly increased the content of organic acids, amino acids and total sugars in the root exudates, and the activities of invertase, urease, dehydrogenase, and catalase in the rhizosphere soil in comparison to conventional border irrigation without super-absorbent polymers. Meanwhile, this treatment also enhanced the average well-color development, Shannon index, and McIntosh index, but decreased the Simpson index. Additionally, the average volume growth rate and relative water content of leaves reached their maximum using 60% irrigation with super-absorbent polymers, which was significantly higher than other treatments. However, using 30% irrigation with super-absorbent polymers, had a smaller effect on rhizosphere soil and volume growth than 60% irrigation with super-absorbent polymers. Therefore, using an appropriate water-saving irrigation measure (60% conventional border irrigation with super-absorbent polymers) can help to improve enzyme activities and microbial diversity in the rhizosphere soil while promoting the growth of poplar trees.","author":"Fangchun Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"460e5b7ddf54c3eb30e92b26597ea071268ae90c9a7b5dced818dc47e08d4b97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
