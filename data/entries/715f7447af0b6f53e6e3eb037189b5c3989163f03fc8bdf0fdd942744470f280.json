The XRD, UV-Vis, SEM-EDX and TEM analyses were performed to ensure the formation of AgNP@ZnO architecture. TEM analysis confirmed that the 4-20 nm sized Ag nanoparticles were anchored evenly on the surface of ZnO with 16-78 nm in size. The antimicrobial study showed the superior performance of AgNP@ZnO functional nanoparticles than the pristine ZnO against pathogenic bacteria <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (gram-positive) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (gram-negative). Hence, AgNP@ZnO functional particles were effectively explored as antimicrobial reinforcement for fabricating composite films using polylactic acid (PLA) as a matrix. The obtained nanocomposite films showed excellent antibacterial activity, which increases with increasing AgNP@ZnO loading.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
