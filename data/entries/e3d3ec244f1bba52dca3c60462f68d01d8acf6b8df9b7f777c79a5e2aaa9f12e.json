{"title":"Linkages between environmental sustainability, disaggregated emission, renewable energy, and energy efficiency: An evidence from BRI countries","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305188","date":1724248800000,"content":"<p>by Fei Meng, Weiyan Sheng, Muhammad Waqas Akbar</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper examines the long-term and short-run causative relationship among environmental sustainability, energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon emissions from all over sources (coal, oil and fossil fuels) and sector wise division (heat and power, transportation, residential, manufacturing and other sectors. The empirical evidence presented in this study is derived from a balanced panel dataset spanning the annual periods from 2000 to 2021. The dataset specifically focuses on a selection of BRI Countries. The Kao test demonstrates the presence of cointegration across variables such as carbon dioxide emissions, environmental suitability, energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Panel Pooled Mean Group-Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PMG-ARDL) model indicates a statistically significant positive association between the environmental sustainability and disaggregated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over a long-term period. The study found a positive relationship between disaggregated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and environmental sustainability and energy efficiency, with renewable energy sources reducing emissions. It suggests a need for a structural transition from an energy-intensive economy to a decarbonized one, with sectors like heat and power positively impacting sustainability. Implementing measures to reduce emissions is crucial for tackling climate change.","author":"Fei Meng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e3d3ec244f1bba52dca3c60462f68d01d8acf6b8df9b7f777c79a5e2aaa9f12e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
