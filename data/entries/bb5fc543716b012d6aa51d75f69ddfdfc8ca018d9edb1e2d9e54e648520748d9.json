{"title":"Groundwater Fluoride Contamination and Human Health Risk Assessment in North Main Ethiopia Rift Valley","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1673/v2","date":1719395464000,"content":": Fluoride toxicity has become a global public health concern, and its significant source of exposure is drinking water. This study aimed to determine groundwater fluoride level and assess its related human health risks. Its level was measured from groundwater samples using an ion-selective electrode. The total hazard index was assessed based on the chronic daily oral intake and dermal absorbed dose of groundwater fluoride. Analyses were conducted using ArcGIS and SPSS. This study reported groundwater fluoride ranged from 0.3 mg/L to 38 mg/L, with a mean annual level of 15 mg/L. Groundwater fluoride level above 5 mg/L was reported in 60 % of the water samples. Total hazard index values among sampled locations varied from 0.18 to 22.56. Half (51.5 %) of infants, 85.5 % of children, 82.5 % of adolescents, and 67.5 % of adults had a risk of developing a non-carcinogenic health effect. This study demonstrated that the fluoride level of the groundwater sources was high, and the water was not suitable for drinking, a result that is of special importance for children and adults since they are a hypersensitive subgroup of the population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb5fc543716b012d6aa51d75f69ddfdfc8ca018d9edb1e2d9e54e648520748d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
