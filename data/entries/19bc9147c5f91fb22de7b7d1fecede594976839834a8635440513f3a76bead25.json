{"title":"Pilot study assessing gut microbial diversity among sexual and gender minority young adults","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306638","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Ashley Guy, Shannon McAuliffe, Robbie Cross, Yue Zhang, Richard E.

However, the biological mechanisms driving minority-related stress impacts remain unknown, including the role of the gut microbiome. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between SGM status and gut microbiome health among young adults attending a 4-year university. To this end, a prospective pilot study was completed in the fall and spring semesters of 2021â€“22. Self-identified SGMs (N = 22) and cisgender-heterosexuals (CIS-HET, N = 43) completed in-person interviews to provide mental health data and demographic information. Nail and saliva samples were collected at the time of interview to quantify chronic and acute cortisol. Stool samples were collected within 48 hours of interview for microbiome analysis. Assessment of the gut microbiota identified a significant reduction in alpha diversity among the SGM group, even when adjusting for mental health outcome. SGM group showed trends for higher abundance of microbes in phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and lower abundance of microbes in phyla <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Proteobacteria</i> compared to the CIS-HET group. These findings support that the gut microbiome could be contributing to negative health effects among the SGM community.","author":"Ashley Guy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"19bc9147c5f91fb22de7b7d1fecede594976839834a8635440513f3a76bead25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
