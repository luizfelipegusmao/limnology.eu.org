{"title":"Electrical Impedance Tomography: A Narrative Review on Technology Principles and Its Current and Future Fields of Application","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2040/v1","date":1717059201000,"content":"Background: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), combined with variable ventilation strate-gies and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is poised to revolutionize critical care by transitioning from reactive to predictive approaches. This integration aims to enhance patient outcomes through personalized interventions and real-time monitoring. Methods: This narrative review explores the principles and applications of EIT, variable ventilation, and AI in critical care. EITâ€™s impedance sensing creates dynamic images of internal physiology, aiding in the management of conditions like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Variable ventilation mimics natural breathing variability to improve lung function and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. AI enhances EIT through advanced image reconstruction techniques, neural networks, and digital twin technology, offering more accurate diagnostics and tailored therapeutic interventions. Conclu-sions: The confluence of EIT, variable ventilation, and AI represents a significant advancement in critical care, enabling a predictive, personalized approach. EIT provides real-time insights into lung function, guiding precise ventilation adjustments and therapeutic interventions. AI inte-gration enhances EIT's diagnostic capabilities, facilitating the development of personalized treatment plans. This synergy fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and sets the stage for in-novative research, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing the future of critical care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eceb692a1f8dbf0180cd3cc20d9df0e278d54e781d2f26c2aa941f62df22e01a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
