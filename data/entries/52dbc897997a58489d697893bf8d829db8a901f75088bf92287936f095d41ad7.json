{"title":"Understanding the Immune System&rsquo;s Intricate Balance: Activation, Tolerance, and Self-Protection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0218/v1","date":1712116699000,"content":"The mechanism of immune activation and de-activation is very important. Host should trigger effective immunity against pathogen infection. And, host cannot trigger immunity against self-antigens that will lead to detrimental autoimmune disorders. Spleen and liver have opposite roles in mediating immune responses. Spleen is the organ involving in immune activation, and liver is the organ involving in immune de-activation. Sympathetic nerve system and parasympathetic nerve system have opposite roles in mediating immune responses. Sympathetic nerve system is involving in pro-inflammatory, and parasympathetic nerve system is involving in anti-inflammatory. ACTH and glucocorticosteroid have opposite roles in mediating immune responses. ACTH is involving in activating adaptive immunity with inhibiting innate immunity, and glucocorticosteroid is involving in activating innate immunity with inhibiting adaptive immunity. The molecular chaperons, heat shock proteins, which are induced by fever, have the vital roles in immune activation. On the contrary, IgD B cells and gamma-delta T cells are causing immune de-activation via the mechanism of clonal anergy. These mechanism can help us the know the work of immunological pathways better for better control of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52dbc897997a58489d697893bf8d829db8a901f75088bf92287936f095d41ad7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
