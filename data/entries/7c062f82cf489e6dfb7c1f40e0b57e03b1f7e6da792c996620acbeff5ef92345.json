{"title":"Green Synthesis of Silver Oxide Nanoparticles from Mauritia flexuosa Fruit Extract: Characterization and Bioactivity Assessment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0317/v1","date":1725431575000,"content":"The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (MDR), persistent biofilms, oxidative stress, and cancerous cell proliferation pose significant challenges in healthcare and environmental settings, highlighting the urgent need for innovative and sustainable therapeutic solutions. The exploration of nanotechnology, particularly the use of green-synthesized nanoparticles, offers a promising avenue to address these complex biological challenges due to their multifunctional properties and biocompatibility. Utilizing a green synthesis approach, Mauritia flexuosa Mf-AgONPs were synthesized and characterized exhibiting potent antibacterial effects against both non-resistant and MDR bacterial strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 11.25 to 45 µg/mL. Mf-AgONPs also demonstrated significant antifungal efficacy, particularly against Candida glabrata, with a MIC of 5.63 µg/mL. Moreover, the nanoparticles showed strong biofilm inhibition capabilities and substantial antioxidant properties, underscoring their potential to combat oxidative stress. Additionally, Mf-AgONPs exhibited pronounced anti-tumor properties against various cancer cell lines, displaying low IC50 values across various cancer cell lines while maintaining minimal hemolytic activity at therapeutic concentrations. These findings suggest that Mf-AgONPs synthesized via an eco-friendly approach offer a promising alternative for biomedical applications, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, and anticancer therapies, warranting further in vivo studies to fully exploit their therapeutic potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c062f82cf489e6dfb7c1f40e0b57e03b1f7e6da792c996620acbeff5ef92345","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
