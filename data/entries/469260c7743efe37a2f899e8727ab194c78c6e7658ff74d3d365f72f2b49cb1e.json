{"title":"Limited spatiotemporal larval mixing of the Norway lobster from no‐take marine protected areas in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4175?af=R","date":1716804910000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nThe larvae of many marine species are pelagic drifters in the vast oceans, yet they are the first and, for sessile species, the only way to connect with other populations. Connectivity is of particular interest in designing and assessing marine protected areas (MPAs), as it is considered a factor of renewal and stability.\nIn this study, we focused on larval mixing between MPAs, investigating mixing rates during and at the end of their pelagic life, and how this is affected by the timing of larval release. We used a particle transport model coupled to the climatological hydrodynamics of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea to simulate the trajectories of <i>Nephrops norvegicus</i> larvae. Larvae were released from four no-take MPAs, where fishery activity is banned, and started mixing between 7 and 12 days old.\nAt settlement time, larval mixing mainly occurred between two pairs of MPAs labelled AxB (49.4% ± 5.8%) and CxD (23.7% ± 10.7%), respectively, located on the northern and southern sides of a thermal front. Percentages of larval mixing between these pairs changed, and other MPA combinations were formed with delayed larval release times. Mixing of larvae released from the same MPA tended to decrease with increasing delays between release times.\nThis variability in mixing was related to the latitudinal distribution of MPAs along the continental slope and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the regional hydrodynamics, with a strong impact from a thermal front.\nLarval mixing modelling is a useful measure for understanding connectivity in marine environments and can suggest new conservation decisions. It identifies MPAs that are spatially distributed to facilitate the convergence of larvae from various protected areas. It also underlines that recognizing the significance of hydrodynamic variability when designing MPAs is crucial for promoting efficient connectivity among these areas.\n</p>","author":"Morane Clavel‐Henry, \nNixon Bahamon, \nJacopo Aguzzi, \nJoan Navarro, \nMiguel López, \nJoan B.
