{"title":"The beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus velezensis SQR9 regulates plant nitrogen uptake via an endogenous signaling pathway","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/11/3388/7630903?rss=1","date":1710720000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Nitrogen fertilizer is widely used in agriculture to boost crop yields. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) can increase plant nitrogen use efficiency through nitrogen fixation and organic nitrogen mineralization. However, it is not known whether they can activate plant nitrogen uptake. In this study, we investigated the effects of volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by the PGPR strain <span>Bacillus velezensis</span> SQR9 on plant nitrogen uptake. Strain SQR9 VCs promoted nitrogen accumulation in both rice and Arabidopsis. In addition, isotope labeling experiments showed that strain SQR9 VCs promoted the absorption of nitrate and ammonium. Several key nitrogen-uptake genes were up-regulated by strain SQR9 VCs, such as <span>AtNRT2.1</span> in Arabidopsis and <span>OsNAR2.1</span>, <span>OsNRT2.3a</span>, and <span>OsAMT1</span> family members in rice, and the deletion of these genes compromised the promoting effect of strain SQR9 VCs on plant nitrogen absorption. Furthermore, calcium and the transcription factor NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 7 play an important role in nitrate uptake promoted by strain SQR9 VCs. Taken together, our results indicate that PGPRs can promote nitrogen uptake through regulating plant endogenous signaling and nitrogen transport pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"49ad2f98f80f050570fe5df5d3b49a3d2b66e13b3c870411682df90750aca1f8","category":"Environment"}
