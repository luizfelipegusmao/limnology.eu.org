{"title":"Quality of life of people living with chronic hepatitis B: The role of social support system","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003103","date":1714140000000,"content":"<p>by Yasmin Ibrahim, Beatrice Zovich, Bright Ansah, Catherine Freeland, Michaela Jackson, Thomas Tu, Chari Cohen</p>\r\n\r\nPeople living with chronic hepatitis B (PLCHB) are recommended to follow a lifelong monitoring regimen and face increased risk of liver cancer. Additionally, PLCHB frequently encounter stigma and discrimination, and relationship disruptions because of their chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Social support plays a key role in coping with chronic illnesses; however, this is inadequately assessed for PLCHB. This study aims to assess the physical, social, and mental impacts of living with CHB, the strategies PLCHB utilize to cope with their disease, and how social support–or lack of–impacts their journey with hepatitis B. The study was promoted through the Hepatitis B Foundation social media platforms, interested individuals filled-in a form expressing their interest to participate. The researcher conducted 24 telephone interviews in English, with PLCHB ≥18 years of age residing in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. Questions focused on the lived experiences of CHB and explored social support mechanisms that helped PLCHB. PLCHB experience a wide range of impacts (physical, social, and mental) that negatively affect their quality of life. Participants reported that receiving social support from their close network of individuals, hepatitis B community, or healthcare providers positively influenced their perspective on their future health and helped them adhere to treatment. The physical, social, and mental impacts of living with hepatitis B significantly affect the quality of life of PLCHB, calling for more research to document these impacts, and design integrated care models to address them. Social support appears to play an essential role in helping PLCHB cope with their disease and should be further studied.","author":"Yasmin Ibrahim","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"67712bbb8e43582db378be48207d7a03951be36d6d78087b1a29569c462ad109","category":"Environment"}
