{"title":"Symptoms of Digital Addiction of Estonian Primary School Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1954/v1","date":1716977857000,"content":"The aim of the present work was to map Estonian primary school students' ratings of symptoms of digital addiction and to identify both class and gender differences. The sample consisted of 5493 primary school pupils from 46 schools in Estonia participating in the 2022 Student Survey conducted by the Tallinn University Centre for Educational Innovation (CIE). The results showed that the digital addiction symptoms scores were highest in 8th and 9th grades. Girls and those who did not disclose their gender, scored higher than boys on digital addiction symptom statements. Symptoms of digital addiction were moderately positively related to screen time during school days and weekends and to school burnout and weakly negatively related to feeling refreshed in the morning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"351e46486c58ebd771a4517e22f190e99a837fd1789913e72bb70007215a0153","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
