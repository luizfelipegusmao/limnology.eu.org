{"title":"Inversion of Left Ventricular Axial Shortening: In Silico Proof of Concept for Treatment of HFpEF","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1155/v1","date":1715929343000,"content":"Left ventricular (LV) longitudinal function is mechanically coupled to the elasticity of the ascending aorta (AA). The pathophysiologic link between stiff AA and reduced longitudinal strain and subsequent deterioration in longitudinal LV systolic function is likely relevant in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). A proposed therapeutic effect of freeing the LV apex and allowing for LV inverse longitudinal shortening was studied in-silico utilizing Living Left Heart Human Model (Dassault Syst√©mes Simulia Corporation). LV function was evaluated in a model with A) Elastic AA; B) Stiff AA; and C) Stiff AA with free LV apex. The cardiac model simulation demonstrated that freeing the apex caused inverse LV longitudinal shortening that can abolish the deleterious mechanical effect of a stiff AA on LV function. A stiff AA and impairment of LV longitudinal strain are common in patients HFpEF. The hypothesis-generating model strongly suggests that freeing the apex and inverse longitudinal shortening may improve LV function in HFpEF patients with a stiff AA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17c2df8a1ce96581273f50929e164a545fa519b3bfb005df95a97ce531632395","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
