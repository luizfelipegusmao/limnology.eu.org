{"title":"R-SNARE protein YKT61 mediates root apical meristem cell division via BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 recycling","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1467/7456360?rss=1","date":1701302400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Root growth is sustained by cell division and differentiation of the root apical meristem (RAM), in which brassinosteroid (BR) signaling mediated via the dynamic targeting of BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) plays complex roles. BRI1 is constitutively secreted to the plasma membrane (PM), internalized, and recycled or delivered into vacuoles, whose PM abundance is critical for BR signaling. Vesicleâ€“target membrane fusion is regulated by heterotetrameric SNARE complexes. SNARE proteins have been implicated in BRI1 targeting, but how SNAREs affect RAM development is unclear. We report that Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) YKT61, an atypical R-SNARE protein, is critical for BR-controlled RAM development through the dynamic targeting of BRI1. Functional loss of <span>YKT61</span> is lethal for both male and female gametophytes. By using weak mutant alleles of <span>YKT61</span>, <span>ykt61-partially complemented</span> (<span>ykt61-pc</span>), we show that <span>YKT61</span> knockdown results in a reduction of RAM length due to reduced cell division, similar to that in <span>bri1-116</span>. YKT61 physically interacts with BRI1 and is critical for the dynamic recycling of BRI1 to the PM. We further determine that <span>YKT61</span> is critical for the dynamic biogenesis of vacuoles, for the maintenance of Golgi morphology, and for endocytosis, which may have a broad effect on development. Endomembrane compartments connected via vesicular machinery, such as SNAREs, influence nuclear-controlled cellular activities such as division and differentiation by affecting the dynamic targeting of membrane proteins, supporting a retro-signaling pathway from the endomembrane system to the nucleus.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"71712f7696b310a331b25512d3219a2d21773698bff901df553fd60bc7b1ad83","category":"Environment"}
