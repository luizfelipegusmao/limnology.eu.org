{"title":"Assessment of Solar Energy Generation Toward Net-Zero Energy Buildings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1233/v1","date":1729017500000,"content":"With the continuous rise in the energy consumption of buildings, the study and integration of net-zero energy buildings (NZEBs) are essential for mitigating the harmful effects associated with this trend. However, developing an energy management system for such buildings is challenging due to uncertainties surrounding NZEBs. This paper introduces an optimization framework comprising two major stages: (i) renewable energy prediction and (ii) multi-objective optimization. A prediction model is developed to accurately forecast photovoltaic (PV) system output, while a multi-objective optimization model is designed to identify the most efficient ways to produce cooling, heating, and electricity at minimal operational cost. These two stages not only help mitigate uncertainties in NZEBs but also reduce dependence on imported power from the utility grid. Finally, to facilitate the deployment of the proposed framework, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed, providing a user-friendly environment for building operators to determine optimal scheduling and oversee the entire system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"985f2e451d9812500cd9a3b1db66d372ecf14758136c576e6ad4fc76badbae1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
