Additionally, MEMS based biasing chip and sample holder design have provided a platform to perform electrochemical experiments to replicate battery cycling operations within the electron microscope. While these experiments have been useful for gaining a micro and nanoscale in-situ understanding of electrochemical processes that occur at solid-liquid interfaces of battery materials, the current spatial resolution of liquid processes within the TEM is still not capable of resolving and quantifying complex dynamic nanoscale structures at atomic resolutions. As a result, the performance of electrochemical systems is currently limited due to a lack of understanding of complex interactions that occur between mobile species and electrode materials. Finding a correlative high-resolution characterization method which is compatible with both the liquid and solid component of the interface is of great importance to gain a fundamental understanding of these processes at an atomic level.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a6a801e033e8ad58580c17bd092769e7dbe3290235a676be3d5eb2d2bc5d7c8d","category":"Environment"}
