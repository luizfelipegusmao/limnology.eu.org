{"title":"Detection of Ghost Introgression Requires Exploiting Topological and Branch Length Information","link":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/73/1/207/7550019?rss=1","date":1705276800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In recent years, the study of hybridization and introgression has made significant progress, with ghost introgression—the transfer of genetic material from extinct or unsampled lineages to extant species—emerging as a key area for research. Accurately identifying ghost introgression, however, presents a challenge. To address this issue, we focused on simple cases involving 3 species with a known phylogenetic tree. Using mathematical analyses and simulations, we evaluated the performance of popular phylogenetic methods, including HyDe and PhyloNet/MPL, and the full-likelihood method, Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP), in detecting ghost introgression. Our findings suggest that heuristic approaches relying on site-pattern counts or gene-tree topologies struggle to differentiate ghost introgression from introgression between sampled non-sister species, frequently leading to incorrect identification of donor and recipient species. The full-likelihood method BPP uses multilocus sequence alignments directly—hence taking into account both gene-tree topologies and branch lengths, by contrast, is capable of detecting ghost introgression in phylogenomic datasets. We analyzed a real-world phylogenomic dataset of 14 species of <span>Jaltomata</span> (Solanaceae) to showcase the potential of full-likelihood methods for accurate inference of introgression.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Systematic Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ff28aeeb9b03783edee2039c6a58e13e932a0eb216cc2d8b21d5a99c6800e59a","entryHash":"d017f21669e78421c7cc91cae8187632100adf8faefa6964d675ed90017c09d6","category":"Environment"}
