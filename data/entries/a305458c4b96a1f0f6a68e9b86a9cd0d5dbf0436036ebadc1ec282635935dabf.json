{"title":"UCM-NetV2 and BNN-UCM-NetV2: Efficient and Accurate Deep Learning Models for Skin Lesion Segmentation on Mobile Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0866/v1","date":1720611187000,"content":"Accurate segmentation of skin lesions from dermoscopic images is crucial for early skin cancer detection, yet variations in lesion appearance and image artifacts present challenges. This study proposes two deep learning models, UCM-NetV2 and BNN-UCM-NetV2, to improve accuracy and computational efficiency. UCM-NetV2 enhances the UCM-Net architecture with a novel \"cyber-structure\" combining Multilayer Perceptron and CNN layers, improving prediction accu-racy without increasing the model's parameter count. BNN-UCM-NetV2 further optimizes for mobile deployment by binarizing activations and weights into 1-bit values, reducing computa-tional complexity and model size. Evaluations on the ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets demonstrate that UCM-NetV2 outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving this with less than 0.04 GFLOPs. These models have the potential to make skin lesion analysis accessible to a broader population, particularly in resource-limited settings, allowing for proactive skin health monitoring and facilitating teledermatology. To foster further innovation in mobile health diagnostics, the source code for UCM-NetV2 will be available on GitHub: https://github.com/chunyuyuan/UCMV2-Net.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a305458c4b96a1f0f6a68e9b86a9cd0d5dbf0436036ebadc1ec282635935dabf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
