Artificial intelligence-driven programs can customize lessons, exercises, and feedback by evaluating a learner's progress and determining strengths and shortcomings. This individualized method aids students in concentrating on their areas of weakness, thus improving their total language competency. This narrative literature review aims to gather relevant literature discussing AI tools as supplementary support in aiding a learner's language acquisition. Relevant studies stated that there are a lot of chances to improve learning outcomes when AI tools are used in language acquisition. Teachers who want to give their students more resources and help should consider including these tools in their lessons. To preserve the interpersonal and cultural components of language learning, it is imperative to strike a balance between the application of AI and conventional teaching techniques. AI tools are always accessible, providing assistance to learners whenever needed. This is especially helpful for individuals with unpredictable schedules or restricted access to conventional language learning materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7a04f79141b8f1444b87fed640c0e0d2ef3d89ba7a691ecccb4950aeda18086","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
