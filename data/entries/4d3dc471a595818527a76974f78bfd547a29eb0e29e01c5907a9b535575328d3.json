{"title":"Astrocyte Morphological Adaptations in a Mouse Model of Social Anxiety Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1333/v1","date":1726574928000,"content":"The social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm, which is an animal model of social anxiety disorder, has been extensively used to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the psychopathology of this disorder. Studies using the SFC paradigm have suggested that the lateral septum plays a pivotal role in regulating social fear. While several lines of evidence have indicated the involvement of various neuronal mechanisms within the LS in modulating social fear, the role played by LS astrocytes in the tripartite synapses in regulating social fear expression is not yet fully understood. Over the years, astrocytes have emerged as key players in regulating synaptic transmission and a plethora of animal behaviors. Given their dynamic morphological and molecular response to various stimuli, studying astrocyte morphology remains an excellent tool for understanding their role in brain function and disease. By applying immunofluorescent-immunohistochemical methods, here we describe a protocol to characterize changes in the morphology of astrocytes in response to social fear acquisition using confocal microscopy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d3dc471a595818527a76974f78bfd547a29eb0e29e01c5907a9b535575328d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
