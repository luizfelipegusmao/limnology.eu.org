{"title":"Orthopaedic and trauma research in Tanzania: A scoping review","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304218","date":1717596000000,"content":"<p>by Benjamin Blackman, Sarah Barnett, Ajay Premkumar, Neil P. Sheth</p>\r\n\r\nTanzania is disproportionately burdened by musculoskeletal injuries as it faces unique challenges when dealing with trauma care. This scoping review aims to summarize and assess the current state of orthopaedic and trauma research in Tanzania. By identifying key themes, trends, and gaps in the literature, this review seeks to guide future research initiatives catered specifically to the needs of Tanzania’s healthcare system. Utilizing the PRISMA-ScR protocol, OVID Medline, PubMed, and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to June 17, 2023, using keywords such as “Orthopaedics” “Trauma” and “Tanzania”. One hundred and ninety-two eligible studies were included and the Arksey and O’Malley framework for scoping studies was followed. There was a notable growth of relevant publications from 2015 onward, with peaks in growth in the years 2019, 2021, and 2020. The studies employed diverse research methodologies, with cross-sectional (n = 41, 21%) and prospective studies (n = 39, 20%) being the most prevalent, and randomized-controlled trials being the least prevalent methodology, making up eight studies (4.2%). The most common study themes were trauma (n = 101, 52.6%), lower extremity (n = 31, 16%), and spine-related issues (n = 27, 14%). Only three studies looked at work-related injuries (1.6%). Road traffic injuries (RTIs) were the most common mechanism of trauma in 77.0% of the trauma focused studies. Fifty-three percent of the studies were conducted by a majority of Tanzanian authors. This scoping review highlights various trends in orthopaedic and trauma research in Tanzania, with a particular emphasis on road traffic-related injuries. Various gaps are explored, including a lack of research on work-related injuries and a paucity of experimental research. Our findings underline areas where future research is warranted. The future of orthopaedic and trauma care in Tanzania depends on the efforts and collaboration of both local and international stakeholders.","author":"Benjamin Blackman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0434a6d9876f241455d26885e23f18532d539ba56109faabfbe866c1d43e67fb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
