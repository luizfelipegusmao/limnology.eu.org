{"title":"An Integrated Photonic Biosensing Platform for Pathogen Detection in Aquaculture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1895/v1","date":1719439406000,"content":"Aquaculture is expected to play a vital role in solving the challenge of sustainably providing the growing world population with healthy and nutritious food. Pathogen outbreaks are a major risk for the sector, so early detection and a timely response are crucial. This can be enabled by monitoring of pathogen levels in aquaculture facilities. This paper describes a photonic biosensing platform based on silicon nitride waveguide technology with integrated active components, which could be used for such applications. Compared to the state of the art, the current system presents improvements in terms of miniaturization of the Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC), and the development of wafer level processes for hybrid integration of active components and for material-selective chemical and biological surface modification. Furthermore, scalable processes for integrating the PIC in a microfluidic cartridge have been developed, as well as a prototype desktop readout instrument. Three bacterial aquaculture pathogens (Aeromonas salmonicida, Vagococcus salmoninarum, and Yersinia ruckeri) were selected for assay development. DNA biomarkers were identified, corresponding primer-probe sets designed, and qPCR assays developed. The biomarker for Aeromonas was also detected using the hybrid PIC platform. This is the first successful demonstration of biosensing on the hybrid PIC platform.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a429368c3b04048746496c31445d45bd8613567be93370087084e506f0b3aa6e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
