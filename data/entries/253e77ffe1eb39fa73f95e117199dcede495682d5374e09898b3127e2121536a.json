{"title":"Dual Regulation of Cytochrome P450 Gene Expression by Two Distinct Small RNAs, a Novel tasiRNA and miRNA, in Marchantia polymorpha","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/7/1115/7636528?rss=1","date":1711584000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The miR390-derived <span>TAS3</span> trans-acting short-interfering RNAs (tasiRNAs) module represents a conserved RNA silencing pathway in the plant kingdom; however, its characterization in the bryophyte <span>Marchantia polymorpha</span> is limited. This study elucidated that MpDCL4 processes Mp<span>TAS3</span> double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to generate tasiRNAs, primarily from the 5สน- and 3สน-ends of dsRNA. Notably, we discovered a novel tasiRNA, tasi78A, which can negatively regulate a cytochrome P450 gene, Mp<span>CYP78A101</span>. Additionally, tasi78A was abundant in MpAGO1, and transient expression assays underscored the role of tasi78A in repressing Mp<span>CYP78A101</span>. A microRNA, miR11700, also regulates Mp<span>CYP78A101</span> expression. This coordinate regulation suggests a role in modulating auxin signaling at apical notches of gemma, influencing the growth and sexual organ development of <span>M. polymorpha</span> and emphasizing the significance of RNA silencing in Mp<span>CYP78A101</span> regulation. However, phylogenetic analysis identified another paralog of the CYP78 family, Mp1g14150, which may have a redundant role with Mp<span>CYP78A101</span>, explaining the absence of noticeable morphological changes in loss-of-function plants. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the combined regulatory roles of miR390/Mp<span>TAS3</span>/miR11700 in controlling Mp<span>CYP78A101</span> and expand our knowledge about the biogenesis and regulation of tasiRNAs in <span>M. polymorpha</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"253e77ffe1eb39fa73f95e117199dcede495682d5374e09898b3127e2121536a","category":"Environment"}
