How to efficiently model these complex dynamics remains a significant challenge. To bridge this knowledge gap, we propose an innovative model termed “the impulsive, tempered fractional advection-dispersion equation” (IT-fADE) to simulate HM-HMs of TAD. The model is approximated using an L1-based finite difference solver with unconditional stability and an efficient convergence rate. Application results demonstrate that the IT-fADE model and its solver successfully capture TAD induced by hydrologically trigged hot phenomena (including hot moments and hot spots) across three distinct aquifers: (a) transient sub-diffusion arising from sudden shifts in hydraulic gradient within a regional-scale alluvial aquifer, (b) transient sub- or super-diffusion due to convergent or push-pull tracer experiments within a local-scale fractured aquifer, and (c) transient sub-diffusion likely attributed to multiple-conduit flow within an intermediate-scale karst aquifer. The impulsive terms and fractional differential operator integrated into the IT-fADE aptly capture the ephemeral nature and evolving memory of HM-HMs of TAD by incorporating multiple stress periods into the model. The sequential HM-HM model also characterizes breakthrough curves of pollutants as they encounter hydrologically mediated, parallel hot spots. Furthermore, we delve into discussions concerning model parameters, extensions, and comparisons, as well as impulse signals and the propagation of memory within the context of employing IT-fADE to capture hot phenomena of TAD in aquatic systems.</p>","author":"Yong Zhang, \nXiaoting Liu, \nDawei Lei, \nMaosheng Yin, \nHongGuang Sun, \nZhilin Guo, \nHongbin Zhan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ca1391b07e3b2d1f792df0b58af4899cba27371db5789ac011fef67cb3632757","entryHash":"030414158c971cf2d51da97b95365c90d654c6370fcf228af35e1c8d5f0cb05a","category":"Environment"}
