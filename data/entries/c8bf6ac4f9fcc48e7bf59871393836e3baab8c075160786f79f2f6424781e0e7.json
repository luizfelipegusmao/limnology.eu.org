{"title":"Collatz Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.0227/v9","date":1706498472000,"content":"This paper presents an analysis of the number of zeros in the binary representation of natural numbers. The primary method of analysis involves the use of the concept of the fractional part of a number, which naturally emerges in the determination of binary representation. This idea is grounded in the fundamental property of the Riemann zeta function, constructed using the fractional part of a number. Understanding that the ratio between the fractional and integer parts of a number, analogous to the Riemann zeta function, reflects the profound laws of numbers becomes the key insight of this work. The findings suggest a new perspective on the interrelation between elementary properties of numbers and more complex mathematical concepts, potentially opening new directions in number theory and analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c8bf6ac4f9fcc48e7bf59871393836e3baab8c075160786f79f2f6424781e0e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
