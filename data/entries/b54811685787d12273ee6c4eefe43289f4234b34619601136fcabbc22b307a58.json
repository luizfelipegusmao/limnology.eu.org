{"title":"Enhanced Nutritional and Functional Recovery in Femur Fracture Patients&rsquo; Post-Surgery: Preliminary Evidence of Muscle-Targeted Nutritional Support in Real-World Practice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1824/v1","date":1729693667000,"content":"Background/Objectives: To describe the effects of muscle-targeted oral nutritional supplementation (MT-ONS) on nutrition, functional capacity, and other health outcomes in patients after femur fracture surgery; Methods: A prospective, open-label, single-center study was conducted. Patients aged 80+ post-femur fracture were recruited. They were assessed at baseline and after 90 days with MT-ONS, 100% whey protein enriched with leucine and vitamin D. Demographics, clinical and nutritional status (MNA®-SF), functional capacity [Barthel Index (BI), Lawton &amp;amp; Brody (LB) scale], muscle strength (dynamometry), cognition [Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)], tolerability, and satisfaction data were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed. Ethical approval was obtained; Results: Thirty-one patients (74% women, mean age 87 ± 3.99 years) were enrolled. At baseline, 32% were malnourished and 65% at risk. After ≥90 days of MT-ONS, malnutrition decreased to 13% and well-nourishment increased to 32%. Ninety percent gained weight, with significant muscle strength improvements (+2 kg, p&amp;lt;0.001). Eighty-one percent achieved a BI score ≥60 points [mean 84.8 (± 17.82)]. BI score improvements correlated with higher baseline muscle strength (rho=0.413, p=0.021) and better nutritional status (rho=0.464, p=0.009). LB mean score was 4.84 (± 2.26). Improvements correlated with pre-fracture BI score (rho=0.475, p=0.007). Positive correlations were noted between nutritional status, muscle strength, and functional outcomes. Cognition remained stable (GDS=1 in 67.7% patients). Tolerability and satisfaction with MT-ONS were high at 90%; Conclusions: MT-ONS, 100% whey protein enriched with leucine and vitamin D for ≥90 days, enhances nutritional status and functional recovery in patients after femur fracture surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b54811685787d12273ee6c4eefe43289f4234b34619601136fcabbc22b307a58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
