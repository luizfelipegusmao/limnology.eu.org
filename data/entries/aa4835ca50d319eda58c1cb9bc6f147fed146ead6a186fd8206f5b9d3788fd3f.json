{"title":"Traces of Consciousness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1305/v1","date":1729144420000,"content":"What is an observer? What is an observation? How do observations inform beliefs? What is the relationship between observers and physical objects in spacetime? These are central, and as yet unresolved, questions in the foundations of physics and consciousness science. We propose an answer taking consciousness as fundamental, resulting in a theory of conscious agents whose mutual interaction is governed by Markov chains. We describe observation via a new trace order on Markov chains. In this context, no observer is aloof: it must be an integral part of any system it observes. We find that the trace order forms a non-Boolean logic, mapping homomorphically to the “Lebesgue” logic” of probabilistic beliefs. We explore implications of conscious agent theory for the “hard problem” of consciousness, and propose a route to empirical tests using data from scattering experiments with subatomic particles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa4835ca50d319eda58c1cb9bc6f147fed146ead6a186fd8206f5b9d3788fd3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
