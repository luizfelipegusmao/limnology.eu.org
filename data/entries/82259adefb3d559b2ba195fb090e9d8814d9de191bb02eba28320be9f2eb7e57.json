{"title":"Effect of nitrogen fertilizer on the quality traits of Indica rice with different amylose contents","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13676?af=R","date":1719409351000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Nitrogen is a key factor affecting the quality of rice. Studying the impact of nitrogen fertilizer on the taste, physicochemical properties, and starch structure of Indica rice with different amylose contents is of great significance for scientifically fertilizing and cultivating high-quality rice varieties for consumption.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The results indicate that increasing nitrogen fertilizer application reduces the amylose content and increases the protein content, resulting in a decrease in taste quality. Simultaneously, it reduces the intergranular porosity of starch particles, improving the appearance and milling quality of rice. Compared to the N1 treatment (nitrogen fertilizer application rate of 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup>), the taste of low-amylose rice (Yixiangyou 2115) and high-amylose rice (Byou 268) decreased by 14.24% and 19.79%, respectively, under N4 treatment (nitrogen fertilizer application rate of 270 kg ha<sup>−1</sup>). The effect of nitrogen fertilizer on low-amylose rice is mainly reflected in increased rice hardness, enthalpy value, and setback viscosity, resulting in a decline in taste. The effect of nitrogen fertilizer on high-amylose rice is mainly reflected in a decrease in peak viscosity, an increase in gelatinization temperature, and crystallinity under high nitrogen levels.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Increasing nitrogen fertilizer application can improve the appearance and milling quality of rice, but it also leads to an increase in protein content, hardness, gelatinization enthalpy, decrease in breakdown value, and a decline in palatability. In practical production, different production measures should be taken according to different production goals. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jinhui Wang, \nXiaoqiao Zhang, \nYao Xiao, \nHong Chen, \nXuechun Wang, \nYungao Hu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"82259adefb3d559b2ba195fb090e9d8814d9de191bb02eba28320be9f2eb7e57","category":"Environment"}
