However, there has been little effort to synthesize or predict how ecosystem engineering may impact the structure and stability of interaction networks.\n\nTo assess current scientific understanding of ecosystem engineering impacts via habitat forming, habitat modification and bioturbation on interaction networks/food webs, we reviewed the literature covering marine, freshwater and terrestrial food webs, plant-pollinator networks and theory.\n\nWe provide a conceptual framework and identify three major pathways of engineering impact on networks through changes in resource availability and energy flow, habitat heterogeneity and environmental filtering. These three processes often work in concert and most studies report that engineering increases species richness. This is particularly marked for engineers that increase habitat heterogeneity and thereby the number of available niches.\n\nThe response of network structure to ecosystem engineering varies, however some patterns emerge from this review. Engineered habitat heterogeneity leads to a higher number of links between species in the networks and increases link density. Connectance can be negatively or positively affected by ecosystem engineer impact, depending on the engineering pathway and the engineer impact of species richness.\n\nWe discuss how ecosystem engineers can stabilize or destabilize communities through the changes in niche space, diversity, network structure and the dependency on the engineering impact. Theory and empirical evidence need to inform each other to better integrate ecosystem engineering and ecological networks. A mechanistic understanding how ecosystem engineering traits shape interactions networks and their stability will be important to predict species extinctions and can provide crucial information for conservation and ecosystem restoration.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/06/13/ecosystem-engineers-shape-communities-and-species-interactions/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Dirk Sanders, \nEnric Frago","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"0e27cabed73dcefea35bbfa70f7424afaf6570a64b3cfb21b9dbf9facedf3e20","category":"Environment"}
