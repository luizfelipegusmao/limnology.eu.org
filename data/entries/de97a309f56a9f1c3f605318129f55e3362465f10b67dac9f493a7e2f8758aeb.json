Although the major route of selenium uptake in macroinvertebrates is via the diet, the uptake of waterborne selenite (HSeO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>), the prominent form at circumneutral pH, can be an important contributor to selenium body burden and thus selenium toxicity. In the current study, radiolabelled selenite (Se<sup>75</sup>) was used to characterize the mechanism of selenite uptake in the water flea, <span>Daphnia magna</span>. The concentration dependence (1–32 μM) of selenite uptake was determined in 1-hour uptake assays in artificial waters that independently varied in bicarbonate, chloride, sulphate, phosphate and selenate concentrations. At concentrations representative of those found in highly contaminated waters, selenite uptake was phosphate-dependent and inhibited by foscarnet, a phosphate transport inhibitor. At higher concentrations, selenite uptake was dependent on waterborne bicarbonate concentration and inhibited by the bicarbonate transporter inhibitor DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid). These findings suggest that concentrations of phosphate in coal mining-affected waters could alter selenite uptake in aquatic organisms and could ultimately affect the toxic impacts of selenium in such waters.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"de97a309f56a9f1c3f605318129f55e3362465f10b67dac9f493a7e2f8758aeb","category":"Environment"}
