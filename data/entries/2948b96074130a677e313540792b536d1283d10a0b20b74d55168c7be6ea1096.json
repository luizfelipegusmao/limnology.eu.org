{"title":"The Effect of Kinesiology Taping on Posture, Balance, and Gait in Patients Suffering from Low Back Pain","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2162/v1","date":1725007859000,"content":"Introduction: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of lost productivity, absenteeism, disability, and early retirement worldwide. LBP treatment should be comprehensive, including prevention, education, diagnosis, and various treatment methods. Treatment can be divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological. The role of physiotherapy in the comprehensive treatment of LBP is very important. Elastic therapeutic tape, also called kinesiology tape or therapeutic kinesiology tape, has been used for about 50 years. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Kinesio taping in patients suffering from (LBP) and its possible effect on the swing of the center of pressure (COP), balance, gait, improvement of coordination, and pain reduction. Material and methods: A total of 60 patients aged 20 to 83 years (54% women) were examined, all of whom met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the experimental group, in addition to comprehensive rehabilitation, kinesiotaping of the L1-L5 spine was used. The control group underwent balance control training. The research tools used included the Bohannon single-leg standing test, the FAC scale - Functional Ambulatory Category, the Podsiadlo and Richardson Standing and Walking Test - Timed Up and Go (TUG), lumbar spine mobility assessment, Lasegue's sign and examination of neurological deficit symptoms. and self-assessment of pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Results: Kinesio taping has a statistically significant effect on postural control, balance, gait, coordination, and pain. The main parameter with a statistically significant effect on the effects of Kinesio taping was age (below 55 years), which was also observed in the control group. Conclusions: Kinesio taping is an effective method in the treatment of LBP. It improves postural control, balance, gait, coordination, and pain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2948b96074130a677e313540792b536d1283d10a0b20b74d55168c7be6ea1096","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
