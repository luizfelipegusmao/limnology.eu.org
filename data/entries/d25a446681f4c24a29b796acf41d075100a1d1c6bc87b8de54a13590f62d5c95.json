{"title":"Exploring Walkability in Saudi Cites Using GIS Techniques to Enhance Urban Sustainability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1363/v1","date":1711114447000,"content":"This study employs Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to evaluate the walkability of Onaizah City, which serves as a representative model for a Saudi city situated in the Qassim region, north of the capital city, Riyadh. The goal is to evaluate how easily pedestrians can navigate the street network and identify areas that excel or need improvement in terms of walkability. The results offer insights for planning and development supporting sustainable initiatives. Approach; The study involves integrating GIS data, such as street layouts, land use patterns, and demographic information. By analyzing factors like integration values and choice values within the street network the study gaugesâ€™ walkability aspects. Furthermore, correlation analysis explores how spatial arrangements, influence walkability. By studying the case of a medium-sized Saudi city, which can then be applied to several Saudi cities. Cost distance analysis and cost-back correlation calculations are employed to determine pedestrian routes. Findings and Discussion; Through GIS techniques the study effectively assesses the walkability of Onaizah City by identifying three walking paths with lengths of (1401m, 1283m, and 1507m). The study reveals pedestrians' actual city distance. Weighted criteria assign 40% to heritage sites, 30% to green spaces, and 15% each to mosques/commercial sites. Preserving access to heritage sites and incorporating areas enhance walkability. Conclusion: Study enhances walkability understanding, offering data-driven planning suggestions. Urban planners prioritize pedestrian connectivity, considering GIS effectiveness and physical environment importance. Findings support walkability research and sustainable urban development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d25a446681f4c24a29b796acf41d075100a1d1c6bc87b8de54a13590f62d5c95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
