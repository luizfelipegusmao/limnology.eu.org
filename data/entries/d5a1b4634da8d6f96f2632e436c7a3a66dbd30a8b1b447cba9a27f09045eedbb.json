{"title":"Grating Coupler Design for Low-Cost Fabrication in Amorphous Silicon Photonic Integrated Circuits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0689/v1","date":1720496728000,"content":"Photonic circuits find applications in biomedicine, manufacturing, quantum computing and communications. Photonic waveguides are crucial components, typically having cross-sections orders of magnitude inferior compared with other photonic components (e. g. optical fibers, light sources and photodetectors). Several light coupling methods exist, consisting of either on-plane (e. g. adiabatic and end-fire coupling) or off-plane methods (e. g. grating and vertical couplers). The grating coupler is a versatile light transference technique which can be tested at wafer level, not requiring specific fiber terminations or additional optical components, like lenses, polarizers or prisms. This study focuses on fully-etched grating couplers without bottom reflector, made from hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), deposited over a silica substrate. Different coupler designs were tested, of these we highlight two: superimposition of two lithographic masks with different periods and an offset between them to create a random distribution and a technique based on the quadratic refractive index variation along the deviceâ€™s length. Results were obtained by 2D-FDTD simulation. The designed grating couplers achieve coupling efficiencies for the TE-like mode over -8 dB (mask overlap) and -3 dB (quadratic variation), at a wavelength of 1550 nm. The coupling scheme considers a 220 nm a-Si:H waveguide and an SMF-28 optical fiber.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5a1b4634da8d6f96f2632e436c7a3a66dbd30a8b1b447cba9a27f09045eedbb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
