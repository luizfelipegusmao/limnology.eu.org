The fluoride hosts with central ion Si<sup>4+</sup>, Ti<sup>4+</sup>, Ge<sup>4+</sup>, Sn<sup>4+</sup>, Zr<sup>4+</sup>, or Al<sup>3+</sup> activated with Mn<sup>4+</sup> or rare-earth (RE) elements have been well reported in the literature [<a href=\"#ozae044.014-B1\">1–7</a>]. The Hf-based fluorides doped with RE elements have found application for radiation detection [<a href=\"#ozae044.014-B5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.014-B7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.014-B8\">8</a>]. Here, we report the cathodoluminescence (CL) of Mn<sup>4+</sup>-doped lithium hafnium fluorides. In a typical synthesis, a solution of LiF in methanol and aqueous HfCl<sub>4</sub> were prepared separately. The LiF was dispersed in methanol by sonication. The Mn<sup>4+</sup> precursor K<sub>2</sub>MnF<sub>6</sub> was synthesized by following the protocol reported elsewhere [<a href=\"#ozae044.014-B9\">9</a>]. First, the required amount of K<sub>2</sub>MnF<sub>6</sub> was dissolved in 1 mL 40% HF and quickly mixed with aqueous HfCl<sub>4</sub> solution. Then, the methanolic solution of LiF was added to the reaction mixture as soon as possible, stirred for 1 min, and precipitated with ethanol. The resulting solid product was separated via centrifugation and washed with ethanol several times. The final product was dried in an oven at 70 °C.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8ab5d0c87da7ff017ca6b36b1cf43b2580b0f24e9a5b8fb6409e149e9a9b2c5a","category":"Environment"}
