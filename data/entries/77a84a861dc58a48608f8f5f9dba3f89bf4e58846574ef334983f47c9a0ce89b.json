However, correcting outliers can mitigate these adverse effects. This study corrects the additive outliers through a weighting method and let these corrected values to replace the original outliers. Then, the model parameters are re-estimated based on this new return series. This approach reduces the extent to which outliers distort volatility estimates, allowing the model to better adapt to market conditions and improving the accuracy of volatility forecasts. This study introduces this approach for the first time to generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity mixed data sampling (GARCH-MIDAS) models, so as to establish an additional outliers corrected GARCH-MIDAS model (AO-GARCH-MIDAS). This pioneering approach marks a unique innovation. The research employs a diverse array of evaluation methods to validate the model’s robustness and consistently demonstrates its dependable performance. Findings unequivocally reveal the substantial influence of outliers on the model’s predictive capacity, with the AO-GARCH-MIDAS model exhibiting consistent superiority across all evaluation criteria. Additionally, while the GARCH model showcases stronger estimation capabilities compared to the GARCH-MIDAS model, the latter demonstrates heightened predictive prowess. Notably, regarding variable selection, the results underscore the greater predictive informational value inherent in realized volatility over other low-frequency factors.","author":"Ting Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"77a84a861dc58a48608f8f5f9dba3f89bf4e58846574ef334983f47c9a0ce89b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
