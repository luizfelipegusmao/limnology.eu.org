{"title":"Identification of morphologically similar genera based on reproductive systems and immature stages: a case study of Anastatus and Mesocomys (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/doi/10.1093/isd/ixae031/7808789?rss=1","date":1727913600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Parallel or convergent evolution may result in phenotypically closely similar species. Many studies have reported that using solely traditional external morphological features can result in misidentification. Here, we discuss using the reproductive systems and immature developmental stages for scientific classification in Eupelmidae (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea), exemplifying with <span>Anastatus</span> Motschulsky and <span>Mesocomys</span> Cameron (Eupelmidae, Eupelminae). Results show that there are at least 6 distinct differences in the immature stages and the reproductive systems of the adults between species of the 2 genera: (1) the terminal ends of the left and right ovarioles are connected together in the studied species of <span>Anastatus</span> but not in <span>Mesocomys</span>, (2) the base of the lateral oviduct of <span>Anastatus</span> has a diverticulum that is lobate-shaped, whereas this diverticulum is spherical in <span>Mesocomys</span>, (3) the peduncle of the egg of <span>Anastatus</span> is significantly longer than that of <span>Mesocomys</span>, (4) the head capsule of the terminal instar larvae of <span>Anastatus</span> is uniformly translucent, whereas in <span>Mesocomys</span> it has a brown pattern, (5) the ocelli of the <span>Anastatus</span> pupa are smooth and slightly raised whereas the ocelli of <span>Mesocomys</span> each have a long filament each, and (6) the phallobase of adult male <span>Anastatus</span> is sharp basally but rounded in <span>Mesocomys</span>. Our findings not only provide novel insights for the differentiation of similar genera that can be difficult to distinguish in the immature stages but also provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for clarifying the evolutionary and phylogenic status of <span>Anastatus</span> and <span>Mesocomys</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Insect Systematics and Diversity Current Issue","siteHash":"d4d59e2090793e303021830a9c164d689828dc5448b6052be7ec32e87f45cab0","entryHash":"5c6ce123e7de252d7944e749b7723522cdc068b32687106d22db1bcefd7f6007","category":"Environment"}
