The boundedness of such operators is established on Triebel-Lizorkin spaces whenever their kernel functions belong to Grafakos and Stefanov class. Our results generalize and improve some previously known results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a732fea11a7a859fdb604db43aa35f2a10fbacfc3a2776dee4d29237dc6cecd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
