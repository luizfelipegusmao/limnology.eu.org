{"title":"A Cost Model for Ocean Iron Fertilization as a Means of Carbon Dioxide Removal That Compares Ship‐ and Aerial‐Based Delivery, and Estimates Verification Costs","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003732?af=R","date":1711712079000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We present a cost model for implementing a deployment scale effort for conducting ocean iron fertilization (OIF) for marine-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The model incorporates basic oceanographic parameters critical for estimating the effective export of newly fixed CO<sub>2</sub> into biomass that is stimulated by Fe addition to an Fe-limited region of the Southern Ocean. Estimated costs can vary by nearly 100-fold between best-case and worst-case scenarios, with best-case values of $7/net tonne C captured versus worst-case $1,500/net tonne C captured, without accounting for verification costs. Primary oceanographic factors that influence cost are the net primary productivity increases achieved via OIF, the amount of C exported into the deep ocean, and the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> ventilated back to the atmosphere. The model compares ship-based versus aerial delivery of Fe to the ocean, and estimates aerial delivery can be 30%–40% more cost effective; however, the specific requirements for aerial delivery require additional research and development. The model also estimates costs associated with verification and environmental monitoring of OIF. These costs increase $/net tonne C captured by 3–4-fold. Best, intermediate, and worst cases for aerial delivery and ship delivery are $21, $83, $2,033, and $24, $94, $4,691, respectively, inclusive of verification costs. The primary goal of this model is to demonstrate the variability in cost of OIF as a CDR method, and to better understand where additional research is needed to determine the major factors that may make OIF a tractable, nature-based CDR method.</p>","author":"David Emerson, \nLaura E.
