This study aims to bridge the gap in understanding microscopy across educational levels, enhancing inclusivity and fostering broader participation. Two approaches have been described to enhance microscopy education: interactive modules for K-12 students and streamlined SEM process checklists for higher education students, simplifying complex concepts and techniques from foundational learning to more advanced applications.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0923d66058507c7c9ec707fe37fb1e047041a12da2787f79e96152b10e69672b","category":"Environment"}
