{"title":"Impact of Succinate Supplements on Metabolic Health and Muscle Mass after Functional Overloading and Denervation in Mice Fed High-Fat Diet","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1132/v1","date":1721023642000,"content":"Succinate is proposed to be a mediator of muscle exercise-induced adaptations. We studied metabolic health and changes of muscle mass in 6-month-old male mice after 12 weeks of feeding regular diet (RD, 13.4 kcal% fat, 66.8 kcal% carbohydrate, 29.8 kcal% protein), high fat diet (HFD, 60 kcal% fat, 20 kcal% carbohydrates, 20 kcal% protein) and ketogenic diet (KD, 80 kcal% fat, &amp;lt;1 kcal% carbohydrates, 20 kcal% protein) with or without 2% succinate supplements (SUS) in drinking water (n=8-12 per group). Functional overloading of the plantaris muscle (PL) was induced in a group of mice by denervation of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles at week 6 of feeding different diets. HFD induced the greatest (p &amp;lt; 0.001) increase in body and fat mass. HFD and KD lead to significant (p &amp;lt; 0.01) impairment in glucose tolerance compared to RD. SUS blunted (p &amp;lt; 0.01) initial surge in energy intake when mice were switched from RD to HFD, but did not influence any measures of metabolic health after 12 weeks of the study. Functional overloading lead to ~25% increase in PL mass which was not affected by diet or SUS. In conclusion, SUS does not have a long-term effect on metabolic health or muscle mass.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"701bee388e368d2cb9ec56c0e111560dd1a5c14f61b8833061f62876f0c618f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
