Single-cell CRISPR screens unite these two technologies, linking genetic perturbations in individual cells to changes in gene expression and illuminating regulatory networks underlying diseases. Despite their promise, single-cell CRISPR screens present considerable statistical challenges. We demonstrate through theoretical and real data analyses that a standard method for estimation and inference in single-cell CRISPR screens—“thresholded regression”—exhibits attenuation bias and a bias-variance tradeoff as a function of an intrinsic, challenging-to-select tuning parameter. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce GLM-EIV (“GLM-based errors-in-variables”), a new method for single-cell CRISPR screen analysis. GLM-EIV extends the classical errors-in-variables model to responses and noisy predictors that are exponential family-distributed and potentially impacted by the same set of confounding variables. We develop a computational infrastructure to deploy GLM-EIV across hundreds of processors on clouds (e.g. Microsoft Azure) and high-performance clusters. Leveraging this infrastructure, we apply GLM-EIV to analyze two recent, large-scale, single-cell CRISPR screen datasets, yielding several new insights.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"4b75496113aad0c6f46b760057b99d5832695174de932ee18c4f861589c76481","category":"Environment"}
