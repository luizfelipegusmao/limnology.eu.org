{"title":"An innovative protocol to increase egg production of chicken layers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305099","date":1717682400000,"content":"<p>by Furkan Alaraji</p>\r\n\r\nThis study investigated the effects of different doses of limestone, light durations, light intensities, and vitamins on both the productive performance and egg quality. The study utilized two rearing houses (control and treatment), each accommodating 75000 Lohmann Brown Classic chicks reared in open-sided rearing cages from one day old until they reached 89 weeks of age. Throughout the laying period, the hens were subjected to a specific light regimen (light = 14 h; dark = 10 h a day). At the end of experiment, the treatment group displayed significant (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) differences compared to the control group across various parameters. Notably, the treatment group exhibited lower daily feed intake (treatment: 112 g/bird vs control: 115 g/bird), 9.6% higher egg production (treatment: 78.5% vs control: 68.9%), lower body weight (treatment: 2057 g vs control: 2073 g), lower feed conversion ratio (FCR)/egg (treatment: 1.44 vs control: 1.69), higher egg weight (treatment: 69.4 g vs control: 68.5 g), greater egg mass (treatment: 56.14 vs control: 48.76), greater shell thickness (treatment: 3.52 mm vs control: 3.44 mm), and greater shell weight (treatment: 9.3 g vs control: 8.79 g). However, the albumin weight, yolk weight, yolk diameter, shape index, and Haugh units (HU) were not significantly (<i>p</i>Ëƒ0.05) affected after 75 weeks of treatment when compared with those of the control group. Therefore, this study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that different ratios of limestone, different durations and intensities of light, and different vitamin supplementation doses in the treatment group (subjected to the novel rearing recommendations described in this study) may yield a profit of 180,541 USD, exceeding the baseline profit of the control group (subjected to conventional rearing methods).","author":"Furkan Alaraji","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1f7eeac8625701c8b316ece0348b82dbcb5918009e27fa2334d83a1a3217f93a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
