{"title":"A Mathematical Model of Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0313/v1","date":1712238952000,"content":"The identification of fetal cells in the blood and tissues of healthy mothers raised questions about the potential alloreactive origins of various diseases, such as autoimmunity, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and cancer. However, the extent to which alloreactivity contributes to these diseases remains unverified. This study presents a basic mathematical disease model based on the genesâ€™ origin and immunological interactions. This model, grounded in set theory, classifies these immunological interactions based on their intrinsic, extrinsic, and allogeneic nature. Therefore, this model offers an unexpected common theoretical foundation for understanding alloreactivity, genetic diseases, and infections. Furthermore, this model provides a valuable framework for scrutinizing the role of alloreactivity in health and disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cac631aeb82af193422c32123f2c6f0c70e6d56e0f072606419abddc1c55386f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
