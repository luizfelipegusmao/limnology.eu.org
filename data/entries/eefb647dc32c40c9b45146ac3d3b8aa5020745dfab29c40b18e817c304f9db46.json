{"title":"Changing the Nomenclature of Duct Dependent Lesions from Duct Dependent Pulmonary and Systemic to Duct Dependent Oxygenation and Perfusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1397/v1","date":1711182915000,"content":"Duct-dependent lesions are classically divided into duct dependent pulmonary circulation which involves severe right sided obstructive lesions such as pulmonary atresia or critical stenosis, and duct dependent systemic circulation which is characterized by malformation of the left side of the heart, and whose severest spectrum is hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Dextro-transposition of the great arteries remains in gray zone between being included in some old classifications as a duct dependent pulmonary circulation lesion or a new category of duct-dependent or independent mixing lesion. We hypothesize that re-classifying duct dependent congenital defects into duct dependent perfusion and oxygenation offers a model to fit D-TGA into the same category of right sided obstructive lesions and reflects the clinical spectrum in a more comprehensive way.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eefb647dc32c40c9b45146ac3d3b8aa5020745dfab29c40b18e817c304f9db46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
