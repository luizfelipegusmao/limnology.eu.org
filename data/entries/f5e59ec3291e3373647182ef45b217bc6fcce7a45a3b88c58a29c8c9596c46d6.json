{"title":"Common Mistakes in Managing Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0544/v1","date":1723112753000,"content":"Introduction: Errors are very common in medical practice â€”and in particular in the healthcare of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, most of them can be prevented.\nAim: To address common errors in the management of IBD. \nMethods: Our approach to the problem will consist in identifying mistakes frequently observed in clinical practice (according to our experience) in the management of patients with IBD, then reviewing the scientific evidence available on the subject, and finally proposing the most appropriate recommendation in each case. \nResults: The most common mistakes in the management of IBD include those related to diagnosis and differential diagnosis, prevention, nutrition and diet, treatment with different drugs (mainly 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, thiopurines, and anti-TNF agents), extraintestinal manifestations, anemia, the elderly patient, pregnancy, and surgery.\nConclusions: Despite the availability of guidelines for both disease management and preventive aspects of IBD care, a considerable variation in clinical practice still remains. In this review, we have identified common mistakes in the management of patients with IBD in clinical practice. There is a clear need for greater dissemination of clinical practice guidelines among gastroenterologists and for the implementation of ongoing training activities supported by scientific societies. Finally, it would be desirable following IBD patients in specialized units, which is undoubtedly associated with higher quality healthcare and a lower likelihood of errors in managing these patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5e59ec3291e3373647182ef45b217bc6fcce7a45a3b88c58a29c8c9596c46d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
