{"title":"Fermentation starters and bacteriocins as biocontrol strategies for table olives preservation: a mini‐review","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13874?af=R","date":1725874532000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Biopreservation is a powerful strategy to prolong the shelf life of food products by applying naturally occurring microorganisms and/or their metabolites. Current food trends emphasise the need to develop alternatives for chemical or thermal preservation methods. In this line, different fermentation starters from table olives present the potential to control spoilage or pathogen-occurring microorganism in table olives storage. One of the most interesting family used as biopreservative culture is <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and it has also been used in combination with yeasts as olive fermentation starter. Lactic acid bacteria, from <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> family, are characterised by the production of bacteriocins, proteins with the potential for preserving food by changing the organisation of the membrane of spoilage microorganisms. These bacteriocins-producing bacteria can be directly inoculated, although nanosystem technology is the most promising incorporation strategy. In table olives, the most commonly used starters are <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>, <i>Lactiplantibacillus pentosus</i>, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Wickerhamomyces anomalus</i>, among others. These strains with biopreservation characteristics, inoculated alone or in mixed cultures, ensure food safety by conferring the product added value and prolonging product shelf life. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Patricia Rus‐Fernández, \nAna Fuentes","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"bfbee05d423ea34ea8d9be5b1f35276ecf5c359c2dfd8c3cffd9176518e7a66b","category":"Environment"}
