This study evaluated the quality of CT and revealed the mechanism of its quality formation.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The CT had a significant citrus flavor and a good antioxidant activity, and its sensory quality was superior to that of GT. Headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC–MS) analysis revealed that the scenting process resulted in a significant increase of alkenes such as β-pinene, <i>trans</i>-β-ocimene, α-farnesene, isoterpinolene, and γ-terpinene, as well as a significant decrease of alcohols such as α-terpineol, <span>l</span>-menthol, and linalool in CT in comparison with GT. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis revealed that the levels of flavonoids (such as neohesperidin, hesperidin, tangeritin, hesperetin 5-<i>O</i>-glucoside, and nobiletin) and alkaloids (such as trigonelline and theobromine) in CT increased significantly after scenting process, while the levels of amino acids (such as valine and <span>l</span>-phenylalanine) and organic acids (such as ascorbic acid) decreased significantly.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>These observations showed that the scenting process promoted the absorption of aroma from citrus flowers by GT and the changes in its non-volatile metabolites, leading to the formation of citrus flavor quality in CT. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Hui Yang, \nLan Shen, \nYuren Li, \nShenqun Wu, \nXiaoyu Zhang, \nXiaoping Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c65de0ebf448e61216d0bb2cb9f428a34d3b368ae122980aaa31c9f37edaac93","category":"Environment"}
