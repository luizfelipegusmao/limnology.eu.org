{"title":"Limb-related sensory prediction errors and task-related performance errors facilitate human sensorimotor learning through separate mechanisms","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002703","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Anushka Oza, Adarsh Kumar, Apoorva Sharma, Pratik K. Mutha</p>\r\n\r\nThe unpredictable nature of our world can introduce a variety of errors in our actions, including sensory prediction errors (SPEs) and task performance errors (TPEs). SPEs arise when our existing internal models of limb-environment properties and interactions become miscalibrated due to changes in the environment, while TPEs occur when environmental perturbations hinder achievement of task goals. The precise mechanisms employed by the sensorimotor system to learn from such limb- and task-related errors and improve future performance are not comprehensively understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we performed a series of learning experiments wherein the location and size of a reach target were varied, the visual feedback of the motion was perturbed in different ways, and instructions were carefully manipulated. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms employed to compensate SPEs and TPEs are dissociable. Specifically, our results fail to support theories that suggest that TPEs trigger implicit refinement of reach plans or that their occurrence automatically modulates SPE-mediated learning. Rather, TPEs drive improved action selection, that is, the selection of verbally sensitive, volitional strategies that reduce future errors. Moreover, we find that exposure to SPEs is necessary and sufficient to trigger implicit recalibration. When SPE-mediated implicit learning and TPE-driven improved action selection combine, performance gains are larger. However, when actions are always successful and strategies are not employed, refinement in behavior is smaller. Flexibly weighting strategic action selection and implicit recalibration could thus be a way of controlling how much, and how quickly, we learn from errors.","author":"Anushka Oza","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"d0bf2012bb9ebdeff4df15c5c58a33aac0da9f7a6378dec1aff0bd52dbbf07be","category":"Environment"}
