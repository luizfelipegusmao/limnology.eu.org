Current manual assessments are subjective and may not take advantage of the most informative moments in embryo development. Here, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify key windows in pre-implantation human development that can be linked to embryo viability and are therefore suitable for the early grading of IVF embryos. We show how machine learning models trained at these developmental time points can be used to refine overall embryo viability assessment. Exploiting the well-known capabilities of transfer learning, we illustrate the performance of CNN models for very limited datasets, paving the way for the use on a clinic-by-clinic basis, catering for local data heterogeneity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"b58aee2d36e924febd3d5c1f8ee7538a45249283684485298f7565c8dfb462a0","category":"Environment"}
