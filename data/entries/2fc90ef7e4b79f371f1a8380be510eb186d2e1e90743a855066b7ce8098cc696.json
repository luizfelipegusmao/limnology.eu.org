{"title":"Correlation of Urinary Glyphosate Levels with Whole Blood Selenium Levels among a Representative Sample of US Adults: NHANES 2013-2018","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0570/v1","date":1718014990000,"content":"Purpose: Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), extensively utilized as herbicides worldwide, have been associated with numerous health issues. Previous experimental studies have indicated their potential to disrupt selenium homeostasis by either interfering with uptake or increasing oxidative stress. However, there is a significant research gap concerning the connection between glyphosate exposure and selenium status in epidemiological studies, particularly within nationally representative samples. \nMethods: In this study, we examined data from the 2013-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), involving 3011 participants aged 3 and above. Our main objective was to examine the connection between urinary glyphosate levels, whole blood selenium, and selenium intake. \nResults: Our analysis did not uncover an association between urinary glyphosate and selenium intake. Nevertheless, we observed a negative correlation between urinary glyphosate levels and whole blood selenium, with a ÃŸ coefficient of -1.984, S.E. = 0.639, and P = 0.003 in the final model. We also reported a notable decrease in the average concentrations of whole blood selenium as glyphosate tertiles increased, with P-values for trend of 0.033. Furthermore, the association was particularly prominent among females, non-Hispanic whites, and individuals with lower selenium intake.\n Conclusions: In this thorough examination of NHANES data, our study uncovers a possible detrimental connection between glyphosate exposure and whole blood selenium levels. These findings underscore the importance of further investigation into the health consequences of glyphosate exposure and its potential influence on selenium status, thereby raising awareness of potential implications for public health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2fc90ef7e4b79f371f1a8380be510eb186d2e1e90743a855066b7ce8098cc696","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
