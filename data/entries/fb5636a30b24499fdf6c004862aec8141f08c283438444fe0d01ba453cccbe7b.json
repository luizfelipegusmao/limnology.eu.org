{"title":"Association of IL13 polymorphisms with susceptibility to myocardial infarction: A case-control study in Chinese population","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308081","date":1722520800000,"content":"<p>by Rong Chen, Qiaoling Bao, Xiaofeng Ma</p>\r\nBackground <p>Inflammatory cytokines play a major role in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI). Although information on the importance of interleukin 13 (IL13) in human MI is limited, it has been well documented in the mouse model. Genetic variation in the IL13 gene has been associated with the structure and expression of the IL13. In the present study, we hypothesized that IL13 common genetic variants would be associated with a predisposition to the development of MI.</p> Materials and methods <p>The present study enrolled 305 MI patients and 310 matched healthy controls. Common genetic polymorphisms in the IL13 gene (rs20541, rs1881457, and rs1800925) were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP genotyping method. Plasma levels of IL13 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p> Results <p>In MI patients, minor alleles of the IL13 rs1881457 and rs1800925 polymorphisms were less common than in healthy controls [rs1881457: AC (P = 0.004, OR = 0.61), C (P = 0.001, OR = 0.66); rs1800925: CT (P = 0.006, OR = 0.59)]. Further haplotype analysis of three studied SNPs revealed a significant association with predisposition to MI. Interestingly, IL13 rs1881457 and rs1800925 were linked to plasma levels of IL13: the reference genotype had higher levels, heterozygotes were intermediate, and the alternate genotype had the lowest levels.</p> Conclusions <p>In the Chinese population, IL13 (rs1881457 and rs180092) variants are associated with different plasma IL13 levels and offer protection against MI development. However, additional research is required to validate our findings in different populations, including descent samples.</p>","author":"Rong Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fb5636a30b24499fdf6c004862aec8141f08c283438444fe0d01ba453cccbe7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
