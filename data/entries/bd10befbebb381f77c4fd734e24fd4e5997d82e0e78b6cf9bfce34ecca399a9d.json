Pesticides are widely used for agricultural activities in fields surrounding the yellow perch (<i>Perca flavescens</i>) habitat in Lake St. Pierre (Quebec, Canada), a fluvial lake of the river where the perch population has collapsed. Clothianidin and chlorantraniliprole were two of the most detected insecticides in surface waters near perch spawning areas. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the transcriptional and biochemical effects of these two pesticides on juvenile yellow perch exposed for 28d to environmental doses of each compound alone and in a mixture under laboratory/aquaria conditions. Hepatic mRNA-sequencing revealed an effect of chlorantraniliprole alone (37 genes) and combined with clothianidin (251 genes), but no effects of clothianidin alone were observed in perch. Dysregulated genes were mostly related to circadian rhythms and to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, the latter effect has been previously associated with chlorantraniliprole mode of action in insects. Moreover, chronic exposure to clothianidin increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the brain of exposed fish, suggesting a potential non-target effect of this insecticide. Further analyses of three clock genes by qRT-PCR suggested that part of the observed effects of chlorantraniliprole on the circadian gene regulation of juvenile perch could be the result of time-of-day of sacrifice. These results provide insight into biological effects of insecticides in juvenile perch and highlight the importance of considering the circadian rhythm in experimental design and results analyses.","author":"Maeva Giraudo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"bd10befbebb381f77c4fd734e24fd4e5997d82e0e78b6cf9bfce34ecca399a9d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
