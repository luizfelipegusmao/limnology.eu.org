{"title":"Leveraging Generative AI for Inclusive Online Friendship Education: Integrating Easy-to-Read Guidelines for Enhanced Accessibility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0677/v1","date":1725882691000,"content":"This study examines the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing generative AI technology to create inclusive online dating educational materials, focusing on integrating easy-to-read principles to enhance accessibility while improving efficiency and reducing the cost of material production. As online dating becomes increasingly prevalent, providing easily comprehensible safety education for special populations, such as individuals with disabilities and adolescents, is of paramount importance. This research developed an innovative AI-generated educational framework that combines easy-to-read principles with generative AI technology, aiming to enhance both the accessibility and production efficiency of educational materials. \nThe study compared three AI generation strategies: independent generation by ChatGPT, independent generation by Claude, and Claude utilizing materials generated by ChatGPT. We evaluated 36 educational units through a mixed-methods approach for readability and accessibility. Results indicate that ChatGPT performed optimally in generating easily readable content (average compliance rate of 93.00%), followed by the strategy Claude using ChatGPT-generated materials (91.67%). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences among these strategies (p &lt; 0.05). The research also found that employing AI generation technology significantly reduced material production time and costs, providing educators with a more efficient tool. \nThe findings of this study underscore the significant potential of generative AI technology in creating inclusive educational resources. This not only opens up new avenues for enhancing online safety awareness and educational accessibility for special populations but also provides material developers with more efficient, cost-effective production methods. The empirical evidence presented here for the application of AI in inclusive education is a significant step forward. The study also proposes recommendations for future research and practice, aiming to further improve the accessibility, effectiveness, and production efficiency of online dating education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3766ce7ff4c373e571f7b014c51ba24fabc02266ec60f983504304558723f01f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
