{"title":"Increased anoxia following species invasion of a eutrophic lake","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10364?af=R","date":1705151776000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Species invasions can disrupt aquatic ecosystems by re-wiring food webs. A trophic cascade triggered by the invasion of the predatory zooplankter spiny water flea (<i>Bythotrephes cederströmii</i>) resulted in increased phytoplankton due to decreased zooplankton grazing. Here, we show that increased phytoplankton biomass led to an increase in lake anoxia. The temporal and spatial extent of anoxia experienced a step change increase coincident with the invasion, and anoxic factor increased by 11 d. Post-invasion, anoxia established more quickly following spring stratification, driven by an increase in phytoplankton biomass. A shift in spring phytoplankton phenology encompassed both abundance and community composition. Diatoms (<i>Bacillaryophyta</i>) drove the increase in spring phytoplankton biomass, but not all phytoplankton community members increased, shifting the community composition. We infer that increased phytoplankton biomass increased labile organic matter and drove hypolimnetic oxygen consumption. These results demonstrate how a species invasion can shift lake phenology and biogeochemistry.</p>","author":"Robin R. Rohwer, \nRobert Ladwig, \nPaul C. Hanson, \nJake R. Walsh, \nM.
