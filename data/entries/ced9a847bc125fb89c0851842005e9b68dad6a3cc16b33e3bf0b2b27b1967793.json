{"title":"A Study of Sliding Friction Using Acoustic Emission and Wavelet-Based Energy Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1004/v1","date":1710742821000,"content":"The purpose of this work is to study the mechanism of running-in during the friction and to determine the informative parameters characterizing the degree of its completion. During the friction, contact interaction of rough surfaces causes various wave phenomena covering a wide range of frequencies, the subsequent frequency analysis can provide information about the sizes of wave sources and thereby clarify the mechanism of interaction between surface roughness. The using of the wavelet transform for processing of the signals of audible acoustic emission made it possible to determine the beginning and the end of the change in the frequency ranges of the interaction of roughness. The code developed by the authors was used to analyze the acoustic emission signals by using wavelet energy and entropy criteria. The mother wavelet was chosen by carefully evaluating the effectiveness of 54 preliminary candidates for the mother wavelet from 7 wavelet families, ac-cording to three criteria: 1) maximum wavelet energy; 2) Shannon entropy minimum; 3) maximum energy-to-Shannon entropy ratio.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ced9a847bc125fb89c0851842005e9b68dad6a3cc16b33e3bf0b2b27b1967793","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
