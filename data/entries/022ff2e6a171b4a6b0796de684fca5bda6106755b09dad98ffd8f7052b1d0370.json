{"title":"Astromineralogy of the Nearby Exoplanetary Systems I: A Comparative Analysis of the Stellar and the Averaged Solar Mg/Si and Fe/Si Molar Ratios","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0332/v1","date":1717652830000,"content":"This study was based on the corresponding elemental abundances of carbonaceous - chondrites and the Solar photospheric elemental abundances [1]. The comparative analysis between the average magnesium, silicon and iron abundances of the Solar System and the abundances of these elements in potential nearby planetary systems was based on the Mg, Si and Fe abundances of host stars, which are in the Galactic thin disk within 25 parsecs distance from the Sun. The stellar abundance data had been taken from the Hypatia Catalog, which contains high precision data of chemical elements. We show that in general there are no significant differences between the molar Mg/Si and Fe/Si ratios of the most examined stars and the corresponding elemental ratios of the Solar System. However, the comparative study also shows that a significant fraction of the nearby extrasolar terrestrial planets may have higher bulk Mg/Si ratio than Solar, but the Solar Fe/Si ratio can relatively be frequent. We conclude that the medium - sized metallic cores can relatively be common in the rocky planetary interiors, while the mantle mineralogy for most of the rocky exoplanets in the Solar neighborhood may differ from that of Earth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"022ff2e6a171b4a6b0796de684fca5bda6106755b09dad98ffd8f7052b1d0370","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
