{"title":"Limited impact of lifting universal masks on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools: The crucial role of outcome measurements","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae212/7687528?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, education systems globally implemented protective measures, notably mandatory mask wearing. As the pandemic's dynamics changed, many municipalities lifted these mandates, warranting a critical examination of these policy changes' implications. This study examines the effects of lifting mask mandates on COVID-19 transmission within Massachusetts school districts. We first replicated previous research that utilized a difference-in-difference (DID) model for COVID-19 incidence. We then repeated the DID analysis by replacing the outcome measurement with the reproductive number (<span>Rt</span>), reflecting the transmissibility. Due to the data availability, the <span>Rt</span> we estimated only measures the within school transmission. We found a similar result in the replication using incidence with an average treatment effect on treated (ATT) of 39.1 (95% CI: 20.4 to 57.4) COVID-19 cases per 1,000 students associated with lifting masking mandates. However, when replacing the outcome measurement to <span>Rt</span>, our findings suggest that no significant association between lifting mask mandates and reduced <span>Rt</span> (ATT: 0.04, 95% CI: âˆ’0.09 to 0.18), except for the first 2 weeks postintervention. Moreover, we estimated <span>Rt</span> below 1 at 4 weeks before lifting mask mandates across all school types, suggesting nonsustainable transmission before the implementation. Our reanalysis suggested no evidence of lifting mask mandates in schools impacted the COVID-19 transmission in the long term. Our study highlights the importance of examining the transmissibility outcome when evaluating interventions against transmission.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"e13a674d2a2889c4ac6c4ac0c7b1b64ce90dbea6478c14c0891e94a2223203ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
