Carroll (1991) proposed a theoretical approach that consists of four components (economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic) to analyze CSR activities and their effects on employee’s satisfaction and retention in the company. Simple random sampling was used to get the information from 221 participants. The entire form of the dataset is utilized to execute regression and correlation analysis using SPSS. In order to find out the relationship between economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic factors and employee's satisfaction and retention, regression beta coefficient and correlation coefficients were used to analyze. This study also examines the relationship between job satisfaction and intentions to retain with an organization. The findings demonstrate that the CSR aspects of ethical and philanthropic have a considerable and favorable influence on employee's satisfaction. The outcome also demonstrates a good and prominent influence of legal CSR on the satisfaction of employee's to retain with the firm. Moreover, this study demonstrates that economic aspect of CSR has no significant impact on employee's retention and satisfaction. Correlation analysis depicts that economic CSR is positively and significantly connected with employee's retention and satisfaction. This research came to the conclusion that enhancing employees view regarding CSR activities such as economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic will increase employee's satisfaction. Therefore, executives and managers in the banks should take steps to influence how employees see CSR areas in order to raise employee's satisfaction and retention in the banks for sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"897a8d166bf8b0f16e727915f09733355939c3b5cbc6ef7b9650282072b72dd5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
