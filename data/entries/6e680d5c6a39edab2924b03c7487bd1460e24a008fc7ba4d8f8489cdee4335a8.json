{"title":"A Comparative Impact Assessment of Hail Damage to Tile and Built-Up Roofing Systems: Technical Review and Field Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2020/v1","date":1721889172000,"content":"Hail causes damage to property, including roofs, automobiles, and crops, with an average annual loss of $850 million. In residential structures, tile roofing systems are common in the southern U.S. due to their resistance to hail impact and long service life. Additionally, the commercial buildings and some portions of the residential structures have low-sloped or flat roof systems.  Commercial low-slope roof systems are equally prone to hail-strike damages as steep residential roof systems. The objectives of this paper are to present a literature review, inspection protocol, and case studies on a comparative assessment of hail threshold for built-up roof (BUR) and tile roof (TR) systems. The published papers determining the hail impact assessment of different roofing systems from 1969 through 2023 were studied and analyzed. This study develops a comparative hail damage assessment table between BUR and TR systems, and the hail threshold for various built-up roof composition systems. In addition, the different failure modes and their causes, the characteristics of hail impacts, and the variables influencing the impact resistance of these roofing systems were examined using field studies. To better understand the effects, it is recommended that an intelligent model be developed to predict the hail resistance threshold of various configurations of BUR and TR systems with critical variables.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e680d5c6a39edab2924b03c7487bd1460e24a008fc7ba4d8f8489cdee4335a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
