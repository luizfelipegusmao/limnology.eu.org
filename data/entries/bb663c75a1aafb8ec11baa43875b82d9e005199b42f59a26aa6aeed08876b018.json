{"title":"Glutamate Transporter 1 as a Novel Negative Regulator of Amyloid &beta;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1982/v1","date":1724839008000,"content":"Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) dynamics are implicated in excitotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Early stages of AD are often marked by hyperactivity and increased epileptiform activity preceding cognitive decline. Previously, we identified a direct interaction between GLT-1 and Presenilin 1 (PS1) in the brain, highlighting GLT-1 as a promising target in AD research. This study reports the significance of this interaction and uncovers a novel role of GLT-1 in modulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) production. Overexpression of GLT-1 in cells reduces the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 by decreasing γ-secretase activity pertinent to APP processing and induces a more \"open\" PS1 conformation, resulting in decreased Aβ42/40 ratio. Inhibition of the GLT-1/PS1 interaction using cell-permeable peptides produced an opposing effect on Aβ, highlighting the pivotal role of this interaction in regulating Aβ levels. These findings emphasize the potential of targeting GLT-1/PS1 interaction as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb663c75a1aafb8ec11baa43875b82d9e005199b42f59a26aa6aeed08876b018","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
