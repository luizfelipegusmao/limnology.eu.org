It is imperative that today’s young people are well equipped with good quality education to better lead a country into the future.  As a consequence, it is also important that we find out the factors that affect the learning success of the youth, since knowing these factors, either positive or negative will help the government in designing programs that can help propagate the positives and rectify the negatives.
