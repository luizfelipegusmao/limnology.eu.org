{"title":"Can the delayed effects of climatic oscillations have a greater influence on global fisheries compared to their immediate effects?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307644","date":1724940000000,"content":"<p>by Sandipan Mondal, Aratrika Ray, Malagat Boas, Sawai Navus, Ming-An Lee, Subhadip Dey, Koushik Kanti Barman</p>\r\n\r\nClimatic oscillations affect fish population dynamics, ecological processes, and fishing operations in maritime habitats. This study examined how climatic oscillations affect catch rates for striped, blue, and silver marlins in the Atlantic Ocean. These oscillations are regarded as the primary factor influencing the abundance and accessibility of specific resources utilized by fishers. Logbook data were obtained from Taiwanese large-scale fishing vessels for climatic oscillations during the period 2005–2016. The results indicated that the effect of the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole on marlin catch rates did not have a lag, whereas those of the North Atlantic Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and Indian Ocean Dipole had various lags. Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to examine the correlations between atmospheric oscillation indices and marlin catch rates, and wavelet analysis was employed to describe the influences of the most relevant lags. The results indicated that annual atmospheric fluctuations and their lags affected the abundance and catchability of striped, blue, and silver marlins in the study region. This, in turn, may affect the presence of these species in the market and lead to fluctuations in their prices in accordance with supply and demand. Overall, understanding the effects of climatic oscillations on fish species are essential for policymakers and coastal communities seeking to manage marine resources, predict changes in marine ecosystems, and establish appropriate methods for controlling the effects of climate variability.","author":"Sandipan Mondal","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f426f2c3b9a99220f21776b37ea86ca6d599a37b44c878acb8f5a5f859222c6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
