{"title":"Health insurance system fragmentation and COVID-19 mortality: Evidence from Peru","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309531","date":1724767200000,"content":"<p>by Misael Anaya-Montes, Hugh Gravelle</p>\r\n\r\nPeru has a fragmented health insurance system in which most insureds can only access the providers in their insurerâ€™s network. The two largest sub-systems covered about 53% and 30% of the population at the start of the pandemic; however, some individuals have dual insurance and can thereby access both sets of providers. We use data on 24.7 million individuals who belonged to one or both sub-systems to investigate the effect of dual insurance on COVID-19 mortality. We estimate recursive bivariate probit models using the difference in the distance to the nearest hospital in the two insurance sub-systems as Instrumental Variable. The effect of dual insurance was to reduce COVID-19 mortality risk by 0.23% compared with the sample mean risk of 0.54%. This implies that the 133,128 COVID-19 deaths in the sample would have been reduced by 56,418 (95%CI: 34,894, 78,069) if all individuals in the sample had dual insurance.","author":"Misael Anaya-Montes","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"30afe470bb8b25c094a0910f6ac78db2aacd6e35c103f73cdaae28fc50782eaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
