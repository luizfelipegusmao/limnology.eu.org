Information sharing and technological integration emerge as critical enablers, facilitating real-time data exchange and collaborative decision-making. The study also identifies challenges such as organizational silos, cultural resistance, and technological constraints that impede seamless integration, highlighting the need for proactive strategies to foster cross-functional collaboration. Additionally, the evolving roles of sustainability and customer-centricity are emphasized as key drivers for differentiating brands and achieving competitive advantage. By integrating sustainable practices and adopting a customer-centric approach, organizations can build stronger customer relationships and enhance their market position. The research underscores the importance of leadership support, investment in technology, and a collaborative organizational culture in overcoming integration barriers. The studyâ€™s findings provide actionable insights for organizations aiming to optimize their SCM and marketing strategies, drive innovation, and sustain growth in an increasingly complex and competitive business environment.
