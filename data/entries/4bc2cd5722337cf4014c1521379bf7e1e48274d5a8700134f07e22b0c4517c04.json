{"title":"Role of Morphology on Zinc Oxide Nanostructures for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Activity and Hydrogen Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0427/v1","date":1725516785000,"content":"Energy generation now heavily relies on the field of photocatalysis. Many conventional research topics have been superseded by the conversion of solar energy into chemical or thermal energy for a variety of energy-related applications. The urgent necessity of moving away from non-renewable energy sources is a result of the problem of global warming. In an effort to create the best photocatalysts for effective solar conversion, scientists are investigating a variety of material systems and material combinations. By examining the influence of morphology changes on the photoelectrochemical activity of zinc oxide nanostructures, here electrodeposition was used to create the nanostructures. By using the proper capping agents, it is possible to control the growth rates of different ZnO facets and get well-defined nanostructures and orientation. In order to generate distinct ZnO morphologies, we report here the electrodeposition of ZnO nanostructured thin films in the presence of different capping agents. A zinc nitrate (Zn (NO₃)₂) bath was used to electrodeposit ZnO nanostructures on indium tin oxide glass (ITO) substrate at 70 °C with an applied potential of -1.0 V. Capping agents such as ethylenediamine (EDA) or ammonium fluoride (NH₄F) were added to this zinc nitrate bath. The photoelectrochemical capabilities of the morphology-controlled zinc oxide nanostructures were extensively evaluated and characterised. Thus various ZnO morphologies had an impact on the PEC properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4bc2cd5722337cf4014c1521379bf7e1e48274d5a8700134f07e22b0c4517c04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
