Several studies have investigated the relationship between PSD and functional outcomes, but the results have been inconsistent.</p> Objective <p>This systematic review of non-experimental studies aims to investigate the prevalence of post-stroke depression and the association between post-stroke depression and functional outcomes.</p> Method <p>A search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text was carried out from inception until January 2024. The literature was screened using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with relevant papers included. We extracted data from non-experimental studies that examined associations between PSD and functional outcomes. The Joanna Briggs Institute for systematic reviews was used for critical appraisal.</p> Results <p>Twenty-one studies met the study criteria, including sixteen cohort studies, four cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study. PSD prevalences ranged from 12.2% to 32.2% in the first two weeks, 17.9 to 35.5% in the first month, and 10.4% to 32.0% in the third month following a stroke. Functional outcomes were evaluated in four domains: degree of dependence, basic activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily living, and physical and cognitive function. Significant associations between PSD and functional outcomes were identified after controlling potential factors such as age, comorbidities, and stroke severity. PSD had negative associations with functional outcomes in all four measure domains from one month to five years after a stroke. Depression treatment showed positive results on functional outcomes in stroke patients.</p> Conclusion <p>PSD prevalence was high in the first three months after stroke. PSD is significantly associated with poor functional outcomes. PSD assessment and management should be performed on a frequent basis in the early stages of stroke to achieve the best possible functional recovery.</p>","author":"Nipaporn Butsing","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"01670e8d05fce979e51d9f00c215c1186da7f7ac6fd4fe88c4e51f429a16d426","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
