{"title":"Genetic Engineering in Bacteria, Fungi, and Oomycetes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1958/v1","date":1727247409000,"content":"Genetic engineering has revolutionized our ability to modify microorganisms for various applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. This review examines recent advances in genetic engineering techniques for bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes, with a focus on CRISPR-Cas systems. In bacteria, CRISPR-Cas9 has enabled precise genome editing, enhancing applications in antibiotic production and metabolic engineering. For fungi, despite challenges associated with their complex cell structures, CRISPR/Cas9 has advanced the production of enzymes and secondary metabolites. In oomycetes, significant plant pathogens, modified Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and CRISPR/Cas12a have contributed to developing disease-resistant crops. The review provides a comparative analysis of genetic engineering efficiencies across these microorganisms and addresses ethical and regulatory considerations. Future research directions include refining genetic tools to improve efficiency and expand applicability in non-model organisms. This comprehensive overview highlights the transformative potential of genetic engineering in microbiology and its implications for addressing global challenges in agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0fb8c1e450989089b2608a35c63a49c7f6764b10a232ad7831921c32bc20e8e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
