{"title":"Missing Links: Current Trends and Future Potential in the Application of Blockchain Oracles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0218/v1","date":1714972902000,"content":"Oracles have been suggested as a vital piece of infrastructure necessary to allow blockchain-based smart contracts to reach their full potential by interacting with real-world data. This paper begins by providing an approachable entry point to the oracle problem and the current landscape of existing solutions. From there, we provide an overview of published research to narrow down unexplored research directions and derive questions for interviews. Finally, the results of 15 unstructured expert interviews are presented and discussed. The focus here is the industry landscape of oracle projects, opportunities for innovation, and challenges needing to be overcome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a113a8859050ccd204927783ae8d7d3de6463bcd51d47c0eda0a7b35fa69f26","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
