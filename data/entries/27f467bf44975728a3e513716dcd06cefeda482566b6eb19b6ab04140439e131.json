The study aims to establish the willingness to adopt mobile phone technology to enhance adherence to ART among PLHIV.</p> Methods <p>The Researchers adopted a cross-sectional survey. Systematic sampling was employed in selecting 237 PLHIV in the HIV clinic for adults at Ido-Ekiti’s Federal Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Data collection was via a 33-item semi-structured questionnaire administered by the interviewer. Information collected via the questionnaire included details on ownership of mobile phone technology, its usage, and willingness to use it to improve adherence to HIV medication. Descriptive statistics coupled with multivariate regression was employed in analyzing data, with the level of significance at 5%.</p> Results <p>The respondent’s had a mean ±SD age of 46.6 ±10 years. Most of the participants were female (77.6%), and have been on ART for over 2years (88.2%). The vast majority of study participants 233 (98.3%) owned a mobile phone. 168 (70.9%) of them were willing to embrace mHealth interventions on medication adherence. Some of the factors influencing the respondent’s willingness to receive the intervention were older age (OR = 0.05, 95%Cl:[0.01–0.24]), having formal education (OR = 7.12, 95%Cl:[3.01–16.53]), being diagnosed over 10years ago (OR = 15.63, 95%Cl:[3.02–80.83]) and previous use of phone to send text messages, record video, access the internet, send email and search the internet for health-related information (OR = 2.2, 95%Cl:[1.2–3.9]; OR = 1.8, 95%Cl:[1.0–3.2]; OR = 2.5, 95%Cl:[1.4–4.7]; OR = 2.7, 95%Cl:[1.2–5.5] and OR = 2.0, 95%Cl:[1.0–3.8]) respectively.</p> Conclusion <p>Many of the PLHIV had a cellphone and expressed willingness on their part to use it in receiving reminders to take their medication. Older age, formal education and internet users were significantly more willing to get reminders to take their medication.</p>","author":"John Olujide Ojo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"27f467bf44975728a3e513716dcd06cefeda482566b6eb19b6ab04140439e131","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
