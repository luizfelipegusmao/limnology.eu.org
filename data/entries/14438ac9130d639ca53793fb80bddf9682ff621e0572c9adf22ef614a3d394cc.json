Proteins with redox-sensitive cysteines can sense oxidative stress and modulate their functions. Recent proteomics efforts have comprehensively mapped the proteins targeted by oxidative modifications. The nucleus, the epicentre of transcriptional reprogramming, contains a large number of proteins that control gene expression. Specific redox-sensitive transcription factors have long been recognized as key players in decoding redox signals in the nucleus and thus in regulating transcriptional responses. Consequently, the redox regulation of the nuclear transcription machinery and its cofactors has received less attention. In this review, we screened proteomic datasets for redox-sensitive cysteines on proteins of the core transcription complexes and chromatin modifiers in <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>. Our analysis indicates that redox regulation affects every step of gene transcription, from initiation to elongation and termination. We report previously undescribed redox-sensitive subunits in transcription complexes and discuss the emerging challenges in unravelling the landscape of redox-regulated processes involved in nuclear gene transcription.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"14438ac9130d639ca53793fb80bddf9682ff621e0572c9adf22ef614a3d394cc","category":"Environment"}
