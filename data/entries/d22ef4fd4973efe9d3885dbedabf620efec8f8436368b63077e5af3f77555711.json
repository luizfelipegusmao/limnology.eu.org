{"title":"Spin(8, C)-Higgs Bundles and the Hitchin Integrable System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1678/v1","date":1727142560000,"content":"Let $\\mathcal{M}(\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C}))$ be the moduli space of $\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g\\geq 2$. The triality automorphism of $\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C})$ acts on $\\mathcal{M}(\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C}))$ and those Higgs bundles that admit a reduction of structure group to $G_2$ are fixed points of this action. This defines a map of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles $\\mathcal{M}(G_2)\\rightarrow\\mathcal{M}(\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C}))$. In this work, the action of the triality automorphism is extended to an action on the Hitchin integrable system associated to $\\mathcal{M}(\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C}))$. In particular, it is checked that the map $\\mathcal{M}(G_2)\\rightarrow\\mathcal{M}(\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C}))$ restricts to a map at the level of Prym varieties. Necessary and sufficient conditions are also provided for the Prym varieties associated with the moduli spaces of $G_2$ and $\\Spin(8,\\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles to be disconnected. Finally, some consequences are drawn from the above results in relation to the geometry of the Prym varieties involved.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d22ef4fd4973efe9d3885dbedabf620efec8f8436368b63077e5af3f77555711","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
