{"title":"Limits of Axial Resolution in Volume Electron Microscopy of Cells and Tissues","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.490/7719661?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Volume electron microscopy has become an important set of techniques for determining the nanoscale 3D ultrastructure of cells and biological tissues prepared by heavy atom staining and embedding in epon or other plastic materials. In the focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), thin layers of material are successively removed from the surface of the specimen block by Ga ion abrasion and the surface layer is imaged with the backscattered electron signal [<a href=\"#ozae044.490-B1\">1-3</a>]. Experience has shown that 5-10 nm spatial resolution is achievable using FIB-SEM, and the resolution is approximately isotropic parallel and perpendicular to the block-face. Images are typically acquired with primary electron beam energies of ∼1.5 keV, and a fluence of ∼600 electrons/nm<sup>2</sup>, producing images of higher quality than can be achieved with the alternative 3D volume EM method of serial block face (SBF)-SEM. Figure 1 illustrates the 3D ultrastructure seen with FIB-SEM from a specimen of isolated blood platelets prepared using the protocol developed by Deerinck et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.490-B4\">4</a>]. Slices through the 3D volume, parallel to the block-face (x-y) and perpendicular to the block-face (x-z), reveal similar resolution in the two orthogonal planes (estimated as 5-10 nm), from which the subcellular ultrastructure of blood platelets can be visualized and segmented, including alpha granules, mitochondria, and canalicular system [<a href=\"#ozae044.490-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"869eb3908beb45fc1c064a94ca53aa543511a6e4c5149a130a416a05c39237b0","category":"Environment"}
