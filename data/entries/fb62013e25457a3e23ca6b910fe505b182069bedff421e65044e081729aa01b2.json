The participants were 20 adults (aged 42–79 years) who were involved in community-based activities for dementia prevention held by a certain organization. The participants were assigned randomly to the intervention (SoroTouch) group or control group. The SoroTouch group received home-based cognitive training with SoroTouch, being asked to use the software every day for 6 months, while the control group did not receive any intervention. To investigate the effect of SoroTouch, CogEvo, a cognitive functions test battery utilizing a tablet device, was administered to all participants once per month during the 6-month intervention period. In addition, before and after the intervention, all participants were asked to take the CogEvo and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). The analyses showed that the SoroTouch group did not improve total scores of the CogEvo and MoCA-J, but large group differences were observed in the two tasks of the CogEvo as follows: ‘Follow the order’ (modified Trail Making Test) at 2 months after the beginning of the intervention (group differences; 39.4, 95% confidence interval; 7.6–71.2) and ‘Route 99’ at 6 months (group differences; 39.6, 95% confidence interval; 4.9–74.4). These results provide evidence that a home-based computerized cognitive training program SoroTouch has the potential to improve working memory, attention and planning in healthy middle-aged and older adults.","author":"Tetsuya Takaoka","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fb62013e25457a3e23ca6b910fe505b182069bedff421e65044e081729aa01b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
