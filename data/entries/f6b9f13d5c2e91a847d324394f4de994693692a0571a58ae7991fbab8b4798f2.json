Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for species detection, and quantitative metabarcoding methods have recently been developed to enable quantitative assessment of biodiversity. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the current invasive distribution and magnitude of Korean perch, <em>Coreoperca herzi</em>, which invaded Japan’s Oyodo River system in 2017, and to assess its impact on fish species using quantitative eDNA metabarcoding. The eDNA survey was carried out at 55 sites, including known invaded sites. Consequently, <em>C. herzi</em>’s eDNA was detected and quantified at 39 sites (71%), indicating its high dispersal and colonization capacity. Furthermore, community analysis revealed that <em>C. herzi</em> invasions can alter fish community structure, posing a significant threat to native ecosystems. For nine out of 21 detected fish species, their eDNA concentrations declined to depend on the eDNA concentration of <em>C. herzi</em>, suggesting the substantial magnitude of the threat of this species to the Japanese ecosystem. Stomach content surveys also supported this, revealing that several species such as <em>Pseudogobio esocinus</em> were actually preyed upon by <em>C. herzi</em>. This study underscores the high invasiveness of <em>C. herzi</em> and demonstrates for the first time the utility of quantitative metabarcoding methods for the rapid assessment of invasion fronts and biological impacts of invasive species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"f6b9f13d5c2e91a847d324394f4de994693692a0571a58ae7991fbab8b4798f2","category":"Environment"}
