{"title":"Analysis of the Polyculture Model of Scapharca broughtonii and Scallop Chlamys farreri in Shallow Sea Suspension Cages","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1467/v1","date":1724229894000,"content":"The study examines the survival status of Scapharca broughtonii and Scallop Chlamys farreri under diverse seasons, sizes, and mixed breeding ratios. The objective is to explore the feasibility and economic benefits of the mixed breeding patterns of different shellfish varieties. The findings demonstrate that the overwintering mortality rate of mixed-cultured S.broughtonii ranges from 12.04% to 16.85%, which is conspicuously lower than that of individually cultured S.broughtonii. The summer mortality rate of mixed-cultured S.broughtonii with a size of 2.5 - 4.0 cm is significantly lower than that of individually cultured S.broughtonii (P &lt; 0.05). There is no notable difference in the mortality between monoculture and polyculture of C.farreri. There is no significant disparity in the growth of C.farreri and S.broughtonii in monoculture and polyculture. The optimal polyculture size of the two scallops is 2.5 cm, and the ideal polyculture ratio is 1:1. The co-culture model of S.broughtonii and C.farreri in suspension cages has a high input-output ratio (1:1.9). It can effectively lower the winter and summer mortality rates of ark clams, representing an efficacious new methodology for marine shellfish farming.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa5e8c712cd6dbfbbaec3276bc778924c3e756eef4397d23baf2d5a539f49861","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
