{"title":"Enhancement of protein, lipid and fatty acids in copepod, Oithona rigida for the improvement of growth, development and survival of early‐stage mud crab larvae (Scylla olivacea)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16089?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The copepod <i>Oithona rigida</i> can be used as a natural feed in rearing larvae of the mud crab <i>Syclla olivacea</i>. However, copepod is not readily obtainable due to their characteristics as seasonal zooplankton, causing limitation in using copepods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutrient transfer of enriched <i>O. rigida</i> in improving the growth development and survival of early-stage mud crab (<i>Scylla olivacea</i>). The effects of different feeding regimes on the survival and development of <i>S. olivacea</i> larvae were studied in two phases of the crab larval development: Phase 1 (zoea 1 to zoea 2 stage) and Phase 2 (zoea 5 to megalopa stage). The feeding regimes were T1: <i>O. rigida</i> enriched with rice bran, T2: <i>O. rigida</i> enriched with <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i>, T3: <i>O. rigida</i> enriched with a mixture of rice bran and <i>N. oceanica</i>, and T4: <i>Artemia</i>. The results showed that rice bran (66.83 ± 2.25% protein and 21.98 ± 1.41% lipid) and <i>N. oceanica</i> (72.08 ± 2.02% protein and 18.09 ± 1.18% lipid) additives produced the best outcomes in terms of protein content and lipid content of <i>O. rigida</i>. A mixture of rice bran and <i>N. oceanica</i> (41.62%) as enrichment also improved the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content of <i>O. rigida</i> as compared with a mono diet applied such as rice bran (28.16%) and <i>N. oceanica</i> (31.35%). The average survival rate of <i>S. olivacea</i> from zoea 1 until megalopa shows that T3 (20.20 ± 1.97%) was higher than T1 (13.87 ± 0.90%), T2 (12.47 ± 1.14%) or T4 (3.13 ± 1.29%). In conclusion, improving the survival rate of crab larvae in commercial hatcheries by using precise early-stage foods is fundamental to enhancing the seed production technology of mud crabs.</p>","author":"Amirah Yuslan, \nMazlan A.
