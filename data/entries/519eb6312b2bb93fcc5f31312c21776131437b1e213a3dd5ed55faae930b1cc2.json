{"title":"Urban and Rural Planning Combined with Environmental Remote Sensing Technology for Planning and Design of Ecological City","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2090/v1","date":1721914458000,"content":"Ecological city is currently a hot topic in urban planning research. How to balance urban development and ecological environment protection has become a focus and difficulty of research. Traditional urban planning is mainly based on experience, but its disadvantage is that it is easy to overlook key geographical factors such as terrain and vegetation, and cannot fully reflect the actual spatial characteristics of the city. Therefore, this article applied the combination of urban and rural planning and environmental remote sensing technology to urban planning and design, obtaining a massive amount of data. Through the actual analysis of Langfang, this paper monitored the vegetation, water, land and landscape data of Langfang through environmental remote sensing technology. By using these data to identify existing problems, this article proposed reasonable planning for the problems, in order to achieve the effective goal of ecological city planning and design. It provided a more accurate analysis of urban structure, including urban planning and urban ecological landscape planning. Among them, ecological landscape planning includes renovating ecological embankments, protecting ecological green belts around the city, and creating characteristic landscape areas, thereby providing more scientific basis for urban planning and design, making urban planning and design more reasonable and scientific. This paper investigated the planned Langfang City, and the average errors of vegetation, soil, water quality, and landscape data obtained from traditional field surveys were 0.35, 0.33, 0.34, and 0.31, respectively. The average errors of remote sensing technology in obtaining vegetation, soil, water quality, and landscape data were 0.16, 0.15, 0.17, and 0.15, respectively. The total suspended solids content of waterscape 1-10 before planning was 5.51mg/L and 7.41mg/L, respectively. After planning, the total suspended solids content of waterscape 1-10 was 3.60mg/L and 4.47mg/L, respectively. From this, it can be seen that the error in obtaining data after planning has decreased, and the total suspended solids content has also decreased.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"519eb6312b2bb93fcc5f31312c21776131437b1e213a3dd5ed55faae930b1cc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
