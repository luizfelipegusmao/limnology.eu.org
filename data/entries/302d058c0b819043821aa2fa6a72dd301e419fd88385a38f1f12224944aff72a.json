{"title":"Sustained Cognitive Improvement in Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Patients Following a Precision Medicine Protocol: Case Series","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1730/v1","date":1714283456000,"content":"Arguably the most important parameter in treating cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s disease is the length of time in which improvement, if achieved at all, is sustained. However, monotherapies such as donepezil and memantine are associated with a more rapid decline than no treatment in patients over multi-year follow-ups {Kennedy, 2018 #535}. Furthermore, anti-amyloid antibody treatment, which at best simply slows decline, is associated with accelerated cerebral atrophy [2], resulting in earlier dementia-associated brain volumes for those treated at the MCI stage than untreated patients. In contrast, a precision medicine approach, in which the multiple potential drivers of cognitive decline are identified for each patient and then targeted with a personalized protocol (such as ReCODE), has led to documented improvement in patients with cognitive decline [3]; [4]; [5], but long-term follow-up (&gt;5 years) has not been reported previously. Therefore, we report here sustained cognitive improvement, in some cases for over a decade, in patients treated with a precision medicine protocol—something that has not been reported in patients treated with anti-cholinesterase, glutamate receptor inhibitory, anti-amyloid, or other therapeutic methods. These case studies warrant long-term cohort studies to determine how frequently such sustained cognitive improvements occur in patients treated with precision medicine protocols.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"302d058c0b819043821aa2fa6a72dd301e419fd88385a38f1f12224944aff72a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
