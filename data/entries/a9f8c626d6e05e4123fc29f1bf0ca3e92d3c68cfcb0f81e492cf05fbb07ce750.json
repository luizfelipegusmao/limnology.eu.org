{"title":"SerpinB3: A Multifaceted Player in Health and Disease â€“ Review and Future Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0851/v1","date":1718195670000,"content":"SerpinB3, a member of the serine-protease inhibitor family, has emerged as a crucial player in various physiological and pathological processes. Initially identified as an oncogenic factor in squamous cell carcinomas, SerpinB3's intricate involvement extends from fibrosis progression and cancer to cell protection in acute oxidative stress conditions. This review explores the multi-faceted roles of SerpinB3, focusing on its implications in fibrosis, metabolic syndrome, carcino-genesis, and immune system impairment. Furthermore, its involvement in tissue protection from oxidative stress and wound healing underscores its potential as diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Recent studies have described the therapeutic potential of targeting SerpinB3 through its upstream regulators, offering novel strategies for cancer treatment development. Overall, this review underscores the importance of further research to fully elucidate the mechanisms of ac-tion of SerpinB3 and to exploit its therapeutic potential across various medical conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a9f8c626d6e05e4123fc29f1bf0ca3e92d3c68cfcb0f81e492cf05fbb07ce750","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
