{"title":"Efficacy of KeraVio with Irradiation via Violet Light-Emitting Glasses without the Administration of Riboflavin Drops for Progressive Keratoconus Treatment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0193/v1","date":1727945113000,"content":"KeraVio is a new portable corneal cross-linking (CXL) treatment modality in which violet light (VL)-emitting spectacles are used along with topical transepithelial riboflavin. We preliminarily identified endogenous riboflavin in the human cornea without the administration of riboflavin drops, and the relatively low intensity of VL irradiation increased corneal stiffness in porcine corneas (TVST 2021). This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical results of KeraVio without riboflavin drops. Patients with progressive keratoconus were enrolled and randomly divided into the VL irradiation alone group (Group 1) and the no irradiation group (Group 2; control group) (jRCTs032190267). The eyes were exposed to VL (375 nm, irradiance 310 μW/cm2)-emitting glasses for 4.5 hours daily for 6 months. The mean changes in the maximum keratometry value (Kmax) from baseline to 6 months were 0.94 ± 2.65 diopters (D) and 1.76 ± 2.75 D in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively (p=0.705). No differences were found between patients who did and did not receive VL irradiation in terms of the clinical outcomes of keratoconus. VL irradiation alone likely does not halt keratoconic progression, and the administration of riboflavin is necessary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"87601eb8234aac2a1419f486d3ad55d732b2bdaa1d95f417c98186d688addee6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
