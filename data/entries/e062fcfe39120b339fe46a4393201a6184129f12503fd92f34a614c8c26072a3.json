Stimulating the Growth of Alfalfa under Cadmium Stress","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1134/S1062359024607444","date":1727740800000,"content":"<span>\n                      <h3>Abstract</h3>\n                      <p>Three bacteria strains of <em>Pseudomonas</em> sp. resistant to heavy metals were isolated from chemically contaminated soil. An analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA and <em>rpoD</em> genes identified the <em>Pseudomonas</em> sp. 17 НМ strain as <em>Pseudomonas capeferrum,</em> and the strains of <em>Pseudomonas</em> sp. 65 НМ and 67 НМ were most closely related to the type strains of <em>Pseudomonas silesiensis</em> and <em>Pseudomonas umsongensis</em>, respectively. It was shown that the strains of <em>Pseudomonas</em> sp. 17 НМ, 65 НМ, and 67 НМ were characterized by different levels of resistance to heavy metals, with the maximum tolerable concentration (MTC) of zinc being 1 mМ for all strains, that of cadmium, 1, 1.5, and 1 mМ; of lead, 5, 5, and 4 mМ; and of nickel, 7, 9, and 7 mМ, respectively. All <em>Pseudomonas</em> strains can form biofilms and have the properties of PGPR bacteria. Treatment of alfalfa seeds (<em>Medicago sativa</em> L.) with the strains of <em>Pseudomonas</em> sp. 17 НМ, 65 НМ, and 67 НМ under cadmium stress increased the dry weight of alfalfa seedlings up to 40% and the content of chlorophyll <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in the leaves by 25–33% relative to the control.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e062fcfe39120b339fe46a4393201a6184129f12503fd92f34a614c8c26072a3","category":"Environment"}
