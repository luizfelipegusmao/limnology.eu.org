{"title":"Secret Weapon of Insects: The Oral Secretion Cocktail and Its Modulation of Host Immunity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/8/1213/7693881?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><strong>Plants and insects have co-existed for almost 400 million years and their interactions can be beneficial or harmful, thus reflecting their intricate co-evolutionary dynamics. Many herbivorous arthropods cause tremendous crop loss, impacting the agro-economy worldwide. Plants possess an arsenal of chemical defenses that comprise diverse secondary metabolites that help protect against harmful herbivorous arthropods. In response, the strategies that herbivores use to cope with plant defenses can be behavioral, or molecular and/or biochemical of which salivary secretions are a key determinant. Insect salivary secretions/oral secretions (OSs) play a crucial role in plant immunity as they contain several biologically active elicitors and effector proteins that modulate plantsâ€™ defense responses. Using this oral secretion cocktail, insects overcome plant natural defenses to allow successful feeding. However, a lack of knowledge of the nature of the signals present in oral secretion cocktails has resulted in reduced mechanistic knowledge of their cellular perception. In this review, we discuss the latest knowledge on herbivore oral secretion derived elicitors and effectors and various mechanisms involved in plant defense modulation. Identification of novel herbivore-released molecules and their plant targets should pave the way for understanding the intricate strategies employed by both herbivorous arthropods and plants in their interactions</strong>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"ec9079d1cb97fa64bf5396cb03d9f68a9218be80d7c1c19ecdfb20d3bebaff87","category":"Environment"}
