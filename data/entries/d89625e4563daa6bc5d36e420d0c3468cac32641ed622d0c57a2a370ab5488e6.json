A major obstacle for microscopy however has been the decoupling of specimen tilt, dynamical diffraction and channeling artifacts from the desired magnetic dipole signal. 4D-STEM and electron ptychography providing a more diverse range of input signals, increasing the options for recognizing and resolving these phenomena. Key to all these measurements is a high-speed, high-dynamic-range pixelated detector. Our latest detector design, the EMPAD-G2, allows us to measure a full diffraction pattern with over 4 nA in the incident beam, resulting in high signal-to-noise diffraction patterns recorded at rate of 10,000 frames/second. This makes it possible to record small maps at live/almost live speeds [<a href=\"#ozae044.495-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d89625e4563daa6bc5d36e420d0c3468cac32641ed622d0c57a2a370ab5488e6","category":"Environment"}
