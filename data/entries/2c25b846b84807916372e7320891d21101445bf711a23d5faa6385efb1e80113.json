{"title":"Identification and Verification of the Blue Pigment in the Edible Jellyfish (Rhopilema esculentum)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/2994722?af=R","date":1702281600000,"content":"<p><i>Rhopilema esculentum</i> is widely cultured in Chinese coastal regions and has thousand years of consumption history in China. Despite <i>R. esculentum</i> owns multiple colors (mainly ochre and blue) in aquaculture ponds, little is known about the pigments and color formation. This study identified and verified the blue pigment of <i>R. esculentum</i>. Results showed that the blue pigment of <i>R. esculentum</i> has 262 amino acids with 54.96% identity to the blue pigment protein precursor of <i>Rhizostoma pulmo</i>. The blue pigment of <i>R. esculentum</i> has Kringle and Frizzled domains, which is in accordance with rhizostomins characteristics. Compared to ochre <i>R. esculentum</i>, the expression level of blue pigment increased 3.49-fold in blue <i>R. esculentum</i>. In addition, overexpression of the blue pigment in <i>Rhodosporidium toruloides</i> made transformant cells blue under blue light excitation. Our findings provide knowledge for the blue color formation of <i>R. esculentum</i> and will benefit the color selection of <i>R. esculentum</i> with excellent traits.</p>","author":"Bailing Chen, \nYulong Li, \nQidou Gao, \nYunfeng Li, \nXiangbo Bao, \nJie Zheng, \nZunchun Zhou, \nZhitao Qi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"2c25b846b84807916372e7320891d21101445bf711a23d5faa6385efb1e80113","category":"Environment"}
