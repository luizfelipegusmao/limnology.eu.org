{"title":"The Holographic Principle Comes from Finiteness of the Universe&rsquo;s Geometry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0491/v1","date":1720577215000,"content":"Discovered as an apparent pattern, a universal relation between geometry and information called the holographic principle has yet to be explained. This relation is unfolded in the present paper. As it is demonstrated there, the origin of the holographic principle lies in the fact that a geometry of physical space has only a finite number of points. Furthermore, it is shown that the puzzlement of the holographic principle can be explained by a magnification of grid cells used to discretize geometrical magnitudes such as areas and volumes into sets of points. To wit, when grid cells of the Planck scale are projected from the surface of the observable universe into its interior, they become enlarged. For that reason, the space inside the observable universe is described by the set of points whose cardinality is equal to the number of points that constitute the universeâ€™s surface.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"926ee9e5de96264bac3bf8878aed471419013919dd6afe309c4a7f49f7b63007","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
