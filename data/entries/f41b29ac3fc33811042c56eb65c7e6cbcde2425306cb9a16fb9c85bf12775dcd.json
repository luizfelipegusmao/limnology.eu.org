For shoulder diameter, roots are sorted into six classes and those in the small (19.1–44.5 mm) and small/medium (44.6–40.8 mm) classes are considered suitable. Smaller (≤19 mm) roots are usually lost in harvesting while larger (≥40.9 mm) roots are typically discarded. Exogenous (foliar-applied) gibberellic acid 3 (GA<sub>3</sub>) may alter source-sink carbohydrate partitioning with potential advantages for processing table beet producers. Small plot replicated trials were conducted in each of 3 years (2020, 2021 and 2022) to evaluate the effect and optimal timing of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> on table beet yield components in New York, USA. GA<sub>3</sub> was applied as ProGibb at 30 ppm in all trials and as ProGibb at 30 ppm and FalGro 2X LV at 67 ppm (label rates) in 2022. GA<sub>3</sub> as ProGibb resulted in significant increases in foliar health attributes (leaf blade length and width, petiole diameter, normalized difference vegetative index and dry weight of foliage). GA<sub>3</sub> as ProGibb significantly reduced average root shoulder diameter and affected the percentage of roots in various size categories. The percentage of tiny roots (&lt;19 mm) was significantly decreased while the percentage of small roots was increased. The percentage of small/medium roots were unaffected. In 2022, the percentage of small roots was significantly increased compared to nontreated plots but was not significantly different between GA<sub>3</sub> as either ProGibb or FalGro applied at 42 or 62 Days after Planting (DAP). Exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> had no consistent, significant effect on the severity of the foliar disease, Cercospora leaf spot. The significant increase in foliar health attributes from GA<sub>3</sub> is beneficial for harvest that relies upon top pulling machinery. Increases in the percentage of small roots and reductions in tiny roots can reduce wasted crop input investments. The optimal number of GA<sub>3</sub> applications was seasonally dependent, ranging from a single application at 40 or 62 DAP in 2 years, to two applications in 2021. GA<sub>3</sub> applications late (&gt;80 DAP) in the cropping season had no significant effect on foliar health attributes or root yield components. The implications of these results on the New York table beet processing industry are discussed.</p>","author":"Sarah J. Pethybridge, \nSean Murphy, \nEric Branch, \nPratibha Sharma, \nJulie R.
