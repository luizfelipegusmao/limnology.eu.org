{"title":"A Single Dose Intraperitoneal Injection of P. gingivalis Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) Stimulated Expressions of Neuroinflammatory Markers and Histopathological Changes in the Brain of Adult Zebrafish","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1703/v1","date":1724560708000,"content":"Porphyromonas gingivalis is the major pathogenic bacteria found in the subgingival plaque of patients with periodontitis, leading to neuroinflammation. The bacteria destroy periodontal tissue through its virulence factors which are retained in the bacteria’s outer membrane vesicles (OMV).  The purpose of this study was to determine the real time effect of intraperitoneal in-jection of P. gingivalis OMV on the production and expression of inflammatory markers as well as histopathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS) of adult zebrafish. Fol-lowing the LD50 (21 µg of OMV), the zebrafish were injected intraperitoneally with 18 µg of OMV and control group with normal saline at 7 different time points. Brains of experimental zebrafish were dissected at desired time points for colorimetric assays, ELISA and   histology. This study discovered that nitric oxide and PGE2 were significantly increased at 45 minutes while IL-1β and IL-6 were expressed at subsequent 12- and 24-hours. respectively. Histopatho-logical changes such as blood coagulation, astrocytosis, oedema, spongiosis, and necrosis were also observed between 6- and 24-hours.  The two apoptotic enzymes, caspases 3 and 9 were not expressed at any time point. In summary, the OMV induced neuroinflammatory responses and histopathological changes in adult zebrafish were time point dependent","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"316974e8136b849b85bb4f30dfd4434642ff0d95d6dcf94019944d72e75e850a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
