The complexity of self-assembly processes still seems challenging due to limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and demands innovative instrumental and experimental techniques to fully discover the mechanisms and kinetics driving each intermediate and final phase through each stage of assembly. However, no single characterization technique alone can provide insight into the entire crystallization and functionalization process. In this context, a correlative study incorporating photon-, X-ray-, and electron-based imaging and spectroscopy methods is required to achieve a comprehensive understanding covering all steps and phase transitions involved in the synthesis process [<a href=\"#ozae044.244-B3\">3</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"732caa7d6f617937b4bed8a2a819c0bc002dc85fcacb0c55d35dc1aa2b1d74fc","category":"Environment"}
