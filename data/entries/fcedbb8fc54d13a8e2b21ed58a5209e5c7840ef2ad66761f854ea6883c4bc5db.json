{"title":"Validity and Reliability of the GAITWell&reg;: A Portable Modular System for Gait Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1386/v2","date":1728987058000,"content":"Background: Gait analysis systems are crucial for rehabilitation but are often time-consuming and less accessible in low and middle-income countries like Brazil. GAITWell® was developed to address these challenges with its modular and portable design for automated gait data extraction and analysis. This study evaluates its methodological properties. Methods: GAITWell® uses discrete binary sensors on interconnected plates to collect gait data, analyzed via the DBSCAN algorithm. Each plate measures 44 cm x 37 cm and features an 11 x 7 discrete sensor array with 4 cm spacing. Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of the mean (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots. Concurrent validity was evaluated by comparing the GAITWell® measurements with those obtained from the Qualisys Pro-Reflex through correlations. Results: Participated 38 healthy young adults, including 18 females (47.4%). The sample had an average age of 33.2 years (SD 13.0) and an average BMI of 26.6 kg/m² (SD 5.4). Correlations between GAITWell® and Qualisys ranged from moderate to very high for most gait variables, except stride length (r = .360, p &lt; .05). ICC2,1 showed moderate to good agreement for most variables, except for double support times, cadence, and base of support. Preliminary analysis suggests that increasing the sensor resolution to 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm could potentially decrease the measurement error from 2 cm to 0.6 cm, representing a theoretical reduction of 70%. Conclusions: While low resolution affected GAITWell® reliability, it remains a promising tool. Future research should focus on enhancing sensor accuracy to improve reliability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fcedbb8fc54d13a8e2b21ed58a5209e5c7840ef2ad66761f854ea6883c4bc5db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
