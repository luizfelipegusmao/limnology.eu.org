{"title":"Redesigning of Flexible Learning Itinerary Configurator (FLIC) for the Design of Learning Situations in Compulsory Education (FLIC-IPAFLEX)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2280/v1","date":1727581764000,"content":"This paper presents the redesign process of FLIC, a web application developed for creating personal learning pathways in higher education, now adapted for primary and secondary education as FLIC-IPAFLEX. This redesign addresses the need to personalise learning through flexible pathways and supports teachers in designing learning situations (LS) in accordance with the criteria established by the new Education Law (LOMLOE). The SCRUM model, integrated into Design-Based Research (DBR), was employed, implementing several iterative cycles involving teachers to validate the tool's utility. The platform facilitates the creation, publication, and reuse of LS by enabling the filtering of competencies, evaluation criteria, and basic knowledge, as well as integrating with Google Classroom, an application widely used by teachers. The results show a positive user evaluation, highlighting its ease of use and capacity to foster collaboration among teachers, thereby promoting the co-design of flexible and adaptive LS. FLIC-IPAFLEX aims to contribute to the field of learning design technologies, aligning with the demands of compulsory education and supporting collaborative processes within the educational environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b581078c611bf323192f163cd33ce54ea878debc8566442fa03f8865f94bb493","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
