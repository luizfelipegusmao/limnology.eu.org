{"title":"Physiology, gene expression, and epiphenotype of two Dianthus broteri polyploid cytotypes under temperature stress","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1601/7439902?rss=1","date":1700524800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Increasing evidence supports a major role for abiotic stress response in the success of plant polyploids, which usually thrive in harsh environments. However, understanding the ecophysiology of polyploids is challenging due to interactions between genome doubling and natural selection. Here, we investigated physiological responses, gene expression, and the epiphenotype of two related <span>Dianthus broteri</span> cytotypes—with different genome duplications (4× and 12×) and evolutionary trajectories—to short extreme temperature events (42/28 °C and 9/5 °C). The 12× cytotype showed higher expression of stress-responsive genes (<span>SWEET1</span>, <span>PP2C16</span>, <span>AI5L3</span>, and <span>ATHB7</span>) and enhanced gas exchange compared with 4×. Under heat stress, both ploidies had greatly impaired physiological performance and altered gene expression, with reduced cytosine methylation. However, the 12× cytotype exhibited remarkable physiological tolerance (maintaining gas exchange and water status via greater photochemical integrity and probably enhanced water storage) while down-regulating <span>PP2C16</span> expression. Conversely, 4× <span>D. broteri</span> was susceptible to thermal stress despite prioritizing water conservation, showing signs of non-stomatal photosynthetic limitations and irreversible photochemical damage. This cytotype also presented gene-specific expression patterns under heat, up-regulating <span>ATHB7</span>. These findings provide insights into divergent stress response strategies and physiological resistance resulting from polyploidy, highlighting its widespread influence on plant function.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"219c12d8ae5b68c7fe49acb051ad50636c6c58857b91d1197901b0c7d8171bfc","category":"Environment"}
