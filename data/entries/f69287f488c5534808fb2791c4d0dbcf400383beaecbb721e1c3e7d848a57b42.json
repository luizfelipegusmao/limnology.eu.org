{"title":"WOX11-mediated plant resilience: nematodes cut and adventitious lateral roots surge","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/273/7601782?rss=1","date":1707177600000,"content":"<span>Plant survival and performance heavily rely on the postembryonic development of the root system. Roots secure anchorage to the soil, facilitate water and nutrient absorption, and engage in all kinds of interactions with the rhizosphere. Seed plants have developed the ability to dynamically adjust their root architecture to cope with fluctuating soil conditions (<a href=\"#kiae065-B5\">Morales-Herrera et al. 2023</a>). This plasticity is achieved by remodeling the growth of the primary root and the development of secondary roots.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"f69287f488c5534808fb2791c4d0dbcf400383beaecbb721e1c3e7d848a57b42","category":"Environment"}
