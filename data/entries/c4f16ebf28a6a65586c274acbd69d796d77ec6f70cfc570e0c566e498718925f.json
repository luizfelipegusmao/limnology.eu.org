{"title":"Evaluating Traffic Efficiency and Safety of Mixed Human-driven and Connected Automated Vehicles for the Freeway Hard Shoulder Running Strategy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1004/v1","date":1728879545000,"content":"Most existing the freeway hard shoulder running (HSR) strategy literature only focuses on the traffic flow with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) but neglects the possible impacts of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) with various penetration rates on the macroscopic traffic flow. The purpose of this paper is to detect whether the effects of mixed traffic flow for the freeway HSR strategy differ the traditional traffic flow or not. An approach based on microscopic simulation with factorial experimental design is adopted in this study, and novel results are obtained from the discussion and statistical analyses of simulation results. The results showed that the penetration rates of CAVs have a positive influence both on the traffic efficiency and safety on freeway HSR regardless of the prevailing traffic flow conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of the HSR strategy has the potential to markedly enhance traffic efficiency across a range of varying traffic demands. However, different speed limits for the HSR can lead to varying degrees of efficiency improvement under different traffic demands. Finally, we find a complex interplay between traffic flow conditions and the impact of HSR on TTC values and overall traffic safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4f16ebf28a6a65586c274acbd69d796d77ec6f70cfc570e0c566e498718925f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
