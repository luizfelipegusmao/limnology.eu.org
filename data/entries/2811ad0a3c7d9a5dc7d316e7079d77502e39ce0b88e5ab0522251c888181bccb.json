{"title":"Supplier Relationship Management in the Age of Digital Transformation: Insights from E-commerce Businesses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1099/v1","date":1721031265000,"content":"This qualitative study explores Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) in the context of digital transformation within e-commerce businesses, focusing on the implications of emerging digital technologies. Through semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis, the study examines how organizations leverage technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance SRM practices. Findings reveal that digitalization enables improved operational efficiencies, real-time data analytics, and expanded supplier networks through platforms such as Amazon Business and Alibaba. Strategic shifts are noted towards collaborative supplier relationships, emphasizing joint innovation, technology co-investment, and shared risk management strategies. However, the implementation of digital SRM strategies presents challenges, including data privacy concerns, integration complexities, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory compliance issues. Organizations must navigate these challenges by developing robust governance frameworks and cybersecurity protocols to protect sensitive information and ensure regulatory adherence. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as supplier performance, cost savings, innovation impact, risk management effectiveness, and sustainability integration are critical for evaluating the success of digital SRM initiatives. Strategically, businesses are advised to prioritize leadership commitment, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous learning to optimize digital SRM practices effectively. Future research should explore emerging trends in digital SRM, investigate technological impacts on supplier dynamics and organizational performance, and examine ethical considerations in digitalization. By integrating these insights into strategic decision-making, businesses can enhance supplier relationships, mitigate operational risks, and achieve sustainable growth in the global marketplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2811ad0a3c7d9a5dc7d316e7079d77502e39ce0b88e5ab0522251c888181bccb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
