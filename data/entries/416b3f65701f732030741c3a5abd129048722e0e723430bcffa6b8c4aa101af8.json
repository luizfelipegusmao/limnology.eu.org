{"title":"Superior Adsorption of Chlorinated VOC by Date Palm Seed Biochar: A Two-Way ANOVA Comparative Analysis with Activated Carbon","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1011/v1","date":1728986300000,"content":"This study investigates biochar (BC) derived from date palm seeds as a high-performance ad-sorbent for trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) removal from aqueous solu-tions, comparing its efficacy to commercial activated carbon (AC). The optimized BC exhibits a high BET surface area of 654.79 mÂ²/g and a unique nanotube morphology. Kinetic studies indicate that the pseudo-second-order model best describes the adsorption process, with BC achieving capacities of 86.68 mg/g for TCE and 85.97 mg/g for PCE, significantly outperforming AC. Isotherm analysis suggests a complex adsorption mechanism involving both multilayer and monolayer adsorption. Two-way ANOVA confirms the significant superiority of BC over AC (p &lt; 0.0001) for both CVOCs. The enhanced performance of BC is attributed to its high surface area, well-developed microporosity, and advanced surface chemistry. This study highlights the promise of date palm seed-derived biochar as a sustainable, high-performance adsorbent for eco-friendly water treatment solutions, potentially reducing operational costs and environmental impact in real-world applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"416b3f65701f732030741c3a5abd129048722e0e723430bcffa6b8c4aa101af8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
