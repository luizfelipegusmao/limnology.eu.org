Using a large, temperate-zone centred dataset, and a well-established carbon model, we show that the empirical upper limit of carbon associated with silt and clay particles does not resemble a maximum mineralogical capacity. Without the given natural limitations of net primary production and C input limitation, soils could most likely stabilise and store much more soil carbon than commonly observed.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual, and particularly the formation of fine fraction carbon (OC<sub>fine</sub>), has a large potential to act as sink for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. For reliable estimates of this potential and efficient policy advice, the major limiting factors for OC<sub>fine</sub> accrual need to be understood. The upper boundary of the correlation between fine mineral particles (silt + clay) and OC<sub>fine</sub> is widely used to estimate the maximum mineralogical capacity of soils to store OC<sub>fine</sub>, suggesting that mineral surfaces get C saturated. Using a dataset covering the temperate zone and partly other climates on OC<sub>fine</sub> contents and a SOC turnover model, we provide two independent lines of evidence, that this empirical upper boundary does not indicate C saturation. Firstly, the C loading of the silt + clay fraction was found to strongly exceed previous saturation estimates in coarse-textured soils, which raises the question of why this is not observed in fine-textured soils. Secondly, a subsequent modelling exercise revealed, that for 74% of all investigated soils, local net primary production (NPP) would not be sufficient to reach a C loading of 80 g C kg<sup>−1</sup> silt + clay, which was previously assumed to be a general C saturation point. The proportion of soils with potentially enough NPP to reach that point decreased strongly with increasing silt + clay content. High C loadings can thus hardly be reached in more fine-textured soils, even if all NPP would be available as C input. As a pragmatic approach, we introduced texture-dependent, empirical maximum C loadings of the fine fraction, that decreased from 160 g kg<sup>−1</sup> in coarse to 75 g kg<sup>−1</sup> in most fine-textured soils. We conclude that OC<sub>fine</sub> accrual in soils is mainly limited by C inputs and is strongly modulated by texture, mineralogy, climate and other site properties, which could be formulated as an ecosystem capacity to stabilise SOC.</p>","author":"Christopher Poeplau, \nRene Dechow, \nNeha Begill, \nAxel Don","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"44ecb82d0efe49702d0678116118c0fe52539c3f81bbd84575d0cd0d5a8a067a","category":"Environment"}
