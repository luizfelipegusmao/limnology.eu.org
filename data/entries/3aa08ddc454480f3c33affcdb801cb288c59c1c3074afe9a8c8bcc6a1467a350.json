{"title":"Simulation Analysis of Blood Transfusion Accuracy and Hemolysis Rate of Conventional Infusion Pump and Cylinder-Type Infusion Pump","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0127/v1","date":1727841030000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Infusion pumps are critical in clinical settings, precisely delivering fluids such as medications and blood products. However, maintaining accuracy and preventing hemolysis is essential when administering blood, particularly to neonates. Conventional pumps may cause hemolysis due to pressure variations during transfusion. This study compares the blood transfusion accuracy and hemolysis rate between the conventional pump, Terufusion TE-LM700 (Terufusion) and the novel cylinder-type infusion pump, Anyfusion H-100 (Anyfusion); Methods: The study evaluated six different infusion rates (10-180cc/hr) and conducted 57 transfusion trials, 20 of which used a 1:1 blood-saline dilution. Blood transfusion accuracy was measured using research-grade packed red blood cells, and hemolysis rates were assessed before and after transfusion by chi-square tests and independent sample t-tests; Results: Anyfusion demonstrated an average transfusion error rate of 3.77%, compared to 4.00% for the Terufusion, with no statistically significant difference in hemolysis rates (p=0.697). Bland-Altman plots confirmed equivalent performance, with hemolysis rates of 0.566 ± 0.095% for Anyfusion and 0.518 ± 0.126% for Terufusion; Conclusions: Anyfusion provides accurate and reliable blood transfusion performance comparable to Terufusion, with no significant difference in hemolysis rates. Its integration of syringe and infusion methods shows potential for safer and more efficient transfusion practices, especially in pediatric and emergency settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3aa08ddc454480f3c33affcdb801cb288c59c1c3074afe9a8c8bcc6a1467a350","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
