VC is a gene-regulated process similar to osteogenic differentiation. There are still no convincing schemes to prevent and reduce the development of VC. It has been reported that hypoxia-inducing factor 1α (HIF-1α) and endothelin-1(ET-1) are related to VC. In this study, we found that the expression of ET-1 and HIF-1α was enhanced after VC, the interaction between HIF-1α and ET-1 was confirmed by CO-IP and luciferase experiments. We found that ET-1 was an upregulated differential gene of calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through gene sequencing. However, hypoxia-inducing factor 2α (HIF-2α) and HIF-1α have antagonistic effects on each other. HIF-1α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and HIF-2α can improve inflammation and fibrosis. Roxadustat, as a selective PHD3 inhibitor, preferentially activates HIF-2α. It is still unclear whether roxadustat improves VC in CKD by regulating the expression of HIF-2α/HIF-1α. Alizarin red staining and western blot as well as immunohistochemical results showed that roxadustat could significantly reduce the degree of vascular and VSMCs calcification in CKD rats. Serum HIF-1α and ET-1 were significantly decreased after roxadustat treatment. In addition, western blot results showed that roxadustat could decrease the expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 in vascular tissues and calcified VSMC, but HIF-2α expression significantly increased. Interestingly, our study confirmed that activation of HIF-1α or inhibition of HIF-2α reversed the ameliorating effect of roxadustat on VC, proving that the effect mediated by roxadustat is HIF-2α/HIF-1α dependent. We have demonstrated for the first time that roxadustat improves VC in CKD rats by regulating HIF-2α/HIF-1α, thus providing a new idea for the application of roxadustat in VC of CKD.</p>","author":"Yujing Wang, \nMin Xiao, \nFeng Cai, \nYang Li, \nTianli Shi, \nXiaoyan Zhou, \nShuhong Tian, \nDenggao Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"8a17c1eec8a92c3aa7694752564a438208b3988d02200ddbdfc090a9d7dda271","category":"Environment"}
