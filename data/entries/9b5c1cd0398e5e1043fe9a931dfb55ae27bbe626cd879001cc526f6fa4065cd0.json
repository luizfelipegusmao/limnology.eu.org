{"title":"475 Effects of diet composition and feed delivery regimen on growth performance, rumen buffering characteristics, carcass outcomes, and liver abscess prevalence of finishing steers","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/382/7757420?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Liver abscesses present significant challenges for the beef industry, yet understanding of the interplay between diet composition, eating behavior, and ruminal acidosis in finishing cattle and their effects on liver abscess prevalence and growth performance is lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the independent and interactive effects of dietary starch concentration and feed delivery regimen on growth performance, rumen buffering characteristics, carcass outcomes, and prevalence of liver abscesses in finishing beef steers. On d 0, beef steers [n = 720; body weight (BW) = 407 ± 4.53 kg) were sorted into 12 blocks according to BW and assigned to 1 of 4 treatments arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial (12 pens/interaction treatment; 24 pens/main effect) in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were finishing diets with low (49.1%; CON) or high (64.4%; HOT) starch concentration fed to steers receiving consistent feed delivery (REG) or randomized variations (ERR) in feed quantity (85% followed by 115% of the previous 4-d average once per week) and delivery time (delayed for 1, 2, 3, or 4 h twice per week). The 3 steers closest to the median BW in each pen were administered a 3-axis accelerometer ear-tag to quantify time spent ruminating and an indwelling rumen bolus to measure ruminal pH for the first 150 d of the study. Fecal score (1 = hard and dry consistency to 5 = water like consistency) and fecal pH were recorded on d 0, 56, 112, and before harvest. Daily dry matter intake (DMI) variability was greatest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01; diet × feed delivery interaction) for CON + ERR, intermediate for HOT + ERR, and least for HOT + REG and CON + REG. No additional interactions (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.14) between diet and feed delivery regimen were observed. Feeding HOT increased total liver abscesses (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) by 21.7 percentage points and liver scars (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) by 12.7 percentage points compared with CON. Additionally, steers consuming HOT had less (<span>P</span> ≤ 0.05) final BW, average daily gain, DMI, gain-to-feed ratio, hot carcass weight, marbling score, and yield grade than CON. Steers fed HOT also had fewer daily rumination minutes (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01; diet × day interaction), lower fecal pH (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01; diet × day interaction) lower ruminal pH (<span>P</span> = 0.04), and less desirable fecal scores (<span>P</span> = 0.02) vs. CON. Feed delivery regimen did not affect (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.21) growth performance, rumen buffering characteristics, carcass traits, or liver abscess prevalence. Increasing the concentration of readily fermentable starch fed to finishing steers reduced growth and carcass performance, ruminal pH, and fecal pH, while increasing the proportion of liver abscesses. In contrast, inducing erratic DMI did not affect growth performance or carcass outcomes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"9b5c1cd0398e5e1043fe9a931dfb55ae27bbe626cd879001cc526f6fa4065cd0","category":"Environment"}
