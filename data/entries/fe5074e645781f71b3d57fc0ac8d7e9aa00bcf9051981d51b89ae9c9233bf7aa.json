{"title":"Growth performance and meat quality of broiler chickens fed diet containing bird eye pepper of varying proportion and sieve size","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae117/7727355?rss=1","date":1722816000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study investigated the potency of bird eye pepper (<strong>BEP</strong>) of varying proportion and sieve size on growth performance and meat quality of broiler chickens. Two hundred and forty-six 2-wk-old broiler chicks were randomly allotted to six treatment groups (basal diet (B) inclusive × 2) in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement each replicated four times (10 × 10 × 10 × 11) in a completely randomized design. Diets containing BEP of varying proportion (0, 150, and 300 g) and sieve size (0.05 and 0.1 mm) were offered in two phases, starter (14 d) and finisher (17 d). Postfeeding, 48 birds (two per replicate) were sacrificed to further evaluate performance and assess the quality of meat produced. Result obtained indicates chicks fed 150 g BEP consumed less feed compared to 300 g BEP. Also, 0 and 150 g BEP groups had better (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) feed conversion ratio (<strong>FCR</strong>) than 300 g BEP, while 0.05 mm BEP diet improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) FCR as against 0.1 mm BEP. Interaction of proportion and sieve size effects of BEP increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) the final weight of the birds and suppressed (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) feed intake for all groups as against 300 g (0.1 mm) BEP (1,576.00 g/bird; 964.20 g/bird). Feeding 150 and 300 g BEP diets lowered (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) superoxide dismutase (<strong>SOD</strong>) production compared to 0 g BEP, while 150 g BEP diet increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) catalase production over 0 g BEP. Interactive effect of proportion and sieve size of BEP reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) SOD production in 150 g (0.05 and 0.1 mm) BEP and 300 g (0.05 mm) BEP groups, followed by 300 g (0.1 mm) BEP group that had lower (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) SOD than both basal groups. Birds fed B + 150 g (0.05 mm) BEP diet produced more (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) catalase compared to both basal groups. Meat pH for 150 and 300 g BEP groups was significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) reduced than 0 g BEP. The Hue angle corresponds with a high value (<span>P </span>&lt;<span> </span>0.05) to 0 g BEP, while 300 g BEP showed a low value. This study has shown BEP at low concentration (150 g) screened with 0.05 and 0.1 mm sieves enhanced chick welfare, while a higher concentration (300 g) screened at 0.05 mm improved overall growth performance (endogenous antioxidant profile) at finisher phase. Broiler chickens, farmers, and meat processors will benefit from diet containing BEP screened through 0.05 mm sieve.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"fe5074e645781f71b3d57fc0ac8d7e9aa00bcf9051981d51b89ae9c9233bf7aa","category":"Environment"}
