{"title":"Bioassay-Guided Isolation of Dehydrocostus Lactone from Echinops kebericho as a Leishmanicidal Drug","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1350/v1","date":1711085541000,"content":"Several bio-actors are involved in the occurrence of leishmaniasis, which is made too complex for prevention and control options. Currently, all forms of leishmaniasis are being treated with chemical drugs, which have limitations and adverse effects on patients. Searching the bioactive molecules from plant sources allows the development of a novel drug. The essential oil and solvent extract of the roots of E. kebericho showed antileishmanial activity. But looking for biological activities of the isolated active ingredient from tubers of E. kebericho was scant. Thus, the isolation of the leishmanicidal compound from the roots of E. kebericho through a bioassay-guided technique was an aim of this work. Dehydrocostus lactone showed doubled potent than the standard drug miltefosine on leishmanicidal activities against L. major and L. tropica. Besides, the broad-spectrum biological activities of dehydrocostus lactone could be a potential drug candidate for co-infected patients caused by an association of leishmania and another pathogen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9c343691df944a456aadc5a5a149b4284e49a1c7977ea9e1e4e05970bdc177c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
