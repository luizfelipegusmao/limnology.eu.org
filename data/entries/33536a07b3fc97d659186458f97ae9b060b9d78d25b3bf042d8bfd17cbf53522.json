{"title":"Otolith elemental composition indicates differences in the habitat use for larvae and early juveniles of Japanese jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) in the waters around Japan","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12699?af=R","date":1725337489000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Trace element analysis of otoliths from core to edge was used to reveal differences in habitats of larvae and early juveniles of Japanese jack mackerel (<i>Trachurus japonicus</i>) caught in the East China Sea (ECS), Pacific Ocean, and Sea of Japan. Multi-element signatures (Sr:Ca, Mg:Ca, Na:Ca, K:Ca, and Ba:Ca) were analyzed with multivariate statistics to determine whether these element signatures provide insight into regional population structure. The median values of elements: Ca ratios in otolith core region differed significantly among areas, with most elements between the ECS and the Pacific Ocean or Sea of Japan showing significant differences. The Sr:Ca ratios exhibited a V-shaped trend from the otolith core to the edge, which was likely related to the vertical habitat layer shift of larvae and early juveniles of <i>T. japonicus</i>. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates using the element: Ca ratios and the hatching day were re-classified according to the sampling area with higher accuracy in the ECS (88–95%) and the Sea of Japan (76–83%) compared to the Pacific Ocean (69–72%). These results indicate that the proportion of eggs, larvae, and early juveniles transported by the Kuroshio Current from the southern ECS—the main spawning ground—to the Pacific Ocean or the Sea of Japan is low and that juveniles distributed in the coastal waters off southwestern Japan may have originated from local spawners. These results suggest that determining the elemental composition of larvae and juveniles of <i>T. japonicus</i> is effective in determining the habitat differences of this species in the three regions. These findings will help to understand population structure and recruitment process of this species around Japan.</p>","author":"Yuki Fujinami, \nMotomitsu Takahashi, \nChiyuki Sassa, \nYuko Hiraoka, \nHiroyuki Kurota, \nSeiji Ohshimo","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"33536a07b3fc97d659186458f97ae9b060b9d78d25b3bf042d8bfd17cbf53522","category":"Environment"}
