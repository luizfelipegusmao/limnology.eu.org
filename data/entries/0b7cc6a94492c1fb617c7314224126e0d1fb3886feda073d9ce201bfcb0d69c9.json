{"title":"Sustainable logistics development strategy based on SWOT and analytic hierarchy process","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312560","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Changgang Xiao</p>\r\n\r\nDue to the implementation of sustainable green development strategy, the study uses the competitive situation method and analytical hierarchy process of logistics enterprises to conduct structural analysis and weight calculation of factor indicators for their development strategies. Afterwards, the exponential smoothing prediction method was used to weight the logistics data. Moreover, through comparative analysis of the indicator evaluation system, the average weights of the advantageous factors of logistics enterprises were found to be 0.0232, 0.1102, 0.0522, and 0.0468, respectively. The energy consumption, transportation volume, and turnover of logistics transportation increased by 68.9% and 52.3% in 2022, respectively, which had a significant impact on the sustainable development of the logistics industry. It has been demonstrated that a sustainable logistics development strategy based on the enterprise competitive situation method and the analytic hierarchy process is both feasible and superior. Furthermore, this strategy has the potential to enhance the environmental benefits and green development of the economy and society.","author":"Changgang Xiao","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0b7cc6a94492c1fb617c7314224126e0d1fb3886feda073d9ce201bfcb0d69c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
