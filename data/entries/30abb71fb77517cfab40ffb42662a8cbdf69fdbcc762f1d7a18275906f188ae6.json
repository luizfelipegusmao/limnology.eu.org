{"title":"Mapping Rural Mobility in the Global South: A Participatory GIS Approach for Assessments of Daily Movement Needs and Practice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2229/v1","date":1725036273000,"content":"This paper investigates rural mobility in the Global South using a participatory GIS approach to address the lack of mobility data. Limited rural mobility due to poor infrastructure and financial constraints hinders social and economic activities, impeding development. The study aims to explore the socio-economic impacts of limited mobility, identify software needs for data-scarce environments, and map daily mobility patterns. Fieldwork was conducted in Kenya (2022) and Nepal (2023), collecting geographic data related to mobility. The methodology included community engagement and digital mapping using the QField app for precise data collection. The study highlights the use of participatory GIS to fill data gaps, enabling more accurate mobility assessments. In Kenya, the research significantly increased the number of mapped roads and paths, providing a more realistic view of local mobility. Community engagement revealed gender-specific mobility patterns, with women facing particular challenges in daily activities. The study emphasizes the need for adaptable data models to reflect community-specific mobility needs and the integration of qualitative insights to propose effective mobility solutions. This research contributes to understanding rural mobility in the Global South and demonstrates the effectiveness of participatory GIS in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing mobility analysis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"30abb71fb77517cfab40ffb42662a8cbdf69fdbcc762f1d7a18275906f188ae6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
