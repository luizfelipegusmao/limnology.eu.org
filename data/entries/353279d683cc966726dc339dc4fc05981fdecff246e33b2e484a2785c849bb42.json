{"title":"Towards a Refined Heuristic Evaluation: Incorporating Hierarchical Analysis for Weighted Usability Assessment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0848/v2","date":1713773382000,"content":"This study delves into the realm of heuristic evaluation within usability testing, focusing on refining and applying a tailored algorithm that simplifies the implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process for heuristic prioritization. Addressing the prevalent challenge of disparate evaluation methodologies and the absence of a standardized process in usability testing, our research introduces a novel method that leverages the Analytic Hierarchy Process alongside a bespoke algorithm. This algorithm utilizes transitive properties for pairwise comparisons, significantly reducing the evaluative workload. This innovative approach facilitates the estimation of heuristic relevance irrespective of the number of items per heuristic or the item scale and streamlines the overall evaluation process. In addition to rigorous simulation testing of the tailored algorithm, we applied our method in a practical scenario, engaging seven usability experts in evaluating a web interface. This empirical application underscored our methodâ€™s capacity to diminish the requisite comparison count and spotlight areas of improvement for critically weighted yet underperforming heuristics. The outcomes of this study underscore the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the efficiency and organization of heuristic evaluations, paving the way for more structured and effective usability testing methodologies in future research endeavors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"353279d683cc966726dc339dc4fc05981fdecff246e33b2e484a2785c849bb42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
