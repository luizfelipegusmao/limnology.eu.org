{"title":"Inference after latent variable estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/25/1/270/6893953?rss=1","date":1670889600000,"content":"<span><div>Summary</div>In the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, researchers often characterize the variation between cells by estimating a latent variable, such as cell type or pseudotime, representing some aspect of the cellâ€™s state. They then test each gene for association with the estimated latent variable. If the same data are used for both of these steps, then standard methods for computing p-values in the second step will fail to achieve statistical guarantees such as Type 1 error control. Furthermore, approaches such as sample splitting that can be applied to solve similar problems in other settings are not applicable in this context. In this article, we introduce <span>count splitting</span>, a flexible framework that allows us to carry out valid inference in this setting, for virtually any latent variable estimation technique and inference approach, under a Poisson assumption. We demonstrate the Type 1 error control and power of count splitting in a simulation study and apply count splitting to a data set of pluripotent stem cells differentiating to cardiomyocytes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biostatistics Current Issue","siteHash":"d3a47065211a18721436d2ad1f713237ccbb15b7790ebb347bb018c26cfcb04f","entryHash":"f7933de89a6a0f5e83d9da476fb064d7674d1c8d5f84c88b7567304382b2cb92","category":"Environment"}
