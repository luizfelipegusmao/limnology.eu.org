{"title":"Super Resolution Microscopy for the Evaluation of Therapeutic Distribution","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.465/7719686?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>In biopharmaceutical Research and Development (R&amp;D), methods for interrogating cellular and tissue biodistribution are integral to understanding therapeutic mechanism of action (MOA). In fact, these data are critical to understanding pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) which are necessary for calculating proper dosing and assessing therapeutic safety profiles. Understanding drug targeting and MOA also contribute to the development of future therapeutic research through a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of novel drug delivery modalities such as gene therapy vectors, liposomes, and biologics with novel modes of action. Advanced microscopy, and super resolution imaging in particular, are essential tools for the quantitative evaluation of therapeutic distribution at the cellular and tissue level. Here we present examples of super resolution imaging with AiryScan or Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy as well as sample expansion techniques as applied to questions of therapeutic distribution. We also discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each when combined with quantitative analyses to answer questions related to therapeutic distribution and MOA in an R&amp;D setting within the pharmaceutical industry.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"94d5ebe74f9e8453d3936e8a8f510d69ea6dea757eecd101d7b7f09896e692b5","category":"Environment"}
