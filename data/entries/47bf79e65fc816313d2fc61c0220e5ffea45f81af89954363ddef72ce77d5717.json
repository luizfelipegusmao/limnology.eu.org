For instance, bilayer graphene can be made superconductive by twisting the layers by a specific angle [<a href=\"#ozae044.932-B1\">1</a>]. The optical properties of 2D materials can be tuned in the same way [<a href=\"#ozae044.932-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"47bf79e65fc816313d2fc61c0220e5ffea45f81af89954363ddef72ce77d5717","category":"Environment"}
