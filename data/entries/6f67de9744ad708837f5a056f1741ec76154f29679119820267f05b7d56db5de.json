One-unit-cell thick FeSe film grown on SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrate (1uc FeSe/STO) is a special superconductor, whose high-Tc has been associated with the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) at the interface [<a href=\"#ozae044.736-B1\">1</a>]. However, the exact role of EPC in the Tc-enhancement is still under investigation. One key question remains unclear is the microscopic coupling mechanism, i.e., which phonon modes are involved in the EPC. Previous studies often associate the oxygen optical phonons of the STO substrate with EPC. This interpretation ignores the fact that there is a double TiO<sub>x</sub> interfacial layer between the FeSe film and the STO substrate, as imaged by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) [<a href=\"#ozae044.736-B2\">2</a>]. It is remains elusive how the cross-interface EPC occurs between the two materials that are spatially separated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6f67de9744ad708837f5a056f1741ec76154f29679119820267f05b7d56db5de","category":"Environment"}
