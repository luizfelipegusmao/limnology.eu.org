{"title":"Native Infective Endocarditis: A State of the Art Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0527/v1","date":1718001331000,"content":"Native infective endocarditis is a global phenomenon, defined by infection of a native heart valve and involving the endocardial surface. The causes and epidemiology of the disease have evolved in recent decades, with a doubling of the average patient age. A higher incidence was observed in patients with implanted cardiac devices that can result in right-sided infection of the tricuspid valve. The microbiology of the disease has also changed. Previously, staphylococci, which are most often associated with health-care contact and invasive procedures, were the most common cause of the disease. Nevertheless, this has now been superseded by streptococci. While innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have emerged, mortality rates have not improved over the past year and remain at 30%, which is higher than for many cancer diagnoses. The lack of randomized trials and logistical constraints impede clinical management, and long-standing controversies such as the use of antibiotic prophylaxis persist. This state of the art review  addresses clinical practice, controversies, and strategies to combat this potentially devastating disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8617b4e72dc06b96c5762f0eb467d790703f6336a6277dcfe58bac1025ec0214","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
