{"title":"Investigating School Principals&#039; Burnout: A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Stress, Sustainability, and Organizational Climate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2277/v1","date":1722238715000,"content":"Chronic stress, culminating in burnout, evolves gradually and is notoriously difficult to detect due to vague symptoms and individuals' hesitance to acknowledge their struggles. To expedite the identification and recognition of this condition, enabling timely psychological intervention, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly considered. This research does not assert the feasibility of an AI system managing all aspects of chronic stress's impact. However, it highlights the capability of current technology to detect stress indicators based on quantifiable data like Heart Rate (HR) and organizational climate dimensions. Although other physiological markers such as oximetry, skin galvanic response, and EKG have been explored, they have not shown reliable differentiation between stress and joy. Focused on the unique context of school principals in the Bedouin regions of Israel, this study investigates the interplay between HR, organizational climate, and stress levels. It introduces a novel application of a fuzzy logic tool that combines HR and organizational climate metrics to aid in stress diagnosis. This tool incorporates the psychologist's expertise to provide real-time data crucial for developing effective coping strategies. While the AI-supported fuzzy system does not replace professional psychological intervention, it significantly enhances the speed of condition identification and intervention planning, thus shortening the response time to stress-related issues in educational leadership within culturally specific settings. The application of such AI-driven tools is pivotal for sustaining the well-being and effectiveness of educational leaders, thereby supporting the broader goal of educational sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a1714f3c6a13cfe7a8cba7f843fc11f155117d46cfa5518059fc77fcd61612c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
