{"title":"Concordance between Preoperative #ENZIANi Score and Postoperative #ENZIANs Score Classification. Why Do We Choose #ENZIAN and How Does It Impact the Future Classification Trend","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2056/v1","date":1719575626000,"content":"Objectives: To assess the concordance of the preoperative application of the #Enzian\nclassification (#ENZIANi) with the postoperative result (#ENZIANs) using surgical findings as the\nreference standard. Methods: This retrospective study included 282 consecutive patients with\ndeep endometriosis undergoing surgical treatment. Preoperative assessment with transvaginal\nsonography and magnetic resonance imaging was compared with postoperative assessment.\nConcordance and diagnostic test evaluation were calculated. Results: The highest concordance\nwas observed in the F (abdominal wall endometriosis) with k Cohen of 0.837, following the values\nfor pelvic locations, with 0.795 for T left, 0.791 for T right, 0.776 for F (adenomyosis), 0.766 for C\n(rectum), and 0.75 and 0.72 for O right k and O left, respectively. The highest sensitivity was\ndemonstrated for the P compartment *(98%), T compartment (both sides 97%), and A, B, C (94%-\n96%), corresponding with deep endometriosis. Conclusions: Preoperative assessment using\nTVS/TAS+MRI with the ENZIANi score correlates well with the ENZIANs postoperative score and\ndemonstrates good concordance in the detection and localization of deep endometriosis, thereby\nminimizing false negative results and ensuring accurate preoperative staging. The ENZIAN\nclassification is well-suited to surgeons&amp;#39; needs and benefits from continuous development. Future\nimprovements, such as adding the expanded C module, may be considered in the next edition.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c1570f00e6e4eee5e1632775e720f87663bc00464eba7cedfeee6649b81bafc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
