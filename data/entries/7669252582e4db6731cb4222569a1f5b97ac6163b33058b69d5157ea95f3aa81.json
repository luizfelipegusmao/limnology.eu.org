{"title":"Advancements in Software Engineering for IoT Applications: Addressing Challenges and Seizing Opportunities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0742/v1","date":1720578000000,"content":"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has ushered in a new era of connectivity, allowing billions of devices to produce extensive data. Significant challenges in software engineering need to be addressed for full utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This article examines the challenges in Internet of Things, software engineering and discusses current developments aimed at addressing these issues and seizing new  opportunities. We examine the challenges associated with Internet of Things software development, including resource constraints, device diversity, security vulnerabilities, and data management concerns. New studies have indicated the use of advanced techniques like as containerization, model-driven development, AI and ML integration, and robust security frameworks. Moreover, the significance of system architecture is explained, including the device, network, and cloud layers, with an emphasis on the principles of reusability, scalability, and modularity. Results and conversations explore the complexities of security measures, emerging opportunities, and scaling solutions made possible by simulation tools, penetration testing, and cross-domain development platforms. The study expects IoT system evolution and emphasises the need for continual software and firmware changes, testing, and deployment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7669252582e4db6731cb4222569a1f5b97ac6163b33058b69d5157ea95f3aa81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
