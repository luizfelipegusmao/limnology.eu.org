{"title":"Impact of Underlying Chronic Medical Conditions on COVID-19 Outcomes among People Living with HIV: A Retrospective Analysis from the Minnesota Fairview Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1327/v1","date":1729234540000,"content":"(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the impact of underlying medical conditions on the health outcomes of people living with HIV (PLWH). This study aimed to assess how pre-existing chronic medical conditions affect the health outcomes of PLWH infected with COVID-19. (2) Methods: A retrospective study using data from the Minnesota Fairview network (January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2022) was conducted. Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, and ordinal logistic regressions with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment on p-values were used to assess the influence of chronic conditions on COVID-19 severity, adjusting for age and gender. (3) Results: Among 216 records, significant associations were found for stroke, chronic kidney disease, lung disease, and neurologic conditions (p&lt;0.05). Type 1 diabetes was marginally significant (0.05&lt;p&lt;0.1). After adjusting for age and sex, stroke (p=0.0008, BH-adjusted p=0.0044) and chronic kidney disease (p=0.0003, BH-adjusted p=0.0033) significantly increased the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. (4) Conclusions: Pre-existing medical conditions should be considered in the clinical management and public health interventions for PLWH with COVID-19. Tailored strategies are essential to mitigate the higher risk of severe outcomes in PLWH with specific chronic comorbidities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"359fac9fcb34763e4c4272d14a30e35ecf70ba59499cbb375a8a9933e2f43e0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
