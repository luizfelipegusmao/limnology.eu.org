{"title":"Cosmic Theory of Structure (CTS): Addressing the Hierarchy Problem with Running Couplings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1233/v6","date":1719814488000,"content":"The Cosmic Theory of Structure (CTS) model has undergone significant refinement to address the hierarchy problem by incorporating the concept of running couplings. This update provides a more robust framework for understanding the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, offering a natural explanation for mass scales due to quantum effects. We present new validations using gravitational wave data from events GW150914 and GW151226, neutrino oscillation data from IceCube, dark matter density data from the Planck survey, and quantum field interaction data. The enhanced model demonstrates improved alignment with observational data, reinforcing the CTS model's predictive power and its potential to unify gravity and quantum physics within a single theoretical framework.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fc454600e493a36aec090003de28c92b228714931e45f736db500c36910b25f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
