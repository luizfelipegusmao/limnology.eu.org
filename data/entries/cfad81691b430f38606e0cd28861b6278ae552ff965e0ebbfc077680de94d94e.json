{"title":"Effect of High Glucose on Embryological Development of Zebrafish, Brachyodanio rerio through Wnt Pathway","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0951/v1","date":1720690381000,"content":"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDMs) is worldly wide pregnancy complication. Gestational Diabetes can significantly impact the fetus development. However, the effects of high glucose on embryological development post-fertilization are yet to be researched. Danio rerio embryos are great model to study the embryonic development. In this study, the effects on embryological (morphological and genetic) development were examined in the presence of a high glucose environment that mimic the developing fetus in pregnant women with GMD. Fertilized Zebrafish embryos were treated with normal media and high glucose for 5 days from 3 hours post-fertilization(hpf) to 96hpf respectively as control and experimental groups. Morphological changes are recorded with Microscope images. Hatch rate and heart rate are compared between groups in set up time points. RNA-Seq is performed to examine the gene changes in experimental group. Glucose delayed the zebrafish embryo development by slowing the hatch rate about 24 hours. The brain, heart, and tail started showing morphology smaller in the glucose group compared to the control group at 24 hpf. Heart rate is faster in the glucose group compared to the control group on day 2 and 3 with a statistically significant difference. Among zebrafish whole genome, the significantly changed genes are 556 genes up-regulated and 1118 genes down-regulated respectively in high glucose group. The metabolic and Wnt pathways are altered under high glucose condition. These conditions contribute to significant physiological differences that may provide insight on functionality post-embryological development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cfad81691b430f38606e0cd28861b6278ae552ff965e0ebbfc077680de94d94e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
