{"title":"Reliability Analysis of Distorted Distributions using Aging Intensity Function","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0587/v1","date":1718020269000,"content":"This paper presents the preservation property of the average intensity order and the preservation property of the monotonic average intensity classes under distorted distributions. Several sufficient conditions are given to get the preservation properties. It is shown that the imposed conditions are achievable as we examine in some examples. The preservation of the average intensity order and the preservation of the decreasing average intensity class under the structure of a parallel system with independent and identically distributed components' lifetime are made. A lower bound for the average intensity function of a random lifetime with an increasing failure rate in average distribution is derived. The results are applied to some semiparametric models as a particular standard family of distorted distribution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0a3030f4297080d3cc7d1ea260b602b134404f52fe896035ae0fb2e81fd9498","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
