{"title":"Burden of Wasting and Stunting in Colombia and Its Economic Impact: A Society&rsquo;s Perspective Analysis, 2021","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1247/v1","date":1729060227000,"content":"Child malnutrition is a critical public health concern that significantly hampers children's physical and mental development and has serious economic repercussions. The World Health Organization (WHO) attributes half of all deaths among children under five to malnutrition, with long-term consequences such as lower educational achievement, decreased productivity, and deepened poverty. The economic impact of child malnutrition extends beyond public health, imposing substantial costs on health systems, households, and the broader economy.\nThis study estimated the burden of child malnutrition in Colombia among children up to four years old using a Markov chain model from a societal perspective. The model simulated six health states, integrating direct and indirect costs, with epidemiological data and international literature guiding the transition probabilities. Surveys were conducted with caregivers to assess indirect costs. Results indicated that malnutrition accounted for 419.84 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 1,000 inhabitants. The total cost of malnutrition over four years was approximately USD 243.58 million, with an annual average cost of USD 60.89 million, with 65% of the burden falling on households.\nThe findings emphasize the significant economic and health burden of child malnutrition, underscoring the importance of early and comprehensive interventions. Investing in child nutrition can improve health outcomes, reduce economic strain, and enhance productivity, making it a crucial priority in health and economic development agendas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"27967b031eb0c83fe70cbdeffba34ac746a0a839c8bfdb212ca903cf2ba40419","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
