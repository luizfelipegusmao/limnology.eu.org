Mishra, Ganesh Chandra Nayak<br />In this study S-doped graphitic CN/ZIF-8 composite was fabricated to remove Pb from water which was anchored through heat treatment. This formed a composite of carbon, Zn-NCN, PbO and PbS and was used as supercapacitor anode.<br />To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.<br />The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"RSC - Environ.
