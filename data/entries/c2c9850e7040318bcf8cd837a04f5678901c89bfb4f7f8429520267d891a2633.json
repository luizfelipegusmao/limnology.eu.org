{"title":"Valorization of Yellowfin Tuna Tails: An Approximation to Circular Bioeconomy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0223/v1","date":1717565997000,"content":"This study investigates the valorization potential of yellowfin tuna tails for the production of high-value commercial products. Muscle and skins were firstly mechanically separated by using a specifically designed device. The muscle was then used as a nitrogen source for the growth of the proteolytic enzymes-producer Bacillus subtilis, whereas the skins were employed for gelatin extrac-tion. The proteases from Bacillus subtilis were partially purified and used to produce antioxidant peptides from gelatin obtained. The gelatin obtained formed a gel upon cooling, with gelling and melting temperatures at 16 ºC and 22 ºC, respectively, and Bloom Strength of ≈ 160. RSM was used to determine the optimal hydrolysis conditions to obtain the highest antioxidant activity (35.96%, measured as DPPH radical scavenging activity), which were 50°C / 6.5 IU of enzyme. The findings emphasize the importance of an integrated approach to maximize the value of tuna by-products, promoting sustainability in the frame of circular bioeconomy. Overall, these results contribute to the efficient utilization of tuna by-products, waste reduction, and enhance economic viability of the tuna industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2c9850e7040318bcf8cd837a04f5678901c89bfb4f7f8429520267d891a2633","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
