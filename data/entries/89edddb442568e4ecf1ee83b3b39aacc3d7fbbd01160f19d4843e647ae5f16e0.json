{"title":"The power of past performance in multidimensional supplier evaluation and supplier selection: Debiasing anchoring bias and its knock-on effects","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303700","date":1715868000000,"content":"<p>by Ricky S.

We consider the supplier past performance in one performance dimension as the anchor and investigate whether and how this anchor would have a knock-on effects on evaluating a supplier’s performance in other dimensions. We conducted two online experimental studies (Study 1, sample size = 104 and Study 2, sample size = 408). Study 1 adopts a 2 x 1 <i>(high anchor vs</i>. <i>low anchor)</i> between-subjects factorial experimental design, and Study 2 is a 3 <i>(debiasing</i>: <i>no</i>, <i>consider-the-opposite</i>, <i>mental-mapping)</i> x 2 <i>(high anchor vs</i>. <i>low anchor)</i> between-subjects factorial design. The results from Studies 1 and 2 suggest that when a supplier has received a low evaluation score in one dimension in the past, participants assign the same supplier lower scores in the other dimensions compared to a supplier that has obtained a high score in the past. We also find that anchoring has a knock-on effect on how likely participants are to choose the same supplier in the future. Our findings highlight the asymmetric effectiveness of ‘consider-the-opposite’ and ‘mental-mapping’ debiasing techniques. This research is the first study that examines how anchoring bias managers’ evaluations in a multi-dimensional setting and its knock-on effects. It also explores the effectiveness of two low-cost debiasing techniques. A crucial practical implication is that suppliers’ exceptionally good or disappointing past performance affects the judgement of supply managers. Hence, managers should use consider-the-opposite or mental-mapping techniques to debias the effect of high and low anchors, respectively.","author":"Ricky S.
