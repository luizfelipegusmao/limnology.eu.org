{"title":"Detecting tea tree pests in complex backgrounds using a hybrid architecture guided by transformers and multi‐scale attention mechanism","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13241?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Tea pests pose a significant threat to tea leaf yield and quality, necessitating fast and accurate detection methods to improve pest control efficiency and reduce economic losses for tea farmers. However, in real tea gardens, some tea pests are small in size and easily camouflaged by complex backgrounds, making it challenging for farmers to promptly and accurately identify them.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>To address this issue, we propose a real-time detection method based on TP-YOLOX for monitoring tea pests in complex backgrounds. Our approach incorporates the CSBLayer module, which combines convolution and multi-head self-attention mechanisms, to capture global contextual information from images and expand the network's perception field. Additionally, we integrate an efficient multi-scale attention module to enhance the model's ability to perceive fine details in small targets. To expedite model convergence and improve the precision of target localization, we employ the SIOU loss function as the bounding box regression function. Experimental results demonstrate that TP-YOLOX achieves a significant performance improvement with a relatively small additional computational cost (0.98 floating-point operations), resulting in a 4.50% increase in mean average precision (mAP) compared to the original YOLOX-s. When compared with existing object detection algorithms, TP-YOLOX outperforms them in terms of mAP performance. Moreover, the proposed method achieves a frame rate of 82.66 frames per second, meeting real-time requirements.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>TP-YOLOX emerges as a proficient solution, capable of accurately and swiftly identifying tea pests amidst the complex backgrounds of tea gardens. This contribution not only offers valuable insights for tea pest monitoring but also serves as a reference for achieving precise pest control. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Xianming Hu, \nXinliang Li, \nZiyan Huang, \nQibin Chen, \nShouying Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"84ff5528b6f50052e77da466c5d806465567b3a3c10c5db0aa77c8fc8223fbaa","category":"Environment"}
