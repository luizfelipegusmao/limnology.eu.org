{"title":"Comprehensive Review Analysis and Countermeasures for Cybersecurity Threats: DDoS, Ransomware, and Trojan Horse Attacks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1369/v1","date":1726795046000,"content":"With all the sophisticated threats to network security, intrusion detection is a section of the security technology industry that is becoming increasingly significant. In this research paper, we have discussed in detail the detection, effects, and prevention protocols of security issues. Security issues are a wide range of elements. Hence, we narrowed our research to two main sectors which are malware attacks and distributed denial of service (DDOS). To make the research more informative, we looked at three selected real-life cases of security intrusion that occurred around the world in recent years. Malware attacks and DDOS are constantly being developed creatively to challenge all the current security systems. In addition, we have analysed and highlighted the potential threats of the security issue and included proposed countermeasure ideas to avoid the security issues. The research findings also show us that malware is evolving simultaneously with our security technology growth. This gives us an understanding that prevention is significantly a continual improvement process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c850a5aae08710e1d1a904435963467cd2791e3a9283876d29912863cef95722","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
