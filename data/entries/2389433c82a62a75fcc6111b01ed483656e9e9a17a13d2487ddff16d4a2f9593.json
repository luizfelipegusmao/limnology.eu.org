{"title":"PSII-18 Evaluating the effects of sodium diformate on finishing pig growth performance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/291/7664682?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A total of 2,200 pigs (Duroc sire (PIC 800 or DNA 600) × PIC Camborough; initial body weight = 24.2 ± 0.30 kg) were used in a 117-d growth trial to evaluate the effects of increasing dietary sodium diformate on finishing pig growth performance and carcass characteristics. Pens of pigs (25 pigs per pen) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design with 22 replicates per treatment. Dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal-based with the addition of none, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75% sodium diformate (Formi NDF; ADDCON Nordic AS, Porsgrunn, Norway). Diets were fed in 6 phases from 24 to 141 kg. From d 0 to 32, increasing sodium diformate tended to decrease (quadratic, <span>P</span> = 0.081; Table 1) average daily feed intake (ADFI) up to the 0.50% inclusion level and had a quadratic (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) effect on feed efficiency with the best gain to feed ratio (G:F) observed at 0.25% sodium diformate. From d 32 to 60, there was no evidence for differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) in average daily gain (ADG) or ADFI; however, there was a tendency for a quadratic effect (<span>P</span> = 0.093) on G:F, with 0.25 and 0.50% inclusion of sodium diformate having the least G:F. From d 60 to 93, increasing sodium diformate increased (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) ADG and ADFI. Additionally, from d 93 to 117, increasing sodium diformate increased (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) ADG, ADFI, and G:F. For the overall period (d 0 to 117), pigs fed increasing sodium diformate had increased (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) ADG and a tendency for increased (linear, <span>P</span> = 0.075) ADFI; however, there was no evidence for differences (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) in G:F. Treatment did not impact carcass characteristics (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10). Overall mortality was 1.1% and was not influenced (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) by treatment. For economics, increasing sodium diformate increased (linear, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) feed cost and feed cost per kg of gain in both low and high price scenarios. However, there was a tendency for a quadratic effect (<span>P</span> = 0.059) for revenue with pigs fed 0.25% sodium diformate generating the greatest revenue in both the low and high price scenarios. Due to the increased feed cost and quadratic response in revenue, pigs fed increasing sodium diformate resulted in a quadratic (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) response in IOFC with pigs fed no sodium diformate having the greatest IOFC. In conclusion, these data suggest that feeding increasing sodium diformate improved ADG and ADFI after d 60 (~82 kg) in the finishing period. However, it is currently not economical to feed sodium diformate throughout the entire finishing period.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2389433c82a62a75fcc6111b01ed483656e9e9a17a13d2487ddff16d4a2f9593","category":"Environment"}
