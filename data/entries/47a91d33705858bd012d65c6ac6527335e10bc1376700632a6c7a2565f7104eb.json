Nevertheless, durability remains a significant challenge, primarily stemming from catalyst degradation in the cathode. Addressing these performance losses necessitates a deeper comprehension of degradation mechanisms under accelerated stress tests (ASTs) through structural characterization and localization. Electron tomography emerges as a key tool for linking the degradation rate and mechanism of Pt-based nanoparticles relative to their location on or within the porous carbon support [<a href=\"#ozae044.534-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.534-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"47a91d33705858bd012d65c6ac6527335e10bc1376700632a6c7a2565f7104eb","category":"Environment"}
