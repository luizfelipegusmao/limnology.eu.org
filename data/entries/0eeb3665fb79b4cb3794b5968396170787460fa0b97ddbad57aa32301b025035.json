{"title":"Testing the Effect of Cue Consistency on the Past Behavior-Habit-Physical Activity Relationship","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1402/v1","date":1713835043000,"content":"Habit theory suggests that behavior performed in the presence of consistent cues is a core ingredient for successful habit development, with the repeated presence of these consistent cues facilitating the activation of automatic responses in future. We tested this assumption in a sample of 68 undergraduate students who, at baseline, reported on their physical activity behavior over the past year then, two weeks later, responded to measures of cue consistency, habit, and physical activity performance over the previous two weeks. As expected, habit mediated the effects of past behavior on prospectively measured behavior. Moreover, the mediating effect of habit between past and future behavior was significantly stronger in those reporting undertaking physical activity at the same time of day, doing the same activity, and in the same mood. Consistent place, people, and part of routine did not moderate the effects of habit. Results provide formative evidence for a key assertion of habit theory, that consistent contextual and internal cues are a cornerstone of habitual development and action, but also indicate the importance of examining different forms of cues and their impact on the formation and enaction of habits as some cues over others may be more relevant.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0eeb3665fb79b4cb3794b5968396170787460fa0b97ddbad57aa32301b025035","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
