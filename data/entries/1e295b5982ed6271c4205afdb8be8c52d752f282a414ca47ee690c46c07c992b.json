{"title":"Birth preparedness and complication readiness among recently delivered women in Hargeisa town, Somaliland: A community-based cross-sectional study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302168","date":1713448800000,"content":"<p>by Abdeta Muktar Ahmed, Mohamed Abdilahi Ahmed, Mohammed Hassen Ahmed</p>\r\nBackground <p>About 287,000 mothers lost their lives due to pregnancy and delivery in 2020 worldwide. Birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) is an approach used to utilize the timely use of skilled maternal and neonatal services. Preparing mothers for childbirth and against its dangers has great importance in reducing maternal mortality. Little is known about BPCR and influencing factors in Hargeisa town, Somaliland.</p> Objective <p>To assess the level of BPCR and its associated factors among recently delivered women in Hargeisa.</p> Methods <p>A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in September 2022 among 300 women who delivered in the one-year time interval before the study period. A census was done to identify the women, and then they were selected by simple random sampling. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a pre-structured questionnaire. A woman was considered prepared for birth if she made preparations for at least three of the BPCR components. Data were cleaned, entered, and analyzed using SPSS V.25. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with a cut-point of 0.05 significance level.</p> Results <p>From a total of 300 women, 38.3% had good knowledge of BPCR, and only one-fourth (25%) were prepared for birth and its complications. Access and media usage (AOR = 9.64, CI 1.09–82.248), receiving health education about BPCR (AOR = 3.75, CI 1.01–13.87), giving birth at health institutions (AOR = 6.02, CI 1.39–25.95), and good knowledge of key danger signs of pregnancy (AOR = 0.017, CI 0.004–0.069) were factors significantly associated with BPCR practice.</p> Conclusion <p>The study identified that the BPCR level was very low compared to many other studies. Such a low BPCR level may have a negative impact on maternal health and lives, hindering interventions conducted to reduce maternal mortality rates. All concerned bodies should consider the importance of awareness creation regarding BPCR in their core interventions.</p>","author":"Abdeta Muktar Ahmed","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1e295b5982ed6271c4205afdb8be8c52d752f282a414ca47ee690c46c07c992b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
