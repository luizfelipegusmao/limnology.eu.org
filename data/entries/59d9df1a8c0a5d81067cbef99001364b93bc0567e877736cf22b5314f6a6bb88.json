{"title":"Robotic Seeding of Large Porous Scaffolds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1815/v1","date":1719389316000,"content":"This study introduces an innovative seeding method for cells on large scaffolds (1-100 sqcm) with an accuracy of 0.1mm, comparing the conventional drop-wise seeding technique with an automated seeding approach using an open sourced robotic liquid handling system (OpenLH). This automated system employs an algorithm in which the user inputs the desired droplet volume and seeding pattern dimensions such in number of rows, columns and distance between droplets, thus optimizing the distribution of cells on the scaffold. By adjusting these parameters, the method achieves greater accuracy and consistency over manual seeding and requires less operation space volume than dynamic seeding. Additionally, the systemâ€™s tip replacement feature can support the precise seeding of multiple cell types on a single scaffold and the dispensing of growth factors to foster patterns of cell differentiation and proliferation on the large 3D scaffold. This seeding method not only enhances the precision and efficiency of cell distribution on scaffolds but also shows significant potential for scalability in the cultured meat industry, where large scaffolds are essential. The adoption of such automated systems could promote efficient scaffold-based tissue engineering by promoting uniform cell distribution and enabling the creation of complex tissue constructs, thereby advancing both biomedical research and cultured meat production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59d9df1a8c0a5d81067cbef99001364b93bc0567e877736cf22b5314f6a6bb88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
