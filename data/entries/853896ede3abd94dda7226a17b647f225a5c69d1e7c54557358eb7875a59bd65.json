{"title":"Synthesis, Herbicidal Activity, and Molecular Mode of Action Evaluation of Novel Quinazolinone−Phenoxypropionate Hybrids Containing a Diester Moiety","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0061/v1","date":1725260528000,"content":"To develop aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides with novel structure and improved activity, a total of twenty-eight novel quinazolinone–phenoxypropionate derivatives containing a diester moiety were synthesized and tested for herbicidal activity. The bioassay results in the greenhouse showed that QPEP-I-4 exhibited excellent herbicidal activity against E. crusgalli, D. sanguinalis, S. alterniflora, E. indica, and P. alopecuroides with inhibition rates &amp;gt;80% at a dosage of 150 g ha-1, and displayed higher crop safety to G. hirsutum, G. max, and A. hypogaea than the commercial herbicide quizalofop-p-ethyl. Studying of the molecular mode of action by phenotypic observation, membrane permeability evaluation, and transcriptomic analysis revealed that a growth inhibition of plant by QPPE-I-4 was the result from damage of plants biomembrane. The evaluation of ACCase activity in vivo indicated that QPPE-I-4 could inhibit ACCase and may be a new type of ACCase inhibitor. The present work demonstrated that QPPE-I-4 could serve as a lead compound for further developing novel AOPP herbicides.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"853896ede3abd94dda7226a17b647f225a5c69d1e7c54557358eb7875a59bd65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
