{"title":"Biomathematics in Cancer Research: Looking into How Mathematical Models Are Used to Understand Tumor Growth and the Effectiveness of Different Treatment Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2425/v1","date":1727699395000,"content":"This paper explores the critical role of biomathematics in cancer research, focusing on how mathematical models enhance our understanding of tumor growth and optimize treatment strategies. It begins with an overview of cancer biology, highlighting the complexities of tumor dynamics and the molecular mechanisms driving growth. The paper then delves into various mathematical modeling approaches, including deterministic, stochastic, and agent-based models, illustrating their applications in predicting tumor behavior and treatment responses. Case studies demonstrate the real-world impact of these models on optimizing chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Challenges such as data availability, model complexity, and clinical translation are discussed, alongside future directions in the field, including advances in computational power and personalized medicine. Ultimately, this research emphasizes the transformative potential of biomathematics in improving cancer treatment outcomes and underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f3e58a8e836b5aaeba57fb0353ed3109b086fc495ecbec01a2969324c55cb1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
