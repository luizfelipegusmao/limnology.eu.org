{"title":"Placental Epigenome Impacts Fetal Development: Effects of Maternal Nutrients and Gut Microbiota","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0214/v1","date":1714975345000,"content":"Evidence is emerging on the role of maternal diet, gut microbiota, and other lifestyle factors in establishing lifelong health and disease, which are determined by trans-generationally inherited epigenetic modifications. Understanding epigenetic mechanisms may help identify novel biomarkers for pregnancy-related exposure, burden, or disease risk. Such biomarkers are essential for developing tools for the early detection of risk factors and exposure levels. It is necessary to establish the exposure threshold to the fetus due to nutrient deficiencies or other environmental factors that can lead to clinically relevant epigenetic changes that modulate disease risks. This narrative review summarizes the latest updates on the roles of maternal nutrients (n-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, vitamins) and gut microbiota on the placental epigenome and its impacts on fetal brain development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e53f6560a67c9578b18d192038d379c498821afb5acb3dd133373d8c59fe474b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
