{"title":"Correlating the Segmental-Relaxation Time of Polystyrene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0223/v1","date":1719911100000,"content":"A previous related paper dealing with the density relaxation of polystyrene (PS) has shown that the equilibrium relaxation time (eq) has a purely exponential temperature dependence (ETD) below ≈ 100ºC. Such an ETD is now also confirmed based upon available dielectric-spectra data for PS. By combining the ETD behavior of eq (or aT) at low temperatures with a VFTH behavior at higher temperatures (based mainly on available recoverable-shear-compliance data), a composite correlation for eq (or aT) is developed which is continuous with continuous slope at a crossover temperature which is found to be 99.22ºC, where eq = 92.15 sec. This composite representation is shown to describe (without any adjustable parameters) available independent data for the segmental-relaxation time over a finite range both above and below Tcrossover (i.e. the glass-transition temperature).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c238c692a739ae8dd1eed24402175754cbddf4a578aa707f091394fa0bf2a1dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
