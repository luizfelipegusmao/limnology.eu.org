{"title":"Removal of Glyphosate With Nanocellulose For Decontamination Purposes in Aquatic Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0196/v1","date":1714978034000,"content":"(1) Agricultural production is one of the most important, fundamental and resilient sectors. The excessive and incorrect use of agricultural pesticides has caused environmental pollution, with final destination in aquatic environments. Once in the aquatic environment, the decontamination process aimed at removing the pesticide is not always a simple task. There are expensive and low-efficiency procedures in the literature. In this sense, it is necessary to develop low-cost, sustainable procedures with high remediation capacity. Among the widely used agricultural pesticides, glyphosate stands out for weed control, which according to the World Health Organization (WHO) is potentially carcinogenic in humans. (2) In this context, a nanocellulose-based biopolymer was developed to recover glyphosate from aquatic environments. Different methodologies have been developed, the most interesting being membrane immersion in aquatic systems. The analytical technique for quantifying glyphosate was molecular spectrophotometry in the ultraviolet â€“ visible range (UV-VIS); (3) Nanocellulose showed a value of 4.7 mg of Glyphosate per g of nanocellulose, and organomodified nanocellulose showed the removal of 6.1 mg of Glyphosate per g of nanocellulose, evaluated in pseudo-first order kinetic models; (4) The biomaterial has a sustainable and renewable origin and has potential for contaminant removal and can be applied to contaminated aquatic systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"612c0a668eee12c25a064c7d08da851f40beac812eed597f40ec1824d4c2a16b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
