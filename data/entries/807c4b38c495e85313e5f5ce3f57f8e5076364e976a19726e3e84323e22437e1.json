{"title":"Complex Photonic Integrated Resonators Modeled Using Scattering Matrix Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0477/v1","date":1728379120000,"content":"We propose a universal approach for modeling complex integrated photonic resonators based on the scattering matrix method. By dividing devices into basic elements including directional couplers and connecting waveguides, our approach can be used to model integrated photonic resonators with both unidirectional and bidirectional light propagation, with the simulated spectral response showing good agreement with experimental results. A simplified form of our approach, which divides devices into several independent submodules such as microring resonators and Sagnac interferometers, is also introduced to streamline the calculation of spectral transfer functions. Finally, we discuss the deviations introduced by approximations in our modeling, along with strategies for improving modeling accuracy. Our approach is universal across different integrated platforms, providing a useful tool for designing and optimizing integrated photonic devices with complex configurations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"807c4b38c495e85313e5f5ce3f57f8e5076364e976a19726e3e84323e22437e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
