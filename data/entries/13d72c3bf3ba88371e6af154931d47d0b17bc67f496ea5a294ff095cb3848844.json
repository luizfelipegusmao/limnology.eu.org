Annual rainfall is high with little seasonality. Study plots with seedling subplots were in fringe, riverine, and interior hydrogeomorphic zones along four small rivers. The height of each seedling was measured each year and was designated each time as being under an open, partially closed, or closed canopy. Growth rates of both species were slow, and no seedling that was newly established during the study became a sapling (2 m). Many seedlings stopped growing for long periods of time. <em>Bruguiera</em> seedlings were more numerous than <em>Rhizophora</em> seedlings. They grew faster than <em>Rhizophora</em> seedlings except in riverine zones. Predicted growth rates of <em>Bruguiera</em> were fastest under an open canopy and slowest under a closed canopy, but <em>Rhizophora</em> was not affected by canopy status. Overall mortality rates for the two species were similar, averaging 36% year<sup>−1</sup>. El-Niño-Southern Oscillation events did not affect growth or mortality but may have caused some defoliation.\n      </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"13d72c3bf3ba88371e6af154931d47d0b17bc67f496ea5a294ff095cb3848844","category":"Environment"}
