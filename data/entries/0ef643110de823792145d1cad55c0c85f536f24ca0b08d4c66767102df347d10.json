Brines are widely distributed in salt lakes in the world's three enormous plateaus and beyond and are classified into three types: sulfate-, chloride-, and carbonate-type brines. Sulfate-type brine forms in salt lakes, whereas carbonate-type brine results from magmatic and hydrothermal activity. Chloride-type brine forms in deep basins due to the reduction and transformation of buried brine. Li in brine plays a critical role in clean energy transitions, and K in brine is important for potash production. Recently, new techniques for extracting Li from brine have been developed, and the large-scale, comprehensive development pattern of brines has formed the basis for a recycling economic model, which contributes to the efficient use of brines for potash and Li<span>2</span>CO<span>3</span> development and CO<span>2</span> emission reduction. This article reviews the genesis of brines and highlights new utilization techniques, trends, and sustainable development.</p></div>","author":"Chenglin Liu, Tim K.
