In vivo experiments involved the use of MCD and HFD diets to induce NASH in mouse models for observing the effects of dopamine on NASH disease progression.<div>Results</div>Our study showed that dopamine significantly downregulated the expression levels of Caspase 1, IL-1β and IL18 in the HepG2 NASH cell model. In addition, dopamine could inhibit the TGF-β1-induced accumulation of collagen I and α-SMA in LX2 cells. In vivo experiments have shown that dopamine attenuation in mice is associated with MCD diet-induced and HFD-induced steatohepatitis. Mechanically, dopamine inhibits the p65 signaling pathway in NASH.<div>Conclusion</div>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the role of dopamine in ameliorating the symptoms of NASH and provides a direction for future research on the application of the dopaminergic system to liver disease.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"990c91dcff6ba117e2702bf1e7c18b4b1ed75e9bd5a79f3760500293b88f1807","category":"Environment"}
