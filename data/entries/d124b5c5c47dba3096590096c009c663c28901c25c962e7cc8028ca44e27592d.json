{"title":"Improved Strategies for Modeling Sick Sinus Syndrome in Rats: Balancing Efficacy and Animal Care","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0327/v1","date":1719999567000,"content":"Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is a disease of sinus rhythm abnormalities. This study aimed to establish an SSS model by injecting 3% NaOH into the jugular vein(JV). Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, 3% NaOH, and 10% NaOH groups. Anesthetized rats underwent electrocardiogram recording before right JV exposure. Rats in the experimental groups received NaOH injections at 0.01 ml/s, while the sham group did not. Model success was evaluated after one hour. Heart rate(HR) and rhythm were documented at 1 hour, 1 week, and 2 weeks post-molding, including HE staining, membrane ion transcription and expression, and calcium ion content test. In the 3% NaOH group, the model establishment rate was 87%,  and the mortality rate was 13%, whereas in the 10% NaOH group, they were 57%  and 43% respectively (P &lt; 0.01). The HR of the 3% NaOH group decreased at multiple time points post-molding (P &lt; 0.001), presenting as arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia. The JV sustained less damage, with necrosis of P cells, changes in membrane ion channels, and reduced calcium ion distribution. In conclusion, JV injection of 3% NaOH can establish the SSS model and benefit animals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d124b5c5c47dba3096590096c009c663c28901c25c962e7cc8028ca44e27592d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
