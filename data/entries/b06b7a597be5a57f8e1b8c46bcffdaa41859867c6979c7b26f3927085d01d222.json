{"title":"Integral Forms and Connections of Multi-Parameter Mittag-Leffler Functions with Fox-Wright and Hypergeometric Functions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2614/v1","date":1722432863000,"content":"In this study, the complex interactions between the well-known Mittag-Leffler functions with two, three, and four parameters are explored. We first study the integral forms of the Mittag-Leffler function $\\mathsf{E}_{\\alpha, \\beta}^{\\rho,\\kappa}(z)$ with the goal of clarifying its mathematical behaviours and features. Moreover, we create relations between these functions and generalised hypergeometric functions and Fox-Wright functions, expanding the range of their use and comprehension.  We explore a number of unique situations by in-depth examination, providing insight into the subtle characteristics of these functions. This investigation advances our theoretical knowledge and opens up possibilities for future applications in a number of scientific fields. As such, this study adds to the current conversation in mathematical analysis and is an important tool for both practitioners and researchers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b06b7a597be5a57f8e1b8c46bcffdaa41859867c6979c7b26f3927085d01d222","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
