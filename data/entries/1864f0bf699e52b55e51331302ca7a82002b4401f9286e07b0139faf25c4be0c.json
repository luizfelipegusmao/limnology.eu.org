{"title":"Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) in the Quantum Era: Challenges and Future Directions for Quantum-Resistant Cryptography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0816/v1","date":1723462200000,"content":"Internet of thing (IoT) has been used in different aspect of life as industry, and daily life. Aligned with IoT, Quantum computers have been generated with high features that can accomplish complicated tasks with high speed. IoT and Quantum computers donâ€™t match in resources and due to this collaboration between the two terms, it was found there are many challenges with quantum computers brought some security concerns. This paper will examine all challenges and future direction that face the use of IoT through using different quantum cryptograph methods. The first part on the paper discussed the vulnerabilities of existing cryptographic methods like RSA and ECC. these two methods were used as basic level for IoT security protocols. These cryptographic algorithms could be easily attacked by quantum computers so to ensure that IoT devices are secure must develop quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms. Next this paper will examine the challenges in implementing quantum resistant cryptographic algorithm in any IoT device through quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms such as lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, multivariate cryptography, and hash-based signatures. Then, the paper discussed the future direction of securing IoT in quantum computing. In conclusion, securing IoT devices in quantum presents many challenges that require to be addressed where quantum resistant algorithms can be a solution that mitigate threats.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1864f0bf699e52b55e51331302ca7a82002b4401f9286e07b0139faf25c4be0c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
