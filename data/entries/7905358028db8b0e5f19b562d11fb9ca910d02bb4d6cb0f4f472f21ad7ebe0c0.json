{"title":"Quality-Downgraded Fluorinated Carbon Nanotubes as Eco-Additives in Microgel Composites for Sustained Water Release","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1126/v1","date":1726299680000,"content":"While significant efforts have been made to recycle metals like lithium or cobalt for sustainable development in the battery industry, other high-value materials in the renewable energy sector, such as fluorinated carbon nanotubes (FCNTs), have not been adequately explored for re-utilization after their quality has been downgraded. FCNTs are expensive and energy-intensive to produce, making their sustainable use crucial. This study explores the potential of reusing quality-downgraded fluorinated carbon nanotubes (QD-FCNTs) as eco-friendly nano-additives in microgel composites for water retention applications. By employing a surface treatment process that avoids additional energy costs and environmentally harmful chemicals, we successfully enhanced the interaction between QD-FCNTs and microgels. This treatment significantly improved water retention time by reducing rapid evaporation, enabling sustained water release. Our findings demonstrate a promising avenue for the sustainable application of quality-downgraded fluorinated carbon nanotubes in agricultural and environmental technologies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7905358028db8b0e5f19b562d11fb9ca910d02bb4d6cb0f4f472f21ad7ebe0c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
