{"title":"Quality of Life and Respiratory Performance in the Laryngectomized Patient. Role of the Hme Filters during Physical Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1647/v1","date":1714036546000,"content":"Background: Permanent tracheostomy because of total laryngectomy surgery entails great conse-quences for the patient regarding respiratory physiopathology such as the filtering, humidifying, and heating function of the air by the nose is lost. The use of special stomal filters can determine adequate protection of the trachea-broncho-pulmonary system with a reduction in respiratory pathologies. In fact, in most cases laryngectomee patients are first cigarette smokers who for this reason already have also respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nDespite the availability of tracheal filters, multiple times, as reported in the literature, the patient tends to limit their use due to reported breathing difficulties, especially in conditions of intense breathing.\nMethods: The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the most suitable stomal filter for the laryngectomee patient during physical activity. The filters studied were an INHEALTH device (Blom-Singer SpeakFree HME); two ATOS devices (Provox® Life™ Energy HME and Provox® Life™ Home HME); and an FAHL device (Laryvox HME Sport).\nResults: For this purpose, the performances of 31 laryngectomee patients, subjected to medi-um-high physical effort, were analyzed through a standardized pneumological test, the Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT) which involves a sustained walk lasting six minutes, with evaluation , every 60 seconds, heart rate, oxygen saturation and meters travelled; furthermore, it examines two sub-jective indices, namely, the basal and final dyspnea index and the initial and final muscular fatigue index.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"293ff56042e7a46d1bda01b7e70331f7b663b7832993b7e12ca64966efc82f4b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
