{"title":"Daylight Influence on Architecture Studio Culture in Nigerian Universities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1594/v1","date":1724301481000,"content":"Productivity levels of architecture students have been ascertained via research to relate strongly to the quality of studio culture in architecture studios. Students' comfort is significantly influenced by the quality of daylight within architecture studios, as demonstrated by research findings. The comfort level in architecture studios is also known to influence the productivity of architecture students significantly. Building on separate research findings that have proven the individual impact of daylighting and studio culture on the performance of architecture students, this research aims to explore the potential connection between daylighting and studio culture. At the commencement of this research, data collection was via a qualitative approach in the form of interviews. At a later stage, we administered structured questionnaires for a quantitative analysis. From observations, many students would instead not work in their studios but elsewhere â€“ at the expense of cultivating a good studio culture. Hence, this research is pertinent in that it would discover the reason(s) behind this trend among architecture students in the sample universities and the contribution of daylighting to studio culture in these universities. The outcome of this research would provide a knowledge base to further improve the design of architecture studios in Nigerian universities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8b9ed2d4306786f7300341287d9cd1f177cbf08b5cc9a6cf1b163d21dbbccb09","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
