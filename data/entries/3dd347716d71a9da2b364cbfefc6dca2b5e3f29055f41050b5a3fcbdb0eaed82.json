{"title":"Networks Based on Graphs of Transient Intensities and Product Theorems in Their Modelling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0551/v1","date":1725634266000,"content":"The paper considers two models of queuing with a varying structure based on the introduction of additional transient intensities into known models or their combinations, which create stationary distributions convenient for calculation. In the first model, it is a probabilistic mixture of known stationary distributions with given weights. In the second model, this uniform distribution is repeatedly used in physical statistics. Both models are based on the selection of states, between which additional transient intensities are introduced. The algorithms used in the paper for introducing new transient intensities are closely related to the concept of flow in a deterministic transport network. The introduced controls are selected so that the marginal distribution of the combined system is a mixture of the marginal distributions of the combined systems with different weights determined by the introduced transient intensities. As a result, the process of functioning of the combined system is obtained by switching processes corresponding to different combined systems at certain points in time.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dd347716d71a9da2b364cbfefc6dca2b5e3f29055f41050b5a3fcbdb0eaed82","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
