However, this scope of investigation is complicated by the continued miniaturization and geometric complexity of individual components and structural features on devices. Atom Probe Tomography (APT) has the potential to meet this demand with the unique capability of three-dimensional, chemical mapping at the atomic-scale [<a href=\"#ozae044.036-B1\">1</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"2c2c3c0bddacedc96f26f4074ad9c4ec596886181ddac65610be30f36cdb3b82","category":"Environment"}
