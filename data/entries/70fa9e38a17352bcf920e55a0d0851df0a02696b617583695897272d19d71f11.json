{"title":"Regional Aspects of Transformations in Agriculture: The Case of the Republic of Bulgaria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1733/v1","date":1729671522000,"content":"Transformations in agriculture not only change the ways in which natural resources and social capital are used, but are also a prerequisite for different opportunities to create added value and improve the viability of rural areas. The purpose of the article is to assess the differences and effects of transformations in agriculture in the Bulgarian regions. Based on statistical data from the Censuses of agricultural holdings in 2010 and 2020, the DEA analysis method was applied. Six models (3 input oriented and 3 output oriented) were constructed and tested, and the efficiency coefficients were assessed on regional level. The degree of structural changes and efficiency of the used production and other resources were evaluated and conclusions were drawn. In the majority of the models, differences are observed between the northern regions of the country and the South Western and South Central regions. The most significant are the efficiency coefficient of the labor force used and the output produced, the gross value added and the net mixed income. In the other models, multidirectional changes are observed. North Western is the region in which all calculated efficiency coefficients increase, and in North Eastern and South Eastern, the most calculated coefficients decrease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"70fa9e38a17352bcf920e55a0d0851df0a02696b617583695897272d19d71f11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
