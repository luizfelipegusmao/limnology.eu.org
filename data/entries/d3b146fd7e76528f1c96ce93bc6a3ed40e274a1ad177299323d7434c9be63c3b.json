{"title":"Single CsPbBr3 Perovskite Microcrystals: From Microcubes to Microrods with Improved Crystallinity and Green Emission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1799/v1","date":1721782501000,"content":"All-inorganic perovskite materials are promising in optoelectronics but their morphology is a key parameter for achieving high device efficiency. We prepared CsPbBr3 perovskite microcrystals with different shape, grown directly on planar substrate by conventional drop casting. We observed the formation of CsPbBr3 microcubes on bare indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass. Interestingly, with the same technique CsPbBr3 microrods were obtained on (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) modified ITO-glass, which we ascribe to modification of formation kinetics. The obtained micro-crystals exhibit orthorhombic structure. Green photoluminescence (PL) emission is revealed from the CsPbBr3 microrods. Contact angle measurements, Fourier-transform infrared and PL spectroscopies confirmed that APTES linked successfully to the ITO-glass substrate. We propose a qualitative mechanism to explain the anisotropic growth. The microrods exhibited improved PL and slower PL lifetime compared to the microcubes, likely due to diminished occurrence of defects. This work demonstrates the importance of the substrate surface to control the growth of perovskite single crystals and to boost the radiative recombination in view of high performance optoelectronic devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3b146fd7e76528f1c96ce93bc6a3ed40e274a1ad177299323d7434c9be63c3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
