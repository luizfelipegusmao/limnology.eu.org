The main aim of our study was to analyse the VDBP genotype and quantify the levels of VDBP and free vitamin D in a sample of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Methods: Multicentre, cross-sectional and prospective study includ-ing patients with CF, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency who were clinically stable. We investigated vitamin D levels (total and free) and the different VDBP haplotypes. Free vitamin D levels were measured using an electro-chemiluminescence assay. Results: A sample of 48 patients was ob-tained (52% male; median age 13.8 years). The most common allele of VDBP was Gc1s (72%)&gt;Gc2 (52%)&gt;Gc1f (27%). Median calcidiol was 21.2 ng/ml (IR 15.3 - 26.9), 81% had levels in the insufficiency range: 23 patients (48%) below 20 ng/ml, and 16 (33%) between 20 and 30 ng/ml. The median free vitamin D level was 4.2 pg/ml (IR 3.9 â€“ 5.6). A positive correlation was observed between calcidiol and free vitamin D levels (r=0.871; p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"913b3009ead8971c31e663ff080a4dbd5ea64d35125cb3c79cbeb1e5fbfb9bf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
