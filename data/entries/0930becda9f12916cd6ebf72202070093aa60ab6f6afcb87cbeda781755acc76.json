{"title":"IDH Mutations in Glioma: Molecular, Cellular, Diagnostic, and Clinical Implications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0393/v1","date":1728279445000,"content":"In 2021, the World Health Organization classified isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant gliomas as a distinct subgroup of tumors with genetic changes sufficient to enable a complete diagnosis. Patients with an IDH mutant glioma have improved survival which has been further enhanced by the advent of targeted therapies. IDH enzymes contribute to cellular metabolism, and mutations to specific catalytic residues result in the neomorphic production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). The accumulation of D-2-HG results in epigenetic alterations, oncogenesis and impacts the tumor microenvironment via immunological modulations. Here, we summarize the molecular, cellular, and clinical implications of IDH mutations in gliomas as well as current diagnostic techniques.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0930becda9f12916cd6ebf72202070093aa60ab6f6afcb87cbeda781755acc76","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
