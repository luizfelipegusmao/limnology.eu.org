We show here, in cultured cells and in a murine model, that the carboxyl terminal fragment of the muscarinic M<sub>2</sub> receptor, comprising the transmembrane regions 6 and 7 (M<sub>2</sub>tail), is expressed by virtue of an internal ribosome entry site localized in the third intracellular loop. Single-cell imaging and import in isolated yeast mitochondria reveals that M<sub>2</sub>tail, whose expression is up-regulated in cells undergoing integrated stress response, does not follow the normal route to the plasma membrane, but is almost exclusively sorted to the mitochondria inner membrane: here, it controls oxygen consumption, cell proliferation, and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reducing oxidative phosphorylation. Crispr/Cas9 editing of the key methionine where cap-independent translation begins in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), reveals the physiological role of this process in influencing cell proliferation and oxygen consumption at the endogenous level. The expression of the C-terminal domain of a GPCR, capable of regulating mitochondrial function, constitutes a hitherto unknown mechanism notably unrelated to its canonical signaling function as a GPCR at the plasma membrane. This work thus highlights a potential novel mechanism that cells may use for controlling their metabolism under variable environmental conditions, notably as a negative regulator of cell respiration.","author":"Irene Fasciani","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"1dfd68734bd437b3b2a505e1b60412cdedeb5c4f7018a3849c5b6b4a02a0c9e1","category":"Environment"}
