{"title":"Invasive Technologies in Generative Artificial Intelligence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1848/v1","date":1729691252000,"content":"This study proposes a new concept that explains the modern technological change: technology invasiveness that breaks into a scientific and technological ecosystem, with accelerated diffusion of large quantities of products leading to main change in the innovation ecotone that transfers knowledge and know-how in businesses and markets. Invasive technologies conquer scientific, technological and business space of alternative technologies and expand the knowledge space of adjacent possible by introducing radical innovations that support dynamic interactions between new technologies and emerging development and applications. This theoretical approach is empirically verified in emerging path-breaking technology of transformer, a deep learning architecture having unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms that create new contents and mimics human ability (Generative Artificial Intelligence). Statistical evidence here, based on patent analyses, reveals that the growth rate of transformer technology is 55.82% (over 2016-2023) more than double compared to 23.02% of all other technologies, such as Convolutional Neural Network: it is force that is revolutionizing the way societies interact with machines. Hence invasive technologies are considered as one of the major causes of global technological change and this study offers a profound exploration of how invasive technologies drive technological change, significantly contributing to our understanding of technological evolutionâ€™s dynamics and its societal and industry impacts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06e04441366a99ae5a83bf4ea250694ff7fd430832a9a69cce66565e546b5504","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
