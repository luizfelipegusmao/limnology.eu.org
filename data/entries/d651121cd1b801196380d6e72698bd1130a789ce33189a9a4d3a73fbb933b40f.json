{"title":"Target detection of helicopter electric power inspection based on the feature embedding convolution model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311278","date":1728309600000,"content":"<p>by Dakun Liu, Wei Zhou, Linzhen Zhou, Wen Guan</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aims to improve the helicopter electric power inspection process by using the feature embedding convolution (FEC) model to solve the problems of small scope and poor real-time inspection. First, simulation experiments and model analysis determine the keyframe and flight trajectory. Second, an improved FEC model is proposed, extracting features from aerial images in large ranges in real time and accurately identifying and classifying electric power inspection targets. In the simulation experiment, the accuracy of the model in electric power circuit and equipment detection is improved by 30% compared with the traditional algorithm, and the inspection range is expanded by 26%. In addition, this study further optimizes the model with reinforcement learning technology, conducts a comparative analysis of different flight environments and facilities, and reveals the diversity and complexity of inspection objectives. The performance of the optimized model in fault detection is increased by more than 36%. In conclusion, the proposed model improves the accuracy and scope of inspection, provides a more scientific strategy for electric power inspection, and ensures inspection efficiency.","author":"Dakun Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d651121cd1b801196380d6e72698bd1130a789ce33189a9a4d3a73fbb933b40f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
