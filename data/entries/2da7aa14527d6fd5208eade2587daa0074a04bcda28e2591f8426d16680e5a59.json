{"title":"Research on Acid Aging and Damage Pattern Recognition of GFRP Oil-Gas Gathering Pipeline Based on Acoustic Emission","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0956/v1","date":1720751276000,"content":"Pipelines extend thousands of kilometers to transport and distribute oil and gas. Given the challenges often faced with corrosion, fatigue, and other issues on steel pipes, the demand for glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) pipes is increasing in the oil and gas gathering and transmission systems. However, the medium transported through these pipelines contains multiple acid gases such as CO2 and H2S, as well as ions including Cl-、Ca2+、Mg2+、SO42-、CO32- and HCO3-. These substances can cause a series of problems, such as aging, debonding, delamination, and fracture. In this study, a series of aging damage experiments were conducted on V-shaped GFRP pipes with depths of 2mm and 5mm. The aging and failure of GFRP were studied under the combined effects of external force and acidic solution using acoustic emission (AE) techniques. It was found that the acidic aging solution promoted matrix damage, fiber/matrix desorption, and delamination damage in GFRP pipes over a short period. However, the overall aging effect was relatively weak. Based on the experimental data, the SSA-LSSVM algorithm was proposed and applied to the damage pattern recognition of GFRP. An average recognition rate of up to 90% was achieved, indicating that this method is highly suitable for analyzing AE signals related to GFRP damage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2da7aa14527d6fd5208eade2587daa0074a04bcda28e2591f8426d16680e5a59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
