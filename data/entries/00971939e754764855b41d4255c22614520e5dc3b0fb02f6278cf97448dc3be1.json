{"title":"Advancing Brainwave Therapy for Trauma: Precision Stimulation with Deep Brain Sound Technology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1814/v1","date":1724653397000,"content":"Objective This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Deep Brain Sound Stimulation (DBSS) as a novel treatment for trauma-related disorders, specifically Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Developmental Trauma Disorder (DTD). The research focuses on the user-reported outcomes of DBSS therapy delivered via a mobile application.   Method DBSS employs precise auditory stimulation targeted at specific brain regions involved in trauma response, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Data were collected from 267 users who purchased the DBSS therapy through the Apple App Store. User feedback regarding the effectiveness and satisfaction with the treatment was analyzed.   Results The majority of users reported significant improvements in emotional regulation, reduction of hyperarousal, and stabilization of interpersonal relationships. The treatment was well-tolerated, with minimal side effects reported. Despite the absence of traditional clinical trials, the findings suggest that DBSS could be a promising non-invasive therapy for trauma-related disorders.   Conclusions DBSS shows potential as an innovative therapy for PTSD and DTD by targeting key neurobiological mechanisms underlying trauma. Future studies should aim to confirm these results through clinical trials and further refine the therapy for broader clinical application.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00971939e754764855b41d4255c22614520e5dc3b0fb02f6278cf97448dc3be1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
