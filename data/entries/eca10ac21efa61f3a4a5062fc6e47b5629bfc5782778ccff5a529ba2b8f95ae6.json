{"title":"Estimating the abundance of benthic invertebrates from trap-catch data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/1/86/7379034?rss=1","date":1699315200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Trap fisheries targeting invertebrates are economically important but many of the target species lack stock assessments. One reason for this is the difficulty of estimating density. One important means by which density can be estimated uses the catch rates of baited traps that are spaced at different distances. With declining spacing, the sphere of attraction will increasingly overlap, leading to reductions in catches, allowing for the estimation of the density that is catchable by traps on the seabed. Here we review the analytical methods adopted across a range of studies and find that no consensus on robust methods exists. We propose an analytical method that assumes the trapping area is circular and that the chance of catching an individual declines linearly with distance from the trap. We apply this method to estimate the density and the trapping radius of crabs and gastropods from real and simulated datasets. The method estimated a trapping radius of between 4 and 86 m, and densities that are up to 2.5 times less and 13 times greater than estimates provided in the original sources, illustrating the sensitivity to methodology. In conclusion, we provide and test a standardized method to estimate the density of benthic invertebrates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"eca10ac21efa61f3a4a5062fc6e47b5629bfc5782778ccff5a529ba2b8f95ae6","category":"Environment"}
