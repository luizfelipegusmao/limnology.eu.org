{"title":"Design of a Robust Controller for Induction Motor Drive Systems Based on Extendable Fuzzy Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0675/v1","date":1718098667000,"content":"In this paper, an extendable fuzzy robust speed controller suitable for induction motor drive system was proposed. Firstly, the two-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) robust control technology with feedforward control and disturbance elimination method was adopted. Upon parameter variation and load disturbance, the motor drive system could utilize a robust controller to generate compensation signals and reduce the impact on controlling performance of the motor drive system. The magnitude of the compensation signal was adjusted via the weighting factor. However, should a fixed weighting factor be adopted, system instability might be generated easily when time delay and saturation of control force occur. Based on the above, the smart method of extendable fuzzy theory (EFT) was adopted in this paper to adjust adequate weighting factors, where the controlling performance of the induction motor drive system could be improved accordingly. The method divided the speed difference between motor speed command and actual speed of the induction motor, and the variation rate for such speed difference into 20 regional categories. The correlation degree between the speed difference of actual feedback, variation rate for speed difference and each regional category was then calculated, where more suitable weighting factor was selected. Therefore, the proposed extendable fuzzy robust 2DOF controller with variable weighting factor designed will allow better performance for response in speed tracking and load regulation. Lastly, the simulation software Matlab/Simulink was applied to simulate the utilization of the controlling method proposed for the induction motor drive system. For both the response in speed tracking and load regulation, the simulation results proved that the extendable fuzzy robust speed controller proposed provided better controlling performance than the conventional robust controller.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90941452634ad9b9e751f17524e4b244c54dfb6f751ddde62d73d3585938457c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
