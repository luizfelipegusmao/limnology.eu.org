{"title":"The Contribution of Off-Takers on Sustainable Agricultural Cluster Businesses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1825/v1","date":1729737629000,"content":"The agricultural sector is vital to the economies of many countries, particularly in developing country, providing livelihoods for millions and significantly contributing to GDP, food security, and social stability. Off-takers play a critical role in addressing these challenges by providing market certainty through predetermined purchase agreements. Engaging in contract farming and offering capital, technical assistance, and market access, off-takers help stabilize income, facilitate capital access, enhance technology adoption, and ensure business continuity. This research employs the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method and secondary data analysis. Based on the review, the multifaceted benefits of agricultural off-takers include increased production and fostering entrepreneurial skills among farmers. Hence, fostering partnerships between farmers and off-takers is crucial for enhancing agricultural competitiveness, sustainability, and farmer well-being. Leveraging off-takers' potential and promoting collaboration within agricultural clusters can foster thriving agricultural ecosystems, ensuring food security and economic prosperity in rural communities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d69d3cbb07cdbfb2d9a56bef0caddc668c64ea9da786a0990d8fe4879fd6680","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
