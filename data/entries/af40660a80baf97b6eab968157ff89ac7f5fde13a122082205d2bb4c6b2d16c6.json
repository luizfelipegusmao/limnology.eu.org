Forest stand dynamics of a short-stature tree species: Ecological knowledge for sustainable forest management. <i>Journal of Applied Ecology</i>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14662\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14662</a>.\n\nOliver stand dynamics conceptual model of tree stand succession was designed for tall trees but is not necessarily applicable to short-stature tree species, which represent a large proportion of forests/woodlands worldwide.\n\nThe South American short tree/shrub <i>Nothofagus antarctica</i> is a persuasive example of a short tree species that can benefit from an alternative conceptual model on stand dynamics. It also illustrates the high variability in stand dynamics observed in many short-stature trees.\n\nStand dynamics of short-stature trees remain generally understudied, hindering their management and silvicultural use. Although generalisations may not be feasible due to the continuum of growth forms and succession dynamics of short trees, there is an urgent need to increase our knowledge for their sustainable management.\n</p>","author":"Juan Paritsis","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"af40660a80baf97b6eab968157ff89ac7f5fde13a122082205d2bb4c6b2d16c6","category":"Environment"}
