{"title":"Recycling and deposition of inorganic carbon from calcium carbonate encrustations of charophytes","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12479?af=R","date":1708528481000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Many aquatic primary producers can use bicarbonates as a carbon source for photosynthesis. Charophytes of the two genera: <i>Chara</i> and <i>Nitellopsis</i> are quite efficient in this process. Some species of these macroalgae produce carbonate encrustations, mainly calcium carbonate, constituting up to 86% of the summer maximum dry weight of the standing crop. In this study, we analyzed the fate of inorganic carbon accumulated this way in <i>Chara</i> spp. and <i>Nitellopsis obtusa</i> from six Polish lakes located in two regions (warmer W Poland and cooler NE Poland). Our study distinguished two groups of charophyte species that differed in the way of CaCO<sub>3</sub> release from their summer standing crops. On average, the corticate <i>Chara rudi</i>s and <i>C</i>. <i>tomentosa</i> belonging to the first group were less efficient in depositing CaCO<sub>3</sub> from summer to autumn than the less corticate <i>C</i>. <i>contraria</i> and ecorticate <i>N</i>. <i>obtusa</i> of the second group. The latter two species were more efficient in inorganic carbon burial in sediments. On the contrary, dissolution of encrustation was more typical of the first species group and was facilitated by decreasing the pH and saturation index of calcite in lake water. The final output of CaCO<sub>3</sub> loss mainly resulted from combined species-specific features, lake water properties and overwintering patterns. Our study revealed that inorganic carbon cycling through charophytes involves burial and dissolution and is more complex than previously thought.</p>","author":"Małgorzata Strzałek, \nLech Kufel, \nKarina Apolinarska, \nMarcin Becher, \nElżbieta Biardzka, \nMichał Brzozowski, \nRafał Kiełczewski, \nGrzegorz Kowalewski, \nAndrzej Pukacz, \nMichał Woszczyk, \nMariusz Pełechaty","siteTitle":"Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"483837404a651916bc0fc2a986656bb768431b5eda97cb95890947a6f32d3b51","entryHash":"0ec110fbc442b087dcdfcf0fcef41fb45f9494071f8b991f8c46514129dbdce7","category":"Environment"}
