{"title":"Recent changes in riparian and floodplain vegetation in England and Wales and its geomorphic implications","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4243?af=R","date":1720605085000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Recent river studies in the United Kingdom have observed an increase in riparian vegetation and its potential impact on river channel change and sedimentation. Here, we quantify changes in floodplain and riparian vegetation during the first two decades of the 21st century along reaches of eight gravel-bed rivers in England and Wales that exhibit varied active and stable, single and multi-thread planforms. The analysis employs information drawn from open-access sources including national LiDAR surveys and the photographic analysis of repeat aerial and satellite imagery. Most reaches show an increase in woody vegetation across their floodplains reflecting both natural colonisation and deliberate planting, and all but one of the reaches show an increase in woody riparian vegetation cover along their riverbanks. Of the six reaches that have exposed riverine sediments, five show a reduction in exposed sediment area as a result of vegetation encroachment. Contrasts in the rate, extent and location of riparian change were associated with the stability of the channel planform, with differences seen between stable and more active reaches. The significance of riparian woodland in promoting riverbank stability is demonstrated. Riparian vegetation development varies between river reaches, largely in response to differing rates of channel movement but also because of multiple and diverse local decisions regarding the management of in-channel and channel-adjacent vegetation by landowners rather than a single national policy. We consider the relevance of our findings and the value of remote monitoring for future river management interventions.</p>","author":"Martin Dawson, \nAngela Gurnell, \nJohn Lewin, \nMark G.
