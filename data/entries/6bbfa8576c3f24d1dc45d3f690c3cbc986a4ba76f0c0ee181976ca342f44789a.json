{"title":"Fully Developed Open Channel Flow Over Clusters of Freshwater Mussels Partially Buried in a Gravel Bed","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035594?af=R","date":1722600893000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present study uses results of eddy-resolving numerical simulations to investigate the open channel flow over large clusters of freshwater mussels (<i>Unio elongatulus</i>) partially buried in a rough, gravel bed. The density of the mussels forming the array varies from 26 to 500 mussels/m<sup>2</sup>. The flow structure is analyzed at large distances from the leading edge of the mussel bed, where the flow can be considered fully developed. The effects of changing the mussel bed density, the filtering discharge, the burial level and the roughness of the bed surface in which mussels are burrowed, are investigated in terms of flow field, turbulent structures, drag forces, and bed shear stresses. It is found that strong interactions occur between energetic eddies generated by the larger gravels on the exposed bed surface and by the mussel shells. Simulations results show that for a burial depth close to 50% and a ratio between the average gravel size and the mussel protruding height of 0.13, the shell induced turbulence becomes dominant for mussel bed densities around 50 mussels/m<sup>2</sup>. The influence of the bed roughness becomes less relevant with increasing mussel density, as the generation of energetic eddies is mostly controlled by mussel-to-mussel interactions. For fixed bed roughness, burial level and filtering velocity, the mean streamwise drag force and the associated drag coefficient for the exposed part of each mussel decrease with increasing mussel density, even if strong variations are observed for individual mussels. For constant mussel bed density and burial level, the mean streamwise drag force and the mean drag coefficient decrease slightly with increasing bed roughness. Increasing the burial level decreases not only the drag forces but also the drag coefficients because of the more streamlined shape of the top of the mussels. Strong active filtering acts toward decreasing the mean streamwise force and the mean drag coefficient. The spanwise drag forces contribute significantly to the total drag force, especially for high mussel bed densities. Based on smooth bed calculations, bed-averaged shear stresses are reduced in highly dense clusters.</p>","author":"T. Lazzarin, \nG. Constantinescu, \nH. Wu, \nD. P.
