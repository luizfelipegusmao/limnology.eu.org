{"title":"A Multifaceted Exploration of the Biological Properties of Three Amazonian Fruit Seeds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0670/v1","date":1720503957000,"content":"Seeds of Arazá and Acai, in addition to the byproduct of the Sacha inchi seed, after the extraction of the oil known as Sacha Inchi oil press-cake (SIOPC), are considered wastes and often discarded; however, they have valuable potential as sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds. We aimed to analyze, the bromatological, and chemical composition of these three byproducts of the fruit industry. Further cytotoxic, antioxidant, and antihypertensive activities of extracts ethanol: water were evaluated through in vitro tests. The Bromatological test showed that SIOPC had a low protein content (8.1%), while AS had a high fiber content (48.9%), however, were poorest in nutrients Ethanol: water extracts from all seeds exhibited diverse profiles of secondary metabolites, with significant concentrations of polyphenols (155.88 µg gallic acid/100 mg dry weight), flavonoids (411.69 µg quercetin/100 mg dry weight), and carotenoids in AS (43.66 µg ß-carotene/100 mg dry weight). AS and ACS extracts excelled in ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging assays, and AS showed high α-glucosidase inhibition, previously unreported in the literature. The results suggest that both seeds and extracts are sources of nutritional and bioactive metabolites with high antioxidant and hypoglycemic activity. that could be used in the food industry and the health sector. These by-products underline the importance of sustainable harnessing these sources of the native Amazonian Region","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2634002d6a468c8a1842fb7ceb3df8f7f86c591f80c29c77af4fb86ceed925ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
