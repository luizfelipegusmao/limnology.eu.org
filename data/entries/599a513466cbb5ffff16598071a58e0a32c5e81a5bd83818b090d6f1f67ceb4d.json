{"title":"A New Hyperchaotic Image Encryption Scheme Based on DNA Computing and SHA-512","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2216/v1","date":1724987985000,"content":"With the fast growth of smartphones and digital cameras, massive images are generated every day in the world. They are easily transmitted on the insecure channel-Internet. It has been a hot spot for protecting sensitive images during communication. A new cryptosystem is proposed using a six dimensional (6D) hyperchaotic system and DNA computing. The hash value is obtained with the function of SHA-512. It keeps the encrypted result closely connected with the original image. The initial values of the cryptosystem are produced with the hash value and the secret key. The pixel is divided into four parts, and a large matrix is formed. Scrambling is performed on the new image. DNA coding, modern DNA complementary rules, DNA computing, and DNA decoding are performed on the new image. Diffusion is also executed, and ciphered image is achieved finally. The experimental result reveals the outcome of the proposed algorithm. Security analysis shows that the designed algorithm has a huge secret key space, low correlation, and high sensitivity. It also signifies that the designed algorithm could protect against common attacks and  is more secure than some existing methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"599a513466cbb5ffff16598071a58e0a32c5e81a5bd83818b090d6f1f67ceb4d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
