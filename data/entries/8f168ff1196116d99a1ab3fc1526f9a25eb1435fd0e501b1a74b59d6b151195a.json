{"title":"Development of Innovative Composite Nanofiber: Enhancing Polyamide-6 with &epsilon;-Poly-L-lysine for Medical and Protective Textiles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0027/v1","date":1717393409000,"content":"A novel electrospun nanofiber was developed using polyamide-6 (PA) and ε-poly-L-lysine (PL). PA is a popular textile polymer having desirable mechanical and thermal properties, chemical stability, and biocompatibility. However, PA nanofibers are prone to bacterial growth and user discomfort. PL, a natural homopolyamide, is non-toxic, antimicrobial, and hydrophilic but lacks spinnability due to its low molecular weight. Given its similar backbone structure as PA, with an additional amino side chain, PL was integrated with PA to develop multifunctional nanofibers. This study explores a simple, scalable method to obtain PL nanofibers by utilizing the structurally similar PA as the base. The goal was to enhance the functionality of PA by addressing its drawbacks. The study demonstrates spinnability of varying concentrations of PL with base PA while exploring compositions with higher PL concentrations than previously reported. Electrospinning parameters were studied to optimize the nanofiber properties. The effects of PL addition on morphology, hydrophilicity, thermal stability, mechanical performance, and long-term antimicrobial activity of nanofibers were evaluated. The inclusion of PL in PA-based nanofibers resulted in super hydrophilicity, increased tensile strength, and efficient antimicrobial properties with long-term stability. These enhanced characteristics hold promise for the composite nanofiber’s application in medical and protective textiles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f168ff1196116d99a1ab3fc1526f9a25eb1435fd0e501b1a74b59d6b151195a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
