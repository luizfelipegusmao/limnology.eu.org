Changes or conversion of land from non-built areas to residential areas or other uses result in the area of water catchment areas being reduced. Another no less important factor is socio-economic factors. One of the socio-economic problems that causes flooding every year in Pekanbaru City is waste management. Garbage thrown carelessly by Pekanbaru people obstructs drainage channels and river flows and causes flooding. Another socio-economic problem is water use behavior. The majority of water used for daily needs, bathing and washing toilets comes from groundwater. The use of groundwater in large and continuous quantities results in land subsidence and contributes to an increase in flood inundation. Analysis of spatial planning strategies and community behavior towards flood control efforts using Participatory Prospective Analysis (PPA). Prospective analysis in this study was used to determine the dominant variables that influence strategy determination. This method is a tool designed to find out or investigate and anticipate changes with the participation of experts or stakeholders. The prospective method is a tool used for policy analysis, especially in research involving sustainable development, because it can facilitate the anticipation of change in an unstable environment. The results of the research show that spatial planning strategies and community behavior in flood control are carried out with the coordination of technical stakeholders related to flood control, flood management includes before a disaster occurs, during a disaster and after a disaster, flood plain management, includes determining flood boundaries, determining zoning, supervision and monitoring as well as community involvement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b139c2c5ec797f975df0e1f1d7dc9f82611c8586550c4af7a5d1645ba8ab2e13","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
