{"title":"HPV, HBV, and HIV-1 Viral Integration Site Mapping: A Streamlined Workflow from NGS to Genomic Insights of Carcinogenesis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1848/v1","date":1716890116000,"content":"Viral integration within the host genome plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. Various disruptive mechanisms are involved, leading to genomic instability, mutations, and DNA damage. With next-generation sequencing (NGS), we can now precisely identify viral and host genomic breakpoints and chimeric sequences, which are useful for integration site analysis. In this study, we evaluated a commercial hybrid-capture NGS panel specifically designed for detecting three key viruses: HPV, HBV, and HIV-1. We also tested workflows for Viral Hybrid Capture (VHC) and Viral Integration Site (VIS) analysis, leveraging customized viral databases in CLC Microbial Ge-nomics. By analyzing sequenced data from virally infected cancer cell lines (including SiHa, HeLa, CaSki, C-33A, DoTc2, 2A3, SCC154 for HPV; 3B2, SNU-182 for HBV; and ACH-2 for HIV-1), we precisely pinpointed viral integration sites. The workflow also highlighted disrupted and neigh-boring human genes that may play a crucial role in tumor development. Our results included in-formative virus-host read mappings, genomic breakpoints, and integration circular plots. These visual representations enhance our understanding of the integration process. In conclusion, our seamless end-to-end workflow bridges the gap in understanding viral contributions to cancer development, paving the way for improved diagnostics and treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55d318c95494ad76ded152be030e32f1a60989da88a3f611f4275a9dab703278","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
