{"title":"Influence of biceps-triceps ratio on golf swing performance","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307547","date":1721743200000,"content":"<p>by Yue Zou, Niall MacFarlane</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study examines how maintaining a straight leading arm affects the muscle strength balance between the biceps and triceps in golfers and its influence on golf performance.</p> Methods <p>We recruited 20 male participants aged 18–45, including 10 golfers and 10 non-golfers. The participants’ average age was 25.6±6.2 years, height 1.8±0.07 m, and weight 75.6±10.2 kg. We measured isometric and isokinetic muscle strength using the Primus RS Dynamometer (BTE Technologies, Hanover, MD, USA) and assessed golf swing performance with the Optishot 2 Golf Simulator (Optishot, Brighton, MI, USA).</p> Results <p>Golfers exhibited significantly greater triceps strength (P = 0.02) and a lower biceps-to-triceps strength ratio (P = 0.002) than non-golfers. Low-handicap golfers showed more centered and consistent ball impacts compared to mid-handicap golfers. There were no significant differences in swing path and face angles between low- and mid-handicap golfers. Muscle strength and the biceps-to-triceps strength ratio correlated with driving distance, as well as the frequencies of specific swing paths, face angles, and ball impact points, highlighting the complex interplay between muscle balance and swing performance.</p> Conclusion <p>Greater triceps strength and a lower biceps-to-triceps strength ratio are key for maintaining a straight leading arm, especially in skilled golfers. While increased muscle strength tends to enhance driving distance, it does not necessarily improve accuracy. Consistent ball impact points may indicate higher skill levels. Future research should involve a larger, more diverse participant pool to validate these findings and further explore the complex nature of golf swing performance.</p>","author":"Yue Zou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"57f0e6991ab925f9bc47b7f4d380740700b773d516e0c0b06f6c1d61b8b233e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
