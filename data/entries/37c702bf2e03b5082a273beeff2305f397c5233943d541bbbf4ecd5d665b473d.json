Therefore, to fully exploit the model performance, researchers have focused on network structure and hyperparameter selection using various swarm intelligence algorithms for optimization. Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), a classic heuristic method that simulates the sparrowsâ€™ foraging and anti-predatory behavior, has demonstrated excellent performance in various optimization problems. Hence, in this study, the Multi-Strategy Modified Sparrow Search Algorithm (MSMSSA) is applied to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to construct an arbitrage spread prediction model (MSMSSA-LSTM). In the modified algorithm, the good point set theory, the proportion-adaptive strategy, and the improved location update method are introduced to further enhance the spatial exploration capability of the sparrow. The proposed model was evaluated using the real spread data of rebar and hot coil futures in the Chinese futures market. The obtained results showed that the mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and mean absolute error of the proposed model had decreased by a maximum of 58.5%, 65.2%, and 67.6% compared to several classical models. The model has high accuracy in predicting arbitrage spreads, which can provide some reference for investors.","author":"Shenjie Cheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"37c702bf2e03b5082a273beeff2305f397c5233943d541bbbf4ecd5d665b473d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
