{"title":"Designing novel multiepitope mRNA vaccine targeting Hendra virus (HeV): An integrative approach utilizing immunoinformatics, reverse vaccinology, and molecular dynamics simulation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312239","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Ahmad Abdullah Mahdeen, Imam Hossain, Md. Habib Ullah Masum, Sajedul Islam, T. M. Fazla Rabbi</p>\r\n\r\nHuman and animal health is threatened by Hendra virus (HeV), which has few treatments. This <i>in-silico</i> vaccine design study focuses on HeV G (glycoprotein), F (fusion protein), and M (matrix protein). These proteins were computationally assessed for B and T-cell epitopes after considering HeV strain conservation, immunogenicity, and antigenicity. To improve vaccination immunogenicity, these epitopes were selectively ligated into a multiepitope construct. To improve vaccination longevity and immunological response, adjuvants and linkers were ligated. G, F, and M epitopes were used to create an mRNA HeV vaccine. Cytotoxic, helper, and linear B-lymphocytes’ epitopes are targeted by this vaccine. The population coverage analysis demonstrates that multi-epitope vaccination covers 91.81 percent of CTL and 98.55 percent of HTL epitopes worldwide. GRAVY evaluated the vaccine’s well-characterized physicochemical properties -0.503, indicating solubility and functional stability. Structure analysis showed well-stabilized 2° and 3° structures in the vaccine, with alpha helix, beta sheet, and coil structures (Ramachandran score of 88.5% and Z score of -3.44). There was a strong affinity as shown by docking tests with TLR-4 (central score of -1139.4 KJ/mol) and TLR-2 (center score of -1277.9 KJ/mol). The coupled V-apo, V-TLR2, and V-TLR4 complexes were tested for binding using molecular dynamics simulation where extremely stable complexes were found. The predicted mRNA structures provided significant stability. Codon optimization for <i>Escherichia</i>. <i>coli</i> synthesis allowed the vaccine to attain a GC content of 46.83% and a CAI score of 1.0, which supports its significant expression. Immunological simulations indicated vaccine-induced innate and adaptive immune reactions. Finally, this potential HeV vaccine needs more studies to prove its efficacy and safety.","author":"Ahmad Abdullah Mahdeen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ac23f51ed8536170877179d9313eca64dfb1e2822f88e7f1aa5e8e24f2f3fafa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
