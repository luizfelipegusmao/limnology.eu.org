{"title":"Projecting expected growth period of bivalves in a coastal temperate sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10393?af=R","date":1713337200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The impact of climate warming on coastal benthic fauna is already observed, but forecasting their long-term fate remains challenging. This study uses δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>shell</sub> data of specimens of five bivalve species collected at six locations and results from kilometer-scale atmosphere–ocean climate model for the time intervals of 1987–2017 and 2070–2100, to estimate changes in bivalve growth phenology. All species will benefit from climate warming during winter, experiencing a longer growing season than currently. The growth of <i>Aequipecten opercularis</i>, <i>Flexopecten glaber</i>, and <i>Pecten jacobaeus</i> will decrease in summer, resulting in up to 3 months of reduced growth per year. <i>Glycymeris pilosa</i> and <i>Venus verrucosa</i> in the southern Adriatic Sea will be more affected than those in the north, with up to 4 months longer annual growth. These findings can inform adaptation plans for bivalve management in the Adriatic Sea but also in areas where the studied species are present.</p>","author":"Petra Zemunik Selak, \nCléa Denamiel, \nMelita Peharda, \nBernd R.
