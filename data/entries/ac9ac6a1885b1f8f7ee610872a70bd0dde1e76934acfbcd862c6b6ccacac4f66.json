{"title":"Relationship Between E-Ethical Leadership and Emotional Exhaustion: A Moderated Mediation Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0722/v1","date":1723429996000,"content":"The risk factors and positive factors of teleworking have been widely analyzed. Emotional exhaustion has been one of the most studied among them. However, the impact of ethical leadership in virtual environments has remained completely unnoticed. There is no clear answer to whether the ethical leader is a factor that buffers or accelerates stress-related processes in teleworking. Furthermore, the role of perceived work autonomy as a theoretical mechanism that protects against specific adverse psychological outcomes requires more scientific evidence because the results obtained so far are confusing and contradictory. Therefore, this study explores how and when ethical leadership influences emotional exhaustion through work autonomy and teleworking intensity (TI).\nThe sample consisted of 448 professionals from six organizations in the Colombian electricity sector. The mediation effect was evaluated through a four-step procedure, and the moderated mediation model was analyzed using statistical tools such as PROCESS and AMOS macros for SPSS.\nSurprisingly, our results revealed a positive relationship between ethical leadership and emotional exhaustion, with work autonomy potentially mediating this relationship. However, teleworking intensity (TI) was found to moderate this mediation process. Specifically, the negative impact of ethical leadership on emotional exhaustion was nullified when TI was high. Moreover, a high level of TI strengthened the relationship between ethical leadership and work autonomy, while weakening the positive relationship between work autonomy and emotional exhaustion.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests a potential positive relationship between ethical leadership and emotional exhaustion from the follower's perspective. However, the number of teleworking days can influence this trend, potentially even reversing it. In other words, teleworking intensity (TI) is a resource as its intensity increases, and it can alter the direction of work autonomy and reconfigure the relationship between ethical leadership and emotional exhaustion. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to analyze these variables, significantly contributing to our understanding of the attributes of ethical leadership and its impact on employee well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac9ac6a1885b1f8f7ee610872a70bd0dde1e76934acfbcd862c6b6ccacac4f66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
