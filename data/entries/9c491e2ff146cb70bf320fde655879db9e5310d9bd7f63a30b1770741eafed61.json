{"title":"Constituents From Brazilian Propolis Against Edwardsiella ictaluri and Flavobacterium covae, Two Bacteria Affecting Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14030?af=R","date":1728551028000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p><i>Edwardsiella ictaluri</i> and <i>Flavobacterium covae</i> are two bacteria species that cause diseases in farm-raised channel catfish (<i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>) that cause heavy economic damage to the aquaculture industry, particularly to the channel catfish farming. In search for environmentally benign antibacterial compounds active against <i>E. ictaluri</i> and <i>F. covae</i>, we investigated the constituents isolated from Brazilian red, brown and green propolis. We have also synthetically modified active constituents to see if lipophilicity plays a role in enhancing antibacterial activities. Vestitol, neovestitol and methylvestitol were found to be the active constituents with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) relative to drug control florfenicol (RDCF) values (MIC<sup>−</sup>RDCF) of 7.6, 7.6 and 7.9 mg/L, respectively, against <i>F. covae</i>. The activity against <i>E. ictaluri</i> was not significant.</p>","author":"Victor P. Ribeiro, \nJairo K. Bastos, \nMarcuslene D. Harries, \nPhaedra N. Page, \nNatascha Techen, \nKumudini M.
