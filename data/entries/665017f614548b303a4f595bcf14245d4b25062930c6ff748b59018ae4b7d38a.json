{"title":"Estimating the human bottleneck for contact tracing","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae283/7714044?rss=1","date":1721088000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of contact tracing for epidemiological mitigation. Contact tracing interviews (CTIs) typically rely on episodic memory, which is prone to decline over time. Here, we provide a quantitative estimate of reporting decline for age- and gender-representative samples from the United Kingdom and Germany, emulating &gt;15,000 CTIs. We find that the number of reported contacts declines as a power function of recall delay and is significantly higher for younger subjects and for those who used memory aids, such as a scheduler. We further find that these factors interact with delay: Older subjects and those who made no use of memory aids have steeper decline functions. These findings can inform epidemiological modeling and policies in the context of infectious diseases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"665017f614548b303a4f595bcf14245d4b25062930c6ff748b59018ae4b7d38a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
