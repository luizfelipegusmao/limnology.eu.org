{"title":"Codes with Weighted Poset Metrics Based on the Lattice of Subgroups of Z_m","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1556/v1","date":1729499657000,"content":"By combining a lattice subgroup diagram of Z_m with a weighted poset metric, we introduce a new weighted coordinates poset metric for codes over Z_m , called LS-poset metric. When I is an ideal in a poset, the concept of I-perfect codes with LS-poset metric is investigated. We obtain a Singleton bound for codes with LS-poset metric and define MDS codes. When the poset in poset metric is a chain, we provide sufficient conditions for a code with LS-poset metric to be r-perfect for some r âˆˆ N .","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c5798d8bfa69e6c584953c634bd089ce6466669ae6d0fe60ea012b5f522a731a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
