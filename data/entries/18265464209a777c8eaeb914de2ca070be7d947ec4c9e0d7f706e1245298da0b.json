It is sporadically caught south of Iceland during the annual International Ecosystem Summer Survey of the Nordic Seas. In total, 43 specimens were caught from 2009 to 2021, of which 41 specimens were caught during 2017–2021. All specimens, except one, were caught using a pelagic trawl (cod-end mesh-size: 50 mm) close to the surface (trawl depth: 0–35 m) with in situ temperature ranging from 9 to 13°C. The area south of Iceland is characterized by having warmer temperatures than other areas around the island, which might be indicative of a northern limit for the distribution of black ruff. The fish were primarily in the range of 29–46 cm with a few larger individuals up to 71 cm. Fourteen fish, caught in 2017 and 2021, were dissected to gather biological information on this species. These fish were all juveniles with no obvious sign of gonad development. Correlations between total length, fork length, and standard length are presented. Otoliths were thin and delicate with a length of ~13–16 mm, and otolith size (length, width, and area) was correlated with fish size. Much of the stomach content was at an advanced stage of digestion, but some contents could be identified and consisted of invertebrates, primarily of the orders Amphipoda and Calanoida with some unidentified fish also present.</p>","author":"James Kennedy, \nAnna Heiða Ólafsdóttir, \nSvandís Eva Aradóttir, \nSvanhildur Egilsdóttir, \nChristophe Pampoulie","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"18265464209a777c8eaeb914de2ca070be7d947ec4c9e0d7f706e1245298da0b","category":"Environment"}
