{"title":"Fabrication of Anti-fatigue Double-Wrapped Yarns With Excellent Mechanical Properties for Generating Compression Fabrics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0729/v1","date":1712801192000,"content":"Elastic yarns are the key component of high-performance compression garments. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate anti-fatigue yarns with high mechanical force and long elongation for generating compression garments with prolonged wear. In this paper, we report the development of anti-fatigue double-wrapped yarns with excellent mechanical properties by wrapping high-denier Spandex with nylon filaments in opposite twists. In particular, 560D high-denier Spandex as the core was untwisted which can maximumly reduce the interaction between the core and wrapping filaments, enabling high elongation of the double-wrapped yarns. In addition, we chose 70D nylon filaments with a tensile force of 387.40 ± 8.82 cN as the wrapping materials to provide sufficient force for double-wrapped yarns. Notably, opposite twists were induced for the inner and outer wrapping filaments to achieve a balanced stable yarn structure. By systematically optimizing manufacturing parameters including inner wrapping density, outer wrapping density, taking-up ratio, and drafting ratio, we obtained double-wrapped yarn with excellent tensile force (952.00 ± 24.03 cN) and elongation (357.28% ± 9.10%). Notably, the stress decay rate of optimized yarns was only 12.0% ± 2.2%. In addition, the optimized yarn was used as the weft-lining yarn for generating weft-lined fabrics, the elastic recovery rate of the obtained fabric was only 2.6% after cyclic stretching, much lower than the control fabric. Our design of anti-fatigue double-wrapped yarns could be widely used for fabricating high-performance compression garments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47709cfb98a450fe93006899ea66901bf14b3ad47d50bb47e82205f3e6f0d1e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
