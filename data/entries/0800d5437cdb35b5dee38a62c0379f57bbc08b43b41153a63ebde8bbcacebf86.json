{"title":"Vehicle in Water Rescue: Will Laminated Glass Be the Death of Us?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1527/v1","date":1719195988000,"content":"The automotive industry is increasingly adopting laminated glass in side and rear windows to comply with safety standards aimed at reducing ejection injuries. However, this trend may have unintended consequences for occupant rescue and escape in submerged vehicle incidents. As more vehicles incorporate laminated glass, concerns arise that they could become \"glass coffins\" in water, making it more difficult for occupants to exit or be rescued. The use of laminated glass is driven by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 226 (FMVSS 226) for ejection mitigation, but it does not address the risk of vehicle submersion and occupant drowning. Drowning accounts for a substantial portion of vehicle-related fatalities. As the adoption of laminated glass grows, there is a need for drowning prevention measures, such as automatic window opening systems, to mitigate the risk of vehicles becoming \"glass coffins\" in water. A comprehensive approach addressing both ejection and submersion dangers is necessary to maximize occupant protection and save lives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0800d5437cdb35b5dee38a62c0379f57bbc08b43b41153a63ebde8bbcacebf86","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
