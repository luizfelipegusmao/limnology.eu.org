As I always note though, I’m not a person of change. At least when it comes to gear. My old-blue cycling jacket is still the same one from my <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2012/09/the-2012-swimbikerun-gear-i-use-list.html\">2012 ‘Gear I Use’ list</a>. My running gloves are still from the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2008/12/philadelphia-marathon-2008-race-report.html/\">Philly marathon expo some like 15 years ago</a>, and my swimsuit is whatever I found in my dresser that doesn’t appear to be fully see-through.</p>\n<p>Of course, the tech does change. Not necessarily because it needs to change, but largely because it’s what I do as my job. And once you upgrade to test something, it’s really hard to downgrade back to an ‘older’ product in most cases. At least for watches and bike computers; for trainers and power meters, it’s less of an issue.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I know plenty of you want to know what gear I use. Thus, I present you with a boatload of links. And while there’s a lot of gear here (because I’m covering three sports via triathlon), I think you’ll find I’m actually pretty simple when it comes to most of my gear (tech goodies aside). And this gear is built up over more than 15 years.</p>\n<p>I’ve divided it up into the three main sports (swim/bike/run), plus a random section at the end. I’m typically not one to buy the most expensive piece of fashionable stuff – and apparel brands don’t tend to mean a lot to me. I just buy what works for me.</p>\n<p>And, as is tradition, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/11/girls-2023-swim-bike-run-gear-i-use-list.html\">The Girl’s 2023 ‘Gear I use’ Guide</a> (my wife) is up as well here, so for those looking for a more women-oriented view of a similar set of training gear (and undoubtedly, a more fashionable view than mine), that’s there for the taking!</p>\n<p><strong>Also note:</strong> Please don’t take any of these as formal ‘gadget recommendations’, these are just the products that work for me. Also, none of these brands sponsor me, or anything here. Everything on this list I’ve bought myself and use day-to-day.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swimming (Pool/Openwater):</strong></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/11/GPTempDownload-17-720x405.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/11/GPTempDownload-17-720x405.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/11/GPTempDownload-17-200x113.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/11/GPTempDownload-17-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/11/GPTempDownload-17-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/11/GPTempDownload-17-125x70.jpg 125w\" /></p>\n<p>I appreciate that swimming is the easiest and shortest category here. Swimsuit, goggles, and if openwater swimming – a swim buoy. Oh, and a watch. Maybe three watches. But on the whole, everything basically fits in an old crumpled-up swim cap from a past race. In my case, I tend to do more openwater swimming than pool swimming. If I travel anywhere and the water is halfway viable, I’ll be openwater swimming. And even in colder times of the year, I manage to openwater swim here in the Netherlands. It’s a weird Dutch thing.</p>\n<p><em>(Also, I took the above photo with the other/older pair of goggles, but I liked it better…thus, I’m keeping it.)</em></p>\n<table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th></th><th><span>Product</span></th><th><span>Amazon</span></th><th><span>Other</span></th><th><span>Note</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"125\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/DecathlonBoxSwimShortTransparent-125x125.png\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/DecathlonBoxSwimShortTransparent-125x125.png 125w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/DecathlonBoxSwimShortTransparent-200x200.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/DecathlonBoxSwimShortTransparent-720x720.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/DecathlonBoxSwimShortTransparent.png 960w\" /></a></td><td>Decathlon Boxer Swim Short</td><td></td><td><a href=\"https://www.decathlon.com/products/short-boxer-swim-trunks-333680?adept-product=short-boxer-swim-trunks-333680&amp;adept_product_id=short-boxer-swim-trunks-333680&amp;source=search\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon</a></td><td>You know why this is my swim suit?

Mainly because I’m near-constantly testing new trainers, indoor bikes, etc… (especially as those release cycles have slowly transitioned from being fall-centric to being “anytime”). So it’s actually relatively rare that I stop and don’t have something to test. That said, there are a few things that are my go-to units, listed below.</p>\n<p>Likewise, for bikes, for the past year+ there’s been a constant stream of loaner bikes equipped with new power meters, groupsets, or other smart tech on them. Thus, for the road-bike in particular, I’ve almost entirely been jumping from loaner bike to loaner bike. Kinda the way my world works.</p>\n<table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th></th><th><span>Product</span></th><th><span>Amazon</span></th><th><span>Other</span></th><th><span>Note</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"125\" height=\"71\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/CanyonExceedCFSL-MTB-125x71.png\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/CanyonExceedCFSL-MTB-125x71.png 125w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/CanyonExceedCFSL-MTB-200x114.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/CanyonExceedCFSL-MTB-720x411.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/CanyonExceedCFSL-MTB-1536x878.png 1536w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/CanyonExceedCFSL-MTB-2048x1170.png 2048w\" /></a></td><td>Canyon Exceed CF SL 5.0 (Mountain Bike)</td><td></td><td><a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-us/mountain-bikes/cross-country-bikes/exceed/exceed-cf/exceed-cf-5/3126.html\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon</a></td><td>When I bought this bike, I kept all the components mostly as-is.

I’m not particular, but I do prefer a pocket or two to stash things.</p>\n<p><strong>Cold Weather Running Top:</strong> I don’t have a specific top I use, rather, I tend to layer bits and pieces together. Here’s an older post on all my <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2012/01/what-i-wear-cold-weather-running.html\">cold-weather running thoughts</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cold Weather Running Gloves:</strong> $1.00 race expo gloves – That’s it.  It’s easy.  I almost never throw them away, I feel guilty.  So I use a few rotating pairs, all from expos – some even free!  I’ve got a pair of no-brand mittens that I toss on if the weather is super-cold, but like running tops in cold weather, you’d be surprised what your body is fine with once it’s up to speed.  All you folks in Minnesota though shouldn’t adhere to this section.  Just go to the Arctic section of REI instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Running headphones/music:</strong> I very rarely run (or ride) with music. I suppose if I were to, at the moment it’d probably still be my Beats Studio Buds, but I really only run with music if I need to test a specific music feature on a watch.</p>\n<p>Got all that?

Note that I went with this model, the cheapest one they make, as I realized that buying the higher-end models that support gas didn't make much sense for me. I have a gas grill already (and could easily just put a stone on it). Similarly, while a large 16\" is appealing, realistically I've found this 12\" more than enough for pretty substantial personal pizzas (and it makes it easier to handle).</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Delicious-Strawberry-Packaging/dp/B002DYIZH6?crid=WCPS5PCXBPY7&amp;keywords=protein%2Bpowder&amp;qid=1700600786&amp;rdc=1&amp;sprefix=pro%2Caps%2C184&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr-thegirl-20&amp;linkId=d7a88fc22e1b5e2da180a584ac7ba00a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"74\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/GoldStandard-Background-Removed-74x125.png\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/GoldStandard-Background-Removed-74x125.png 74w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/GoldStandard-Background-Removed-200x339.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/GoldStandard-Background-Removed-720x1222.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/11/GoldStandard-Background-Removed.png 884w\" /></a></td><td>Optimum Nutrition: Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder</td><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Delicious-Strawberry-Packaging/dp/B002DYIZH6?crid=WCPS5PCXBPY7&amp;keywords=protein%2Bpowder&amp;qid=1700600786&amp;rdc=1&amp;sprefix=pro%2Caps%2C184&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr-thegirl-20&amp;linkId=d7a88fc22e1b5e2da180a584ac7ba00a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></td><td></td><td>I’ve gotten into doing recovery drinks this year, though mostly only for mid to longer (many hours) workouts.
