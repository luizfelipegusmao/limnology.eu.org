{"title":"Scalable Optical Neural Network Based on Free-Space Optics Using Lens Arrays and a Smart Pixel Light Modulator","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2095/v1","date":1724913885000,"content":": We explore the integration of smart pixel light modulators (SPLMs) into bidirectional optical neural networks (BONNs), highlighting their advantages over traditional spatial light modulators (SLMs). SPLMs enhance BONN performance by enabling faster light modulation in both directions, significantly increasing the refresh rate of neural network weights to hundreds of megahertz, thus facilitating the practical implementation of the backpropagation algorithm and two-mirror-like BONN structures. The architecture of an SPLM-based BONN (SPBONN) features bidirectional modulation, simplifying hardware with electrical fan-in and fan-out. Scalability limitations of the projection system restrict input and output array sizes but achieve high throughput, up to 4.3 × 10¹⁷ MAC/s with 100 layers. Energy assessments showed that the SPLM array, despite its higher power consumption compared to the SLM array, is manageable via effective heat dissipation. Smart pixels with programmable memory in the SPBONN provide a cost-effective solution for expanding network node size and overcoming scalability limitations without the need for additional hardware.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9ad904bf8736289ecc2613dd714385d5c89edb154522e9655c28067fa97526a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
