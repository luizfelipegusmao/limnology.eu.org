{"title":"Towards a Common Understanding of Gender-Responsive Monitoring and Evaluation for Health Programs and Interventions: Evidence from a Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1597/v1","date":1716538528000,"content":"Given the many approaches to and definitions of gender responsive monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) for health programs and interventions there is a lack of clarity on how to operationalize it including what to measure and how to measure it. We conducted a scoping review to understand what makes M&amp;E gender responsive. We included 31 studies and conducted two rounds of extraction to delineate ways in which gender was integrated into M&amp;E. Twelve articles described the use of theory to guide M&amp;E though most were not related to gender. Twelve articles employed a gender score in data collection, most of which measured Likert scale responses related to gender equity. Even though most studies did not use a specific gender framework, most incorporated gender domains in their analysis. Seven studies used participatory methods in the design and implementation of M&amp;E. Most studies conducted M&amp;E on programs or interventions that were designed to be gender intentional and related to gender issues. Gender responsive M&amp;E intentionally integrates gender into the M&amp;E process, regardless of how gender-intentional the program or intervention is. Gender dimensions can be identified through gender theories, models, scores, and frameworks to inform tool development, data collection, analysis, and stakeholder engagement processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ae3ebb6925a8fe3cca4f64fffb1b28320ecbb617f8070b7ef9b6891e6998a95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
