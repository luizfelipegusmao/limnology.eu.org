{"title":"Pregestational Prediabetes Induces Maternal Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Dysregulation and Results in Adverse Fetal Outcomes: Influences on HPA Axis and Development","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1803/v1","date":1711704335000,"content":"Maternal type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been shown to result in fetal programming of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to adverse fetal outcomes. T2DM is preceded by prediabetes and shares similar pathophysiological complications. However, no studies have investigated the effects of maternal prediabetes on fetal HPA axis function and postnatal offspring development, hence this study. Pre-diabetic (PD) and non-pre-diabetic (NPD) female Sprague Dawley rats were mated with non-prediabetic males. After gestation, male pups born from the PD and NPD groups were collected. Markers of HPA axis function, adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone were measured in all dams and pups. Glucose tolerance and expression of mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors were further measured in all pups at birth and their developmental milestones. The results demonstrated increased basal concentrations of ACTH and corticosterone in the dams from the PD group by comparison to NPD. Furthermore, the results show an increase in pups ACTH and corticosterone concentrations, impaired glucose tolerance and dysregulated MR and GR expression in the PD group at all developmental milestones. These observations reveal that pregestational prediabetes is associated with maternal dysregulation of the HPA axis, impacting offspring HPA axis development along with impaired glucose handling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"574864578b3bc969f4caa13aedddbad1835f7c83ac030bca553898012c8f6be4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
