{"title":"Monitoring the Wear Trend in Wind Turbines by Tracking the Fourier Vibration Spectrum and Base Density Support Vector Machine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1198/v2","date":1712651039000,"content":"To make wind power more competitive, it is necessary to reduce turbine downtime and reduce costs associated with wind turbine Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;amp;M). Incorporating machine learning in developing condition-based predictive maintenance methodologies for wind turbines can enhance their efficiency and reliability. This paper presents a monitoring method that utilizes Base Density for the Support Vector Machine (BDSVM) and the evolutionary Fourier spectra of vibrations. This method allows smart monitoring of the function evolution of the turbine. A complex optimal function (FO) for 5-degree order has been developed that will be the boundary function of the BDSVM to timely determine the magnitude, frequency, and place of the failure occurring in wind turbine drive.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34173478f51f345e79dff721f47fb6cb95293ecec2d748fbd0692b70589be2b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
