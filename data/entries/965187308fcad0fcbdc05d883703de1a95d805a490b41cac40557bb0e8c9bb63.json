{"title":"The Temporal Pattern of Change in Ionised Calcium, Parathyroid Hormone and Biomarkers of Bone Metabolism Following Ingestion of a Plant-Sourced Marine Multi-mineral + Plant-Sourced Protein Isolate in Healthy Young Adult Men and Women","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0149/v1","date":1722693196000,"content":"An increase in plant-sourced (PS) nutrient intake is promoted in support of a sustainable diet. PS dietary minerals and proteins have bioactive properties that can affect bone health and the risk of fracture. In a group randomised, cross-over, design, this study evaluated the post-ingestion, temporal pattern of change in arterialised ionised calcium (iCa), parathyroid hormone (PTH), C-terminal crosslinked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) for 4 hours following ingestion of a novel supplement (SUPP) containing a PS marine multi-mineral + PS protein isolate. A diurnally matched intake of mineral water was used as a control (CON). Compared to baseline, the change in iCa concentration was 0.022 (95%CI, 0.006 to 0.038, p = 0.011) mmol/l greater in SUPP than CON, resulting in a -4.214 (95%CI, -8.244 to -.183, p = 0.042) pg/mL mean reduction in PTH, a -0.64 (95%CI, -0.199 to -0.008, p = .029) ng/mL decrease in the biomarker of bone resorption, CTX, and no change in biomarker of bone formation, P1NP. Used as a dietary supplement, or by incorporation into a food matrix, the promotion of PS marine multi-mineral and PS protein isolates may contribute to a more sustainable diet and overall bone health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"965187308fcad0fcbdc05d883703de1a95d805a490b41cac40557bb0e8c9bb63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
