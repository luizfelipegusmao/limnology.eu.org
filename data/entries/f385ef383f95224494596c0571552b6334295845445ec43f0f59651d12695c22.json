An electron biprism is used to interfere an electron wave that has passed through the region of interest with a reference to provide an interference pattern, known as the hologram. From the spatial distribution of the fringes, the phase of the electrons can be calculated which allows quantitative measurements of the electromagnetic fields [<a href=\"#ozae044.073-B1\">1</a>]. This technique, which is becoming increasingly rare, has benefited enormously from the availability of ultra-stable modern microscopes, from the improvements in specimen preparation by focused ion beam (FIB) milling and by the availability of powerful desktop computers that can rapidly apply advanced reconstruction techniques on the holograms as they are acquired.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f385ef383f95224494596c0571552b6334295845445ec43f0f59651d12695c22","category":"Environment"}
