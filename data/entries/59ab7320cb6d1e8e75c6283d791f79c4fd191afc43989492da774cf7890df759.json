Three different culture media (Leibovitz–L-15, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium [DMEM], and 199) were employed, with or without the addition of AmnioMax, maintaining a standard temperature of 29°C. Based on the results obtained, we standardized a cell growth protocol in which medium 199 was less efficient for both species. Notably, <i>G. proximus</i> cells exhibited superior proliferation in DMEM and L-15 media, whereas <i>A. bimaculatus</i> cells demonstrated better parameters exclusively in the DMEM medium. Successful subculturing of cells with good proliferation index was observed, accompanied by preserved morphological characteristics. Therefore, the methodology outlined in this study represents an advancement in establishing fish cell cultures.</p>","author":"Ivanete de Oliveira Furo, \nLygia S.
