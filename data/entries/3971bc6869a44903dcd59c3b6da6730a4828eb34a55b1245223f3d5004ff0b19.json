{"title":"Examining fish scale biomineral from Atlantic salmon populations","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15904?af=R","date":1724051652000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Fish scale microchemistry can be used to make life-history inferences, although ecological studies examining scale composition are relatively rare. Salmon scales have an external layer of calcium phosphate hydroxyl apatite (HAP). The structure, hardness, and calcium content of this layer have been shown to vary within and between species. This variation may lead to misinterpretation of trace element profiles. This study uses backscatter scanning electron microscopy with electron dispersive spectrometry to compare scales from salmon populations and to present a more detailed analysis of scale HAP than was previously available. Our findings extend the range of salmon populations for which HAP Ca is available and confirm previous findings that the HAP Ca is relatively invariable within this species.</p>","author":"Elizabeth Tray, \nDeirdre Brophy, \nElvira de Eyto, \nNiall Ã“'Maoileidigh, \nTimothy Sheehan, \nIan Bradbury, \nQuentin G.
