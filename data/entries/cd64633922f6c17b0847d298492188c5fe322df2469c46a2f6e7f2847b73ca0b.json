{"title":"Remotely sensed imagery reveals animal feeding operations increase downstream dissolved reactive phosphorus","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13177?af=R","date":1700650701000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this paper, we use remotely sensed imagery to identify the location and size of animal feeding operations in the Maumee River Watershed, a key drainage area to Lake Erie's Western Basin, which has recently experienced severe harmful algal blooms. We then estimate the relationship between the intensity of animal feeding operations in the watershed and surface water body concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), the pollutant most responsible for algal growth. We find that stream reaches with relatively larger increases in upstream animal feeding exposure experience significantly higher increases in concentrations of DRP. The average marginal upstream animal feeding operation in the watershed increases downstream DRP concentrations by between 10% and 15%. In contrast, when restricting the analysis to include only permitted operations, coefficient estimates are practically zero and statistically insignificant. Our work presents evidence that the increasing intensity of animal feeding operations contributes to water quality problems. Permitting and identification of animal feeding operations is therefore important for managing runoff and correctly attributing the causes of excess nutrients in surface water bodies.</p>","author":"Andrew Meyer, \nZach Raff, \nSarah Porter","siteTitle":"Wiley: JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b7070794a350c180e68e2251d6fc4f4ad5be669c5d24d82d3d55b25b0dce7a23","entryHash":"cd64633922f6c17b0847d298492188c5fe322df2469c46a2f6e7f2847b73ca0b","category":"Environment"}
