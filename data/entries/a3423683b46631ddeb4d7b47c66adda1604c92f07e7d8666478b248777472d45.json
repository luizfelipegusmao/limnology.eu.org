{"title":"On Metacognition: Overconfidence in Word Recall Prediction and Its Association with Psychotic Symptoms in Patients with Schizophrenia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0983/v1","date":1718347178000,"content":"A two-factor account has been proposed as an explanatory model for the formation and maintenance of delusions. The first factor refers to a neurocognitive process leading to a significant change in subjective experience; the second factor has been regarded as a failure in hypothesis evaluation characterized as an impairment of metacognitive ability. This study was focused on the assessment of metacognition in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the study were to measure the overconfidence in metacognitive judgments through the prediction of word list recall; and to analyze the correlation between basic neurocognition: memory and executive function and metacognition through a metamemory test and the severity of psychotic symptoms. Method: 51 participants with diagnosis the of Schizophrenia were evaluated. The PANNS was used to assess the severity of psychiatric symptoms and the subtest of Metamemory included in the BANFE Battery was used to evaluate overconfidence and underestimations errors, intrusion and perseverative response, and total volume of recall. Results. The strongest correlation are observed between overconfidence errors and the positive factor of the PANSS (r= 0.774, p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a3423683b46631ddeb4d7b47c66adda1604c92f07e7d8666478b248777472d45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
