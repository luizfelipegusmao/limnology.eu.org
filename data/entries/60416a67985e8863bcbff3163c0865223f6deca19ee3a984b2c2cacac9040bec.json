{"title":"148 The equine dermal microbiome: State of the science","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/219/7757167?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Equine microbiome research has rapidly moved from a fledgling field to a thriving and productive area of research. Impacts to the equine gastrointestinal microbiome have been examined related to travel, antibiotic administration, meal size, fiber type, breed, sex and nutrient level. Although advances in this field are exciting, data related to the dermal microbiota are sorely lacking. Conducting equine microbiome research presents unique challenges and opportunities. Coordination for data collection in conjunction with other studies will be reviewed. Diet is widely recognized as a significant modulating factor to the microbiome and will be reviewed as a potential consideration in equine dermal microbiome research. This presentation will highlight the limited data available on equine dermal microbiota and identify potential areas for further examination. Studies reporting the characteristics of equine dermal measures will be discussed and gaps in current understanding will be identified. Specific conditions including equine pastern dermatitis as well as wound dressing methods will be examined, and a discussion of future works will be included. Dermatological studies of the microbiome in humans and canines will be examined as a potential map for the future of equine dermal microbiome research. As microbiome research continues to evolve, its impact on equine health has become increasingly apparent. The skin functions as a protective organ and is the first line of defense against pathogenic invasion and immune function support. It is home to bacteria, fungi and viruses with many roles similar to those of the gastrointestinal microbiome. This presentation will highlight the critical need for increased understanding of the dermal microbiome in conjunction with current equine gastrointestinal microbiome studies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"60416a67985e8863bcbff3163c0865223f6deca19ee3a984b2c2cacac9040bec","category":"Environment"}
