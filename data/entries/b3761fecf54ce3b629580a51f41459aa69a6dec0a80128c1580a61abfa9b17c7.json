{"title":"Advances in Hydrogels of Drug Delivery Systems for Local Treatment of Brain Tumors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1419/v1","date":1716362974000,"content":"The management of brain tumors presents numerous challenges, despite the employment of multimodal therapies including surgical intervention, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Owing to the distinct location of brain tumors and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), these tumors exhibit considerable heterogeneity and invasiveness at a histological level. Recent advancements in hydrogel research for the local treatment of brain tumors have sought to overcome the primary challenge of delivering therapeutics past the BBB, thereby ensuring efficient accumulation within brain tumor tissues. This article elaborates on various hydrogel-based delivery vectors, examining their efficacy in the local treatment of brain tumors. Additionally, it reviews the fundamental principles involved in designing intelligent hydrogels that can circumvent the BBB and penetrate larger tumor areas, thereby facilitating precise, controlled drug release. Hydrogel-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) are posited to offer a groundbreaking approach in addressing the challenges and limitations inherent in traditional oncological therapies, which are significantly impeded by the unique structural and pathological characteristics of brain tumors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b3761fecf54ce3b629580a51f41459aa69a6dec0a80128c1580a61abfa9b17c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
