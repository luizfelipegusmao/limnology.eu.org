{"title":"Overrepresentation of TTMV9 in a Subgroup of Patients with ME/CFS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0073/v1","date":1722514059000,"content":"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic disorder classified by the WHO as postviral fatigue syndrome (ICD-11 8E49 code). Diagnosing ME/CFS, often overlapping with Fibromyalgia (FM), is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and lack of biomarkers. The etiology of ME/CFS and FM is poorly understood, but evidence suggests viral infections play a critical role. This study employs microarray technology to quantitate viral RNA levels in immune cells from ME/CFS, FM, or co-diagnosed cases, and healthy controls. The results show significant overexpression of the Torque Teno Mini Virus 9 (TTMV9) in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients which correlate with abnormal HERV and immunological profiles. Increased levels of TTMV9 transcripts accurately discriminate this subgroup of ME/CFS patients from the other study groups, showcasing its potential as biomarker for patient stratification and the need for further research into its role in the disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0b9f7c769030c03468139700ae4f98ff830ebdf8ab0f5f05052ef1cfd899588","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
