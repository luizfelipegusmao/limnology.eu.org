{"title":"Phytocompounds Targeting for the Treatment of &beta;-Thalassemia: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0604/v1","date":1718089161000,"content":"For treating β-thalassemia, increasing foetal haemoglobin (HbF) production with drugs shows promising result. Many studies have focused on finding new HbF-inducing phytocompounds and understanding how they work. This review compiles the identified agents so far. While these agents can stimulate HbF production, chemotherapy drugs cannot be practically used for treating β-haemoglobinopathies, like β-thalassemia, due to their toxicity and growth-inhibiting effects. To overcome this issue, researchers are exploring natural plant sources for effective, safe, and easy-to-use HbF-inducing agents. This review highlights summarizes the natural phytocompounds that stimulate HbF production, aiming to provide new insights into future treatments for β-thalassemia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"900deaab9deb87ea454f04062b9d1b55cd76dfa7e617edf13ef8c3b340551ca2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
