During SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, portable devices were used in different environments and considered a valuable prevention tool. This study has evaluated the effectiveness of the air treatment device \"AEROK 1.0\" in reducing microbial, particulate and pollen airborne contamination indoors, during normal activity. Methods: In an administrative room, airborne microbial contamination was measured using active (DUOSAS 360 and MD8) and passive sampling; a particle counter was used to evaluate particle concentrations; a Hirst-type pollen trap was used to assess airborne pollen and Alternaria spores. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0; p values","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"73c35decf9c6e96fd36a86b3a55d5d8978090e75ecfed374e5517e5d0d3b3281","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
