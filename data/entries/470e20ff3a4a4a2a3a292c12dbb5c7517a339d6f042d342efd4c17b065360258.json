{"title":"Changes on SOD and NF-kappaB Levels in Substantia Nigra and Intestine, by Oxidative Stress Effects in a Murine Model of Ozone Pollution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1299/v1","date":1711014430000,"content":"This work aimed to elucidate how O3 pollution causes loss of regulation of the immune response in both the brain and the intestine. In this work, we studied the effect of exposing rats to low doses of O3 on the association between the antioxidant response of superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and nuclear factor kappa light chains of activated B cells (NFκB) as a marker of inflammation. Method: 72 Wistar rats were used, divided into six groups that received the following treatments: Control, 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days at O3, respectively. After treatment, tissues were extracted and processed using Western blotting, biochemical, and immunohistochemical techniques. The results indicated an increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and Cu/Zn-SOD, a decrease in Mn-SOD, and SOD activity in the substantia nigra, jejunum, and colon decrease. Furthermore, the translocation of NFκB to the nucleus increased in the different organs studied.\nIn conclusion, repeated exposure to ozone alters the regulation of the antioxidant and inflammatory response in the substantia nigra and the intestine. This suggests that these responses are critical in the loss of regulation of the inflammatory response, and they respond to ozone pollution, which could be occurring in the progression of chronic degenerative diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"470e20ff3a4a4a2a3a292c12dbb5c7517a339d6f042d342efd4c17b065360258","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
