{"title":"GIS and Contamination Indices for Environmental Risk Assessment of Landfill Disposal Sites in Central Saudi Arabia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0641/v1","date":1728477407000,"content":"Landfills pollute air, soil, surface and groundwater worldwide. Present work aims to assessment environmental Risks three landfills in southern Riyadh using GIS, soil quality guidelines, and contamination indices. GIS tools indicated an increase in the area of the landfill sites with time. The concentration of heavy metals (HMs) in the investigated landfills had the following descending order: Fe (11532 mg/kg) ˃ Al (5405 mg/kg) ˃ Pb (561.7 mg/kg) ˃ Zn (356.8 mg/kg) ˃ Mn (165 mg/kg) ˃ Cr (74.8 mg/kg) ˃ Cu (42.7 mg/kg) ˃ Ni (22.4 mg/kg) ˃ V (21.8 mg/kg) ˃ As (5.16 mg/kg) ˃ Co (4.08 mg/kg). The highest values of Al, As, Co, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn were recorded in Riyadh landfill 3, at the third industrial city. However, average values of all HMs decrease those from most worldwide soils and background, except Zn, Cu, Cr, and Pb. Results of enrichment factor and statistical analysis indicated deficiency to minimal enrichment and geogenic sources for Al, Co, Mn, and V, while those of As, Cr, Pb, Zn, and Ni showed EF ˃ 2 implied anthropogenic activities, especially in in Riyadh landfill 3. Additionally, very high contamination and high effects range-median were reported in individual samples, especially for Pb, As, and Zn, indicated frequent adverse effects for these HMs. The difference in contamination for the HMs in the studied landfill sites might be attributed to the difference in the magnitude of input for each metal into the landfill site and/or the difference in the removal rate of each metal from it.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3315ee7506611affa177177dd102c9a7b76c325b351598f4ad8c9b1b2a467657","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
