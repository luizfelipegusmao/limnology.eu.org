{"title":"Evaluation of Effect of Clay-Water on the Physico-Chemical Properties of Drinking Water","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0509/v1","date":1728349965000,"content":"The issue of degradation of drinking water quality has become a problem of great concern in Pakistan, and especially availability of water treatment facilities in the Sindh province of Pakistan is almost negligible, particularly in rural areas. And, the public has been using traditional methods to reduce the concentration of physic-chemical parameters in drinking water. Therefore this study was carried out to analyze the impact of a Clay-water cooler on physic-chemical parameters of drinking water. Analysis revealed that samples remained colorless, with the passage of time odor of water changed to a clayey odor; Turbidity increased with the passage of time and temperature decreased; the pH value of water increased initially and crossed the allowable limit but with time it was observed that pH of water decreased came under the limit; the concentration of EC, Cl, Ca, Total Hardness and TDS decreased for first 12 hours, but increased with increase in storage time. The value of Magnesium increased as storage time increased. Overall, it was disclosed that a Clay-water cooler has a positive impact on the quality of drinking water particularly if water is stored in a clay-water cooler for a time not longer than 8 hours.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d088e8b6bdddef543c63c227dbaa56a09d3db9909f66320de2c74ccc44cd774","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
