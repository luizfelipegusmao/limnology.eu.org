However, its role in assessments of inflammation is little reported in the veterinary literature. Lymph nodes are most easily assessed superficially through palpation, but computed tomography (CT) enables evaluation of deep lymph nodes. Accordingly, we investigated associ-ations between maximal lymph node diameter and plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive inflammatory marker, targeting three deep lymph nodes (sternal, cranial me-diastinal, and internal iliac). We evaluated data from small dogs with non-neoplastic diseases that underwent synchronous CT and blood biochemistry at our institution. We found that cranial mediastinal lymph node diameter was significantly greater in dogs with clinically elevated CRP than those with clinically unremarkable CRP (CRP 0.7-7.0&lt; mg/dL vs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1916654c45bf457ec6b82919cbe491364ba7e4dc10fe70c29894fadac6f24870","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
