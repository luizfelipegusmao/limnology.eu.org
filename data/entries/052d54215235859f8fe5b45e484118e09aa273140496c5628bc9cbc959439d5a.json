The important influence of toxic reactions caused by oxidative stress on aging formed the basis of the “Free radical theory of aging (FRTA)”, which indicates that aging of organisms occurs due to the accumulation of cell-damaging free radicals over time. At the cellular level, ROS regulates growth, apoptosis, migration, and other signals. Oxidative damage caused by oxidative stress will cause cellular dysfunction and physiological decline, thereby causing human aging and degenerative diseases [<a href=\"#ozae044.423-B2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.423-B3\">3</a>]. Hyperglycemia accelerates skin aging via oxidative stress, DNA damage, altered gene expression, inflammation, and cell death, exacerbating diabetic vascular complications [<a href=\"#ozae044.423-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"052d54215235859f8fe5b45e484118e09aa273140496c5628bc9cbc959439d5a","category":"Environment"}
