{"title":"Clinical Profiles in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Enhancing Diagnosis, Treatment, and Overall Health Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0856/v1","date":1718195622000,"content":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder, is increasingly diagnosed and significantly affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. The current diagnostic framework, guided by the DSM-5, has limitations that may lead to clinical gaps due to overlapping symptoms of ASD and other disorders. This study proposes a comprehensive approach to enhance ASD diagnosis through clinical stratification based on comorbidities. We applied precision medicine techniques to identify and categorize ASD into ten clinical profiles. Our findings contribute to a more profound understanding of ASD, including its varied clinical manifestations and comorbidities, and facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d217c58303594a42de58fbab716619e7016edbc9e9ea380863c9e900dfa899bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
