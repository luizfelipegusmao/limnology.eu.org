Our study aimed to test this hypothesis by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass. Diet-induced obese rats underwent Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (RYGB rats) while a Sham-operated control group was used. All rats received a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled protein meal 1 or 3 months after surgery and were euthanized 6h later. Protein digestibility, <sup>15</sup>N recovered in organs and urea pool, fractional protein synthesis rate, and intestinal morphometry were assessed. Protein digestibility was similar in all groups (94.2±0.3%). The small intestine was hypertrophied in RYGB rats 1 month after surgery, weighing 9.1±0.2g vs. 7.0±0.3g in Sham rats (P = 0.003). Villus height and crypt depth were increased in the alimentary limb and ileum of RYGB rats. However, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass had no impact on the fractional synthesis rate. In the gastrointestinal tract, <sup>15</sup>N retention only differed in the ileal mucosa and was higher in RYGB rats at 1 month (0.48±0.2% vs. 0.3±0.09%, P = 0.03). <sup>15</sup>N recovery from the liver, muscle, and skin was lower in RYGB rats at 1 month. <sup>15</sup>N recovery from urinary and plasma urea was higher in RYGB rats at both times, resulting in increased total deamination (13.2±0.9% vs. 10.1±0.5%, P&lt;0.01). This study showed that Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass did not affect protein digestibility. Dietary nitrogen sequestration was transitorily and moderately diminished in several organs. This was associated with a sustained elevation of postprandial deamination after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, whose mechanisms merit further studies.","author":"Soukaïna Benhaddou","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"37b6a3d3f756ba69b43f57b2c7def658e985732ab132a0ab71febae2695d2d1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
