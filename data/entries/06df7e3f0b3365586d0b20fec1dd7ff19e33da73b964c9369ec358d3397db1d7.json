{"title":"Eco-Design of Thermopressing through Induction of 100% Coriander-Based Fiberboards: Optimization of Molding Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0267/v1","date":1725365581000,"content":"The hot pressing process for 100% coriander-based fiberboards was optimized using an induction RocTool system, which offers rapid mold heating and cooling. The fiberboards were made with deoiled press cake as a proteic binder and extrusion-refined straw as reinforcement. A Doehlert’s experimental design evaluated the influence of pressure (10-50 MPa), molding time (60-300 s), and mold temperature (155-205°C) on fiberboard properties, energy consumption, cost, and environmental impact. The results showed that the RocTool device allows better temperature control during shaping, resulting in exacerbated adhesive properties for proteins. Using the isoresponse curves, optimal hot pressing conditions were 35 MPa, 300 s, and 205°C, corresponding to a 40.6 MPa flexural strength. However, it was observed that to achieve a MDF-like fiberboard with minimal production cost, much less restrictive molding conditions were sufficient, i.e., 32.5 MPa, 170 s, and 160°C. The study revealed that maximum thermopressing conditions emitted 3.87 kg of CO2 eq., while conditions leading to the MDF-like board reduced emissions to 1.45 kg CO2 eq., resulting in a more environmentally-friendly material.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"06df7e3f0b3365586d0b20fec1dd7ff19e33da73b964c9369ec358d3397db1d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
