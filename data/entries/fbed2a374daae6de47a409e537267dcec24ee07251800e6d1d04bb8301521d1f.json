{"title":"Evaluation of in silico tools and Chat-GPT in identifying the impact of missense variants of immune-related genes associated with immunotherapy outcomes for solid tumors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1496/v1","date":1711417501000,"content":"Understanding clinical significance of variants of unknown significance (VUS) reported in next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become essential in cancer treatment. Our study examined six widely used in silico tools: PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD, MutationTaster2, CADD, REVEL, and Chat-GPT. We utilized a dataset of gene variants known to potentially affect immune therapy. No single tool could comprehensively determine mutation variant pathogenicity. MutationTaster2021 showed the highest overall accuracy and MCC among the tools. Notably, REVEL and Chat-GPT exhibited 100% specificity, suggesting their proficiency in accurately identifying pathogenic variants and minimizing false positives. In contrast, CADD displayed optimal sensitivity, making it suitable for effectively ruling out benign variants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbed2a374daae6de47a409e537267dcec24ee07251800e6d1d04bb8301521d1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
