{"title":"Adilights: A Novel Automotive Lighting System for Enhanced Safety","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0190/v1","date":1717496688000,"content":"The increasing complexity of vehicular traffic and the prevalence of accidents, particularly rear-end collisions, necessitate enhancements in automotive safety technologies. Adilights, an innovative automotive lighting system, addresses this need by introducing a dynamic visual communication method between vehicles. This system features a novel design that employs variable-intensity brake lights configured in an upside-down \"U\" shape to indicate braking severity. The intensity and pattern of the lights change in response to the pressure applied to the brake pedal, providing clear and immediate feedback to following drivers. This design not only improves the perceptibility of braking signals, particularly in dense traffic and poor visibility conditions but also aims to reduce the frequency of rear-end collisions significantly. The paper details the development and testing of Adilights, discusses its integration with current vehicular systems, and evaluates its effectiveness through simulated scenarios. The introduction of Adilights marks a step forward in the use of adaptive lighting systems for enhanced vehicular communication and road safety.\\cite{Lee2007RearEnd}","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d99612215e488d0577c8562e9f22b636133d0c1078883c079293a954642d04a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
