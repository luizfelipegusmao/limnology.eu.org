{"title":"Loss of amphibian species alters periphyton communities in montane ponds","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05551-0","date":1725148800000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Amphibian larvae can affect the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems, but their effects have been little explored although amphibian biodiversity is rapidly declining. Given that larvae of different amphibian species belong to different trophic levels, their effects on freshwater communities and processes can be expected to differ, with herbivores likely having direct effects on algae and predators having indirect effects through trophic cascades. We explored this question through a mesocosm experiment conducted in montane ponds, using an anuran and a urodele species affected by emergent diseases. We used different scenarios of reduction and loss of one or both species, and compared them to a control scenario representing a typical amphibian community in the study area composed of four species, with total larval density held constant. Loss of the anuran resulted in lower chlorophyll concentration and algal density, likely due to replacement by more efficient grazers. Loss of the urodele produced similar trends but weaker, possibly due to an increase of invertebrate grazing activity in the absence of this predator. Our study shows how the loss of amphibian species can alter the structure of montane ponds, but also how the mechanisms involved and the intensity of effects differ for different species.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"5db18a0ffb78a1f19621ce8d48418385221c92677f336fb86a9843e385de98ac","category":"Environment"}
