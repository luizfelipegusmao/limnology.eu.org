{"title":"Low Cost Source Measure Unit (SMU) to Characterize Sensors Built on Graphene-Channel Field-Effect Transistors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1169/v1","date":1710862158000,"content":"This study introduces a low-cost solution provided by a specialized source measure unit (SMU), offering an alternative to conventional source meter units. Through precise IV curve measurements for graphene-channel FETs, the SMU demonstrates its capability in accurately characterizing these devices with minimal noise and high accuracy. This cost-effective solution presents a promising avenue for researchers and developers seeking reliable tools for sensor development and characterization, providing valuable insights into the behavior of graphene-channel FETs and the effect of surface illumination without the need for expensive equipment. Additionally, the SMU was validated with known passive and active components, along with probe station integration for microscale connection, ensuring its effectiveness in capturing accurate measurements. The SMUâ€™s focus on collecting IV curves, coupled with its ability to identify device defects, such as Schottky junctions, contributes to its utility in quality testing for semiconductor devices. Its low-cost nature makes it accessible for various research endeavors, enabling efficient data collection and analysis for graphene-based sensor applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7900f7e2c5e6fd75ed99fbae2706a49086ef4f62576fe6071d938eac805ce52b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
