In this study, we used the <span>Drosophila</span> reproductive system as a model to investigate the biological functions of O-glycosylation. We found that O-glycosylation in the male accessory glands, an organ responsible for secreting seminal fluid proteins, plays important roles in female postmating behavior. The loss of one O-glycosyltransferase, PGANT9, in the male reproductive system resulted in decreased egg production in mated females. We identified one substrate of PGANT9, lectin-46Ca (CG1656), which is known to affect female postmating responses. We further show that the loss of lectin-46Ca O-glycosylation affects its ability to associate with sperm tails, resulting in reduced transfer within the female reproductive system. Our results provide the first example that O-glycosylation of a seminal fluid protein affects its ability to associate with sperm in vivo. These studies may shed light on the biological function of O-glycans in mammalian reproduction.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"dd787dd9d7055ab2716b4da0625069c1ef14818b68e0292baba222473a1222f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
