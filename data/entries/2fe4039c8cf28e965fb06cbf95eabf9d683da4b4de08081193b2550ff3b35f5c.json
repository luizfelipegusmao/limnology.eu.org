Such management requires reliable foundational evidence to help managers make informed choices about how to address the needs of their target species. Unfortunately, such evidence is still lacking for many species and management scenarios.\n\nOne major global challenge is improving the reproductive success of threatened species in the context of predation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of in situ experiments that used non-lethal methods to protect bird nests against predators, with the aims of summarising global trends in nest protection efforts, comparing the effectiveness of different protection measures and informing future research and management. We considered peer-reviewed studies in English.\n\nWe detected a large geographic and taxonomic bias in the evidence base with 58% of articles conducted in North America and 76% on ground-nesting birds. Less than 3% of articles involved taxa listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered and 51% of study units lasted just a single breeding season.\n\nNests protected with exclosures, fences and guards were more likely to be successful than their unprotected controls. Interventions involving deterrents, conditioned taste aversion, chemical camouflage and diversionary feeding did not have a significant positive effect on nest success, but the interventions in these categories were less common and more diverse in nature.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>. To increase their conservation value, future non-lethal nest protection experiments should whenever possible clearly state overall aims, take place over multiple seasons, use a comparable control and test non-lethal protection methods independently of lethal predator control. Greater focus is required on under-studied taxa such as cup-nesting songbirds and birds in South America, Africa and Asia, and novel protection techniques such as deterrents and chemical camouflage. Practitioners should consider the evidence we synthesise here when deciding whether non-lethal nest protection approaches are optimal for their study system, to increase conservation success and reduce ethical and financial costs.\n</p>","author":"Daniel Gautschi, \nAntica Čulina, \nRobert Heinsohn, \nDejan Stojanovic, \nRoss Crates","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"2fe4039c8cf28e965fb06cbf95eabf9d683da4b4de08081193b2550ff3b35f5c","category":"Environment"}
