{"title":"Wnt signaling modulates the response to DNA damage in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc by regulating the EGFR pathway","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002547","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by Ben Ewen-Campen, Norbert Perrimon</p>\r\n\r\nDespite the deep conservation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, cells in different contexts vary widely in their susceptibility to DNA damage and their propensity to undergo apoptosis as a result of genomic lesions. One of the cell signaling pathways implicated in modulating the DDR is the highly conserved Wnt pathway, which is known to promote resistance to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation in a variety of human cancers. However, the mechanisms linking Wnt signal transduction to the DDR remain unclear. Here, we use a genetically encoded system in <i>Drosophila</i> to reliably induce consistent levels of DNA damage in vivo, and demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling in the wing imaginal disc buffers cells against apoptosis in the face of DNA double-strand breaks. We show that Wg, the primary Wnt ligand in <i>Drosophila</i>, activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via the ligand-processing protease Rhomboid, which, in turn, modulates the DDR in a <i>Chk2</i>-, <i>p53</i>-, and <i>E2F1-</i>dependent manner. These studies provide mechanistic insight into the modulation of the DDR by the Wnt and EGFR pathways in vivo in a highly proliferative tissue. Furthermore, they reveal how the growth and patterning functions of Wnt signaling are coupled with prosurvival, antiapoptotic activities, thereby facilitating developmental robustness in the face of genomic damage.","author":"Ben Ewen-Campen","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"8c2d1d520880ec514ebc6873ceddacbcfeeb670da3f486a525ba44230316b16e","category":"Environment"}
