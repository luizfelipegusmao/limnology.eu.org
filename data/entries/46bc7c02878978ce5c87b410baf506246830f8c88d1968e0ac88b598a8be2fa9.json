{"title":"Can internal medicine specialists diagnose functional somatic disorders (FSDs)? Training and comparison with FSD specialists","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307057","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Michael Moesmann Madsen, Christian Trolle, Lotte Fynne, Eva Ørnbøl, Per Fink, Lise Kirstine Gormsen</p>\r\nBackground <p>Functional somatic disorders (FSD) are a common problem across medical settings and remain challenging to diagnose and treat. Many patients with FSD undergo sequential and unnecessary extensive diagnostic work-up, which is costly for society and stressful for patients. Previous studies have shown that the empirically based FSD diagnostic entities are interrater reliable and stable over time.</p> Objective <p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether internists who have received adequate training and with sufficient time per patient could diagnose FSD.</p> Design <p>This was a prospective diagnostic accuracy study. The study was conducted from May 2020 to April 2022.</p> Participants <p>The study included 27 consecutive patients referred by their general practitioner to a non-psychiatric diagnostic clinic for assessment of physical symptoms on suspicion of FSD.</p> Interventions <p>The internists received a 30-hour training course in the use of a tailored version of the SCAN interview.</p> Main measures <p>The main outcome measure was the agreement between the diagnoses of the internists and the reference diagnoses made by specialists in FSD on the basis of the full SCAN interview.</p> Key results <p>The interrater agreement between the internists and the FSD experts was substantial for any FSD (kappa = 0.63) as well as multi-organ vs. single-organ FSD (kappa = 0.73), indicating good diagnostic agreement.</p> Conclusions <p>Internists with proper training and sufficient time (3–4 hours) per patient can proficiently diagnose FSD employing a tailored version of the SCAN interview for use in a non-psychiatric diagnostic setting.</p>","author":"Michael Moesmann Madsen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"46bc7c02878978ce5c87b410baf506246830f8c88d1968e0ac88b598a8be2fa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
