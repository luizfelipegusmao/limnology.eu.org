{"title":"Rechargeable Solid-State Batteries: Insights from a Cross-Sectional Thematic and Bibliometric Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2007/v1","date":1727258776000,"content":"Rechargeable solid-state batteries (SSBs) offer enhanced safety, higher energy density, and longer cycle life compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries, making them a promising solution for electric vehicles, grid storage, and other high-demand applications. However, challenges such as interface stability, low ionic conductivity, and manufacturing scalability hinder their commercial viability. This research provides a comprehensive cross-sectional thematic and bibliometric analysis of recent SSB research, focusing on four key areas: electrolyte engineering, electrode engineering, battery architecture, and performance evaluation. By analyzing publications from major databases, this study highlights the latest innovations, including improved solid electrolytes, advanced electrode materials, and novel architectures that enhance both performance and manufacturability. The findings offer valuable insights for researchers, engineers, and industry stakeholders by identifying critical gaps in the field and highlighting future research directions. The work examines progress in interface optimization, ion transport improvements, and scalable production techniques, which are crucial for advancing SSB technology. By presenting a detailed review of key developments and challenges, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of SSB progress and its potential to revolutionize the energy storage industry. The results will guide researchers in targeting high-impact areas and help industry leaders and policymakers strategize the commercial deployment of SSBs in electric vehicles, stationary energy storage, and other applications requiring reliable and efficient energy solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ee37f0b7045d92ed52d3834530f6f116e1c902295e74ec07f999538ae17b360","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
