{"title":"Integrated Application of Innovative Technologies for Oil Spill Remediation in Gran Tarajal Harbor: A Scientific Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1977/v1","date":1716981117000,"content":"This study examines the recovery efforts at Gran Tarajal Harbor following a significant oil spill, employing innovative technologies. Initial response efforts were hampered by inadequate contingency plans and bureaucratic delays, underscoring the need for improved preparedness. Cleanup operations utilized advanced methods such as enhanced absorbent sponges, absorbent granulates, bioremediation with allochthonous species, and a combination of barriers and sponges. These technologies proved effective in minimizing environmental impact, reducing hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments from nearly 60,000 mg/kg to less than 1,600 mg/kg in seven months. Heavy metal analysis revealed lead and copper concentrations associated as well as with routine port activities, while mercury levels linked to the spill decreased over time. Tissue analysis indicated minimal contamination in local organisms, suggesting limited impact from the spill, and evaluation of the biological communities in sediments suggest an ecological recovery. Study underscores the importance of rapid response, advanced technologies, and detailed contingency plans tailored to each port. Despite the successful cleanup and ecosystem recovery, political and bureaucratic challenges remain significant obstacles to implementing these improved methods. The findings advocate for a re-evaluation of current oil spill response protocols to incorporate more effective, sustainable, and cost-efficient technologies, aligning with the principles of a circular economy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dd516e6b691b937d5ed825a706984be2cd20a98ca4d8eefa0ff8fccee120409c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
