{"title":"Plant protein–lipid interfaces studied by molecular dynamics simulations","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/17/5237/7676306?rss=1","date":1715990400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The delineation of protein–lipid interfaces is essential for understanding the mechanisms of various membrane-associated processes crucial to plant development and growth, including signalling, trafficking, and membrane transport. Due to their highly dynamic nature, the precise characterization of lipid–protein interactions by experimental techniques is challenging. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a powerful computational alternative with a spatial–temporal resolution allowing the atomistic-level description. In this review, we aim to introduce plant scientists to molecular dynamics simulations. We describe different steps of performing molecular dynamics simulations and provide a broad survey of molecular dynamics studies investigating plant protein–lipid interfaces. Our aim is also to illustrate that combining molecular dynamics simulations with artificial intelligence-based protein structure determination opens up unprecedented possibilities for future investigations of dynamic plant protein–lipid interfaces.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0f0fee475134c489a6e4511b8b61e700e1d008d8d3eb45f5d3eae3f11a4184f0","category":"Environment"}
