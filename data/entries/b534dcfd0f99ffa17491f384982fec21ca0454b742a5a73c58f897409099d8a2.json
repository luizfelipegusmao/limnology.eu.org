The majority of HHT patients have haploinsufficiency of genes involved in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFÎ²) signaling pathway, including endoglin (ENG), activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1, also known as ACVRL1), or SMAD4. Active angiogenesis is also required for telangiectasia and AVM development. Anti-angiogenic strategies have been tested in patients and animal models extensively. However, the exact mechanisms for telangiectasia and AVM development remain unclear. In this review, we discuss recent advances in identifying disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b534dcfd0f99ffa17491f384982fec21ca0454b742a5a73c58f897409099d8a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
