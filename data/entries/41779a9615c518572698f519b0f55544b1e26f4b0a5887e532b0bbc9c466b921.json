We combined a virally delivered genetically encoded calcium reporter (GCaMP8m) and ultra-widefield imaging in live nonpregnant mice to characterize uterine calcium dynamics at organ scale throughout the estrous cycle. Prior to ovulation (proestrus and estrus), uterine excitations primarily initiated in a region near the oviduct, but after ovulation (metestrus and diestrus), excitations initiated at loci homogeneously distributed throughout the organ. The frequency of excitation events was lowest in proestrus and estrus, higher in metestrus, and highest in diestrus. These results establish a platform for mapping uterine activity and demonstrate that an anatomically localized trigger for uterine excitations depends on the estrous cycle phase.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"41779a9615c518572698f519b0f55544b1e26f4b0a5887e532b0bbc9c466b921","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
