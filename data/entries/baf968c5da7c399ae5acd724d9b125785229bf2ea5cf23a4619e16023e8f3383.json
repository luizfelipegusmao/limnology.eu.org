{"title":"Air Transport as Subsystem of Modern Communication Space. Analysis Based on Transfer Entropy Graphs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1159/v1","date":1728971401000,"content":"The communication space allows for the exchange of information and ensures the movement of material flows and passenger flows. By communication space, we mean the movement of information and material flows of various natures based on transport systems, in this case, air transport systems. The direction and intensity of these flows to varying degrees reflect the main social and economic processes. Time series reflecting the intensity of passenger flows and cargo transportation over a given time horizon were selected as a source of information used for analysis. An information-theoretical measure based on the assessment of entropy transfer between time series elements is used as a research tool. Based on the obtained paired estimates of entropy transfer between the selected time series, an entropy transfer matrix is formed, which allows considering a set of time series as a communication system within the framework of system analysis. The resulting matrices are used to form entropy transfer graphs, which allow investigating the properties of time series based on directed graph analysis methods. The article examines examples of the analysis of the cognitive model of transportation, the analysis of the regional communication space, and the analysis of changes in the global communication field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"baf968c5da7c399ae5acd724d9b125785229bf2ea5cf23a4619e16023e8f3383","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
