{"title":"Decoding the functionality of plant transcription factors","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4745/7676309?rss=1","date":1715990400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Transcription factors (TFs) intricately govern cellular processes and responses to external stimuli by modulating gene expression. TFs help plants to balance the trade-off between stress tolerance and growth, thus ensuring their long-term survival in challenging environments. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that define the functionality of plant TFs is of paramount importance for unravelling the intricate regulatory networks governing development, growth, and responses to environmental stimuli in plants. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of these factors and mechanisms defining the activity of TFs. Understanding the dynamic nature of TFs has practical implications for modern molecular breeding programmes, as it provides insights into how to manipulate gene expression to optimize desired traits in crops. Moreover, recent studies also report the functional duality of TFs, highlighting their ability to switch between activation and repression modes; this represents an important mechanism for attuning gene expression. Here we discuss what the possible reasons for the dual nature of TFs are and how this duality instructs the cell fate decision during development, and fine-tunes stress responses in plants, enabling them to adapt to various environmental challenges.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"f8b4b61cf88e8344e6c73be1889dbb85b10fa5ca3199c82a741a5c4f38c23073","category":"Environment"}
