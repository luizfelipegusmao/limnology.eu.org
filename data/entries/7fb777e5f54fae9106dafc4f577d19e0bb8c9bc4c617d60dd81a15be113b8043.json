{"title":"ATML1 Regulates the Differentiation of ER Body–Containing Large Pavement Cells in Rosette Leaves of Brassicaceae Plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/7/1160/7642494?rss=1","date":1712534400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–derived organelles, ER bodies, participate in the defense against herbivores in Brassicaceae plants. ER bodies accumulate β-glucosidases, which hydrolyze specialized thioglucosides known as glucosinolates to generate bioactive substances. In <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, the leaf ER (LER) bodies are formed in large pavement cells, which are found in the petioles, margins and blades of rosette leaves. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in establishing large pavement cells are unknown. Here, we show that the <span>ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA</span> MERISTEM L1 LAYER (ATML1) transcription factor regulates the formation of LER bodies in large pavement cells of rosette leaves. Overexpression of <span>ATML1</span> enhanced the expression of LER body–related genes and the number of LER body–containing large pavement cells, whereas its knock-out resulted in opposite effects. ATML1 enhances endoreduplication and cell size through LOSS OF GIANT CELLS FROM ORGANS (LGO). Although the overexpression and knock-out of <span>LGO</span> affected the appearance of large pavement cells in <span>Arabidopsis</span>, the effect on LER body–related gene expression and LER body formation was weak. LER body–containing large pavement cells were also found in <span>Eutrema salsugineum</span>, another Brassicaceae species. Our results demonstrate that ATML1 establishes large pavement cells to induce LER body formation in Brassicaceae plants and thereby possibly contribute to the defense against herbivores.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"7fb777e5f54fae9106dafc4f577d19e0bb8c9bc4c617d60dd81a15be113b8043","category":"Environment"}
