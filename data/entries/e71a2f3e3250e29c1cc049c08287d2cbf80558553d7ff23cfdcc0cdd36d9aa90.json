{"title":"222 Validation of Brix for predicting sugar concentration of alfalfa and orchardgrass","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/186/7757198?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of Brix in predicting sugar concentrations in fresh alfalfa (<span>Medicago sativa L</span>.; ALF) and orchardgrass (<span>Dactylis glomerata L.</span>; OG) forages to be used as an inexpensive and rapid field-level assessment of relative energy in forages. In a 2-yr study, fresh forages samples from ALF and OG monoculture pastures in central Pennsylvania, U.S. were collected once monthly from May to September. Samples were immediately evaluated for Brix values with a hand-held digital refractometer, and the remaining biomass was frozen immediately with liquid N to halt cellular respiration. Samples were lyophilized and analyzed for individual sugars and wet chemistry nutritive analyses. Brix values were correlated with wet chemistry analyses using the PROC CORR procedure in SAS, with significance established at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. Brix was positively correlated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) with total and individual sugars in ALF during late spring and late summer (0.49 to 0.93), but correlations were non-existent (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) or negative (-0.55 to -0.73; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) in mid-summer. Brix values had moderate to strong negative correlations (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) to NDF and ADF in ALF (-0.57 to -0.71). Conversely, Brix values did not correlate (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) to any notable sugar parameters in OG beyond the first sampling date (0.60 to 0.74; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Brix was not correlated (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05) to NDF and ADF in OG. In summary, Brix values did not consistently predict sugar concentrations in fresh ALF and OG forages. Because Brix measures dissolved solids in solution (not just sugars), Brix readings collected from crushed ALF or OG samples may be confounded by fibrous fractions found in the solution as well as decreased sugar concentrations compared with fruit crops. Brix accuracy may also be dependent on seasonal temperature patterns, plant growth stage, and daily weather patterns. Other solutions should be investigated that rapidly assess sugar profiles and nutritive values of fresh forages.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"e71a2f3e3250e29c1cc049c08287d2cbf80558553d7ff23cfdcc0cdd36d9aa90","category":"Environment"}
