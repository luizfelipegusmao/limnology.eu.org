{"title":"Tympanic Pre-Operative Electrically Evoked Auditory Late Response (TympEALR) as an Alternative to Trans-Tympanic Tests Using Anesthesia in Cochlear Implant Candidacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1730/v1","date":1729671422000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Before a cochlear implant is considered, patients undergo various audiological tests to assess their suitability. One key test measures the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to acoustic stimuli. However, in some cases, even with maximum sound stimulation, no response is detected. Methods: The promontory test involves electrical stimulation near the auditory nerve, allowing patients to associate the sensation. Ideally, the electrode is placed in the middle ear after opening the eardrum. This method, along with LA-TT-EABR and LA-TT-EALR, helps assess the auditory nerve's existence and excitability. The TympEALR test, utilizing a tympanic PromCERA, provides an alternative measurement. Previous research has shown the possibility of deriving brainstem and cortical potentials through trans-tympanic electrical stimulation, allowing for objective assessment of the auditory nerve's integrity and potentially objectifying patient sensations. Results: Sixteen patients have been tested using TympEALR. In seven of these, we found a positive response. The morphology was similar to other EALRs, e.g., using cochlear implants or trans-tympanic stimulation electrodes. We observed a higher influence of electrical artifacts than in other EALRs. Conclusions: TympEALR showed positive results in nearly half of the study participants, potentially avoiding invasive procedures. TympEALR can be a valuable alternative to trans-tympanic methods. More research is needed to determine if a negative result suggests against cochlear implantation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dae0ff01adcf8aa1d30da5f0ee7d116d6a35c892bf96c50c9980ee9cabb6d258","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
