{"title":"Early Warning System for Toxic Cyanobacteria Blooms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1304/v1","date":1729085550000,"content":"Harmful cyanobacterial blooms produce cyanotoxins which can adversely affect humans and animals. Without proper monitoring and detection programs, tragedies such as the loss of pets or worse are possible. Multiple factors including rising temperatures and human influence contribute to the increased likelihood of harmful cyanobacteria blooms. Current approaches to cyanobacteria and their toxins monitoring included microscopic methods, immunoassays, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LCMS), and molecular methods such as qPCR. This review highlights current research into early detection methods for harmful cyanobacterial blooms and the pros and cons of these methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52f580af152f77d629beb4c41cd8f606a471746524d5c27daa941d77c63b9717","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
