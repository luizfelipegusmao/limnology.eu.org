Large-scale growth of <i>C. pyrenoidosa</i> in outdoor environments is subject to various stressors such as elevated temperature. The purpose of this study was to assess the protective effects of exogenous 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) on <i>C. pyrenoidosa</i> under high-temperature conditions. Compared to a temperature of 30°C, increasing the temperature to 43°C reduced the enzymatic capacity for carbon assimilation and resulted in the buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus reducing photosynthesis and proliferation. It was observed that exogenous EBL protected <i>C. pyrenoidosa</i> cells against high temperatures, with an optimal EBL concentration of 100 nM, resulting in enhanced capacity for photosynthetic carbon assimilation with a notable reduction in the imbalance between the absorption of light and energy used under high-temperature conditions. The addition of 100 nM EBL resulted in a 25.4% increase in cell density when exposed to elevated temperatures for 7 days. In addition, exogenous EBL reduced ROS production and increased the activities of critical antioxidant enzymes. This, in turn, mitigated heat-induced oxidative damage, resulting in advantageous outcomes in terms of cellular development and maintenance.</p>","author":"Fang Su, \nYongfu Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"90b3b1706fc0fa888ad0127bb223f419810134f6a310dd86f8e576f47bd3b255","category":"Environment"}
