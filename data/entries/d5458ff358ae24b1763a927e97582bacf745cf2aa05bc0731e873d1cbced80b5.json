{"title":"The Mechanism of Posterior Malleolar Fracture: A Finite Element Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1327/v1","date":1724150145000,"content":"Background: Good reduction of the articular surface and restoration of the congruent joint space are crucial for promoting positive outcomes in ankle fracture treatment. A good understanding of the mechanism of ankle fractures is indispensable to achieve these goals. Unfortunately, until now, the mechanism has still not been fully elucidated, particularly regarding the posterior malleolar fractures (PMFs). This study aims to provide insight into the mechanism of PMFs, thereby grasping the key to proceeding with PMFs reduction and fixation.\nMethods: An FE model of a normal ankle in tiptoe posture with 9 collateral ligaments was constructed from CT images. On the model, lateral malleolar fractures were made below, through, and above the syndesmosis; the medial malleolus was broken at its base; and ligaments were suppressed to simulate ligament rupture. A force of 1000 Newtons was applied on the talus head along talus axis. The posterior malleolar fragment (PMF) displacement, whether the talus impacts the posterior malleolus, and the initial mechanism displacing the PMF, were recorded.\nResults: A total of 15 tests were conducted. The tests, 'all collateral ligaments rupture', 'LMFB', 'LMFC+AITFL rupture', 'ATFL+CFL+PTFL rupture', 'ATTL+PTTL+TCL rupture', 'MMF', and 'MMF+AITFL rupture', presented significant PMF displacement. In tests 'MMF' and 'ATTL+PTTL+TCL rupture', the talus hit the medial edge of the PMF; but in tests 'ATFL+CFL+PTFL rupture' and 'all collateral ligaments rupture', the talus impacted the center part of the PMF. Except tests 'all collateral ligaments rupture' and 'ATFL+CFL+PTFL rupture', where PMF displacement was initially caused by talus impact, the other tests demonstrated PMF displaced following PITFL drag.\nConclusions: \nThis research discovered that rotation is the initial and major mechanism causing PMF displacement. The subsequent impact of the talus on the posterior malleolus may be the reason for large/blocky PMF. The talus impacting the posterior malleolus is always combined with talus rotation. Without the medial ankle structure being broken, big/blocky PMF may not occur. These findings suggest that, in clinical practice, reconstructing both the medial and lateral ankle structures is critical for achieving ankle stability, and this procedure even takes precedence over posterior malleolar fracture fixation itself.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5458ff358ae24b1763a927e97582bacf745cf2aa05bc0731e873d1cbced80b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
