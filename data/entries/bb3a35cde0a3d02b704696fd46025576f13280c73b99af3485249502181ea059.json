{"title":"The Ripple Framework: Co-Producing Social, Cultural, and Economic Value in Care through a Generative and Relational Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2224/v1","date":1725009291000,"content":"Work has been undertaken in healthcare sector to explore ways of co-produce design responses with different communities, and organisations. However, we lack empirical analysis of how design thinking can help tackle complexity. To assist the (anonymised for peer review) programme, we curated the Ripple Framework to develop trust and attempt to address the challenges of complexity in nursing. Through a generative design process data was used to collaboratively define bespoke co-design pathways with 31 participants from six Scottish care providers over ten months. Thematic, content and matrix analyses produced insights to inform vignettes illustrating how design responded to complex social care sector needs, with a particular focus on fulfilment and flourishing of the care workforce. Drawing on our empirical material and using the Design Research Value Model (Rodgers et al.), we illustrate how we have developed care's social, cultural, and economic value, through co-design, this way contributing to strategies to address the care crisis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb3a35cde0a3d02b704696fd46025576f13280c73b99af3485249502181ea059","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
