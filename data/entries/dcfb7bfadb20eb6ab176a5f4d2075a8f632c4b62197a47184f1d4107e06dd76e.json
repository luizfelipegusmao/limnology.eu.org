{"title":"Exploring the Role of Thy-1 and Its Soluble Form regarding Fibrosis Severity in Primary Biliary Cholangitis and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1171/v1","date":1715936624000,"content":"Portal myofibroblasts (PMF) are known to be critical in bile duct injury, but their role in liver fibrogenesis remains underexplored. Thy-1, an adhesion molecule integral to fibroblasts, relevant in fibrogenesis and detectable in serum as soluble Thy-1 (sThy-1), is expressed by PMF but not hepatic stellate cells in vitro. This study aimed to elucidate the correlation between Thy-1 expression in liver histology and sThy-1 levels in serum with the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). \nLiver histology samples were stained for Thy-1 and sThy-1 was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). \nIn patients with PBC and MASLD, portal Thy-1 expression significantly correlated with increased fibrosis. The sinusoidal Thy-1 expression also significantly correlated with increased fibrosis in patients with PBC (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dcfb7bfadb20eb6ab176a5f4d2075a8f632c4b62197a47184f1d4107e06dd76e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
