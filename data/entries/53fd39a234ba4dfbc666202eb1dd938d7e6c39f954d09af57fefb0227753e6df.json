{"title":"Unveiling the Metabolic Trajectory of Pig Feces across Different Ages and Senescence","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0009/v1","date":1725276969000,"content":"Porcine metabolomics research has been extensively conducted, primarily focusing on conventional cohorts or animal models. However, the composition and functions of fecal metabolites in pigs at various ages, particularly in the elderly, remain poorly understood. In the present study, an untargeted metabolomics approach was employed to analyze the fecal metabolomes of pigs at three distinct age stages, with the aim of elucidating age-associated changes in metabolite composition and functionality under standardized rearing conditions. Through the untargeted metabolomic analysis of fecal samples from young (one year), middle-aged (four years), and elderly (eight years) pig cohorts, a variety of age-related metabolites were identified. For example, L-methionine sulfoxide was observed to increase with age, while cytidine-5-monophosphate exhibited a concomitant gradual decrease during the aging process. These metabolites were found to undergo alterations across multiple biological pathways, including energy metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, the age-dependent metabolic changes were associated with known senescence biomarkers, offering new insights into the mechanistic understanding of aging in pigs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53fd39a234ba4dfbc666202eb1dd938d7e6c39f954d09af57fefb0227753e6df","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
