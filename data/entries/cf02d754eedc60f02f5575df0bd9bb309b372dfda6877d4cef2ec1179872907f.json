{"title":"Structural and Chemical Analysis of Entropy-Engineered Vanadium Rich 2D Thiophosphates (MPS3)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.660/7719755?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Metal thiophosphates (MPX<sub>3</sub>) have gained prominence for their intrinsic antiferromagnetic properties. These materials feature a layered van der Waals structure with [P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup> bipyramid anion units surrounded by octahedrally coordinated metal cations. By incorporating different metal cations, a diverse range of magnetic phases can be induced, making MPX<sub>3</sub> compounds promising subjects for condensed matter research into magnetic phases. Remarkably, V-based thiophosphates are comparatively understudied despite exhibiting the most stable antiferromagnetic ground state for the homogenous family of compounds [<a href=\"#ozae044.660-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.660-B2\">2</a>]. This is mainly due to the challenges in synthesizing the monometallic phase, which is plagued by the formation of a parasitic vanadium sulfide species. Through entropy engineering, we have stabilized V in the MPS<sub>3</sub> structure by alloying it as a bimetallic phase with Fe, Co, or Ni and as a high entropy material. These V-rich compounds are expected to maintain the large exchange parameter while possibly exhibiting magnetic frustration.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cf02d754eedc60f02f5575df0bd9bb309b372dfda6877d4cef2ec1179872907f","category":"Environment"}
