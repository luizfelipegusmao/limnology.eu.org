{"title":"Exploring the experiences of English-speaking women who have moved to Israel and subsequently used Israeli fertility treatment services: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309265","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Lucy Davies, Gilles de Wildt, Yael Benyamini, Anoushka Ramkumar, Rachel Adams</p>\r\nBackground <p>Israel’s pronatalist cultures result in a social expectation to have children and drive Israel’s fertility rate of 2.9. Israeli policy reflects this through funding unlimited fertility treatment up to two children. Societal pressure to have children exacerbates challenges of fertility treatment. Furthermore, the lack of financial burden creates a culture of perseverance following treatment failures. Whilst the experiences of Israeli women using fertility treatment have been studied, the experiences of women who migrated to Israel and were therefore raised in a different society have not. This study aimed to address this gap in knowledge.</p> Methods <p>A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to investigate the experiences of 13 English-speaking women who utilised Israeli state funded fertility treatment. Participants were located across Israel and were recruited using purposive sampling through social media. Data was analysed using framework analysis.</p> Results <p>Despite not being aimed at specific ethnic or religious groups, all respondents were Jewish. Three themes were identified: <i>1</i>. <i>Systemic factors</i>: The lack of financial burden was positive, however, participants struggled to navigate the bureaucratic healthcare system, especially when experiencing a language barrier. <i>2</i>. <i>Influence of others</i>: Encountering a cold bedside manner alongside contending with the expectations of a pronatalist society was challenging. Participants utilised support from other migrants who appreciated the same culture shock. Understanding of healthcare professionals regarding shared religious values further improved treatment experiences. <i>3</i>. <i>Impact of journey</i>: Participants often withdrew socially and the treatment process implicated upon their lives, jobs and relationships.</p> Conclusion <p>Navigating a bureaucratic system and pronatalist society are difficulties associated with fertility treatment in Israel. The lack of financial burden and an understanding of religious and cultural beliefs by healthcare providers improved treatment experience. Better provision of resources in English and further research into supporting women who are navigating Israel’s pronatalist society is required.</p>","author":"Lucy Davies","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"97749c7f9a6f5ed55c33007bfbea228533b3b957fcb0a08865302958b6041c3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
