{"title":"The Impact of Immersive Virtual Reality Therapy on Psychological and Functional Status in Elderly Female Patients Undergoing Inpatient Rehabilitation Following Hip Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1445/v1","date":1729252366000,"content":"Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common health condition that often requires procedures like total hip arthroplasty (THA). Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in managing OA, especially in supporting recovery and improving outcomes following THA. Given the rising demand for THA and the significant impact of OA on mobility and quality of life, effective rehabilitation strategies are essential. This study investigates the impact of virtual reality (VR) therapy on the psychological and functional outcomes of female patients undergoing rehabilitation post-THA. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted with 24 female patients aged 60 and older. Participants were randomized into two groups: a control group receiving 4-week standard rehabilitation and an experimental group receiving standard rehabilitation plus VR therapy. Psychological and functional statuses were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), and various functional tests before and after the intervention. Results: The experimental group showed significant improvements in psychological outcomes, with a 53% reduction in overall HADS scores and a 43% reduction in PSQ scores. Functional improvements were also observed, with significant increases in Tinetti Test, Barthel Index, and Rivermead Motor Assessment scores. In contrast, the control group showed no significant changes in psychological parameters and less pronounced functional improvements. Conclusions: VR therapy effectively enhances psychological well-being and functional recovery in women undergoing rehabilitation post-THA. These findings suggest that integrating VR therapy into standard rehabilitation protocols could improve outcomes and should be considered in future rehabilitation strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7860b621b2c586cbf2c194edcde5810368b2ed91d965c71d8db3b8b70805d36e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
