{"title":"Current-Induced Hall Effect","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1131/v1","date":1710839685000,"content":"The properties of the current-induced Hall effect are analysed, for which the static magnetic field, supplied  by an external source in the traditional experiment, is created by the current itself. The special experimental setup, needed for its observation, is described. It is shown how, combined with the skin effect, it could give access to the concentration of conduction electrons in superconductors. Besides this experiment might permit to dodge shortcomings, ensueing from the Meissner effect and limiting severely the sensitivity of the conventional Hall voltage measurement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"80bef3b3eab3242be9b0c777f5c00c7bb1411fb5ae7e1414a70eb72a68548593","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
