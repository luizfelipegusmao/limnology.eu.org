{"title":"Public Health in Disaster: Emotional Health and Life Incidents Extraction during Hurricane Harvey","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2291/v2","date":1724078962000,"content":"Countless disasters have resulted from climate change, causing severe damage to infrastructure and the economy. These disasters have significant societal impacts, necessitating mental health services for the millions affected. To prepare for and respond effectively to such events, it is crucial to understand people's emotions and the life incidents they experience both before and after a disaster strikes. In this case study, we mined the emotions and life incidents expressed on Twitter during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. Between August 20 and August 30, we collected a dataset of approximately 400,000 public tweets related to the storm. Using a BERT-based model, we predicted the emotions associated with each tweet. Following emotion prediction, we applied various natural language processing techniques to analyze the content of the tweets, aiming to uncover the 'topics' discussed alongside specific 'emotions.' To efficiently identify these topics, we utilized the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique for topic modeling, which allowed us to bypass manual content analysis and extract meaningful patterns from the data. However, rather than stopping at topic identification, we further refined our analysis by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Large Language Models (LLM). The GNN was employed to generate embeddings and construct a similarity graph of the tweets, which was then used to optimize clustering. This step ensured that related tweets were accurately grouped together based on their content and context. Subsequently, we used an LLM to automatically generate descriptive names for each event cluster. This advanced approach allowed us to identify and label life incidents automatically, providing a nuanced understanding of the key issues faced by the community during the hurricane. The results revealed significant emotional shifts as the hurricane reached its most devastating phase. These shifts coincided with pressing concerns and demands from the population, such as evacuation plans, animal safety, safety updates, public policy, help requests, flood impacts, and the spread of fake news. By combining GNN and LLM for automatic event name prediction, our study not only mapped out the emotions but also accurately categorized the specific life incidents that were most relevant during the disaster, offering critical insights for disaster preparedness and response strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da42ea0795596e4662fe1fcf08acd1a9cc7f8fb518688e6cfa7b8424bb6a8fc6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
