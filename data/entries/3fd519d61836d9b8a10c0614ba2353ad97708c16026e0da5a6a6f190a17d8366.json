{"title":"Ultrasonic A-scan Signals Data Augmentation using Electromechanical System Modelling to Enhance Cataract Classification Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2323/v1","date":1722257773000,"content":"A thorough understanding of the type and severity of cataracts is crucial for accurately estimating the optimal phacoemulsification energy. In preceding research efforts, an innovative clinical prototype known as the Eye Scan Ultrasound System (ESUS) was developed to facilitate the automated characterization of cataracts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype as a medical tool, extensive data must be collected from several patients with and without cataracts. However, obtaining an adequate number of patients and data for training and testing machine learning models is challenging. To overcome this limitation, the authors implemented a simulated prototype model of the ESUS system, to augment the data. The proposed model encompasses the electric-to-acoustic signal conversion in the ultrasonic transducer, the wave propagation through the eye, and the subsequent acoustic-to-electric signal conversion. Electrical modelling of the transducer was done using a two-port network and the wave propagation was modelled by using the k-Wave MATLAB toolbox. This holistic modelling approach enabled the generation of synthetic data augmentation, presenting great similarity with real data. The synthetic data can then be employed together with real data for the purpose of cataract classification.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fd519d61836d9b8a10c0614ba2353ad97708c16026e0da5a6a6f190a17d8366","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
