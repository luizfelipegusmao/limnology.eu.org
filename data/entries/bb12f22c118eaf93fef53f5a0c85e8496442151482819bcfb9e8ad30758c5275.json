{"title":"Understanding Postpartum Haemorrhage in Vietnam: A Comprehensive Review to Explore Current Status, Opportunities and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0376/v1","date":1717660606000,"content":"Postpartum haemorrhage remains a significant contributor to maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. PPH continues to pose challenges in both developed and developing nations despite being preventable. This review examines the current state of knowledge regarding PPH within the context of Vietnam, a country with its unique healthcare landscape. This review identifies critical areas for improvement and future research directions based on a comprehensive literature analysis, including epidemiological insights, risk factors, prevention strategies, and management approaches. Discrepancies in PPH definitions and prevalence rates across regions highlight the need for tailored interventions and policies. Understanding the specific challenges and opportunities related to PPH in Vietnam is crucial for informing evidence-based interventions and policies to improve maternal health outcomes. This review contributes to the broader global effort to reduce maternal mortality by addressing gaps in knowledge and proposing strategies to enhance PPH prevention and management in Vietnam.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb12f22c118eaf93fef53f5a0c85e8496442151482819bcfb9e8ad30758c5275","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
