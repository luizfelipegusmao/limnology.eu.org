{"title":"Exploring The Impact Of The Use Of Electronic Devices On Academic Procrastination Among University Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2313/v1","date":1722291377000,"content":"This study explores the incidence of using electronic devices on academic procrastination in university students. The procrastination profile, screen use habits, and perceived academic performance are analyzed, assessing the impact of screen use on the psychological dimensions of procrastination. An ad-hoc instrument and descriptive and correlational techniques were used for data analysis. The results reveal that procrastination is common among students, and they perceive their academic performance as good or very good with a similar result in their grade point average, indicating that procrastination does not seem to affect their performance significantly. About 50% report frequent use of screens, and although no widespread addictive behaviors are detected, 20% may be at risk of addiction. The dimensions of self-regulation, self-efficacy, and self-esteem show an inverse correlation with screen use, suggesting that less screen use improves these dimensions and reduces procrastination. In addition, high screen use is associated with higher levels of anxiety. Self-efficacy emerges as crucial to mitigating procrastination. In conclusion, although procrastination is prevalent, it does not appear to affect academic performance significantly, but excessive use of electronic devices negatively impacts key psychological dimensions and increases anxiety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d26ec4d312d7d9e427009eedee31d0bff1e995454faed8962396454a0b71924","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
