{"title":"A Dangerous Couple: Sequential Effect of Phosphorus Flame-Retardant and Polyurethane Decrease Locomotor Activity in Planarian Girardia tigrina","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0885/v1","date":1713148044000,"content":"Understanding the interplay among organophosphorus flame-retardants (OPFRs), microplastics, and freshwater organisms is crucial for unravelling the dynamics within freshwater environments and foreseeing the potential impacts of organic pollutants and plastic contamination. For that purpose, the present research assessed the exposure impact of 10 mg L–1 flame-retardant alumin-ium diethylphosphinate (ALPI), 10 μg mg–1liver microplastics polyurethane (PU), and the combina-tion of ALPI and PU on the freshwater planarian Girardia tigrina. The exposure of G. tigrina to both ALPI and PU revealed a sequential effect, i.e., a decrease in locomotor activity, while other molecular biomarkers (oxidative stress biomarkers and metabolic response) remained unaffected. Despite this fact, it was possible to observe that the range (min-max) of responses of exposed or-ganisms were altered, in the particular case of electron transport system, cholinesterase activity, glutathione S-transferase, catalase and levels of total glutathione and proteins, showing that the energetic costs for detoxification and antioxidant capacity might be causing less energy allocated for the planarian activity. By examining the physiological, behavioural, and ecological responses of planarians to these pollutants, insights can be gained into broader ecosystem-level effects and inform strategies for mitigating environmental risks associated with OPFRs and microplastic pol-lution in freshwater environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"992eff9d401bbb35c80990e388b9fcbc1e00a564be59185f547cef03d8845f27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
