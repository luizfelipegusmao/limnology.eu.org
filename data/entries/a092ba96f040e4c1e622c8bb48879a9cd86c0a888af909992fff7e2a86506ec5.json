{"title":"Leveraging LDA Feature Extraction to Augment Human Activity Recognition Accuracy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1528/v1","date":1719109243000,"content":"This research introduces a hybrid feature extraction approach that combines Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) methods to address the challenges of reducing feature vector dimensionality and accurately classifying smartphone-based human activities. Moreover, to refine activity classification accuracy, Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is employed. LDA, a statistical tool, is leveraged to derive a new feature space for data projection, enhancing class separation and test feature label prediction. The proposed approach, named LMSS, was evaluated using the UCI-HAR dataset and compared with state-of-the-art models. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperformed the best-performing method over this dataset. It achieved an accuracy rate of 99.52%, precision of 99.55%, recall of 99.53%, and an F1-score of 99.54%, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately classifying the data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a092ba96f040e4c1e622c8bb48879a9cd86c0a888af909992fff7e2a86506ec5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
