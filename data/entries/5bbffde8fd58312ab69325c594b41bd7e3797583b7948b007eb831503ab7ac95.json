{"title":"<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> uses the SigM signaling pathway to prioritize the use of its lipid carrier for cell wall synthesis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002589","date":1714399200000,"content":"<p>by Ian J. Roney, David Z. Rudner</p>\r\n\r\nPeptidoglycan (PG) and most surface glycopolymers and their modifications are built in the cytoplasm on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (UndP). These lipid-linked precursors are then flipped across the membrane and polymerized or directly transferred to surface polymers, lipids, or proteins. Despite its essential role in envelope biogenesis, UndP is maintained at low levels in the cytoplasmic membrane. The mechanisms by which bacteria distribute this limited resource among competing pathways is currently unknown. Here, we report that the <i>Bacillus subtili</i>s transcription factor SigM and its membrane-anchored anti-sigma factor respond to UndP levels and prioritize its use for the synthesis of the only essential surface polymer, the cell wall. Antibiotics that target virtually every step in PG synthesis activate SigM-directed gene expression, confounding identification of the signal and the logic of this stress-response pathway. Through systematic analyses, we discovered 2 distinct responses to these antibiotics. Drugs that trap UndP, UndP-linked intermediates, or precursors trigger SigM release from the membrane in &lt;2 min, rapidly activating transcription. By contrasts, antibiotics that inhibited cell wall synthesis without directly affecting UndP induce SigM more slowly. We show that activation in the latter case can be explained by the accumulation of UndP-linked wall teichoic acids precursors that cannot be transferred to the PG due to the block in its synthesis. Furthermore, we report that reduction in UndP synthesis rapidly induces SigM, while increasing UndP production can dampen the SigM response. Finally, we show that SigM becomes essential for viability when the availability of UndP is restricted. Altogether, our data support a model in which the SigM pathway functions to homeostatically control UndP usage. When UndP levels are sufficiently high, the anti-sigma factor complex holds SigM inactive. When levels of UndP are reduced, SigM activates genes that increase flux through the PG synthesis pathway, boost UndP recycling, and liberate the lipid carrier from nonessential surface polymer pathways. Analogous homeostatic pathways that prioritize UndP usage are likely to be common in bacteria.","author":"Ian J.
