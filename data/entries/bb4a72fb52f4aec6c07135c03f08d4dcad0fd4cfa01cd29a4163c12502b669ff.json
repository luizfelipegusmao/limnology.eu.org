{"title":"From Piracy to Development in the Western Indian Ocean: Securing a Blue Economy Space","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1210/v1","date":1729040074000,"content":"A new maritime order is emerging – the blue economy – characterised by a plethora of non-traditional security threats. Using the case of the Western Indian Ocean I demonstrate how the creation of spaces of risk in response to traditional security threats by world powers has led to a new, regionally-led governance regime in response to the new maritime order. International efforts to protect shipping lanes from the threat of piracy off the coast of Somalia have evolved into wider environmental and human security measures. I analyse these changes through the lens of governmentality and argue that this case represents an example of a global governmentality in which states are responsibilised to act collaboratively by the international community through discourses of risk. Regional States have turned this to their advantage, acting together to construct and secure a new development frontier - a shared blue economy space in an extensive and difficult-to-govern territory.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bb4a72fb52f4aec6c07135c03f08d4dcad0fd4cfa01cd29a4163c12502b669ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
