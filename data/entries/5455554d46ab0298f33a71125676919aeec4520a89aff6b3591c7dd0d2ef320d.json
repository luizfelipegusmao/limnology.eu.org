Through Bangladeshâ€™s current national cervical cancer screening program, only about 10% of the at-risk population is reached. Thus, Bangladesh is an ideal setting to consider HPV self-sampling to improve cervical cancer prevention efforts. However, the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling has not been evaluated in Bangladesh. We aimed to understand levels of HPV and cervical cancer knowledge and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling for cervical cancer screening in a semi-urban Bangladeshi community. Participants were recruited from a local clinic; 164 women completed a cross-sectional questionnaire about attitudes towards screening, and cervical cancer and HPV risk factor knowledge, and provided self-collected cervical samples for high-risk HPV testing. Of the participants, 4.3% tested positive for high-risk HPV and were referred for appropriate follow-up care. Nearly all participants had heard of cervical cancer, though specific knowledge was quite low. Self-sampling for high-risk HPV testing had high rates of acceptability, high rates of convenience, and very little discomfort and embarrassment reported in this study population, making implementing HPV self-sampling as a form of cervical cancer screening in Bangladesh appear feasible.","author":"Lilah Khoja","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"5455554d46ab0298f33a71125676919aeec4520a89aff6b3591c7dd0d2ef320d","category":"Environment"}
