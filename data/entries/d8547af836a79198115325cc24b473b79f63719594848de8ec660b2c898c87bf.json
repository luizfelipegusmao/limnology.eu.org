{"title":"Myo-inositol oxygenase CgMIOX3 alleviates S-RNase-induced inhibition of incompatible pollen tubes in pummelo","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/856/7712419?rss=1","date":1720656000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pummelo (<span>Citrus grandis</span> L. Osbeck) exhibits <span>S</span>-RNase-based self-incompatibility (SI), during which <span>S</span>-RNase cytotoxicity inhibits pollen tubes in an <span>S</span>-haplotype-specific manner. The entry of <span>S</span>-RNase into self-pollen tubes triggers a series of reactions. However, these reactions are still poorly understood in pummelo. In the present study, we used <span>S</span>-RNases as baits to screen a pummelo pollen cDNA library and characterized a <span>myo</span>-inositol oxygenase (CgMIOX3) that physically interacts with <span>S</span>-RNases. <span>CgMIOX3</span> is highly expressed in pummelo pollen tubes, and its downregulation leads to a reduction in pollen tube growth. Upon entering pollen tubes, <span>S</span>-RNases increase the expression of CgMIOX3 and enhance its activity by directly binding to it in an <span>S</span>-haplotype-independent manner. CgMIOX3 improves pollen tube growth under oxidative stress through ascorbic acid (AsA) accumulation and increases the length of self-pollen tubes. Furthermore, over-expression of <span>CgMIOX3</span> increases the relative length of self-pollen tubes growing in the style of petunia (<span>Petunia hybrida</span>). This study provides intriguing insights into the pumelo SI system, revealing a regulatory mechanism mediated by CgMIOX3 that plays an important role in the resistance of pollen tubes to <span>S</span>-RNase cytotoxicity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d8547af836a79198115325cc24b473b79f63719594848de8ec660b2c898c87bf","category":"Environment"}
