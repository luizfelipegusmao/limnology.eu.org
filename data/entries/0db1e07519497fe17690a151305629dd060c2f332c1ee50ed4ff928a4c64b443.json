{"title":"The Vision of University Students from the Educational Field in the Integration of ChatGPT","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0753/v1","date":1718138050000,"content":"ChatGPT has significantly increased in popularity in recent months because of its capacity to generate novel content and provide genuine responses to questions. Nevertheless, like all technologies, it is crucial to assess its limitations and features prior to implementing it into an educational setting. A major obstacle associated with ChatGPT is its tendency to produce consistent yet occasionally unreliable and inaccurate responses. Our study provides students with training in this area, and its objective was to analyse the opinion of those same university students studying education-related degrees regarding the efficacy of the usefulness of ChatGPT for their learning. We used a mixed methodology and two instruments for data collection: questionnaires and discussion groups. The sample comprised 150 university students pursuing degrees in Teaching and Social Education. The results show that the majority of students are familiar with the technology, but have not had any formal training at university. They use this tool to complete academic assignments outside the classroom, and they emphasise the need for training in it. Furthermore, following the training, the students highlight an increase in motivation and a positive impact on the development of generic skills such as information analysis, synthesis and management, problem-solving and learning how to learn. Ultimately, this study provides an opportunity to consider the implementation of educational training of this tool at university level in order to ensure its appropriate use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0db1e07519497fe17690a151305629dd060c2f332c1ee50ed4ff928a4c64b443","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
