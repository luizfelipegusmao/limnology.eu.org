{"title":"Hypoxia makes EZH2 inhibitor not easy—advances of crosstalk between HIF and EZH2","link":"https://academic.oup.com/lifemeta/article/doi/10.1093/lifemeta/loae017/7665267?rss=1","date":1714953600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Histone methylation plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2is) have been shown to be effective in treating hematologic malignancies, while their effectiveness in solid tumors remains limited. One of the major challenges in the treatment of solid tumors is their hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is a key hypoxia responder that interacts with EZH2 to promote tumor progression. Here we discuss the implications of the relationship between EZH2 and hypoxia for expanding the application of EZH2is in solid tumors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"3b533d7245d44314f8d8be23cd0567cd564d823cf3d862381cef5b8287ba75d9","category":"Environment"}
