{"title":"Iron Supplementation in the Treatment of Cocaine Use Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0825/v1","date":1712921637000,"content":"Many drastic actions are taken by cocaine users for the sake of experiencing high dopamine levels, which depends on iron for its synthesis. Dopamine depletion and iron deficiency are also involved in the symptoms of restless leg syndrome (RLS). The intersecting biochemical pathways of cocaine use, iron deficiency, and RLS have not been adequately investigated. This case report reveals the successful treatment of a patient with these conditions. A 63-year-old male with a history of cocaine use disorder, insomnia, and RLS sought emergency care for suicidality. Upon admission, he was also found to be iron-deficient. He revealed that his RLS worsened when he attempted to abstain from cocaine. He also used alcohol to sustain the effects of cocaine when the cost of cocaine was too high. During hospitalization, his mood, cravings, and RLS were resolved with adjunctive iron supplementation as well as 300 mg of Wellbutrin. If iron-deficient, replenishment of adequate dopaminergic receptor density and function via supplementation may play an essential role in the prevention of cocaine use and cessation of cocaine withdrawal. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and understand the implications of iron supplementation in addiction medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1424b5b402a96b8dae90e978b3e5305253e92c1522dca67a05ec77ef1bec7dca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
