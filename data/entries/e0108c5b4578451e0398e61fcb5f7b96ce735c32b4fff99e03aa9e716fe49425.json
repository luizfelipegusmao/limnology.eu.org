{"title":"Ecological comparison of native (<i>Apis mellifera mellifera</i>) and hybrid (Buckfast) honeybee drones in southwestern Sweden indicates local adaptation","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308831","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Finja Schaumann, Niclas Norrström, Mats Niklasson, Sonja Leidenberger</p>\r\n\r\nHoneybee drones’ only known task is to mate with a virgin queen. Apart from their mating behaviour, their ecology has been little studied, especially in comparison to honeybee females. Previous knowledge is primarily based on short-term direct observations at single experimental hives, rarely, if ever, addressing the effect of drones’ genetic origin. Here, Radio Frequency Identification Technology was utilised to gather drone and worker bee lifetime data of <i>Apis mellifera mellifera</i> and <i>Apis mellifera x</i> (hybrid Buckfast) colonies over one mating season (spring and summer) with the ultimate goal to investigate differences at subspecies level. This technique enabled continuous monitoring of tagged bees at the hive entrance and recording of individuals’ movement directions. The results confirmed that spring-born drones survive longer than summer-born drones and that they generally live longer than worker bees. Drones’ peak activity occurred in the afternoon while worker bees showed more even activity levels throughout the day. Earlier orientation flights than usually reported for drones were observed. In summer, mating flights were practiced before reaching sexual maturity (at 12 days of age). Differences were found between <i>Apis m</i>. <i>mellifera</i> and Buckfast drones, where <i>Apis m</i>. <i>mellifera</i> showed later drone production in spring, but significantly earlier first activities outside the hive in summer and a later peak in diurnal activity. Additionally, <i>Apis m</i>. <i>mellifera</i> flew more in higher light intensities and windy conditions and performed significantly longer flights than Buckfast drones. The observed differences in drone ecology indicate the existence of a local adaptation of the native subspecies <i>Apis m</i>. <i>mellifera</i> to environmental conditions in southwestern Sweden.","author":"Finja Schaumann","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e0108c5b4578451e0398e61fcb5f7b96ce735c32b4fff99e03aa9e716fe49425","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
