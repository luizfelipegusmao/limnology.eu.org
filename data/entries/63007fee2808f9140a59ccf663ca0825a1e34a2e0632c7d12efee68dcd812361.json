{"title":"Psychometric Assessment of the Communication Skills Scale among Peruvian Nurses and Exploration of Its Association with Job Insecurity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2282/v1","date":1727580222000,"content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Communication Skills Scale (CSS) among Peruvian nurses and its association with job insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored five models of confirmatory factor analysis for the CSS and its four subscales and assessed the convergent validity and criterion validity of the scale by analyzing its connection with job insecurity through stepwise multiple regression. We used insights from a focus group for the cultural adaptation of the scale. In the psychometric phase, 225 nurses participated through a virtual survey. The psychometric analysis revealed that the CSS and its subscales have a robust internal structure—similar to the original questionnaire—and are optimally reliable in the Peruvian population. Furthermore, the results show that job insecurity was associated with contract type, communication skills, empathy, and job satisfaction. The CSS and its subscales are valid and reliable to be applied to Peruvian nurses. Initiatives should be undertaken to strengthen communication skills and increase job satisfaction among nursing professionals by improving their working conditions, especially in times of crisis, to reduce job insecurity and promote well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63007fee2808f9140a59ccf663ca0825a1e34a2e0632c7d12efee68dcd812361","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
