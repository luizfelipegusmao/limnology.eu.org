Large-size valves usually contain several key parts and are generally produced in small-series production. Almost all the parts need to be manufactured in the same workshop at the same time in the plant. Facilities have to handle various items in one order, including different models, sizes, and types. It is a classical NP-hard problem on a large scale. An improved NSGA-II algorithm is suggested to obtain satisfactory solutions for makespan and manufacturing costs, which involve large optimization parameters and interactions. A two-section encoding method and an inserting greedy decoding method are chosen to enable the algorithm. The dynamic population update strategy based on dynamic population update and the adaptive mutation technique depending on the population entropy changing rate are selected for enhancing both the solution quality and population diversity. The methodology was successfully implemented in a real-life case at a major valve machining workshop operated by Yuanda Valve Company in China. By taking into account realistic factors and restrictions that have been identified from a real-world manufacturing setting, this technique aids in bridging the knowledge gap between present IPPS research and practical valve production implementations.","author":"Junqiang Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c264b4161555b9b4eaf65cf86bf9e17630680f54382eb04953954f5874e8275e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
