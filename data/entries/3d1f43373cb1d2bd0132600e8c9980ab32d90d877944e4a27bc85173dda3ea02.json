{"title":"Increasing Disparities in Mortality by Socioeconomic Status","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040617-014615","date":1522670400000,"content":"This review focuses on the widening disparities in death rates by socioeconomic class. In recent years, there has been a major increase in the availability of data linking mortality risk and measures of socioeconomic status. The result has been a virtual explosion of new empirical research showing not only the existence of large inequities in the risk of death between those at the top and those at the bottom of the socioeconomic distribution, but also that the gaps have been growing. This assessment of the empirical research finds a consistent pattern of growing disparities within the United States. However, this widening gap in death rates does appear to be a uniquely American phenomenon, as the disparities by socioeconomic class appear to be stable or even declining in Europe and Canada.","author":"Barry Bosworth","siteTitle":"Annual Review of Public Health","siteHash":"7a16e40f33727f64c92405053603e83c5cbbe960f1756170cbd1d528ffe78607","entryHash":"3d1f43373cb1d2bd0132600e8c9980ab32d90d877944e4a27bc85173dda3ea02","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
