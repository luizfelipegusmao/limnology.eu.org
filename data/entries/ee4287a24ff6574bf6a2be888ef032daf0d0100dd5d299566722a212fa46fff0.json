{"title":"The Collatz Conjecture: A New Perspective from Algebraic Inverse Trees","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.0773/v9","date":1698746504000,"content":"This paper addresses the Collatz Conjecture, an open question in mathematics that postulates all positive integers will eventually reach one when a pair of specific operations are repeatedly applied. Despite its apparent simplicity, the conjecture lacks a formal proof. To tackle this enigma, we introduce Algebraic Inverse Trees (AITs), data structures that trace inverse operations of the Collatz sequence. This new approach not only elaborates our unique methodology but also sheds light on the underlying complexities of the Collatz Conjecture.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee4287a24ff6574bf6a2be888ef032daf0d0100dd5d299566722a212fa46fff0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
