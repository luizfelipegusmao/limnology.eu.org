{"title":"In Silico Evaluation of Ten Monoclonal Antibodies Neutralization Power of SARS-CoV-2 Variants EG.5, BA.2.86 and JN.1","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1340/v1","date":1724078310000,"content":"The current globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants are showing immune escape and reduced susceptibility to antiviral drugs. Therefore, agencies responsible for drug evaluation and regulation such as the FDA and EMA are revising their emergency authorization use of several COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies. These MAbs proved to be unlikely effective against new variants especially Omicron descendants and several pharmaceutical companies are pursuing the development of more potent neutralizing antibodies. To address this issue, we used In Silico method we previously developed to assess 10 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies propensity to neutralize the new Omicron’s subvariants EG.5, BA.2.86 and JN.1, based on comparative binding affinity of 3D generated models and previous experimental and clinical observations. Nine of these MAbs were once granted emergency use authorization, and one is currently under clinical investigation. The results showed that one antibody showed a marked increase of the binding energy for EG.5 compared to two antibodies that showed a significant increase with Pirola (BA.2.86) and JN.1. This data indicates that the new SARS-CoV-2 variant escapes neutralization of most of the available therapeutic NAbs. Furthermore, the data showed new potential therapeutic MAbs combination that could be effective for the treatment countermeasure of the new Omicron’s descendants or potential novel variants.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df72d36e8a23f19b1f65c7a79c4bb4b7fbf58d68e4335b03047f435452af2166","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
