{"title":"APX2 Is an Ascorbate Peroxidase–Related Protein that Regulates the Levels of Plastocyanin in Chlamydomonas","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/4/644/7641244?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The function of ascorbate peroxidase–related (APX-R) proteins, present in all green photosynthetic eukaryotes, remains unclear. This study focuses on APX-R from <span>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</span>, namely, ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APX2). We showed that <span>apx2</span> mutants exhibited a faster oxidation of the photosystem I primary electron donor, P700, upon sudden light increase and a slower re-reduction rate compared to the wild type, pointing to a limitation of plastocyanin. Spectroscopic, proteomic and immunoblot analyses confirmed that the phenotype was a result of lower levels of plastocyanin in the <span>apx2</span> mutants. The redox state of P700 did not differ between wild type and <span>apx2</span> mutants when the loss of function in plastocyanin was nutritionally complemented by growing <span>apx2</span> mutants under copper deficiency. In this case, cytochrome <span>c6</span> functionally replaces plastocyanin, confirming that lower levels of plastocyanin were the primary defect caused by the absence of APX2. Overall, the results presented here shed light on an unexpected regulation of plastocyanin level under copper-replete conditions, induced by APX2 in <span>Chlamydomonas</span>.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"77621c957c388120b67e8d263aa49b5d5bd31f9ecfb111f5a16bd699cb0aca60","category":"Environment"}
