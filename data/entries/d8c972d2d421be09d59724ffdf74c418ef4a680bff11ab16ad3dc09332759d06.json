Methods First, we identified and annotated different cell types in CCA samples using single-cell sequencing data. Pseudotime analysis revealed the transcriptional status and differentiation process of CCA cells. We then explored interactions between CCA cells and their regulatory pathways through cell communication analysis. 47 key genes related to telomere activity were identified, and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Additionally, we constructed a prognostic model and verified the model's predictive efficacy. Finally, we identified genes associated with drug sensitivity in CCA patients and identified pathways associated with CCA prognosis through tumor TMB analysis. Results We identified 452 active telomere-associated cells. Then, we assessed telomere associated gene activity, obtaining 47 differentially expressed telomere genes by intersecting with CCA differentially expressed genes. Major up-regulated signaling pathways, including MIF-(CD74+CXCR4) and HLA-A-CD8A, were identified through pseudotime analysis. Three telomere-associated prognostic genes were identified using LASSO analysis, and prognostic-related models were built. In addition, PBRM1 mutation load was found to be highest in the high-risk group, making it a potential diagnostic target. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis revealed higher sensitivity to certain therapeutic drugs in the high-risk group, providing guidance for tailored CCA treatment. Conclusion The MIF-(CD74+CXCR4) and HLA-A-CD8A signaling pathways appear to be major pathways for CCA cell proliferation. Prognostic models based on telomere-associated genes show promise for application, indicating the biological and clinical significance of telomere activity genes in CCA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8c972d2d421be09d59724ffdf74c418ef4a680bff11ab16ad3dc09332759d06","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
