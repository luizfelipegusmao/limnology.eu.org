{"title":"Optimal Solutions for a Class of Impulsive Differential Problems with Feedback Controls and Volterra-Type Distributed Delay: A Topological Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0710/v1","date":1718102502000,"content":"In this paper, the existence of optimal solutions for problems governed by differential equations involving feedback controls is established, when the problem must account for a Volterra-type distributed delay and is subject to the action of impulsive external forces. The problem is reformulated within the class of impulsive semilinear integro-differential inclusions in Banach spaces and is studied using topological methods and multivalued analysis. The paper concludes with an application to a population dynamics model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3274033b91bb4a1500f8632c56835d4823d525ad58e8284a31cddcd6fe0f79ac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
