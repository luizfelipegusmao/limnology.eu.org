{"title":"Genetic Characterization of Lactococcus spp. Isolated from Brazilian Native Fish Species","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0255/v1","date":1712136183000,"content":"Piscine lactococcosis is a disease caused by Lactococcus garvieae, L. petauri and L. formosensis. It is considered to be an emerging disease and poses a risk to global aquaculture production. Studies of the genetic diversity of Lactococcus spp. strains have epidemiological importance since they provide information on the genetic relationships between isolates and indicate geographic and temporal distribution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of Brazilian Lactococcus spp. isolates obtained from native fish species using PCR-based DNA fingerprinting techniques. For this, 36 isolates were selected and submitted to gyrB sequencing, molecular serotyping, REP-, BOX-, and RAPD-PCR approaches. The discriminatory power and the congruence between the typing methods were calculated. After the correct taxonomic discrimination of the isolate, a total of 14, 5 and 17 isolates were reclassified as L. garvieae, L. formosensis and L. petauri, respectively. L. garvieae and L. petauri are related to serotype I, while L. formosensis strains were classified as serotype II. The typing methods tested are useful for evaluating the genetic diversity of isolates and a comprehensive indication of the diversity was found. Heterogeneous and homogeneous populations were observed for L. garvieae and L. petauri, respectively. RAPD-PCR demonstrated a greater discriminatory power for L. formosensis and L. petauri, while REP-PCR showed better results for L. garvieae strains, thus these methodologies are recommended for genotyping these bacterial species. In conclusion, Brazilian isolates of Lactococcus spp. obtained from native fish species constitute a genetically diverse population and the techniques used in this study allowed a better genetic characterization of the isolates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d54ca62f73e78ca6c8f166414108b3965b35047230d20100a5a831076f4aee72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
