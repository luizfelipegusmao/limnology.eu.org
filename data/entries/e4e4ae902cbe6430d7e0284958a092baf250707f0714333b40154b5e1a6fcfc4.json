{"title":"Are rotifer indices suitable for assessing the trophic status in slow-flowing waters of canals?","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05275-7","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>\n      Zooplankton indicators based on rotifers (TSI<sub>ROT</sub>) and an indicator based on Secchi disk visibility (TSI<sub>SD</sub>) were used to assess trophic state changes in artificial, slow-flowing, and stagnant canal waters. The study was conducted in the summers of 2019, 2021, and 2022 in the Bydgoszcz Canal and the Noteć Canal (Poland). Water samples were taken from five sites once in the month of July and once in August. In terms of the species number and density, rotifers dominated among zooplankton (at almost all sites), which reflected the high trophic state. Our results showed statistically significant correlations between TSI<sub>ROT</sub> and TSI<sub>SD</sub> as well as between the individual indicators TSI<sub>ROT1</sub> (Rotifer numbers), TSI<sub>ROT2</sub> (Rotifer biomass), TSI<sub>ROT3</sub> (bacterivorous numbers of rotifers), TSI<sub>ROT6</sub> (rotifers indicating high trophic state), and TSI<sub>SD</sub>. According to our study, the presented indices most likely determine the trends between TSI<sub>ROT</sub> cumulative and TSI<sub>SD</sub> in the studied canals. Similarly to previous studies performed on lakes and small reservoirs, zooplankton constituted a useful indicator of trophic state. It seems that, for stagnant and slowly flowing waters of canals such as the Bydgoszcz Canal and the Noteć Canal, the method of zooplankton trophic status indicators based on rotifers may be applied.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"e4e4ae902cbe6430d7e0284958a092baf250707f0714333b40154b5e1a6fcfc4","category":"Environment"}
