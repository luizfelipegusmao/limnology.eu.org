Recently, a selective thiosulfate uptake pathway involving a membrane protein YeeE (TsuA) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> was characterized. YeeE-like proteins are conserved in some bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. However, the precise function of YeeE, along with its potential partner protein in the thiosulfate ion uptake pathway, remained unclear. Here, we assessed selective thiosulfate transport via <i>Spirochaeta thermophila</i> YeeE in vitro and characterized <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> YeeD (TsuB) as an adjacent and essential protein for YeeE-mediated thiosulfate uptake in vivo. We further showed that <i>S</i>. <i>thermophila</i> YeeD possesses thiosulfate decomposition activity and that a conserved cysteine in YeeD was modified to several forms in the presence of thiosulfate. Finally, the crystal structures of <i>S</i>. <i>thermophila</i> YeeE-YeeD fusion proteins at 3.34-Å and 2.60-Å resolutions revealed their interactions. The association was evaluated by a binding assay using purified <i>S</i>. <i>thermophila</i> YeeE and YeeD. Based on these results, a model of the sophisticated uptake of thiosulfate ions by YeeE and YeeD is proposed.","author":"Mai Ikei","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"c09559755160830efb633ca6a7398d421f37ed10499a835f875f3f79219b83dc","category":"Environment"}
