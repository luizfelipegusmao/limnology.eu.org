{"title":"Vitamin Solutions Effects on Reproduction of Broodstock, Growth Performance and Survival Rate of Pangasius Catfish Fingerling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1037/v1","date":1718787442000,"content":"A feeding study was conducted to evaluate the different diets supplemented with vitamin solution effect on broodstock reproduction, growth performances, and the survival rates of larvae and fry of Pangasius catfish during over-spawning season. The experiment of broodstock cultivation was set up as a diet supplement design with six different diets consisting of vitamin solution, each diet fed to triplicate groups of fish, the stocking density of 10 broodstock fish (07 females and 03 males) per hapa net. Fish larvae and fry were reared in the hatchery for 45 days after hatching to evaluate growth performances and survival rates of fish fingerling.\nThe growth and reproductive performances of breeders fed with different test diets showed that there were differences among the six tested diets (P &lt; 0.05). The highest final body weight (FBW), weight gain (WG), daily weight gain (DWG), specific growth rate (SGR) of broodstock and survival rate of Pangasius fingerlings were found in Treatment 5, which contained 0.6% H-OVN for Pangasius Broodstock mixed with 12.6% algal oil and Treatment 3, which contained 0.6% vitamin premix H-OVN for Pangasius Broodstock compared to other Treatments. With these test diets, the Gonadosomatic index (GSI), relative fecundity index (RFI), fertilized egg, hatching rates of eggs, and survival rate of fingerling ranged between a 6.7–12.8%, 104,267–199,512 eggs/kg, 62.2–93.6%, 43.5–76.2%, and 45.3–66.3%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The findings of this study showed that the diet containing 35% CP contents supplemented with 0.6% vitamin premix H-OVN mixed with algal oils showed the highest results in terms of growth, reproductive performance indices, and survival rates of Pangasius catfish fingerling.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6e6ae30adfff759a27e68340bddda5c0bd0a65db5b93ca8b2775bdcd0d2031b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
