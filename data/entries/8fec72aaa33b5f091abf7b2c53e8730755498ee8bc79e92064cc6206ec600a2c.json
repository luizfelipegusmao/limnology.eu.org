{"title":"The Global Climate Crisis is Associated with Environmental Risks and Heat Stress impacts on Occupational Safety, Health, and Hygiene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1280/v1","date":1729068687000,"content":"The relationship between the global climate crisis associated with environmental risks and occupational hygiene has not been extensively studied. This study develops a framework for identifying how climate change and the climate crisis could impact the workplace environment, workers, and occupational morbidity, mortality, and injury. A framework based on a review of scientific literature published from 2012-2024 that addresses climate risks, their interaction with occupational hazards, and their effects on the workforce. Eight categories of climate-related hazards are identified: increased high temperatures, dust and air pollution, sun and cosmic ultraviolet exposure, pandemics, and infectious diseases, diseases transmitted by insects and changes in ecosystems, industrial occupational diseases, changes and crises in the built environment, and extreme weather events. It is important to consider the possibility of interactions between known hazards and new conditions and the productivity of workers, especially those who are most at risk of heat-related illnesses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8fec72aaa33b5f091abf7b2c53e8730755498ee8bc79e92064cc6206ec600a2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
