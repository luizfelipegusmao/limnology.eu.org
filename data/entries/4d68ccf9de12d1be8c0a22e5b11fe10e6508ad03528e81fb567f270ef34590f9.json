In a continuous-flow growth chamber, the resistance to crystal growth due to the volume diffusion may be reduced or even eliminated by increasing the solution flow rate through the growth chamber. Therefore, the effects of the sole surface reaction step on the growth kinetics can be investigated [<a href=\"#ozae044.1057-B1\">1</a>]. In addition, the effects of the sole surface reaction step on the growth kinetics of sucrose due to the presence of glucose will be studied.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4d68ccf9de12d1be8c0a22e5b11fe10e6508ad03528e81fb567f270ef34590f9","category":"Environment"}
