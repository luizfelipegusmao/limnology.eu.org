{"title":"Understanding the Impact of Seismic Hazard and Climate Conditions on Multi Criteria&ndash;Based Retrofitting of Existing Buildings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0748/v2","date":1716201668000,"content":"A large share of the reinforced concrete (RC) building stock in Mediterranean countries faces a dual challenge of seismic vulnerability and energy inefficiency, calling for urgent renovation efforts. While energy upgrades have been the focus of previous renovation policies, recent research highlights the critical need for integrated retrofitting solutions that address both structural integrity and energy performance. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches are a promising tool for optimizing the combined choice of these integrated interventions, considering various decision variables (DVs) of economic, social, environmental, and technical nature. To understand the impact of climate and seismic hazard conditions on multi-criteria-based retrofitting assessment, a case-study RC school building is selected and assumed to be located in three distinct climate conditions, cold, mild, and warm, and three seismic hazard levels, low, medium and high. Moreover, given the complexity and challenges of quantifying seismic performance metrics for practitioners, an available simplified (practice-oriented) approach is compared herein with a more thorough research-based one for quantifying the seismic performance of RC buildings within the MCDM framework. Both approaches are applied to the case-study building, considering twelve possible combinations of energy and seismic interventions. The accuracy of the practice-oriented approach and its impact on the retrofitting rankings is evaluated, emphasizing the importance of accessible and efficient evaluation methods in facilitating informed decision-making for building renovation","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f44df7ddfc75344d4126733c3b4ab0ccfb29f5452a3dc5f265deb5465d01b7ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
