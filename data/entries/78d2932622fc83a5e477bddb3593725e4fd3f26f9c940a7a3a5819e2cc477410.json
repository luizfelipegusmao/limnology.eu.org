{"title":"Generalized Bayesian Inference Study Based on Type-II Censored Data from the Class of Exponential Distributions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0087/v1","date":1725324604000,"content":"Generalized Bayesian (GB) is a Bayesian approach based on the learning rate parameter (LRP) () as a fraction of the power of the likelihood function. In this paper, we consider the GB method to perform inference studies for a class of exponential distributions. Generalized Bayesian estimators (GBE) and generalized empirical Bayesian estimators (GEBE) for the parameters of the considered distributions were obtained based on the censored type II samples. In addition, generalized Bayesian prediction (GBP) and generalized empirical Bayesian prediction (GEBP) were considered using a one-sample prediction scheme. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare the performance of the GBE and GEBE estimation results and the GBP and GEBP prediction results for different values of the LRP.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78d2932622fc83a5e477bddb3593725e4fd3f26f9c940a7a3a5819e2cc477410","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
