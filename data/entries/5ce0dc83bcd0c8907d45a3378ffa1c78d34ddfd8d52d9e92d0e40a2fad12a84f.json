{"title":"The inhibitory action of lactocin 63 on deterioration of seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus) during chilled storage","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13284?af=R","date":1712732400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The bacteriocins, particularly derived from lactic acid bacteria, currently exhibit potential as a promising food preservative owing to their low toxicity and potent antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lactocin 63, produced by <i>Lactobacillus coryniformis</i>, in inhibiting the deterioration of <i>Lateolabrax japonicas</i> during chilled storage, while also investigating its underlying inhibitory mechanism. The measurement of total viable count, biogenic amines, and volatile organic compounds were conducted, along with high-throughput sequencing and sensory evaluation.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The findings demonstrated that treatment with lactocin 63 resulted in a notable retardation of bacterial growth in <i>L. japonicas</i> fish fillet during refrigerated storage compared with the water-treated and nisin-treated groups. Moreover, lactocin 63 effectively maintained the microbial flora balance in the fish fillet and inhibited the proliferation and metabolic activity of specific spoilage microorganisms, particularly <i>Shewanella</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter</i>. Furthermore, the production of unacceptable volatile organic compounds (e.g. 1-octen-3-ol, hexanal, nonanal), as well as the biogenic amines derived from the bacterial metabolism, could be hindered, thus preventing the degradation in the quality of fish fillets and sustaining relatively high sensory quality.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The results of this study provide valuable theoretical support for the development and application of lactocin 63, or other bacteriocins derived from lactic acid bacteria, as potential bio-preservatives in aquatic food. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Peifen Wu, \nJie Yang, \nXiaojie Meng, \nYanlin Weng, \nYayi Lin, \nRuili Li, \nXucong Lv, \nLi Ni, \nJin‐Zhi Han, \nCaili Fu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5ce0dc83bcd0c8907d45a3378ffa1c78d34ddfd8d52d9e92d0e40a2fad12a84f","category":"Environment"}
