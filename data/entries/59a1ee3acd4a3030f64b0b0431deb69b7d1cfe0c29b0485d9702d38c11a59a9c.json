{"title":"Scenario of Pakistan 5 Years after Screening Mammography Intervention: Are We Ready for a National Guideline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1188/v2","date":1721314390000,"content":"Abstract: Cancer, notably breast cancer, is a significant health concern globally, with a substantial burden in Asia, particularly in Pakistan. Late diagnosis exacerbates mortality rates, emphasizing the importance of robust screening programs. This article examines the effectiveness of breast cancer screening initiatives and intervention four years after initial pilot study that spanned 2015-2019, using data from the Islamabad Federal Breast Screening Centre, to assess readiness for national guideline implementation in Pakistan and beyond. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study, conducted at the Federal Breast Screening Center (FBSC), involved 5,580 patients undergoing mammography screening over an four-year period from 2015 to 2023. The study examined patients' data, including Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) categories through double reading mammography and complementary ultrasound (USG) findings. Demographic information, including age, ethnicity, education status, socio-economic factors, breastfeeding history, breast density, and family history, was recorded to analyze its correlation with breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent management. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 2021. Results: The study included a total of 5580 patients who visited the Federal Breast Screening Centre from 2020 to 2023. The mean age of patients attending screenings from 2020 to 2023 was 48.50 Â± 9.55 years, with the most common age group being 41-45 years 1,364 (24.4%), followed by 46-50 years 1,008 (18.1%). The ethnicity with the highest frequency was Punjabi 4,647 (83.3%). The distribution of patients across BI-RADS categories was as follows: BI-RADS 0 (n=175, 3.10%), BI-RADS I (n=1,933, 34.60%), BI-RADS II (n=1,691, 30.30%), BI-RADS III (n=642, 11.50%), BI-RADS IV (n=612, 11.00%), BI-RADS V (n=389, 7.00%), and BI-RADS VI (n=138, 2.50%). The prevalence rate of invasive breast cancer during these four years was 10.4%. Conclusion:In conclusion, breast cancer poses an escalating challenge associated with increasing mortality rates. Pakistan, alongside its South Asian counterparts, is witnessing a surge in cases, emphasizing the urgency for comprehensive interventions. Research endeavors such as this provide valuable insights into demographic profiles, aiding in the formulation of tailored guidelines. Moreover, the establishment of additional federal centers for screening is imperative to enhance patient access and mitigate the issue of delayed diagnoses, aligning Pakistan's healthcare infrastructure with that of developed nations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59a1ee3acd4a3030f64b0b0431deb69b7d1cfe0c29b0485d9702d38c11a59a9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
