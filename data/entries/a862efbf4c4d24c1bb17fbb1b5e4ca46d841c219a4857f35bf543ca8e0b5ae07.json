{"title":"PHOSPHATE1-mediated phosphate translocation from roots to shoots regulates floral transition in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/5054/7675318?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Phosphorus nutrition has been known for a long time to influence floral transition in plants, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Arabidopsis phosphate transporter PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) plays a critical role in phosphate translocation from roots to shoots, but whether and how it regulates floral transition is unknown. Here, we show that knockout mutation of <span>PHO1</span> delays flowering under both long- and short-day conditions. The late flowering of <span>pho1</span> mutants can be partially rescued by Pi supplementation in rosettes or shoot apices. Grafting assay indicates that the late flowering of <span>pho1</span> mutants is a result of impaired phosphate translocation from roots to shoots. Knockout mutation of <span>SPX1</span> and <span>SPX2</span>, two negative regulators of the phosphate starvation response, partially rescues the late flowering of <span>pho1</span> mutants. PHO1 is epistatic to PHO2, a negative regulator of PHO1, in flowering time regulation. Loss of <span>PHO1</span> represses the expression of some floral activators, including <span>FT</span> encoding florigen, and induces the expression of some floral repressors in shoots. Genetic analyses indicate that at least jasmonic acid signaling is partially responsible for the late flowering of <span>pho1</span> mutants. In addition, we find that rice <span>PHO1;2</span>, the homolog of <span>PHO1</span>, plays a similar role in floral transition. These results suggest that PHO1 integrates phosphorus nutrition and flowering time, and could be used as a potential target in modulating phosphorus nutrition-mediated flowering time in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"a862efbf4c4d24c1bb17fbb1b5e4ca46d841c219a4857f35bf543ca8e0b5ae07","category":"Environment"}
