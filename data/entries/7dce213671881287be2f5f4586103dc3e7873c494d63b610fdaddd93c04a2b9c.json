{"title":"A high-yielding recipe: Cytokinin signaling in soybean roots affects phosphorus uptake efficiency and crop production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1260/7425534?rss=1","date":1700179200000,"content":"<span>As autotrophs, plants require relatively little input to produce both vegetative and reproductive tissue but still need key nutrients for growth and development, particularly nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. These 3 elements are the major components of commercial fertilizers, though the efficacy of these fertilizers relies on the efficient uptake of these nutrients from the soil by plant root systems. Increasing nutrient uptake efficiency is consequently a key target in agricultural research. The less supplemental fertilizer, sourced from nonrenewable mineral deposits, is required by crops, the more economical, sustainable, and environmentally sensitive production of these crops can be (<a href=\"#kiad616-B3\">Fageria et al. 2008</a>). Mineral nutrients are taken up from surrounding soil by roots, and plant root system architecture can change drastically in response to nutrient availability to seek out deficient nutrients. Much of this plasticity in root growth is regulated by hormones that affect the production of primary and lateral roots that shapes a root system's architecture (<a href=\"#kiad616-B4\">LÃ³pez-Bucio et al. 2003</a>). Particularly the balance in the root meristem between cell division, promoted by the hormone auxin, and cell differentiation, promoted by the hormone cytokinin, can affect many physiological traits in root architecture to build a root system that responds in real time to nutrient availability (<a href=\"#kiad616-B1\">Chapman and Estelle 2009</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"7dce213671881287be2f5f4586103dc3e7873c494d63b610fdaddd93c04a2b9c","category":"Environment"}
