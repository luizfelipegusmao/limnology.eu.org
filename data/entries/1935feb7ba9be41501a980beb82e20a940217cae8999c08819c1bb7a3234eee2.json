{"title":"Clinical Effect of Propolis and Mangosteen Extract Complex in Subjects with Gingivitis: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0570/v1","date":1723129625000,"content":"This study investigated the efficacy and safety of a propolis mangosteen extract complex (PMEC) on gingival health in patients with gingivitis and incipient periodontitis. A multi-centered randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 104 subjects receiving either PMEC or placebo for eight weeks was conducted. The primary focus was on changes in inflammatory biomarkers from gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), with clinical parameters as secondary outcomes. Results revealed that the PMEC group showed significantly reduced expression of all measured GCF biomarkers compared to the placebo group (p&amp;lt;0.0001) at 8 weeks, including substantial reductions in IL-1Î², PGE2, MMP-8, and MMP-9 levels compared to baseline. While clinical parameters trended towards improvement in both groups, inter-group differences were not statistically significant. No significant adverse events were reported, indicating a favorable safety profile. These findings suggest that PMEC consumption can attenuate gingival inflammation and mitigate periodontal tissue destruction by modulating key inflammatory mediators in gingival tissue. Although PMEC shows promise as a potential adjunctive therapy for supporting gingival health, the discrepancy between biomarker improvements and clinical outcomes warrants further investigation to fully elucidate its therapeutic potential in periodontal health management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1935feb7ba9be41501a980beb82e20a940217cae8999c08819c1bb7a3234eee2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
