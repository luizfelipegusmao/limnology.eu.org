We also explored associations between physical activity (PA) <i>per se</i> and body composition. This study presents secondary outcomes of the FitMum randomized controlled trial, which included healthy inactive pregnant women at gestational age ≤ 15+0 weeks. They were randomized to structured supervised exercise training, motivational counselling on PA, or standard care. Maternal body composition was measured by doubly labeled water at 28 weeks gestation (<i>n</i> = 134) and by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan 7–14 days after delivery (<i>n</i> = 117). PA, including moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA), active kilocalories, and steps, were measured continuously from inclusion to delivery by a wrist-worn activity tracker. One hundred fifty pregnant women were included with a median pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) of 24.1 (21.6–27.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. We found no differences between groups in fat mass, fat percentage or fat-free mass at 28 weeks gestation or 7–14 days after delivery. Visceral adipose tissue mass and bone mineral density measured 7–14 days after delivery did not differ between groups either. Linear regression analyses adjusted for pre-pregnancy BMI showed that a higher number of daily steps was associated with lower fat mass, fat percentage, and visceral adipose tissue mass at 28 weeks gestation and 7–14 days after delivery. Active kilocalories during pregnancy was positively associated with fat-free mass 7–14 days after delivery. Neither structured supervised exercise training nor motivational counselling on PA during pregnancy affected maternal body composition at 28 weeks gestation or 7–14 days after delivery compared to standard care. Interestingly, when adjusted for pre-pregnancy BMI, higher number of daily steps was associated with lower fat content during pregnancy and after delivery, whereas MVPA and active kilocalories were not.\r\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT03679130; 20/09/2018.","author":"Caroline Borup Roland","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7001cc3ba7488aa3b95a8508f22d30f1fca3950e7eb4c9999181401b3e80a655","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
