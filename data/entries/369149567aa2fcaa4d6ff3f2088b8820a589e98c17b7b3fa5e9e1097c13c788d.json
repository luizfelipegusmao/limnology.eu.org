{"title":"The Protection Level of S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G Antibodies Using The Chemiluminescent Immunoassay Compared To The Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1751/v1","date":1719306180000,"content":"COVID-19 infection in high-risk populations is fatal and has a poor prognosis, necessitating a test to determine the protectiveness of immune response. Antibody testing is necessary to determine the body's immune response to COVID-19 infection and also vaccination strategies. Among the various methods available, chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) test is more widely used and accessible to determine antibody levels. This study aimed to determine the protection level of S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG using CLIA compared to Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (SVNT). The population of this study comprised all healthcare professionals who experienced S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level examinations. S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were examined using CLIA and SVNT. The cut-off was determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve) measurements were evaluated. The result showed a strong positive correlation between S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA and SVNT with a value of r=0.933 and p &amp;lt;0.001. The value â‰¥37.29 BAU/mL was determined as the cut-off based on SVNT 30% inhibition level with sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of 96.5%, 90.9%, 96.5%, and 90.9%, respectively. A titer of antibodies greater than or equal to 37.29 BAU/mL with CLIA showed the presence of protective antibodies compared to SVNT.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"369149567aa2fcaa4d6ff3f2088b8820a589e98c17b7b3fa5e9e1097c13c788d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
