{"title":"Carbon Emission Prediction of Transportation Industry in Jiangsu Province Based on WOA-SVM Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0462/v1","date":1722983551000,"content":"In order to help the transportation industry achieve the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, this study is based on the selection of eight variables, such as population size, per ca pita GDP, personal vehicle ownership, passenger and freight turnover, and green space coverage, as the factors influencing the carbon emissions of the transportation industry in Jiangsu Province, and the prediction and analysis of the transportation carbon emission trends from 2000 to 2021, and the prediction and analysis of the carbon emissions of the transportation industry and the time of the peak of the carbon emissions in Jiangsu Province. The trend of transportation carbon emissions from 2000 to 2021 was predicted and analyzed, and the carbon emissions and peak time of carbon emissions in the transportation industry in Jiangsu Province were predicted and analyzed. Comparing the predicted results with other models to verify the accuracy of the results, it was found that the WOA-SVM model had the smallest error among several models. On this basis, targeted measures are proposed to accelerate the process of carbon peak and ensure the smooth achievement of carbon neutrality goals in Jiangsu Province. The results indicate that under the current policy measures, the peak carbon emissions in Jiangsu Province will occur in 2038, with a peak of 48.72 million tons. Jiangsu Province should actively adopt energy-saving and emission-reduction measures, build a green and low-carbon transportation development model, and achieve the carbon peak target ahead of schedule.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40694d26bd0efef84e57e8621c416ea4fbc2cb8fb04b2e80679b6b9ddf2925a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
