{"title":"Climate Change Risks Impacts on Public Health Correlated with Air Pollution, African Dust in South Europe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1234/v1","date":1729017183000,"content":"Climate change poses a significant risk to the environment and public health, leading to extreme weather patterns, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. The relationship between air pollution from African dust and climate change demonstrates its critical role in trapping heat in the atmosphere, resulting in heat-related illnesses, heart problems, and respiratory issues. This Research points to the detrimental effects of pollutants such as smog, dust, acid rain, and ozone depletion on ecosystems, highlighting the importance of using Geographically Weighted Regression modeling and MODIS-NDVI analysis to address air pollution. Particulate Matter (PM 2.5-10) and ozone levels can have negative impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health. Proactive steps, such as implementing clean energy technologies and enforcing stricter pollution regulations, are necessary to protect public health. Acting is crucial to addressing these global challenges and creating a cleaner, healthier future for future generations, underscoring the need for climate justice commitment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c1c5b4871be2d845cf75d45cbb0645dd66ecbab93d3d1f91c52cbec6582a46d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
