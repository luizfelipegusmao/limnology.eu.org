{"title":"Pan-Arctic Lead Maps based on Sentinel-1 SAR Images with a Convolutional Neural Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0905/v1","date":1726050698000,"content":"The Sentinel-1 SAR Extra Wide swath mode with its 40 meters pixel size allows accurate lead mapping in Arctic sea ice areas.\n  We present an improved winter lead detection algorithm based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network.\n  We introduce a preprocessing procedure that balances normalized radar cross section (NRCS) values between sub-swaths.\n  This results in more consistent Sentinel-1 SAR images as input for the classifier, which is especially important for the cross-polarization HV channel.\n  In turn, image consistency is essential for automatic image semantic segmentation.\n  We develop a new lead detection algorithm and compare it with a previously published version.\n  We produce pan-Arctic, 40 meters resolution lead maps and present pan-Arctic lead area fraction on a 12 km grid for January 2019.\n  Within different Arctic regions, the lead area fraction is stable and varies only within the expected natural variability during the one month studied here.\n  The average Arctic-wide lead area fraction is 2.44 % with 0.25 % standard deviation during January 2019.\n  The improved lead detection algorithm leads to a better lead discrimination and extends the applicability area to the entire Arctic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31e60129f6cf393cefdb834fb2ade010cac259660f31477e23d9f97564aa29ea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
