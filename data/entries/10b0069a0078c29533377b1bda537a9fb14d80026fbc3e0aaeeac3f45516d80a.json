{"title":"Efficacy and Safety of GLP-1RAs including Tirzepatide, in the Management of Obesity in Nondiabetic Patients: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2397/v1","date":1722406881000,"content":"Background Obesity is a major healthcare challenge worldwide. Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as a promising pharmacological option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity in diabetic patients.  Objective This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP-1RAs in nondiabetic patients.  Methods We systematically reviewed 2356 published articles from the past ten years (2013 to November 22, 2023). After rigorous screening, 11 articles were selected for an in-depth review. The analysis focused on the efficacy and safety of GLP-1RAs in nondiabetic patients, considering various baseline characteristics and subgroups.  Results The review found that GLP-1RAs, including exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, and the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1RA) tirzepatide, significantly promoted weight loss in obese/overweight nondiabetic patients. Additionally, these agents positively affected cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, glycemic control, nephropathy, lipid levels, serum insulin levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP) profiles. However, GLP-1RAs, including tirzepatide, were associated with gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation. These adverse events were typically transient, mild-to-moderate in severity, and subsided over time.  Conclusion GLP-1RAs are effective and relatively safe for weight management and improving cardiovascular risk factors in nondiabetic patients, despite the occurrence of some gastrointestinal side effects. Further research is warranted to optimize the use of these agents in nondiabetic populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10b0069a0078c29533377b1bda537a9fb14d80026fbc3e0aaeeac3f45516d80a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
