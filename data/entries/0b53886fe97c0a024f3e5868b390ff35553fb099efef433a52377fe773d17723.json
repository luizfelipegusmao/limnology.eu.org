{"title":"Generalized Partially Functional Linear Model with Interaction between Functional Predictors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0875/v1","date":1720612909000,"content":"In this work, we propose a generalized partially functional linear regression model with an interaction term between functional predictors. The estimators of the regression coefficient of scalar predictors and regression coefficient functions of functional predictors and their interactions are obtained. The asymptotic property of the estimators is established. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the asymptotic results. Finally, the proposed model was applied to investigate the influence of air qualities, climate factors, medical and social indicators and the interactions on cancer incidence which is a binary response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0b53886fe97c0a024f3e5868b390ff35553fb099efef433a52377fe773d17723","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
