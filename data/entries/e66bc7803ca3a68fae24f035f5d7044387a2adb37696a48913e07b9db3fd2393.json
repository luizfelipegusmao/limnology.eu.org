{"title":"Northeast Arctic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) spawning grounds and drift to nursery areas in the Barents Sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fog.12694?af=R","date":1721703077000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The Northeast Arctic stock of haddock (<i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i>) is the most northerly stock of the species. It is one of the largest haddock stocks but not the most studied. Similar to the more extensively studied sympatric cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) and herring (<i>Clupea harengus</i>) stocks, it relies on Atlantic currents for egg and larvae transportation from spawning grounds to nursery areas in the Barents Sea. The exact locations of the spawning grounds have not been known and the maps that have been published differ substantially. Here, we present results from the first survey dedicated to exploring the spawning habitat of Northeast Arctic (NEA) haddock, and a particle drift and larvae growth model with physical forcing from a high-resolution ocean model. Gadoid eggs, later identified as haddock by DNA analyses, as well as spawning individuals were sampled at the survey. Spawning haddock was found in Atlantic water in temperatures 3.6–6.2°C and depths of 240–560 m. Sampled eggs were mostly in early development stages, suggesting that they were largely spawned in the surveyed area. Using the drift model, we found that most of the modelled particles released as eggs at our surveyed area ended up in the nursery area in the Barents Sea. A crude estimate of the spawning stock biomass based on the survey suggests that the most updated spawning ground map of NEA haddock might be too restricted in its extent. Particle drift and growth with physical forcing for the years 2012–2022 indicated small interannual variation in aberrant drift, and that growth driven by ambient temperature could be important in explaining interannual variation in haddock recruitment.</p>","author":"Edda Johannesen, \nHåvard Guldbrandsen Frøysa, \nØystein Langangen, \nFrode Bendiksen Vikebø","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Oceanography: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ddf10675d11d4e916ea2c59904318f6a27094a133dc6841be0937d77cc7558c9","entryHash":"e66bc7803ca3a68fae24f035f5d7044387a2adb37696a48913e07b9db3fd2393","category":"Environment"}
