{"title":"Inspection of Architectural Heritage and Ancient Structures Using Aerial Thermography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2500/v1","date":1722419060000,"content":"In previous investigations, drones have been used for visual inspections of heritage elements. We now propose the use of aerial thermography to complement the information obtained with standard drones, which perform purely visual inspections. Thus, after a brief overview of the contribution of aerial thermography to heritage, we will use a drone with a thermographic camera to inspect three unique and important heritage elements: the Roman Bridge of Alcántara, the Roman Aqueduct of Segovia and the Roman Bridge of Alconétar. The three monuments were previously visually inspected with a drone with a camera. These operations will enable us to draw conclusions about the applicability of this technology to heritage: the inspections will demonstrate the usefulness of thermography for the diagnosis of damage to stone at a deeper level, which is already in an advanced stage of development in the interior of the element when it appears on the surface. Detecting such damage early can be the key when trying to adopt less aggressive and expensive early treatment, thus avoiding further risk to the constituent elements of the monument.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4222b3063953c3815d2a7bbd99f64180ad2bf7e272c9c0bad7570aaed7ae1d75","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
