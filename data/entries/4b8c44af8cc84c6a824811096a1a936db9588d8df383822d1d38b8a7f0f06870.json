{"title":"Tunable Radiation Patterns on the Temperature-Denpendent Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1590/v1","date":1719209027000,"content":"The utilization of optical antennas for active control of far-field radiation at the subwavelength scale is crucial in various scientific and technological applications. We propose a thermally tunable disk design of indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminum gallium nitride (Al0.18Ga0.82As), enabling a switch between absorption and scattering. Furthermore, the control of far-field radiation pattern can be easily realized by combining ITO and Al0.18Ga0.82As to enhance or suppress emission. Our results demonstrate that hybrid structure can be dynamically tuned with temperature variations. In the proposed design, a frequency is achieved at the epsilon-near-zero wavelength of 1240 nm. The thermal tunability of hybrid structure introduces new multifunctional possibilities for light manipulation, thereby enhancing the potential applications of new devices in the near-infrared range.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b8c44af8cc84c6a824811096a1a936db9588d8df383822d1d38b8a7f0f06870","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
