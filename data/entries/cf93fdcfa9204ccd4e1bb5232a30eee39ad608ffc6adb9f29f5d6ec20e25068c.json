{"title":"Simultaneously predicting SPAD and water content in rice leaves using hyperspectral imaging with deep multi‐task regression and transfer component analysis","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13853?af=R","date":1725282232000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Water content and chlorophyll content are important indicators for monitoring rice growth status. Simultaneous detection of water content and chlorophyll content is of significance. Different varieties of rice show differences in phenotype, resulting in the difficulties of establishing a universal model. In this study, hyperspectral imaging was used to detect the Soil and Plant Analyzer Development (SPAD) values and water content of fresh rice leaves of three rice varieties (Jiahua 1, Xiushui 121 and Xiushui 134).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Both partial least squares regression and convolutional neural networks were used to establish single-task and multi-task models. Transfer component analysis (TCA) was used as transfer learning to learn the common features to achieve an approximate identical distribution between any two varieties. Single-task and multi-task models were also built using the features of the source domain, and these models were applied to the target domain. These results indicated that for models of each rice variety the prediction accuracy of most multi-task models was close to that of single-task models. As for TCA, the results showed that the single-task model achieved good performance for all transfer learning tasks.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Compared with the original model, good and differentiated results were obtained for the models using features learned by TCA for both the source domain and target domain. The multi-task models could be constructed to predict SPAD values and water content simultaneously and then transferred to another rice variety, which could improve the efficiency of model construction and realize rapid detection of rice growth indicators. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yuanning Zhai, \nJun Wang, \nLei Zhou, \nXincheng Zhang, \nYun Ren, \nHengnian Qi, \nChu Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"cf93fdcfa9204ccd4e1bb5232a30eee39ad608ffc6adb9f29f5d6ec20e25068c","category":"Environment"}
