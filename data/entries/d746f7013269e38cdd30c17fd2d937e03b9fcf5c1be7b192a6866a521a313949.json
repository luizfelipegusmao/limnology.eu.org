{"title":"Evaluation of Antiviral Properties of Various Materials Using Influenza Virus and Feline Calicivirus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0564/v1","date":1710144184000,"content":"An influenza A virus (H3N2) with an envelope with the same structure as COVID-19 was used for antiviral testing of material surfaces, in comparison with some results of feline calicivirus. The evaluation method used was the film adhesion method, in which the virus solution is placed on the material and adhered to it using a film. The evaluation method was based on the film adhesion method, in which the virus solution is placed on the material and adhered with a film, and the plaque method, in which the cell virus is allowed to infect the material and form plaques, but the appropriate virus concentration must be adjusted to observe the plaques. When not under that restriction, the plaques are often incomplete; this is observed. For this reason, this study applied an area measurement method that can reflect viral activity even when plaques are not obtained. This study revealed that different types of metallic materials have different antiviral properties. Specifically, the antiviral activity of iron, carbon steel, and nickel was relatively high, while that of stainless steel and titanium was relatively low. The order of antiviral activity was as follows: Fe, SS400, Ni, SUS316L, SUS304, and Ti.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d746f7013269e38cdd30c17fd2d937e03b9fcf5c1be7b192a6866a521a313949","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
