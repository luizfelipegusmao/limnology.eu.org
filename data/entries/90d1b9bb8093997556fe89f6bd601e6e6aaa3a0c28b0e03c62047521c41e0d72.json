{"title":"From Beach Nuisance to an Organic agricultural Input: The Sargassum Story","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0806/v1","date":1728566207000,"content":"Several environmental and economic issues have been brought about by mass accumulations of Sargassum along the coastlines in Trinidad and Tobago, and the wider Caribbean region. Though there are massive environmental issues associated with this seaweed biomass, there is also a chance to make innovations, thereby making this problem into a solution. The holopelagic species such as S. natans and S. fulitans have considerably high amounts of beneficial compounds which can be leveraged for agriculture. The value chain transformation of Sargassum from a nuisance to a resource for agricultural production is narrated in the following report. Details of the application of products from Sargassum including composts, soil amendments, and liquid biostimulants are given. A case study is presented for OJA1 biostimulant, which was developed from Sargassum biomass at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad. This biostimulant has shown increased productivity and resistance to diseases of several cash crops. The valorization of Sargassum contributes to sustainable agriculture and propels economic development in coastal communities. The Caribbean could lead with the adoption of the circular economy, turning environmental adversity into a lever for sustainable development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90d1b9bb8093997556fe89f6bd601e6e6aaa3a0c28b0e03c62047521c41e0d72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
