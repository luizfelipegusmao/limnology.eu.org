To align the terminology use, the Micronutrient Data Innovation Alliance (DInA) of the Micronutrient Forum (MNF) created a lexicon of terms related to LSFF and other micronutrient programs. The purpose of this lexicon is to establish a central repository of consensus definitions of key terms to facilitate communication among diverse stakeholders involved in micronutrient programs including public and private sectors, donor agencies, food industries, academic institutions, etc. This paper describes the methodology of lexicon development. Important terms related to micronutrient programs were compiled from multiple sources, including United Nations agencies, program implementation and technical support agencies, relevant websites, and scientific literature. The selection of terms was guided by key micronutrient interventions (fortification, supplementation, dietary diversification) and the program cycle (assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation). Definitions of terms were identified from these references and checked for consistency across different sources. For terms with multiple definitions, a modified Delphi method was applied to harmonize the definitions. The first draft lexicon (n = 113 terms) was reviewed by six experts from the University of California, Davis (UCD) and MNF, and second draft (n = 115 terms) was shared with 24 global micronutrient experts for feedback. Fifty-four terms were found to have multiple definitions. Of which, minor modification was made for 12-terms with nominal difference and remaining 42-terms were shared with over 140 micronutrient-experts disseminated via an online survey through newsletters and emails to solicit experts’ opinions on the most appropriate definition or a modified one. Nineteen legal terms and 83 micronutrient terms (n = 102 terms) were subsequently added. Overall, 39 experts from diverse areas of expertise (LSFF, micronutrient program planning and implementation, surveys and research, policy development, food industry regulations, food safety, and public health nutrition) participated in the online survey. The terms with &gt;75% agreement among experts were considered as final, while the remaining were reviewed again by experts from UCD and MNF until consensus was reached on harmonized definitions. The current lexicon is available online at the DInA-website. and contains 217 terms and will be maintained as a “living document”. The lexicon will facilitate the ability of key stakeholders of micronutrient programs to evaluate and compare program performance in order to make informed decisions on how to ensure future progress in reducing micronutrient deficiencies.","author":"Lwin Mar Hlaing","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2758bc6d75f7339b34f0da634fec65c1573eacb3d1e13dda860be504f71e1049","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
