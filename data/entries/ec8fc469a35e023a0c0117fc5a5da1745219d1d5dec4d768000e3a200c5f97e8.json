{"title":"Yaks Are Dependent on Gut Microbiota for Survival in the Environment of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0915/v1","date":1715662228000,"content":"The yak (Poephagus grunniens) has evolved unique adaptations to survive the harsh environment of the Tibetan Plateau, while their gut microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the animal. Gut microbes spread through the animal population not only by horizontal transmission but also vertically, which enhances microbial stability and inheritance between generations of the population. Homogenization of gut microbes in different animal species occurs in the same habitat enhancing interspecies coexistence. Using the yak as a model animal, this paper reviews the adaptive strategies under extreme environments and how the gut microbes of the yak circulate throughout the Tibetan Plateau system, which not only affects other plateau animals such as plateau pikas, but can also have a profound impact on the health of people. By examining the relationships between yaks and their gut microbes, this review provides new perspectives in understanding the adaptations of plateau animals and the stability of the ecosystem.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec8fc469a35e023a0c0117fc5a5da1745219d1d5dec4d768000e3a200c5f97e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
