{"title":"Processes. A View from Inside","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0359/v1","date":1717751613000,"content":"A processual texture lies at the core of phenomena that undergo change. Philosophers have observed the incessant becoming of our world from antiquity to the present day, but an explanation must still be found in terms of contemporary metaphysics. This article strives to bring the focus on the domain of possibles, an under-theorised philosophical issue that dwells in the ontological realm between the possibility and its actual realization. Sketching a more comprehensive concept of the possible unravelling the thread of its main meanings, the process of change will be not simply clarified from inside, but also understood as an activator of reality. Finally, the discussion will argue for a principle of prudence and responsibility derived from an ontological basis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ae0015c1dc46905d2b99f7b03f14cd5229d3f83fc6a424c157f43eef90adbfa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
