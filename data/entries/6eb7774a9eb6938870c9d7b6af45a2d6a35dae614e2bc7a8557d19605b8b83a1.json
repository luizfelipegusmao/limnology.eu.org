However, despite recent breakthroughs in imaging non-equilibrium condensed ice structures [<a href=\"#ozae044.865-B1\">1-4</a>], the ice-water interface has never been imaged at a molecular resolution. This is primarily due to the low stability of the hydrogen bonds in ice under high-resolution microscopy conditions and a lack of methods to prepare compatible samples.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6eb7774a9eb6938870c9d7b6af45a2d6a35dae614e2bc7a8557d19605b8b83a1","category":"Environment"}
