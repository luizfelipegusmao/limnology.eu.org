This is typically attributed to preferential tie formation (i.e. homophily) among those with shared partisanship. Here, we demonstrate an additional factor beyond homophily driving assorted networks: preferential <span>prevention</span> of social ties. In two field experiments on Twitter, we created human-looking bot accounts that identified as Democrats or Republicans, and then randomly assigned users to be followed by one of these accounts. In addition to preferentially following-back copartisans, we found that users were 12 times more likely to block counter-partisan accounts compared to copartisan accounts in the first experiment, and 4 times more likely to block counter-partisan accounts relative to a neutral account or a copartisan account in the second experiment. We then replicated these findings in a survey experiment and found evidence of a key motivation for blocking: wanting to avoid seeing any content posted by the blocked user. Additionally, we found that Democrats preferentially blocked counter-partisans more than Republicans, and that this asymmetry was likely due to blocking accounts who post low-quality or politically slanted content (rather than an asymmetry in identity-based blocking). Our results demonstrate that preferential blocking of counter-partisans is an important phenomenon driving political assortment on social media.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"fcb963d6a54d3f3333c6572cac7e328a43ec30ed12a7e0dd98bf79fc2db47aaf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
