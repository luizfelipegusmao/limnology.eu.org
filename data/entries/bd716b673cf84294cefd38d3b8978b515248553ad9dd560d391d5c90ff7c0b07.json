In essence, the UTEM is a pump-probe setup that uses femtosecond laser pulses as the pump and femtosecond electron pulses as the probe, granting us accesses to microscopic phenomena at its natural time-scale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bd716b673cf84294cefd38d3b8978b515248553ad9dd560d391d5c90ff7c0b07","category":"Environment"}
