{"title":"Coming in from the cold: Addressing the challenges experienced by women conducting remote polar fieldwork","link":"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000393","date":1717596000000,"content":"<p>by Maria Dance, Rebecca Julianne Duncan, Marjolein Gevers, Eleanor Maedhbh Honan, Elaine Runge, Florina Roana Schalamon, Daniela Marianne Regina Walch</p>\r\n\r\nRemote fieldwork is an important component of polar research across both physical and social sciences. There is increasing recognition that the inherent logistical, physical, psychological, and interpersonal challenges of remote polar fieldwork are not felt equally across the polar research community, with minority groups often disproportionately affected. Although historically lacking diversity, the demographics of polar researchers have shifted, and the way polar research is conducted has been changing in response. However, there are still barriers to equal participation. Removing these barriers would attract scientists from more diverse backgrounds and improve scientific outcomes. We explored the lived experiences of those who identify as women in polar fieldwork through a review of current literature and an anonymous survey, using existing networks to connect with women working in polar research. We synthesised survey responses with regards to topics such as harassment, hygiene, inefficient communication, gendered work expectations and responsibilities to form a holistic understanding of the key fieldwork challenges faced by women. The majority of survey respondents (79%, n = 320) had encountered negative experiences during fieldwork, with the most common and impactful issues relating to field team dynamics and communication, sexism, rest, and weather. Many other issues including fieldwork preparation, work expectations, harassment, and personal space and privacy were also raised by respondents. We identify critical points of action from the survey results and in literature and propose strategies to remove barriers to participation and improve the experiences of women in polar fieldwork. These include individual- and organisational-level strategies for pre, during, and post fieldwork. A diverse polar research community is imperative in order to address the challenges presented by current unprecedented climate change. Though this study focussed on womenâ€™s experiences, we seek to advance the discourse on challenges faced by all minorities in polar research.","author":"Maria Dance","siteTitle":"PLOS Climate","siteHash":"ab511bb583c9cc103fc6bd74737f07eb1311e1e62c758b30431d090c3da71072","entryHash":"3d48f339a5e4f7523a1f11289b08d95834dee2218648e9fac99c1155cf9fd4a5","category":"Environment"}
