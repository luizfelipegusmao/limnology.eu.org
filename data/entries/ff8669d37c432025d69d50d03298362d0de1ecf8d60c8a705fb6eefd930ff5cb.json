{"title":"Advancements In Understanding and Diagnosing Canine Ehrlichiosis: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0490/v1","date":1712563755000,"content":"Abstract: Canine ehrlichiosis is a zoonotic disease transmitted by ticks, posing a formidable challenge to both veterinary and public health sectors worldwide. Across continents and regions, the prevalence rates of Ehrlichia canis exhibit significant variation, underlining the necessity for a nuanced and globally informed approach to understanding and combating this disease. The review navigates through this complexity, shedding light on the intricate pathogenesis of the illness. Central to this understanding is the bacterium's adept manipulation of the host's immune response, contributing to the diverse clinical manifestations observed in infected animals. Diagnostic methodologies, crucial for timely intervention and management, are subjected to critical assessment. From traditional microscopy to modern molecular techniques and serology, each approach is scrutinized for its strengths and limitations. By acknowledging these nuances, the review aims to equip practitioners with the knowledge necessary to make informed diagnostic decisions. A central tenet of this review is the advocacy for an integrated \"One Health\" approach. By leveraging advancements in genomics, proteomics, and artificial intelligence, there is a potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and develop innovative therapeutic and preventive strategies globally. This collaborative approach recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, offering a holistic framework for tackling complex zoonotic diseases like canine ehrlichiosis. In conclusion, this review serves as a beacon of knowledge, illuminating the multifaceted landscape of canine ehrlichiosis. Through its synthesis of scientific literature and emphasis on methodological rigor, it provides a foundation upon which future research and interventions can be built. With a unified commitment to \"One Health\" principles and the integration of cutting-edge technologies, there exists the potential to mitigate the impact of this disease and safeguard both animal and human well-being worldwide","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff8669d37c432025d69d50d03298362d0de1ecf8d60c8a705fb6eefd930ff5cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
