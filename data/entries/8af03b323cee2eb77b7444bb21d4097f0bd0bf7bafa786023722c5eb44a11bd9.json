{"title":"Application of bundled process control in the prevention of pressure injury in patients with head and neck cancer","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305190","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Mianmian Chen, Fenfen Wang, Xueying Xie, Xiaohong Yang, Yaling Luo, Chaoman Zhuang, Baoyuan Xie</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to explore the application effects of cluster process control and routine nursing on the prevention of pressure injury (PI) in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery and to provide a basis for reducing the occurrence of PI, thereby promoting the safety of the patients. This was a retrospective study. Patients with head and neck cancers who underwent surgical treatment in the Department of Otolaryngology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University from July 2022 to June 2023 were selected as the research participants. Participants were classified into experimental and control groups using a convenience sampling method. In the experimental group, cluster process control was implemented, while routine nursing management was applied in the control group. The incidence of PI (<i>p</i> = 0.028) and healing time (<i>p</i> = 0.035) in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group. The process management ability of nurses in the experimental group was significantly improved, with the results for the Braden scale (<i>p</i> = 0.023), effective decompression (<i>p</i> = 0.002), floating heel (<i>p</i> = 0.002), nutrition monitoring (<i>p</i> = 0.005), and patient satisfaction in the experimental group being higher than those in the control group (<i>p</i> = 0.007). This study effectively demonstrated the effect of cluster process control in reducing the incidence of PI in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery, thereby determining that cluster process control is suitable for clinical application.","author":"Mianmian Chen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"8af03b323cee2eb77b7444bb21d4097f0bd0bf7bafa786023722c5eb44a11bd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
