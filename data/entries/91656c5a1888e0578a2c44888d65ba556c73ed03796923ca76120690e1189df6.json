{"title":"Renewable Electricity and Green Hydrogen Integration for Decarbonization of “Hard-to-Abate” Industrial Sectors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1709/v1","date":1716795750000,"content":"The energy transition is a challenge that affects all sectors, from transport to civil structures and industry. In the industrial sector, the greatest need is the decarbonisation of energy-intensive in-dustries, such as producers of iron and steel, aluminum, cement, petrochemicals, paper, and more. The steel industry, in particular, is a hard-to-abate high-emissivity industry that, due to chemical processes and high thermal demands (often above 500 °C), contributed to 7.4% of global CO2 emissions in 2021. This paper explores the potential applications of hydrogen in these hard-to-abate sectors, highlighting its versatility and significance in decarbonization efforts, especially as a me-dium to facilitate the transition to green electric energy uses. It provides an overview of hydrogen production methods, emphasizing the importance of sustainable and green hydrogen production. It reviews hydrogen production methods, storage, and potential in blended combustion. In the final part of the article, some considerations are introduced on the possible role of hydrogen in the steel sector (both as a supplementary fuel and as a reducing agent in innovative processes), showing that while there is potential for its inclusion as an element for decarbonization, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the energy balances of the various processes and the methods of hydrogen production, in order to avoid achieving only marginal effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91656c5a1888e0578a2c44888d65ba556c73ed03796923ca76120690e1189df6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
