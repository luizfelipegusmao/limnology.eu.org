{"title":"PSLBI-14 Assessment of the effective tissue concentrations of injectable lidocaine and a lidocaine-impregnated latex band for castration in calves and lambs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/637/7757652?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Tail docking in lambs and castration in lambs and calves are common husbandry practices, both of which cause pain and discomfort, for which many industries recommend or require pain management. The purpose of this study was to assess the effective tissue concentrations of the current standard of care for pain mitigation in calves and lambs during castration or tail docking (injectable lidocaine) and to assess the ability of a lidocaine-loaded elastration band (LLB) to deliver effective concentrations into the scrotal or tail tissues over time. This work comprised four different field trials (n = 50/trial): 1) effective concentrations of injectable lidocaine in the scrotal tissue of dairy calves; 2) the in vivo delivery of effective concentrations of lidocaine from LLBs placed on the calf scrotums; 3) effective concentrations of injectable lidocaine in the scrotal and tail tissue of lambs; and 4) the in vivo delivery of effective concentrations of lidocaine from LLBs placed on the lamb scrotums and tails. Sensation in the tissue of interest was assessed by electrocutaneous stimulation. Sensation was correlated to tissue concentrations of lidocaine by analyzing sampled tissue for lidocaine content by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Injectable lidocaine allowed for short-term anesthesia for up to 60 min calves, highlighting the importance of finding additional strategies to mitigate long-term pain. An effective concentration (EC) yielding 50% reduction in tissue sensation (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.635 (95% CI 0.462 to 0.829) mg/g was calculated for calf scrotal tissue. Based on HPLC data of processed biopsy samples taken over time, the LLBs yielded tissue concentartions of lidocaine that approached EC<sub>50</sub> and exceeded EC<sub>95</sub> at 2 and 72 h following application, respectively, and remained above those concentartions for at least 28 d after application. In lambs, injectable lidocaine allowed for short-term anesthesia for up to 180 min following injection. An EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.174 (95% CI 0.125 to 0.248) mg/g was calculated for lamb scrotal tissue and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.0765 (95% CI 0.0533 to 0.113) mg/g was calculated for lamb tail tissue. The use of the LLB provided tissue lidocaine concentrations that met or exceeded the EC<sub>50</sub> for at least 21 to 28 d and, based on electrostimulation data, provided local anesthesia for at least 3 d when compared with a control band. The use of an LLB could provide a practical, long-duration alternative to injectable lidocaine for pain mitigation during castration and tail docking. Further studies are warranted to compare the use of LLBs to injectable local anesthetics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1d6ccb8a289e013d3581336f937a05db8cbe90a42cedd2a2eccddff7f383b2b1","category":"Environment"}
