Then, among\nother things,  we give a new proof that for a compact Hausdorff\nspace $X$ the space ${\\sf I}(X)$ is also a compact Hausdorff space.\nFor a Tychonoff space $X$, we consider the topological space ${\\sf\nI_{\\tau}}(X)$ of $\\tau$-smooth idempotent probability measures on\n$X$,and show that the space ${\\sf I_{\\tau}}(X)$ is \\v{C}ech-complete\nif and only if the given space $X$ is \\v{C}ech-complete.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c7802e55d13235a2dcb43318703910e4b286d09a55fdb4100b11924eada14bac","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
