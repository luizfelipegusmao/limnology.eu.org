{"title":"Leveraging Local Geomaterial Properties for Global Pavement Solutions: A Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1298/v1","date":1721127630000,"content":"This study investigates the permeability and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of base course materials for flexible pavements, focusing on materials from local quarries in Quer√©taro and Puebla, Mexico. Recognizing the fundamental role of the base layer in load distribution and hydraulic conductivity, the research evaluates these properties at different grain sizes and moisture contents. The objective is to define an optimal range that maximizes both drainage and mechanical resistance, crucial to extending the useful life of the pavement. Four different quarries were selected for material sampling and extensive testing was performed to determine permeability and CBR values under different conditions. The findings reveal the need for broader experimentation and methodological improvements, particularly in the measurement of hydraulic conductivity, a parameter not yet regulated for these materials in Mexico. The results demonstrated permeability values ranging between 1.2810^-3 and 1.9010^-3 cm/s, highlighting the significant impact of the percentage of fine material and its plasticity on the hydraulic and mechanical performance. Despite achieving permeability rates lower than the optimal value suggested in American manuals (0.35 cm/s), even with a fine material content of less than 5%, the study highlights the potential of local materials to meet the international standards with proper processing and testing. This research contributes to the global body of knowledge in pavement engineering by linking local geomaterial properties to broader applicable engineering practices. It suggests that even locally sourced materials, when appropriately evaluated and used, can significantly influence overall pavement solutions, promoting sustainability and cost-effectiveness in pavement construction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67e3eed85e2f7bb13216695ae485b680840a42c794a7b6b78549c5a9ef8cea37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
