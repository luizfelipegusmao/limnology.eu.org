{"title":"A hybrid TCN-GRU model for classifying human activities using smartphone inertial signals","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304655","date":1723557600000,"content":"<p>by Sarmela Raja Sekaran, Ying Han Pang, Lim Zheng You, Ooi Shih Yin</p>\r\n\r\nRecognising human activities using smart devices has led to countless inventions in various domains like healthcare, security, sports, etc. Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR), especially smartphone-based HAR, has become popular among the research community due to lightweight computation and user privacy protection. Deep learning models are the most preferred solutions in developing smartphone-based HAR as they can automatically capture salient and distinctive features from input signals and classify them into respective activity classes. However, in most cases, the architecture of these models needs to be deep and complex for better classification performance. Furthermore, training these models requires extensive computational resources. Hence, this research proposes a hybrid lightweight model that integrates an enhanced Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers for salient spatiotemporal feature extraction without tedious manual feature extraction. Essentially, dilations are incorporated into each convolutional kernel in the TCN-GRU model to extend the kernelâ€™s field of view without imposing additional model parameters. Moreover, fewer short filters are applied for each convolutional layer to alleviate excess parameters. Despite reducing computational cost, the proposed model utilises dilations, residual connections, and GRU layers for longer-term time dependency modelling by retaining longer implicit features of the input inertial sequences throughout training to provide sufficient information for future prediction. The performance of the TCN-GRU model is verified on two benchmark smartphone-based HAR databases, i.e., UCI HAR and UniMiB SHAR. The model attains promising accuracy in recognising human activities with 97.25% on UCI HAR and 93.51% on UniMiB SHAR. Since the current study exclusively works on the inertial signals captured by smartphones, future studies will explore the generalisation of the proposed TCN-GRU across diverse datasets, including various sensor types, to ensure its adaptability across different applications.","author":"Sarmela Raja Sekaran","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4aa4541bf9f63e16a068cbe4897b489b5dce029925c609bb31cae04a34b1bb80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
