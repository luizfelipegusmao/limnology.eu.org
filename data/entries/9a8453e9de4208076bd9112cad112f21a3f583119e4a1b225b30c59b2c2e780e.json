{"title":"Optimization of Real-Time Spatial Mapping in Architectural Visualization: A Comparison Among Mixed Reality Devices","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1455/v1","date":1718940826000,"content":"Recent advancements in communication technology have catalyzed the widespread adoption of realistic content, with augmented reality (AR) emerging as a pivotal tool for seamlessly inte-grating virtual elements into real-world environments. In construction, architecture, and urban design, the integration of mixed reality (MR) technology enables rapid interior spatial mapping, providing clients with immersive experiences to envision their desires. The rapid advancement of MR devices, or devices that integrate MR capabilities, offers users numerous opportunities for enhanced entertainment experiences. However, to support designers at a high level of expertise, it is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data provided by these devices. This study explores the potential of utilizing spatial mapping within various methodologies for surveying architectural interiors. The objective is to identify optimized spatial mapping procedures and determine the most effective applications for their use. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the interior survey performance, using HoloLens 2, iPhone 13 Pro for spatial mapping, and photogrammetry. The findings indicate that HoloLens 2 is most well-suited for the tasks exam-ined in the scope of experiments. Nonetheless, based on the acquired parameters, the author also proposes approaches to apply the other technologies in specific real-world scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a8453e9de4208076bd9112cad112f21a3f583119e4a1b225b30c59b2c2e780e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
