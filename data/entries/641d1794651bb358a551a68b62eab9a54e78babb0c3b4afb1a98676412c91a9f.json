{"title":"Use and Overuse Leading the Conservation Issues of the Endangered Flagship Species Artemisia granatensis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0371/v1","date":1728287175000,"content":"Here I examine the overexploitation of Artemisia granatensis, a narrow endemic medicinal plant species from Sierra Nevada, Spain, and the consequences for its conservation. With over 50,000 flowering plant species used for medicinal purposes worldwide, many species face sustainability issues due to overharvesting and habitat loss. Historical documentation of A. granatensis use dates back to the 13th century, highlighting its significance in traditional medicine. However, this species has suffered extensive overexploitation, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, leading to a significant decline in populations. Conservation concerns were first raised in 1909, and despite the species being legally protected since 1982, illegal collection and environmental pressures persist. Today,  A. granatensis is critically endangered, with fewer than 2,000 individuals remaining in fragmented populations. The study synthesizes historical and recent literature to understand the long-standing pressures on this species and the limited conservation efforts made. Cultivation of A. granatensis is proposed as a crucial strategy to reduce pressure on wild populations and ensure the survival of this flagship important plant species.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"641d1794651bb358a551a68b62eab9a54e78babb0c3b4afb1a98676412c91a9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
