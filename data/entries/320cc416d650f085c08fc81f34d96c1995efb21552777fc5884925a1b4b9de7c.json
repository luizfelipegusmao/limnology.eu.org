{"title":"HUGENICS","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0703/v1","date":1715343471000,"content":"Living systems are intricate repositories of biomolecules, where the interactions between these molecules play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. Interruptions in these interactions can lead to diseases, underscoring the significance of biomolecular interactions and their molecular basis. HUGENICS (Human Genetic Database) is a comprehensive biological database that focuses on molecular interactions between human and microbial proteins, particularly emphasizing protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This database offers insights into disease pathways by elucidating the interplay between microbial surface/secretory proteins and human disease-related proteins. This white paper highlights the significance, scope, and potential applications of HUGENICS in advancing biomedical research and improving human health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"320cc416d650f085c08fc81f34d96c1995efb21552777fc5884925a1b4b9de7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
