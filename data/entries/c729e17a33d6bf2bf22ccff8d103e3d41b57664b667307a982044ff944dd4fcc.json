{"title":"Molecular basis of the persistence of chloramphenicol resistance among <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> spp. from pigs, pork and humans in Thailand","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304250","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Jiratchaya Puangseree, Rangsiya Prathan, Songsak Srisanga, Rungtip Chuanchuen</p>\r\n\r\nThis study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms associated with the persistence of chloramphenicol (CHP) resistance in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> isolated from pigs, pork, and humans in Thailand. The CHP-resistant <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> (n = 106) and <i>Salmonella</i> (n = 57) isolates were tested for their CHP susceptibility in the presence and absence of phenylalanine arginine β-naphthylamide (PAβN). The potential co-selection of CHP resistance was investigated through conjugation experiments. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to analyze the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> (E329, E333, and E290) and <i>Salmonella</i> (SA448, SA461, and SA515) isolates with high CHP MIC (32–256 μg/mL) and predominant plasmid replicon types. The presence of PAβN significantly reduced the CHP MICs (≥4-fold) in most <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> (67.9%) and <i>Salmonella</i> (64.9%). Ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin co-selected for CHP-resistant <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>-transconjugants carrying <i>cmlA</i>. IncF plasmids were mostly detected in <i>cmlA</i> carrying <i>Salmonella</i> (IncFIIAs) and <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> (IncFIB and IncF) transconjugants. The WGS analysis revealed that class1 integrons with <i>cmlA1</i> gene cassette flanked by IS<i>26</i> and Tn<i>As1</i> were located on IncX1 plasmid, IncFIA(HI1)/HI1B plasmids and IncFII/FIB plasmids. IncFIA(HI1)/HI1B/Q1in SA448 contained <i>catA</i> flanked by IS<i>1B</i> and Tn<i>As3</i>. In conclusion, cross resistance through proton motive force-dependent mechanisms and co-selection by other antimicrobial agents involved the persistence of CHP-resistance in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> in this collection. Dissemination of CHP-resistance genes was potentially facilitated by mobilization via mobile genetic elements.","author":"Jiratchaya Puangseree","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c729e17a33d6bf2bf22ccff8d103e3d41b57664b667307a982044ff944dd4fcc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
