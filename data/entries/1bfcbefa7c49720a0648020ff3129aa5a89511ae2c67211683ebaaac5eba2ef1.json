We argue that the technological transformation has created an entirely new ecosystem that is often mismatched with our evolved adaptations for social living. We discuss how evolved responses to moral transgressions, such as compassion for victims of transgressions and punishment of transgressors, are disrupted by two main features of the online context. First, the <span>scale</span> of the internet exposes us to an unnaturally large quantity of extreme moral content, causing compassion fatigue and increasing public shaming.
