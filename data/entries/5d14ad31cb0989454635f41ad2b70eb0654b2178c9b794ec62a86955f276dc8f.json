Considering the global endemic consequences of the disease, there is a need to develop a successful vaccine candidate against LF. Using advanced immunoinformatics approaches, we designed two multiepitope vaccines targeting <i>W</i>. <i>bancrofti</i>’s glutathione S-transferase and thioredoxin. Therefore, we predicted several MHC-1, MHC-2, and B-cell epitopes from these proteins and mapped two vaccine candidates (V1 and V2). The vaccines were subsequently employed for physicochemical analysis, structural prediction and validation, docking and normal mode analysis, codon optimization, and immune simulation. The selected MHC-1, MHC-2, and B-cell epitopes were antigenic without allergenicity or toxicity. The designed vaccines were expected to be soluble, stable proteins under physiological conditions. Compared to V2, V1’s secondary and tertiary structures were simultaneously favorable, with Ramachandran plot analysis revealing 95.6% residues in favored areas. Subsequently, the molecular docking analysis indicated that the V1 had a high binding affinity for the TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-5, as suggested by the docking scores of -1248.7, -1038.5 and -1562.8, respectively. The NMA of these complexes further indicated their structural flexibility. Molecular dynamics simulations of V1-TLR complexes revealed V1-TLR-4 as the most stable, with the lowest free energy and minimal fluctuations, indicating the strongest binding affinity. The results of the codon optimization showed high levels of expression, with a favorable CAI score (&lt;1.0). A three-dose vaccination analysis showed significant and persistent immunological responses, including adaptive and innate immune responses. The findings emphasize the potential of the V1 against <i>W</i>. <i>bancrofti</i>, but further validation is required through <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and clinical trials.","author":"Rehana Parvin","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5d14ad31cb0989454635f41ad2b70eb0654b2178c9b794ec62a86955f276dc8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
