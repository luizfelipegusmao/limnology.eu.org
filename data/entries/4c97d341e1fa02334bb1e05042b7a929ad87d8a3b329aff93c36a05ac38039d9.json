{"title":"PSV-20 Supplementation of an electrolyte solution improves water intake in receiving beef cattle under commercial feedlot conditions","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/563/7757695?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>During transport to and receiving at feedlots, cattle are exposed to a variety of stressors, including changes in social structure due to separation and mixing of groups, handling, and a lack of access to feed and water for extended periods of time. These stressors often result in loss of body mass and dehydration, which if not adequately addressed upon feedlot arrival, may result in increased morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate changes in body weight (BW) and water intake in cattle supplemented with an electrolyte solution upon feedlot arrival. Shipments of animals were weighed upon arrival at a commercial feedlot operation and moved to a set of holding pens where animals remained for a 3-d receiving period prior to entry into the feedlot. Sets of holding pens (n = 5 sets of 4 pens per treatment) were blocked by arrival date and randomly assigned to receive either a negative control (water) or an electrolyte solution during the receiving period. Daily free-choice fluid intake was monitored per pen, and animals were weighed at the end of the receiving period. Average fluid intake per animal was increased by 46.9 % (10.3 L/d; <span>P</span> = 0.013) in response to the addition of electrolyte. No differences due to treatment were observed in average origin BW, arrival BW, or BW recovery. This suggests that while recovery of BW was not affected, supplementing receiving cattle with an electrolyte solution may be an effective method of improving hydration status prior to feedlot entry. Future work aims to evaluate potential changes in morbidity and mortality during the finishing period following a similar supplementation strategy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"4c97d341e1fa02334bb1e05042b7a929ad87d8a3b329aff93c36a05ac38039d9","category":"Environment"}
