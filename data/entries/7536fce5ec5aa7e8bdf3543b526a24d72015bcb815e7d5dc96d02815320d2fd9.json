{"title":"Integrated Photonic Sensors for The Detection of Toxic Gases - A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0864/v1","date":1718201774000,"content":"Gas sensing is crucial for detecting hazardous gases in industrial environments, ensuring safety and preventing accidents. Additionally, it plays a vital role in environmental monitoring and control, helping to mitigate pollution and protect public health. Integrated photonic gas sensors are important due to their high sensitivity, rapid response time, and compact size, enabling precise recognition of gas concentrations in real-time. These sensors leverage photonic technologies, such as waveguides and resonators, to enhance performance over traditional gas sensors. Advancements in materials and fabrication techniques could further improve their efficiency, making them invaluable for environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and healthcare diagnostics. In this review, we delved into photonic gas sensors that operate based on the principles of evanescent field absorption (EFA) and wavelength interrogation methods. These advanced sensing mechanisms allow for highly sensitive and selective gas detection, leveraging the interplay of light with gas molecules to produce precise measurements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7536fce5ec5aa7e8bdf3543b526a24d72015bcb815e7d5dc96d02815320d2fd9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
