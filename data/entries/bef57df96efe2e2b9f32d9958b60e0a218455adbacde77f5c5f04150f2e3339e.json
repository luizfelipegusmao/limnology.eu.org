{"title":"Knowledge and Practice Gaps in Healthcare Ethics: A Comparative Study of Two Ghanaian Hospitals","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0654/v1","date":1728451416000,"content":"Maintaining patient trust, providing quality care, and safeguarding patients' rights and safety, all of which require strong adherence to ethical principles. This study assessed the key differential factors influencing healthcare ethics (HCE) practice in two Ghanaian hospitals. This study employed an analytical cross-sectional design, utilizing simple random sampling to recruit 382 healthcare professionals. Bivariate analysis was conducted using Chi-square tests and T-tests, while Random Forest analysis was applied to identify variables of relative importance to HCE practice. The study found no significant differences in HCE knowledge or practices between the facilities. However, in both facilities, knowledge of HCE significantly influenced HCE practice, indicating that individuals with better knowledge of HCE were more likely to practice HCE. Further, the analysis identified age, knowledge, education, and facility type as the most relevant factors in general. In the sub-analysis, the key factors varied between facilities: for Facility A, age, knowledge, gender, and the intention to change profession were most relevant, while for Facility B, knowledge, education, gender, and age were the dominant factors. HCE training programs should be tailored to meet the unique needs of each facility to ensure effectiveness since factors influencing HCE may vary by facility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bef57df96efe2e2b9f32d9958b60e0a218455adbacde77f5c5f04150f2e3339e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
