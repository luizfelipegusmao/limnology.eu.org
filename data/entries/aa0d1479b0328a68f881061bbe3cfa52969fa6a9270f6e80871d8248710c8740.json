{"title":"Syndemics of the sea: Adverse disease interactions and the stressors of fisher livelihoods","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12803?af=R","date":1708005086000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The occupation of commercial fishing is recognized as a comparatively stressful and hazardous job characterized by a myriad of risks to health, including high rates of job-related injury, morbidity, and mortality. Nonetheless, systematic study of fisher health is limited. This paper examines a particularly understudied aspect of illness among fishers: the physical and social contexts, pathways, and potential for adverse disease interactions. The focus of the paper is on a biosocial disease process called syndemics, which increases the health burdens of this population. The paper is presented as an initial testing of the hypothesis that a “lens” of syndemics improves occupational health research and advocacy for commercial fishermen who face a substantial burden of biosocial challenges.</p>","author":"Merrill Singer","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fish and Fisheries: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3de509ad0f312c77d6dd4d37070c89263edb7695bf1d0e15e1eb17cfd4455e34","entryHash":"aa0d1479b0328a68f881061bbe3cfa52969fa6a9270f6e80871d8248710c8740","category":"Environment"}
