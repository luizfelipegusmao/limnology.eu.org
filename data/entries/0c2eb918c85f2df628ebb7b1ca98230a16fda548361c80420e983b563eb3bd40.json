{"title":"Research Hotspots and Trend Analysis of Community Public Health Based on CiteSpace and VOSviewer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0380/v1","date":1720095843000,"content":"Objective: To explore the hot spots and development trends of community public health research. \nMethods: The literature related to this topic was searched in CNKI and PubMed databases, and the trend map of the number of articles was drawn according to the obtained data. The included literature were analyzed with Vosviewer software for keyword and author co-occurrence, and CiteSpace 6.3.R1 Basic software was used for mechanism co-occurrence, key emergence and clustering analysis, and timeline distribution map drawing. \nResults: 189 Chinese literature and 77 English literature were selected. The Chinese literature focused on “community public health service, emergency management, and community governance”, and the research trend was “community public health emergency management and community governance”; English literature focuses on “nursing education, health education, human qualitative research”. \nConclusion: Although the Chinese and English literature shows that scholars in this field have different emphases, the primary community health is the key and difficult point to realize the national public health service project, and improving the basic public health service in the primary community is related to the health of all the people, so it is very important.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c2eb918c85f2df628ebb7b1ca98230a16fda548361c80420e983b563eb3bd40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
