Some of the most used methodological approaches of the last decade have been Flipped Classroom and Flipped Learning. This article explores the intersection between Flipped Learning and AI through qualitative research based on interviews with international experts in the field. The results reveal the significant impact of AI on education, highlighting how AI tools are transforming teaching and learning methodologies. Additionally, the evolution of Flipped Learning with the integration of AI is analyzed, showing how this combination enhances personalized learning and improves student engagement. Finally, the role of the teacher in this new educational paradigm is discussed, emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation and the development of new competencies to fully leverage emerging technologies. With this study, we aim to provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges that AI presents in the context of Flipped Learning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3178cd57f37ff168f31420bb8097c8a622582dc1c2e345e2acdfa0068a9deb80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
