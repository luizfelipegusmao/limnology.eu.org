{"title":"The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List does not account for intraspecific diversity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/5/815/7642017?rss=1","date":1712534400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List identifies threatened and endangered species and is a key instrument in global biodiversity conservation efforts. Our understanding of the structure and value of genetic biodiversity below the species level is rapidly increasing. Nonetheless, the IUCN assessment criteria overlook genetic variation within species. Here, we address this blind spot and discuss the principles of species conservation status classification relative to intraspecific biodiversity. We focus on coastal species, which thrive in heterogeneous environments known to drive genetic differentiation. The focal example species, Atlantic cod and sugar kelp, have contrasting life histories, are ecologically and economically important constituents of the coastal ecosystem, and are currently not classified as threatened in Norway and Canada. We expose important variation in population structure, the presence of ecotypes and genetic-environment covariation, as well as loss of ecotypes that threatens the conservation of these species. Because the genetic makeup of species directly influences their resilience, omitting this information from conservation status assessments can result in loss of adaptive capacity to future stressors, such as climate change. Consequently, recognizing and preserving intraspecific variation emerges as vital for speciesâ€™ abilities to adapt to and survive in future ocean conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"22d4806e86a395a3711a2e9cb150797fcce1a1ba54311e55b7db68838c63885f","category":"Environment"}
