{"title":"Improved super-resolution ribosome profiling reveals prevalent translation of upstream ORFs and small ORFs in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/510/7449574?rss=1","date":1700784000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A crucial step in functional genomics is identifying actively translated ORFs and linking them to biological functions. The challenge lies in identifying short ORFs, as their identification is greatly influenced by data quality and depth. Here, we improved the coverage of super-resolution Ribo-seq in <span>Arabidopsis</span> (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), revealing uncharacterized translation events for nuclear, chloroplastic, and mitochondrial genes. Assisted by a transcriptome assembly, we identified 7,751 unconventional translation events, comprising 6,996 upstream ORFs (uORFs) and 209 downstream ORFs on annotated protein-coding genes, as well as 546 ORFs in presumed noncoding RNAs. Proteomic data confirmed the production of stable proteins from some of these unannotated translation events. We present evidence of active translation from primary transcripts of <span>trans</span>-acting small interfering RNAs (<span>TAS1â€“4</span>) and microRNAs (pri-<span>MIR163</span> and pri-<span>MIR169</span>) and periodic ribosome stalling supporting cotranslational decay. Additionally, we developed a method for identifying extremely short uORFs, including 370 minimum uORFs (AUG-stop), and 2,921 tiny uORFs (2 to 10 amino acids) and 681 uORFs that overlap with each other. Remarkably, these short uORFs exhibit strong translational repression as do longer uORFs. We also systematically discovered 594 uORFs regulated by alternative splicing, suggesting widespread isoform-specific translational control. Finally, these prevalent uORFs are associated with numerous important pathways. In summary, our improved <span>Arabidopsis</span> translational landscape provides valuable resources to study gene expression regulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"e1e78e2074ac0a6726ae4a032b9fb0b13330e1484d4faa260c374b8c4b6983b5","category":"Environment"}
