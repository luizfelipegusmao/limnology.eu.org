{"title":"JMDSFCv1.0: an Interactive R/Shiny Application for Dataset Format Conversion with Real-Time Progress Monitoring.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0665/v1","date":1725875461000,"content":"In modern data analysis, working with diverse dataset formats is essential for ensuring compatibility across different software tools and platforms. However, manual conversion between formats can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we developed an interactive Shiny application that facilitates the seamless conversion of datasets between popular software formats such as CSV, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata, and RData. This user-friendly app enables users to upload datasets, select an output format, and download the converted file with a single click. The application also incorporates a real-time progress indicator, enhancing the user experience by showing conversion progress. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, the app is designed for researchers, data analysts, and practitioners who regularly handle multiple file formats in their workflows. Additionally, the app features a clean, intuitive interface with clear guidance, making it accessible even to users with minimal technical background. The development process, key features, and potential applications of this tool are discussed in this article.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"866ee869575158e2dfe6e427a19743545f631d94cddd41e3a256c49216b9f96d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
