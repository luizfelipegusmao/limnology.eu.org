{"title":"Analysis of Dynamic Behavior of Multi-layer Soil Grounds Through 1 G Shaking Table Tests and Numerical Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1598/v1","date":1713945748000,"content":"The ground consists of many layers of soil with different properties. The propagation speed and path of seismic waves are affected by different soil layers. It is necessary to understand that layered soil exhibits different dynamic behaviors and responses under the action of seismic waves. This study utilized weathered soil and silica sand as materials to create multi-layered soil conditions with varying degrees of compaction. By conducting 1 g shaking table test on multi-layered soil, the interaction and influence between different soil layers under different earthquake conditions were observed. The approach of numerical analysis aims to validate the experimental results and provide an in-depth understanding of the dynamic behaviors of multi-layered soil grounds during seismic events. The results of this study show that the amplification effect of seismic waves is related to the number of soil layers and the degree of compaction of the soil layers. This indicates that the multi-layered soil ground and the behavior of the soil layers play an important role in the propagation and impact of seismic waves, and this amplification effect is of great significance in actual seismic disaster risk assessment and design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96395a063aafbb82fa6d6cfbcbadd2b49ae3c96ad53a3a1f7ca3907e02eb45af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
