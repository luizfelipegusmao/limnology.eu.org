{"title":"Preservation of Vocal Function in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Patients Following Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy (PDT) and Adjuvant Therapies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0894/v1","date":1720693802000,"content":"To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) combined with adjuvant therapies in preserving vocal function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 47 ALS patients who underwent PDT at the Rodem Hospital from 2021 to 2023. Post-operatively, these patients were provided with a comprehensive treatment plan that included regenerative injection therapy, low-frequency electrical stimulation, respiratory rehabilitation, and swallowing rehabilitation therapy. Additionally, a balloon reduction program was implemented for effective Tracheostomy tube (T-tube) management. The preservation of vocal functions was evaluated 4 weeks following the procedure. Results: While some patients maintained or slightly improved their ALSFRS-R speech scores, the overall trend indicated a de-crease in speech scores post-PDT. This suggests that PDT combined with adjuvant therapies may not universally improve vocal function, but can help maintain it in certain cases. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that PDT combined with mesotherapy, low-frequency electrical stimulation, and swallowing rehabilitation therapy may play a role in maintaining vocal function in limb type ALS patients, though further research is needed to optimize patient management and validate these results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b1ca3ed79e7ed789527ecb481e47ef200a73a44170de7137e337882e9314a27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
