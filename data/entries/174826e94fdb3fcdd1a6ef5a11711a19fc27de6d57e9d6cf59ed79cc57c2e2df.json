{"title":"246 The effect of trypsin inhibitor unit concentrations from raw soybeans in grower pig performance and protein digestibility","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/149/7664808?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Soybeans contain two major protease inhibitors, Kunitz trypsin and Bowman-Birk protease inhibitors, both of which are anti-nutritional components that can be directly linked to a reduction in amino acid bioavailability and growth performance in swine. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the level at which trypsin inhibitor units (TIU, expressed as TIU/mg of complete feed), coming from raw soybeans, in pig diets result in reduction in growth performance and digestibility. This study used 45 grower gilts initial body weight (BW) = 39.7 Â± 2.1 kg] that were individually penned and fed one of five dietary TIU treatments (n = 9 pigs/trt) in a complete randomized design. Diets were representative of a commercial corn-soybean meal diet and formulated to have ranging TIU/mg of complete feed of 0.89, 1.77, 3.55, 6.99, and 11.54 TIU/mg utilizing raw ground soybeans and soybean meal at incremental levels. Analyzed diets contained 0.99, 2.23, 3.07, 6.49, and 9.38 active TIU/mg. Diets were balanced to the same grams of SID Lys:ME of 2.85 and NDF concentration of 7.4% utilizing soybean oil and soybean hulls, respectively. Individual feed intake was recorded throughout, and pig BW were collected on d 0, 21, and 27 to calculate average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency gain to feed ratio (G:F). All pigs were placed into metabolism crates on d 21 for 6 d to determine apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nitrogen (N), N excretion and N balance. Growth performance and ATTD data were analyzed with pig as the experimental unit and diet TIU level as a fixed effect using ANOVA, linear, and quadratic contrast models. Overall, ADG decreased as diet TIU increased (1.07, 1.03, 1.02, 0.91, and 0.83 kg/d, respectively, linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). However, no differences in ADFI (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) were reported and this resulted in a decrease in G:F (0.48, 0.45, 0.43, 0.41, 0.36, respectively, linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) as dietary TIU concentrations increased from 0.99 to 9.38 TIU/mg. Compared with 0.99 TIU/mg, pigs fed 9.38 TIU/mg had a 9.32% reduction in final BW (68.7 vs. 62.3 kg, linear <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Apparent total tract digestibility of N decreased when pigs were fed 9.38 TIU/mg compared with 0.99 and 2.23 TIU/mg (83.26% vs. 90.29% and 89.57%, respectively, <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, as total trypsin inhibitor units increase in complete feed of grower pigs, digestibility of protein, growth rates and feed efficiency are reduced in a linear manner.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"174826e94fdb3fcdd1a6ef5a11711a19fc27de6d57e9d6cf59ed79cc57c2e2df","category":"Environment"}
