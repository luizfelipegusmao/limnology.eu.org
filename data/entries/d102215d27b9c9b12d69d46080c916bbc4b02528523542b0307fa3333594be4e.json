Data was collected from the electronic medical record, and venous collaterals were independently reviewed by two neuroradiologists using the Qureshi classification. Patients with and without venous collaterals were compared. Significant factors (P&lt;0.05) in the univariate analysis were recruited into the multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine independently associated factors.</p> Results <p>Among 79 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis, the prevalence of venous collaterals at the initial neuroimaging was 25.3%. In the univariate analysis, patients with cerebral venous thrombosis and venous collaterals were significantly younger (37.0±13.9 years vs. 44.9±17.4 years, P = 0.048), more often had occlusion in the superior sagittal sinus (80.0% vs. 54.2%, P = 0.041), and were associated with hormonal exposure (35.0% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.002). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed occlusion in the superior sagittal sinus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.581; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.941–13.626; P = 0.044) and hormonal exposure (aOR 7.276, 95% CI 1.606–32.966, P = 0.010) as independent factors associated with venous collaterals in cerebral venous thrombosis.</p> Conclusions <p>In this cohort, the prevalence of venous collaterals was 25.3%. Occlusion in the superior sagittal sinus and hormonal exposure were independently associated with venous collaterals in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis.</p>","author":"Phirat Petchprom","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d102215d27b9c9b12d69d46080c916bbc4b02528523542b0307fa3333594be4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
