We previously reported that central leptin exerts an anti-hypertrophic effect in the heart via cardiac PPARβ/δ activation. Here, we assessed the impact of central leptin administra-tion and PPARβ/δ inhibition on cardiac function. Various cardiac properties, including QRS du-ration, R wave amplitude, heart rate (HR), ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic left ventricular mass (EDLVM), end-diastolic volume (EDV), and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed. Central leptin infusion increased cardiac PPARβ/δ protein content and decreased HR, QRS duration and R wave amplitude. These changes induced by central leptin suggested a decrease in the ventricu-lar wall growth which was confirmed by MRI. In fact, the EDLVM was reduced by central leptin, while increased in rats co-treated with leptin and GSK0660, a selective antagonist of PPARβ/δ ac-tivity. In summary, central leptin plays a dual role in cardiac health, potentially leading to ven-tricular atrophy and improving heart function when PPARβ/δ signaling is intact. The protective effects of leptin are lost by PPARβ/δ inhibition, underscoring the importance of this pathway. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting leptin and PPARβ/δ pathways to combat cardiac alterations and heart failure, particularly, in the context of obesity","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"115e2b7d5b1ad7f7133a1d1adaf2dd182da41f0ffe949950c0e68118e6a6eb3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
