{"title":"Lubricating Greases from Fried Vegetable Oils","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1064/v1","date":1713279988000,"content":"Biobased greases are derived from renewable resources, being considered more environmentally friendly, and offering comparable performance with petroleum-based greases. In this study, lubricating greases from frying cooking oils were prepared, thus valorizing waste, in order to obtain sustainable and environmentally friendly products. 12 batches (500 g each) were produced from sunflower and palm frying oils, with 20% by weight calcium/ lithium stearate soaps prepared in situ, and additivated with 15% wt. cellulose or lignin sulphate. The greases were rheologically characterized. Their consistency was assessed by the penetration test, performed before and after working the greases. Dropping point determinations offered information about the stability at higher temperatures, and oil bleeding tests were performed. The average values of the friction coefficient (COF), the contact resistance and the wear scar diameter were measured, through mechanical tests. Additivated greases prove to be comparable with those obtained from mineral oils, with good rheological properties, soft consistency and good antiwearing behavior, e.g.in open or total- loss lubricating systems, like in open gears and certain food processing machinery; they are thermally stable, and  prone for use in low-loading working mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5c432c6eb3e2f936d3e1c8e780597c34ef1232be38f9c7c00b9cd1c7b8d0471","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
