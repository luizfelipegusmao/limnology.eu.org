Specifically, such data sets are desired to calibrate and validate models, and broaden the insight on the boundary conditions that force models. Here, we present a wave data set collected in the North Sea at three stations in intermediate water depth (6-14~m) during the 2021/2022 storm season as part of the RealDune/REFLEX experiments. Continuous measurements of synchronized surface elevation, velocity and pressure were recorded at 2-4~Hz by Acoustic Doppler Profilers and an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter for a 5~month duration. Time series were quality-controlled, directional-frequency energy spectra were calculated, and common bulk parameters were derived. Measured wave conditions vary from calm to energetic with 0.1-5.0~m sea-swell wave height, 5-16~s mean wave period and W-NNW direction. Nine storms, i.e. wave height beyond 2.5~m for at least six hours, were recorded including the triple storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin. This unique data set can be used to investigate wave transformation, wave nonlinearity and wave directionality for higher and lower frequencies (e.g. sea-swell and infragravity waves) to compare with theoretical and empirical descriptions. Furthermore, the data can serve to force, calibrate and validate models during storm conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2031945996060b0d0b7f7172369206f03e0d8974f50d7f42132a6e1d033ccb80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
