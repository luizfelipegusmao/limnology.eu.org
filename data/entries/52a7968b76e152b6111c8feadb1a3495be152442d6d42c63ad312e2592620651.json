{"title":"Definition of a Multi-omics Signature for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Prognosis Prediction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0230/v1","date":1719959113000,"content":"Esophageal cancer is an extremely deadly tumor that accounts for 5% of all cancer deaths. The two main subtypes of the disease are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). To date, few studies analyse EAC for transcriptional signatures associated with diagnosis and/or prognosis, while most focus on the analysis of transcriptional profiles of ESCC. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of CD45+ cells enriched from Tumors and matched Non Tumor tissues from therapy na—óve patients to identify all types of immune cells present in tumor immune infiltrate and its transcriptional profile. In addi-tion, we analysed the entire transcriptome in a cohort of 23 patients whose tissue biopsies were taken from Tumors and matched with Non Tumor tissue. \nThe transcriptional signatures we obtained were then used to stratify a large cohort of TCGA EAC patients, demonstrating a strong association with their prognosis, as well as the ability to predict a patient's clinical outcome and better define the prognosis of EAC after surgery. In addition, these features may lead patients to effective therapies including immunotherapy approaches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"52a7968b76e152b6111c8feadb1a3495be152442d6d42c63ad312e2592620651","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
