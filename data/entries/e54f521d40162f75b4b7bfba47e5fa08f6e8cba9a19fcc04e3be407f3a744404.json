Rababah, Jorn Dormans</p>\r\n\r\nThis study explores gender-specific aspects of nurses’ valued domains of living, examining differences in importance and consistency between male and female nurses in Jordanian hospitals. A cross-sectional study recruited 206 nurses (103 females, 103 males) from two major hospitals in Jordan. Data were collected using a demographics questionnaire and the Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ), assessing 10 domains of living. The mean age of the sample was 35.4, ranging between 27 and 59 years old. The highest rank order valued domain of living for females was family, with 88.3% of females considering it a very important living domain. Parenting was the highest-ranked domain of living for males, with 76.7% reporting it as a very important domain of living. Significant gender differences were found in valued domains’ rank order, importance, and consistency. Female nurses prioritized work, education/training, spirituality, and citizenship/community more than males, while males prioritized marriage/couples/intimate relations. Females consistently aligned actions with values related to work, education/training, spirituality, and citizenship/community. Parenting emerged as a problematic valued domain, particularly for females. Understanding gender differences in nurses’ valued domains is essential for creating equitable and supportive work environments. Tailored interventions should address gender-specific needs and challenges, promoting workplace satisfaction and improving patient outcomes. Future research should explore factors contributing to gender differences and evaluate interventions promoting gender equity and diversity in nursing.","author":"Mohammed Munther AL-Hammouri","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e54f521d40162f75b4b7bfba47e5fa08f6e8cba9a19fcc04e3be407f3a744404","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
