{"title":"A Potato Virus Y Infection under Ambient Conditions That Turn It Asymptomatic Affects the Physiology of the Host, and Its Interplay with Drought","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1421/v1","date":1721213081000,"content":"Nicotiana benthamiana plants infected with a potato virus Y isolate (PVYO) under ambient conditions of 25 °C and ~405 parts-per-million (ppm) ambient CO2 display symptoms of chlorosis, leaf curling, and stunting. However, under elevated temperature and CO2 levels (30 °C, 970 ppm), systemic viral titers decrease several-fold, and plants appear asymptomatic. Under the latter conditions we have studied how infection, drought, or both combined affect infection, drought-driven loss of leaf turgor, plant water content, stomatal conductance, metabolome, and hormone (ABA, SA, and JA) levels. We found that drought did not affect viral titers. As expected, drought decreased plant water content and stomatal conductance. Under drought conditions, infection did not alter significantly final water content or loss of leaf turgor progression, but it increased the levels of some sugars and other osmo-protectants. Infection and drought altered the levels of many components of the metabolome. Some components altered by infection were not altered by drought, but most of those altered by drought were also altered by infection. Drought increased the levels of ABA, infection increased the levels of ABA, SA, and JA, and altered their relative balance. The effects of drought and of infection on hormone levels were cumulative when combined. Thus, under ambient conditions that turn a severe infection into an asymptomatic one both, plant physiology parameters and the interplay with drought are affected.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"535a1e01026fc330b4b1bda1b9b1858233dbeb7ef2adde32200ebf1ee991d339","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
