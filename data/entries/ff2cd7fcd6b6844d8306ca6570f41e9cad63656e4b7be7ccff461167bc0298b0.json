{"title":"Three Arabidopsis UMP kinases have different roles in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and (deoxy)CMP salvage","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3611/7691842?rss=1","date":1718150400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pyrimidine nucleotide monophosphate biosynthesis ends in the cytosol with uridine monophosphate (UMP). UMP phosphorylation to uridine diphosphate (UDP) by UMP KINASEs (UMKs) is required for the generation of all pyrimidine (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates as building blocks for nucleic acids and central metabolites like UDP-glucose. The Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) genome encodes five UMKs and three belong to the AMP KINASE (AMK)-like UMKs, which were characterized to elucidate their contribution to pyrimidine metabolism. Mitochondrial UMK2 and cytosolic UMK3 are evolutionarily conserved, whereas cytosolic UMK1 is specific to the Brassicaceae. In vitro, all UMKs can phosphorylate UMP, cytidine monophosphate (CMP) and deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP), but with different efficiencies. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9)-induced null mutants were generated for <span>UMK1</span> and <span>UMK2</span>, but not for <span>UMK3</span>, since frameshift alleles were lethal for germline cells. However, a mutant with diminished UMK3 activity showing reduced growth was obtained. Metabolome analyses of germinating seeds and adult plants of single- and higher-order mutants revealed that UMK3 plays an indispensable role in the biosynthesis of all pyrimidine (deoxy)nucleotides and UDP-sugars, while UMK2 is important for dCMP recycling that contributes to mitochondrial DNA stability. UMK1 is primarily involved in CMP recycling. We discuss the specific roles of these UMKs referring also to the regulation of pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate synthesis.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"ff2cd7fcd6b6844d8306ca6570f41e9cad63656e4b7be7ccff461167bc0298b0","category":"Environment"}
