{"title":"Ultrasound and Clinical Parameters in Patients with Hashimoto&rsquo;s Thyroiditis Related to Dermatological Diseases: A Cross-Sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0724/v1","date":1710249252000,"content":"Background: Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis (HT) is an autoimmune disease that progressively leads to thyroid gland destruction and hypothyroidism. Patients produce antibodies against two thyroid-specific antigens: thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase. As a result of the abnormal amount of thyroid hormone produced and its autoimmune etiology, patients with HT display a higher frequency of either autoimmune or non-autoimmune dermatological disorders. On ultrasound examination, HT can be detected by observing an enlarged thyroid gland with hypoechoic parenchymal regions or by observing a small gland indicating atrophy and diffusely heterogeneous parenchyma. Changes in the parenchymal vascularity can be observed as decreased or increased levels of vascularization. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the role of clinical data and ultrasound evaluation of patients with HT in suggesting an association with dermatological disorders. Patients and methods: Complete dermatological and endocrinological assessments as well as ultrasonography of the thyroid and lymphnodes were performed in HT patients. Results: The data obtained showed that a family history of thyroid disease, increased diameter of the inferior thyroid artery, and the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy were more frequent in the group of patients with dermatological diseases. Taken together, our results suggest the usefulness of ultrasound in determining a possible association between HT and dermatological disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ff16ed5b777d2629a160d67243bdb6f8efb535dc22a73c089222d407aa1d101","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
