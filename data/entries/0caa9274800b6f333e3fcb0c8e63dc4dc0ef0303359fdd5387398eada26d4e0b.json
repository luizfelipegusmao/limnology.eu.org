{"title":"Voacangine mitigates oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in middle cerebral artery occlusion‐induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by averting the NF‐κBp65/MAPK signaling pathways in rats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24274?af=R","date":1712921589000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of human mortality. Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (CI/RI) is a primary cause of stroke. Ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) resulting in oxidative stress and inflammatory events may lead to severe neuronal impairments. Thus, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory mediators that can alleviate post-I/R neuronal injuries are required for the treatment of CI/RI. An alkaloid, voacangine (VCG) is a recognized antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agent. Hence, the current study intended to explore the neuroprotective potential and the principal mechanisms of VCG in CI/RI. The experimental rats were divided into four sets: control, I/R-induced, I/R + VCG (2.5 mg/kg), I/R + VCG (5 mg/kg). CI/RI was induced by implanting a thread into the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Brain damages were assessed on the basis of brain edema, brain infarct volume, neurological deficit score, histopathology, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Results revealed that VCG inhibited the triggering of NLRP3 inflammasome, pro-inflammatory cytokines, lipid peroxidation, but enhanced the antioxidant status in MCAO rats. Furthermore, VCG treatment averted brain damage by I/R, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress by suppressing NF-κBp65/MAPK pathways. The results of the study provide pertinent insights pertaining to the role of VCG as a potential neuroprotective agent against ischemic stroke.</p>","author":"Bo Xu, \nHua Wu, \nWei Guo, \nShaik Althaf Hussain, \nTian Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"0caa9274800b6f333e3fcb0c8e63dc4dc0ef0303359fdd5387398eada26d4e0b","category":"Environment"}
