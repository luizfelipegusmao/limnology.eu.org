Nonetheless, evidence of the barriers challenging smallholder farmers in the implementation of CSA practices remains limited in Ghana. This study, therefore, investigated the barriers opposing smallholder cassava farmers in implementing CSA practices in the Afigya Kwabre South District, Ghana. The study used descriptive statistics and content analysis to analyze primary data collected through 200 household surveys and 10 key informant interviews from four selected communities (Aboabogya, Aduamoa, Aduman Old Town, and Aduman New Town) in the district. Results revealed that the smallholder cassava farmers implemented key CSA practices including mulching (89%), mixed farming (86%), crop diversification (84%), and crop rotation (81%) to build their resilience in food systems. Furthermore, the results showed that the critical enablers to the farmers’ utilization of CSA practices were access to weather and climate services (82%), a secured land tenure system (75%), and knowledge of the effects of climate change (68%). Also, the results indicated that the key barriers challenging smallholder cassava farmers in the implementation of CSA practices were inadequate technological assistance (91%), the incidence of pests and diseases (90%), and a lack of knowledge and understanding of CSA (90%). We recommend that smallholder cassava farmers adopt improved varieties of cassava that are resistant to pests and diseases, drought tolerant, high yielding, and possessing desirable quality traits. Smallholder cassava farmers can also participate in contract farming schemes that link them to agribusinesses that can offer them access to quality inputs, credit, training, and guaranteed markets for their produce.</p>","author":"Frank Baffour‐Ata, \nLouisa Boakye, \nLordina Ekua Acquah, \nSamuel Boamah Brown, \nJohn Dagadu Kafui, \nAustin Appiah Marfo, \nPrince Acheampong, \nSalome Wheagar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Climate Resilience and Sustainability: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e7509a6a763a901e53649c0568b0f7267c6e779cdc08f41bb80af5ed2bfb3753","entryHash":"8a3bee1d7a9960fbda6760b0e34e6271f7f9ebbfa3be0d8423c5b172795eed24","category":"Environment"}
