To address this knowledge gap, we investigated how arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)- and ectomycorrhizal (EcM)-associated seedlings alter rhizodeposition in response to increased seedling inorganic N acquisition. We grew four species each of EcM and AM seedlings from forests of the eastern United States in a continuously <sup>13</sup>C-labeled atmosphere within an environmentally controlled chamber and subjected to three levels of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled fertilizer. We traced seedling <sup>15</sup>N uptake from, and <sup>13</sup>C-labeled inputs (net rhizodeposition) into, root-excluded or -included soil over a 5-month growing season. N uptake by seedlings was positively related to rhizodeposition for EcM- but not AM-associated seedlings in root-included soils. Despite this contrast in rhizodeposition, there was no difference in soil C storage between mycorrhizal types over the course of the experiment. Instead root-inclusive soils lost C, while root-exclusive soils gained C. Our findings suggest that mycorrhizal associations mediate tree belowground C investment in response to inorganic N availability, but these differences do not affect C storage. Continued soil warming and N deposition under global change will increase soil inorganic N availability and our seedling results indicate this could lead to greater belowground C investment by EcM-associated trees. This potential for less efficient N uptake by EcM-trees could contribute to AM-tree success and a shift toward more AM-dominated temperate forests.</p>","author":"Amelia A. Fitch, \nSarah B.
