{"title":"Vitiligo Is a Breakdown of the Melanocyte-Immune Tolerance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1852/v1","date":1714358197000,"content":"The human body tries to tolerate the pigment-producing cells through several mechanisms including; central deletion of melanocyte-specific T cells or peripheral induction of inhibition or anergy of the released cytotoxic T cells. The melanocytes also try to hide their antigenic components from the immune system. The breakdown of these mechanisms leads to the induction of the adaptive immunity and the production of unopposed melanocyte-specific cytotoxic T cells, destroying the melanocytes, leading to the development of depigmentation. Vitiligo will develop whenever tolerance-jeopardizing factors outnumber or over-weigh the tolerance-inducing factors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"348770a661935fd37370557b4e4d38834c8241e79fc69b9f200af9b3c24048e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
