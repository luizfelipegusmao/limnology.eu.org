Modern aberration-corrected electron microscopes now routinely reach deep sub-angstrom level spatial resolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.310-B1\">1</a>], while ultra-high-resolution monochromators, based on closely related electron-optical ‘corrector’ designs, have enabled spectroscopy in the meV regime [<a href=\"#ozae044.310-B2\">2</a>]. One of the most impactful consequences of these developments has been the widespread adoption of low-voltage instruments, which can maintain very high spatial resolutions, even down to 20kV, thanks to their aberration correctors [<a href=\"#ozae044.310-B3\">3</a>] – with the serendipitous and timely ‘discovery’ of 2D materials such as graphene providing the ideal sandbox and test objects for the development of ‘single-atom microscopy’ in these instruments [<a href=\"#ozae044.310-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ee374c92388770f1827c6854c39a94a0b9d24cca10307480fb3851ebeb397a1a","category":"Environment"}
