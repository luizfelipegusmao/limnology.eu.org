{"title":"Increasing Silicate Supply with Decreasing Npk Fertilization Can Mitigate the Stimulative Effect of Shading on Carbon Intensity in Paddy Field","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2393/v1","date":1727686080000,"content":"Decreased solar radiation is one of the main issues of climate change. Decreased solar radiation reduced rice yield, while compound fertilization with silicate enhanced the yield. However, it is not fully understood regarding the fertilization effects on the yield, the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide in paddy fields under decreased solar radiation. Field simulation experiments with shading were conducted in two consecutive years (2019 to 2020) at the Agrometeorological Station, Nanjing, China. An orthogonal experimental design with three factors and three levels was adopted in this study. The shading was set at 3 levels, i.e. no shading (S0), shading from flowering to maturity period (S1), and shading from tillering to maturity period (S2), with 64% of shading rate. The compound fertilization (as NPK) was set at 3 rates, i.e. 100 kghm-2 (F1), 200 kghm-2 (F2), and 300 kghm-2 (F3). The silicate supply was set at 3 levels, i.e. no silicate supply (R0), adding steel slag at 200 kg SiO2hm-2 (R1), and adding steel slag at 400 kg SiO2hm-2 (R2). The results showed that, shading significantly reduced rice yield. Compared with S0, S1 and S2 significantly decreased rice yield by 43.31-43.32% and 48.51-48.52%, respectively. Shading extremely reduced the cumulative CH4 emission. Compared with S0, S1 and S2 decreased the cumulative CH4 emission by 7.47%-15.21 and 52.15-57.72, but increased the cumulative N2O emission by 8.56%-26.25% and 54.80-57.59%, respectively. The compound fertilization significantly increased the cumulative CH4 and N2O emissions. Compared with F1, F2 and F3 increased the cumulative CH4 emission by 42.01-48.29% and 9.59-57.00%; and enhanced the cumulative N2O emission by 5.67-85.81% and 21.32-192.98%, respectively. Compared with control (R0), silicate supply generally decreased the cumulative CH4 emission by 20.1%-29.57, while increased the cumulative N2O emission by 8.58%-39.57% and 9.12%-48.00%, respectively. Shading (S1 and S2) decreased the total global warming potential (GWP) by 6.88%-13.69% and 47.58%-55.73%, while compound fertilization increased the total GWP by 43.91-49.05% and 10.36-59.70%, respectively. In general, shading and compound fertilization increased the greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) by 59.51%-60.62% and 33.13%-105.76%, while silicate application decreased the GHGI by 23.08%-50.50%, respectively. This study suggests that, controlling the fertilization amount was helpful in decreasing the GHGI, simultaneously ensuring rice yield under decreased solar radiation, with the optimal fertilization at 100 kg·hm-2 of compound fertilizer (as NPK) and 200 kg SiO2·hm-2 of steel slag in the lower reaches of Yangtze River, China.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5a67c2afe7f983685e9fb49a707790b7f3d1cc18a0f6950264de73e0d69ba45","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
