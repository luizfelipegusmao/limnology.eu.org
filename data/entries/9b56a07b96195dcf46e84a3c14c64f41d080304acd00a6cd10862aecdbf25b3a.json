{"title":"Cohomology of Modified Rota-Baxter Pre-lie Algebras and Its Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1411/v1","date":1713835025000,"content":"Semenov-Tian-Shansky has introduced the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, which is called the modified $r$-matrix. Relevant studies have been extensive in recent times.  This paper is devoted to study cohomology theory of modified Rota-Baxter pre-Lie algebras and its applications.\nFirst we introduce the concept and representations of modified Rota-Baxter pre-Lie algebras.   We then develop the cohomology of modified Rota-Baxter pre-Lie algebras with coefficients in a suitable representation.  As  applications,  we consider the infinitesimal deformations, abelian extensions   and  skeletal modified Rota-Baxter pre-Lie 2-algebra  in terms of    lower degree cohomology groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b56a07b96195dcf46e84a3c14c64f41d080304acd00a6cd10862aecdbf25b3a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
