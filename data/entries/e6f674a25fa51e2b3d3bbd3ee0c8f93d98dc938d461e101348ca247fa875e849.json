{"title":"Overexpressing GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE 1;2 maintains carbon and nitrogen balance under high-ammonium conditions and results in increased tolerance to ammonium toxicity in hybrid poplar","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/4052/7631002?rss=1","date":1710720000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The glutamine synthetase/glutamic acid synthetase (GS/GOGAT) cycle plays important roles in N metabolism, growth, development, and stress resistance in plants. Excess ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) restricts growth, but GS can help to alleviate its toxicity. In this study, the 84K model clone of hybrid poplar (<span>Populus alba</span> Ã— <span>P. tremula</span> var. <span>glandulosa</span>), which has reduced biomass accumulation and leaf chlorosis under high-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress, showed less severe symptoms in transgenic lines overexpressing <span>GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE 1;2</span> (<span>GS1;2</span>-OE), and more severe symptoms in RNAi lines (<span>GS1;2</span>-RNAi). Compared with the wild type, the <span>GS1;2</span>-OE lines had increased GS and GOGAT activities and higher contents of free amino acids, soluble proteins, total N, and chlorophyll under high-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress, whilst the antioxidant and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation capacities of the <span>GS1;2</span>-RNAi lines were decreased. The total C content and C/N ratio in roots and leaves of the overexpression lines were higher under stress, and there were increased contents of various amino acids and sugar alcohols, and reduced contents of carbohydrates in the roots. Under high-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress, genes related to amino acid biosynthesis, sucrose and starch degradation, galactose metabolism, and the antioxidant system were significantly up-regulated in the roots of the overexpression lines. Thus, overexpression of <span>GS1;2</span> affected the carbon and amino acid metabolism pathways under high-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress to help maintain the balance between C and N metabolism and alleviate the symptoms of toxicity. Modification of the GS/GOGAT cycle by genetic engineering is therefore a potential strategy for improving the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> tolerance of cultivated trees.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"e6f674a25fa51e2b3d3bbd3ee0c8f93d98dc938d461e101348ca247fa875e849","category":"Environment"}
