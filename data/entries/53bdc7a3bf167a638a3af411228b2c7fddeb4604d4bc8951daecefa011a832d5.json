{"title":"Following the Principles of the Universe: Lessons from Plants on Individual and Communal Thriving","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1391/7246883?rss=1","date":1692576000000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The means by which plants and other organisms exist in and respond to dynamic environments to support their thriving as individuals and in communities provide lessons for humans on sustainable and resilient thriving. First examined in my book, <span>Lessons from Plants</span> (Harvard University Press, 2021), I explore herein the following question: “How can plants teach us to be better humans?” I consider how insights gathered from plant physiology, phenotypic plasticity, and other plant growth phenomena can help us improve our lives and our society, with a focus on highlighting academic and scientific environments. Genetically identical plants can have very different appearances, metabolisms, and behaviors if the external environments in which they are growing differ in light or nutrient availability, among other environmental differences. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that enable them to maximize their chances of survival in dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environments, while also transforming the environment in which they exist in the process. Highlighting examples from research on, for instance, plants’ responses to light and nutrient cues, I focus on insights for humans derived from lessons from plants. These lessons focus on how plants achieve their own purposes by following common principles of the universe on thriving and resilience as individuals and in communities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"53bdc7a3bf167a638a3af411228b2c7fddeb4604d4bc8951daecefa011a832d5","category":"Environment"}
