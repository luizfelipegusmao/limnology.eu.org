{"title":"How Veeries vary: Whole genome sequencing resolves genetic structure in a long-distance migratory bird","link":"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/doi/10.1093/ornithology/ukad061/7471462?rss=1","date":1702339200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In high-latitude species with high dispersal ability, such as long-distance migratory birds, populations are often assumed to exhibit little genetic structure due to high gene flow or recent postglacial expansion. We sequenced over 120 low-coverage whole genomes from across the breeding range of a long-distance migratory bird, the Veery (<span>Catharus fuscescens</span>), revealing strong evidence for isolation by distance. Additionally, we found distinct genetic structure between boreal, western montane U.S., and southern Appalachian sampling regions. We suggest that population genetic structure in this highly migratory species is detectable with the high resolution afforded by whole-genomic data because, similar to many migratory birds, the Veery exhibits high breeding-site fidelity, which likely limits gene flow. Resolution of isolation by distance across the breeding range was sufficient to assign likely breeding origins of individuals sampled in this species’ poorly understood South American nonbreeding range, demonstrating the potential to assess migratory connectivity in this species using genomic data. As the Veery’s breeding range extends across both historically glaciated and unglaciated regions in North America, we also evaluated whether contemporary patterns of structure and genetic diversity are consistent with historical population isolation in glacial refugia. We found that patterns of genetic diversity did not support southern montane regions (southern Appalachians or western U.S. mountains) as glacial refugia. Overall, our findings suggest that isolation by distance yields subtle associations between genetic structure and geography across the breeding range of this highly vagile species even in the absence of obvious historical vicariance or contemporary barriers to dispersal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithology Current Issue","siteHash":"4b42e15d9ceec568e037973cb16bc8a0448c103c6eaf3f714117d3650f8eefe7","entryHash":"91355afc28af2a9d49cf41907dc7e987ca33fd528492f226a915c30778e2cf6a","category":"Environment"}
