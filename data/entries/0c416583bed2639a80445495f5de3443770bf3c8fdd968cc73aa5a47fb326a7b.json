{"title":"Snowdrift‐Permitting Simulations of Seasonal Snowpack Processes Over Large Mountain Extents","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036948?af=R","date":1723891592000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The melt of seasonal snowpack in mountain regions provides downstream river basins with a critical supply of freshwater. Snowdrift-permitting models have been proposed as a way to accurately simulate snowpack heterogeneity that stems from differences in energy inputs, over winter redistribution, sublimation, melt, and variations in precipitation. However, these spatial scales can be computationally intractable for large extents. In this work, the multiscale Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) was applied to simulate snowpacks at snowdrift-permitting scales (≈50 m) across the Canadian Cordillera and adjacent regions (1.37 million km<sup>2</sup>) forced by downscaled atmospheric data. The use of a multiscale land surface representation resulted in a reduction of computational elements of 98% while preserving land-surface heterogeneity. CHM includes complex terrain windflow and radiative transfer calculations, lapses temperature, humidity, and precipitation with elevation, redistributes snow by avalanching, wind transport and forest canopy interception and calculates the energetics of canopy and surface snowpacks. Model outputs were compared to a set of multiscale observations including snow-covered area (SCA) from Sentinel and Landsat imagery, snow depth from uncrewed aerial system lidar, and point surface observations of depth and density. Including snow redistribution and sublimation processes improved the summer SCA <i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup> from 0.7 to 0.9. At larger scales, inclusion of snow redistribution processes delayed full snowpack ablation by an average of 33 days, demonstrating process emergence with scale. These simulations show how multiscale modeling can improve snowpack predictions to support prediction of water supply, droughts, and floods.</p>","author":"Christopher B.
