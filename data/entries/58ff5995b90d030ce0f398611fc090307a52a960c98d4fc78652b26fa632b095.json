{"title":"Interactions Between Corn Starch and Ethyl Maltol Under Heat-Moisture Treatment and Its Application in Fried Chicken Nuggets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0484/v1","date":1728349935000,"content":"The study delved into the interaction between corn starch and ethyl maltol during innovative repeated-continuous heat-moisture treatment (RCHMT), and its impact on the quality of fried chicken nuggets. The results revealed that the complexation ratio of ethyl maltol in the corn starch-ethyl maltol complex remained stable, and the complex created dense microporous structures. Native starch and complex samples exhibited an A-type crystal structure, while the physical mixture sample showed a Ca-type. Additionally, the peak of C-O-H def., CH2 of the complex sample was red-shifted, and the hydrogen bond structure was enhanced. Moreover, the complex exhibited a higher resistant starch content and lower hydrolysis rate than the physical mixture sample. The starch-ethyl maltol formed by RCHMT is a non-inclusion complex. It has been shown to reduce oil absorption and enhance the crispness of fried chicken nuggets, matching that of commercial products. This finding provides a direction for the development of innovative coating powders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58ff5995b90d030ce0f398611fc090307a52a960c98d4fc78652b26fa632b095","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
