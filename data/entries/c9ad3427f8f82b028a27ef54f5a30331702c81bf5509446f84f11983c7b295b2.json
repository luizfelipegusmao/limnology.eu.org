{"title":"Phylogenomic data reveal cryptic diversity and deep phylogeographical structure within the common chuckwalla, Sauromalus ater (Squamata: Iguanidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/141/4/572/7263126?rss=1","date":1694044800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Understanding how historical geological processes drive diversification and shape the contemporary distribution of species is fundamental to phylogeography. We take a genomic approach in order to elucidate the deep phylogeographical history and species limits of chuckwallas (<span>Sauromalus</span>), a conspicuous group of lizards of the arid lands of south-western North America. Phylogenetic and population genomic analyses of double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data confirm the presence of at least two major lineages, peninsular and continental groups, within the widespread and morphologically variable common chuckwalla (<span>Sauromalus ater</span>). These lineages diversified in the vicinity of the head of the Gulf of California in north-eastern Baja California in the early Pliocene to late Miocene, during the formation of the northern gulf. The peninsular lineage of <span>S. ater</span> subsequently gave rise to the four insular endemic species of <span>Sauromalus</span> associated with the Baja California peninsula. Genomic analyses strongly support the continued recognition of the insular gigantics <span>Sauromalus varius</span> and <span>Sauromalus hispidus</span> as distinct species, although their relationship as sister species remains unresolved. Weaker phylogenetic signal for the insular species <span>Sauromalus slevini</span> and <span>Sauromalus klauberi</span> is provided by the genomic data; thus, it is advocated to continue recognizing these species until additional data can be analysed to evaluate their distinctiveness.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"c9ad3427f8f82b028a27ef54f5a30331702c81bf5509446f84f11983c7b295b2","category":"Environment"}
