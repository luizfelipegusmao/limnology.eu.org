{"title":"Comparison of In Vitro Models for Drug-Induced Liver Injury Assessment","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0676/v1","date":1715330574000,"content":"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) stands as a significant cause of drug attrition. To mitigate clinical DILI risks, assessing drugs using human liver models is crucial since animal studies may fall short due to species-specific liver pathway variations. Cell-based preclinical hepatotoxicity testing is often pertinent. In the present study, cells from a human liver cancer line (HepG2, HepaRG) were cultured in both formats of 2D and 3D spheroids to explore their responses to drugs. Liver-specific marker expressions across cell lines and culture formats were also examined to assess disparities in drug-induced liver injury marker expressions. In cytotoxicity assays, HepG2 cells exhibited heightened sensitivity to amiodarone HCl, while HepaRG cells showed greater sensitivity to acetaminophen. Generally, 2D cultures were more responsive to drugs than 3D cultures. Consistency was observed between cytotoxicity assays and liver injury markers AST and ALT. Variations were also noted in liver cell marker secretion, with albumin and urea concentrations declining post-drug treatment, particularly with higher baseline expression in HepaRG cells and 3D cultures. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of CYP enzymes involved in hepatocellular drug metabolism were compared following treatment with enzyme inducers. CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 were not expressed in HepG2 cells. On the other hand, CYP3A4 was expressed higher in 3D culture than in 2D culture. HepaRG cells exhibited significantly increased expression of all three enzymes post-treatment. Notably, enzyme expression was notably higher in 3D cultures than in 2D cultures. Collectively, these findings suggest that HepaRG cells and 3D cultures hold promise for evaluating DILI during early-stage drug development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"83a8d9a45c82a47c779f4cf19c1a7e1ae7f2f1e4fcdddec9d5f22976a927291b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
