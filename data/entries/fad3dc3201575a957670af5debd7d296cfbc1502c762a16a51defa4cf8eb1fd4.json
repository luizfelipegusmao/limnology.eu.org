{"title":"Personalized Diabetes Management with Digital Twins: A Patient-Centric Knowledge Graph Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0884/v1","date":1710489135000,"content":"Diabetes management requires constant monitoring and individualized adjustments. This study proposes a novel approach that leverages digital twins and Personal Health Knowledge Graphs (PHKGs) to revolutionize diabetes care. Our key contribution lies in developing a real-time, patient-centric digital twin framework built on PHKGs. This framework integrates data from diverse sources, adhering to HL7 standards and enabling seamless information access and exchange. PHKGs offer a flexible and efficient format that supports various applications. As new knowledge about the patient becomes available, the PHKG can be easily extended to incorporate it. This dynamic approach fosters continuous improvement and facilitates the development of new applications. As proof of concept, we have demonstrated the versatility of our digital twin by applying it to different use cases in diabetes management. These include predicting glucose levels, optimizing insulin dosage, providing personalized lifestyle recommendations, and visualizing health data. By enabling real-time, patient-specific care, this research paves the way for more precise and personalized healthcare interventions, potentially improving long-term diabetes management outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fad3dc3201575a957670af5debd7d296cfbc1502c762a16a51defa4cf8eb1fd4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
