Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) make a major contribution to the global burden of disease. Many of the driving forces responsible for GEC also influence NCD risk through a range of mechanisms. This article provides an overview of pathways linking GEC and NCDs, focusing on five pathways: (a) energy, air pollution, and climate change; (b) urbanization; (c) food, nutrition, and agriculture; (d) the deposition of persistent chemicals in the environment; and (e) biodiversity loss.</p>\r\n<p>Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 40, 2019</p>","author":"Howard Frumkin and Andy Haines","siteTitle":"Annual Review of Public Health","siteHash":"7a16e40f33727f64c92405053603e83c5cbbe960f1756170cbd1d528ffe78607","entryHash":"709c84547c620e17ab4a647372c22e7af224618a6f5c148d698d700538fa9108","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
