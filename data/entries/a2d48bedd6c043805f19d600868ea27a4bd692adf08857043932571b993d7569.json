{"title":"Poaceae plants transfer cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase to chloroplasts for ultraviolet-B resistance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/326/7606712?rss=1","date":1707696000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Photoreactivation enzyme that repairs cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) induced by ultraviolet-B radiation, commonly called CPD photolyase (PHR) is essential for plants living under sunlight. Rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>) PHR (OsPHR) is a unique triple-targeting protein. The signal sequences required for its translocation to the nucleus or mitochondria are located in the C-terminal region but have yet to be identified for chloroplasts. Here, we identified sequences located in the N-terminal region, including the serine-phosphorylation site at position 7 of OsPHR, and found that OsPHR is transported/localized to chloroplasts via a vesicle transport system under the control of serine-phosphorylation. However, the sequence identified in this study is only conserved in some <span>Poaceae</span> species, and in many other plants, PHR is not localized to the chloroplasts. Therefore, we reasoned that <span>Poaceae</span> species need the ability to repair CPD in the chloroplast genome to survive under sunlight and have uniquely acquired this mechanism for PHR chloroplast translocation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a2d48bedd6c043805f19d600868ea27a4bd692adf08857043932571b993d7569","category":"Environment"}
