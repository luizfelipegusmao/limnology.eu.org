{"title":"Transcription factor CaHDZ15 promotes pepper basal thermotolerance by activating HEAT SHOCK FACTORA6a","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/812/7589260?rss=1","date":1706140800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>High temperature stress (HTS) is a serious threat to plant growth and development and to crop production in the context of global warming, and plant response to HTS is largely regulated at the transcriptional level by the actions of various transcription factors (TFs). However, whether and how homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) TFs are involved in thermotolerance are unclear. Herein, we functionally characterized a pepper (<span>Capsicum annuum</span>) HD-Zip I TF CaHDZ15. <span>CaHDZ15</span> expression was upregulated by HTS and abscisic acid in basal thermotolerance via loss- and gain-of-function assays by virus-induced gene silencing in pepper and overexpression in <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> plants. CaHDZ15 acted positively in pepper basal thermotolerance by directly targeting and activating <span>HEAT SHOCK FACTORA6a</span> (<span>HSFA6a</span>), which further activated <span>CaHSFA2</span>. In addition, CaHDZ15 interacted with HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 70-2 (CaHsp70-2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase1 (CaGAPC1), both of which positively affected pepper thermotolerance. CaHsp70-2 and CaGAPC1 promoted CaHDZ15 binding to the promoter of <span>CaHSFA6a</span>, thus enhancing its transcription. Furthermore, CaHDZ15 and CaGAPC1 were protected from 26S proteasome-mediated degradation by CaHsp70-2 via physical interaction. These results collectively indicate that CaHDZ15, modulated by the interacting partners CaGAPC1 and CaHsp70-2, promotes basal thermotolerance by directly activating the transcript of <span>CaHSFA6a</span>. Thus, a molecular linkage is established among CaHsp70-2, CaGAPC1, and CaHDZ15 to transcriptionally modulate CaHSFA6a in pepper thermotolerance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a9bf9eddbbc75e705ad3a3c7e29ac1a62a01f3065d7ec8b9abaee3aefc80f1a9","category":"Environment"}
