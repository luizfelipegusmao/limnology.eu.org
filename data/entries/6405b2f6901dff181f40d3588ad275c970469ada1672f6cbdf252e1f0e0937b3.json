{"title":"Neurosurgical Management and Modifiable Risk Factors of Neurocognitive Decline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0678/v1","date":1712726300000,"content":"Cognitive impairment is a condition which affects aging patient populations and is becoming more prevalent as the geriatric population expands. It is categorized by the extent of cognitive decline, memory loss, functional abilities, and the capability to perform daily tasks. Based on the degree of impairment, it is classified as mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Considering the debilitating nature of cognitive decline and its impact on quality of life, prevention is key. In addition, given the gradual progression of the underlying causes of cognitive decline, early diagnosis and appropriate management has the potential to offer clinical advantages and better patient outcomes. Management options discussed vary from pharmaceutical regimens to neurosurgical interventions, with differing outcomes based on etiology of cognitive impairment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6405b2f6901dff181f40d3588ad275c970469ada1672f6cbdf252e1f0e0937b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
