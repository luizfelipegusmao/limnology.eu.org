{"title":"Integrating Extended Reality (XR) and Advanced ICT into Therapeutic Practices for Impaired and Socially Isolated Individuals: The Role of Healthcare Professionals in Leveraging XR for Remote Artistic and Recreational Activities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0577/v1","date":1723099336000,"content":"Extended Reality (XR) technologies—encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—merge elements of the physical world with virtual environments, revolutionizing various sectors, including healthcare. This paper explores the transformative potential of XR when combined with advanced digital tools to enhance therapeutic practices for individuals with disabilities or social isolation. Emphasizing the pivotal role of healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, the study investigates how these experts can effectively integrate XR technologies to maximize therapeutic benefits. The research includes a pre-implementation phase that assesses the knowledge and acceptance levels of both healthcare professionals and the general population. This foundational study highlights the potential of XR in expanding access to artistic and recreational activities, drawing insights from efforts by the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore (Florence) to democratize timeless artistic experiences. The findings underscore the im-portance of defining key terms and understanding stakeholder readiness before full-scale implementation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4105601640f9ff9bc7c8e145e499e721459a468fc19b42bd59d938f019af902d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
