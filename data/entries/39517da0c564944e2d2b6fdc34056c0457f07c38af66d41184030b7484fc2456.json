{"title":"Fabrication Tolerances Impact on an ODAC Based PAM-4 Transmitter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0793/v1","date":1715579168000,"content":"Photonic integrated circuits (PIC) devices are impacted by fabrication tolerances and therefore, prior knowledge of such variation could improve the PIC fabrication process and overall yield. This paper presents a method for predicting the fabrication impacts on a telecommunication optical digital to analog converter (oDAC) based pulse amplitude modulator level four (PAM-4) transmitter. Our findings allow us to estimate the production yield in fabrication scenario using symbol error rate (SER) benchmark.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39517da0c564944e2d2b6fdc34056c0457f07c38af66d41184030b7484fc2456","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
