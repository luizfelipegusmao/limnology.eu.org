{"title":"Amazon tropical fishes of commercial interest show human-cell contamination but no SARS-CoV-2 in a real-life scenario","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306985","date":1721052000000,"content":"<p>by Carolina Sousa de Sá Leitão, Carlos Henrique dos Anjos dos Santos, Jefferson Valente, Bernardo Maia, Rogério Santos Pereira, Larissa Matos Batista, Felipe Guedes Amorim, Luciana Mara Fé-Gonçalves, Marcus Lacerda, Fernando Almeida-Val, Adalberto Luis Val</p>\r\nBackground <p>Amazonas was one of the most impacted Brazilian states by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mortality rates were high, and the health systems collapsed. It is important to identify possible intermediate reservoirs to avoid animal-to-human contamination. Several tropical fish are of commercial interest and are sold in large open-air markets in the region, representing a large economic and dietary importance.</p> Objectives <p>This study aimed to verify if fish species of commercial importance, aerosols, and fish wastewater in local open-air markets, at a major capital city in the western Brazilian Amazon, are contaminated by SARS-CoV-2.</p> Methods <p>488 fish, 50 aerosol, and 45 wastewater samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The samples were subjected to extraction using the BIOGENE Viral DNA/RNA Extraction kit, and the molecular diagnosis was tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the Bio-Manguinhos SARS-CoV-2 (EDx) Molecular Kit.</p> Results <p>It was not possible to detect the virus (Ct≤40, for Gene E) in these samples, however, in 181 samples of fish it was possible to detect the human RP gene (Ct≤35, for the RP Gene), indicating human contact. There was a high number of COVID-19 diagnoses in all city districts in which the samples were collected, showing that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating.</p> Conclusion <p>This study indicates that fish of local commercial importance do not carry SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, despite circulation of SARS-CoV-2, and are not an important source of animal-to-human contamination. Despite these results, the human RP gene was found detectable in fish, air, and fish wastewater, showing that such places may carry human pathogens.</p>","author":"Carolina Sousa de Sá Leitão","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f9356e28cdb5e284d42a5960ed7e780eef0d3367a8a9fd4452186b5f496474d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
