{"title":"Management of Atypical Peripheral Neuropathy: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1479/v1","date":1724204633000,"content":"Introduction: Peripheral neuropathies are very common and occur due to multiple causes including diabetes, tuberculosis, vasculitis, thyroid disorders, immune mediated diseases, vitamin B12 deficiency and drugs. Drug induced peripheral neuropathy (DIPN) is potentially irreversible, resulting in sensory deficits and paraesthesia. DIPN due to anti-tubercular drugs is common and can be implicated on linezolid, cycloserine and isoniazid.Case: 40-year-old female, diabetic with MDR-TB presented with severe, sharp, burning pain in her lower limbs. The patient was on all longer acting ATT drug regimen and was suspected with drug induced peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion: Linezolid, is used in treatment of tuberculosis and one of the major side effects includes peripheral neuropathy which is usually quite severe, presenting predominantly with sensory symptoms. Cessation of linezolid and neuropathic pain medications reduced the pain of patient from VCPS 8-10 to 1-2. Treatment of DIPN can be challenging as adverse drug reactions while treating tuberculosis should be kept in mind. It also warrants earliest treatment by identification of the drug in disguise and timely discontinuation of the drug.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"55fc66641f7875c6c2834e34b687d8dd5efad17abdc9bce8735708d61e115f40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
