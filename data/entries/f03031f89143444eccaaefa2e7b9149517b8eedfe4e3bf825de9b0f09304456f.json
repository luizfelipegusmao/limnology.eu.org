{"title":"Power Consumption Modeling of Airconditioning Units in an Educational Building Using Polynomial and Neural Network Fitting Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1196/v1","date":1710924619000,"content":"There are several challenges on how to attain energy efficiency while maintaining balance among factors affecting energy consumption such as power rating and temperature setpoints of cooling units, room temperature and humidity, and indoor air quality (IAQ). A real-time energy and IAQ monitoring system were installed in an educational building to profile the operational power consumption of inverter-based air condition unit (ACU) installed in each room. Polynomial curve and neural fitting regression analysis were applied to the real-time power consumption, indoor temperature and humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2) level data. The derived models were able to provide the stabilizing indoor thermal and air conditions of the room to reach steady state ACU power consumption. These collected data and calculated parameters can be used to define rules in automating control of cooling appliances for an efficient energy utilization. The regression approaches, using real-time data, have determined the influence of indoor heat conditions and carbon dioxide levels on ACU power consumption. These parameters were utilized to establish consistent values for temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels under stable settings of inverter-based air conditioning units.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f03031f89143444eccaaefa2e7b9149517b8eedfe4e3bf825de9b0f09304456f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
