{"title":"A Bayesian inverse approach to identify and quantify organisms from fisheries acoustic data","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/7/1461/7220877?rss=1","date":1688688000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Identifying sound-scattering organisms is a perennial challenge in fisheries acoustics. Most practitioners classify backscatter based on direct sampling, frequency-difference thresholds, and expert judgement, then echo-integrate at a single frequency. However, this approach struggles with species mixtures, and discards multi-frequency information when integrating. Inversion methods do not have these limitations, but are not widely used because species identifications are often ambiguous and the algorithms are complicated to implement. We address these shortcomings using a probabilistic, Bayesian inversion method. Like other inversion methods, it handles species mixtures, uses all available frequencies, and extends naturally to broadband signals. Unlike previous approaches, it leverages Bayesian priors to rigorously incorporate information from direct sampling and biological knowledge, constraining the inversion and reducing ambiguity in species identification. Because it is probabilistic, a well-specified model should not produce solutions that are both wrong and confident. The model is based on physical scattering processes, so its output is fully interpretable, unlike some machine learning methods. Finally, the approach can be implemented using existing Bayesian libraries and is easily parallelized for large datasets. We present examples using simulations and field data from the Gulf of Alaska, and discuss possible applications and extensions of the method.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"fb10c0c4900b34144b7a1d2f9f96efb84c8737d908e5f7dba792bd669ea3ab3f","category":"Environment"}
