{"title":"Energy Efficiency Trends in the Built-Environment Globally and in Egypt: A Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0147/v1","date":1712035699000,"content":"Buildings consume 30% of the total energy consumption around the globe  and 29% of the energy consumption in Egypt which in 2022 had a total population of 102 million, out of which 43 % live in urban areas . The operation of buildings contributes to around 30% of global CO2 emissions due to their high energy consumption (IEA, 2022a). Among the efforts made towards improving the energy efficiency of buildings are Advanced Energy Design Guides (AEDGs), building rating systems, codes, and standards. Furthermore, numerous research studies that are either literature review studies, experimental studies, or computational studies addressed the topic of energy efficiency in buildings. These are all examined in this literature review with the purpose of identifying the research gap in available research with a focus on Egypt. The identified gap is the development of a prescriptive path for the GPRS energy efficiency category based on whole building energy simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ad62db9d8b47232ee5658ea73fcf003fc121469509dff73a29049b78cdd91912","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
