{"title":"Impacts of pine oil and hydrogen induction with hemp oil methyl ester on dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion in diesel engine","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14410?af=R","date":1716028206000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The current research focuses on the impacts of pine oil injection and hydrogen induction separately with hemp oil methyl ester (HOME) in the single cylinder diesel engine in dual fuel-reactivity controlled compression ignition (DF-RCCI) combustion mode. The engine was tested under a DF-RCCI mode for the different energy shares of 10% pine oil with HOME (10P-HOME), 30% pine oil with HOME (30P-HOME), 3-lpm hydrogen with HOME (3-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME), and 6-lpm hydrogen with HOME (6-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME) separately at 345 °CA bTDC of low reactivity fuel (pine oil and hydrogen) and 23°C bTDC injection timing of high reactivity fuel (HOME). The results showed a higher Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) of 7.44%, 5.32%, 5.72%, and 2.46% for 6-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME, 3-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME, 30P-HOME, and 10P-HOME fuel shares, respectively, over the conventional diesel combustion (CDC) at full load. 30P-HOME, 3-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME, and 6-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME fuel combinations recorded 4.08% 4.42%, and 5.69% lower brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), respectively, at full load. When comparing DF-RCCI combustion to CDC, an increase in the heat release rate (HRR) of 2.89%–26.50% and a rise in peak cylinder pressure of 0.77%–12.99% were observed. The 30P-HOME, 3-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME, and 6-lpmH<sub>2</sub>-HOME emit less smoke in DF-RCCI combustion mode by 13.06%, 4.84%, and 7.26%, respectively at full load condition. When using 30P-HOME the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) decreased by 3.50% at full load condition. At part and full load conditions, the 30P-HOME fuel share reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>X</sub>) emissions by 3.93% and 5.26%, respectively.</p>","author":"Senthamil Selvan Murugan, \nPrakash Ramasamy, \nSundararajan Rajkumar, \nNallusamy Nallusamy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"4ad40e1226b33bd321e4e09ee98dd993fdd6fa4dcafb42c344055f001dd46d54","category":"Environment"}
