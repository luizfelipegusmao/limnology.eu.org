{"title":"Calcium-Based Biochar Loaded with Paenibacillus mucilaginosus Acted as an Eco-Friendly Strategy to Enhance Soil Nutrients and Plant Biomass","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0214/v1","date":1712067498000,"content":"The loose and porous structure and abundant pores of biochar provide conditions for being a suitable fertilizer carrier. Biochar loaded with beneficial microorganisms will greatly promote plant growth and soil improvement. In this work, an environmentally friendly Paenibacillus mucilaginosus loaded biochar-based fertilizer (B@PM) with high nutrient content, good slow-release effect and increased biological activity was prepared. The released mechanism of P-K-Ca from B@PM and the synergistic effect on the soil nutrients and plant growth were also analyzed. The experimental results showed that the release behavior of P, K and Ca from B@PM was diffusive and dissolved, which conforms to the Power function and Parabolic diffusion models, respectively. The potting experiment showed that the root length (30.77%), leaf width (71.67%), and plant height (81.08%) of Chinese cabbage were enhanced after the application of B@PM, and the organic matter, available phosphorus, available potassium, and total calcium in the soil were also substantially enhanced. In addition, the abundance of the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the in the rhizosphere soil was increased, as well as the activities of catalase (82.84%) and alkaline phosphatase (39.64%). The results of RDA analyses showed that B@PM increased the content of the environmental factors, such as OM, URE, EC, TCa, AK, CAT, AP and ALP, thus improving soil quality and plant length.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91eb5d35264ead845c9c0c2ec2e4dc4ce5e0cc354efa20469c2e3f50f0cd70aa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
