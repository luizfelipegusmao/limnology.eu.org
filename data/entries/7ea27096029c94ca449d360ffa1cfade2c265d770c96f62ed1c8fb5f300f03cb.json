Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether diazepam can inhibit inflammation and ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the let-7a-5p/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) axis.</p> Methods <p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce cell pyroptosis in an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. After treatment with diazepam, changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis were observed, and the occurrence of inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis in the mice was detected.</p> Results <p>The results showed that LPS can successfully induce cell pyroptosis and inflammatory responses and cause lung fibrosis in mice. Diazepam inhibits the expression of pyroptosis-related factors and inflammatory factors; moreover, it attenuates the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Mechanistically, diazepam can upregulate the expression of let-7a-5p, inhibit the expression of MYD88, and reduce inflammation and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the let-7a-5p/MYD88 axis.</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings indicated that diazepam can inhibit LPS-induced pyroptosis and inflammatory responses and alleviate pulmonary fibrosis in mice by regulating the let-7a-5p/MYD88 axis.</p>","author":"Duanyi Song","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7ea27096029c94ca449d360ffa1cfade2c265d770c96f62ed1c8fb5f300f03cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
