{"title":"Structural Genetics to Understand Holoenzyme Assembly and Substrate Selection of Diverse Multimeric Serine-threonine Phosphatases","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.354/7720475?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Protein phosphorylation plays key roles in regulating cell cycle progression, growth, death, and survival. Aberrant phosphorylation is involved in the progression of multiple human diseases including heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and many types of cancers. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a family of phosphatases that, along with PP1, accounts for âˆ¼90% of all phosphoserine-threonine phosphatase activity in cells. The broad substrate specificity and function of PP2A is attained through the assembly of diverse heterotrimeric holoenzymes. The PP2A holoenzyme is composed of the core dimer, consisting of the scaffold (A) and catalytic (C) subunit, bound to one of many regulatory (B) subunits that control the substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the holoenzyme. The complex process of holoenzyme assembly is regulated by PP2A-specific proteins that control the folding and activation of the catalytic subunit, formation of the core dimer, and binding of regulatory B subunits. Binding of different B-subunits, thus substrate specificity, is further regulated by a unique post-translational modification (PTM) of carboxymethylation of the C-terminal leucine residue of the catalytic C-subunit. The carboxymethyl group is added by LCMT-1 (leucine carboxyl methyl transferase 1) and removed by PME-1 (PP2A methylesterase 1). Leucine carboxymethylation is a PTM that regulates only the family of phosphatases that, in addition to PP2A, includes protein phosphatases 4 and 6. Moreover, endogenous regulators of PP2A modulate the biogenesis process through inhibition of C subunit catalytic activity and/or binding of regulatory B-subunits. We have used cryo-EM along with genetic, biochemical, and biophysical assays to define the process of PP2A biogenesis and holoenzyme assembly in living cells and in reconstituted systems. Our structures demonstrate differential dependencies of C-tail interactions with diverse regulatory B-subunits. Moreover, we define the structure of PP2A complexes upon genetic removal of two PP2A regulators, PTPA (PP2A phosphatase activator) and PME1. Altogether, our data using purified proteins and complexes isolated from cells provide new insights into events that govern PP2A holoenzyme assembly.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"943de83529c231f9d819e0c6c259249625fc0d7df0a4bfdc32283e419851eed4","category":"Environment"}
