{"title":"Effect of ultrasonic modification on the binding ability of pectin to anthocyanin","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13245?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Pectin was considered as a potential candidate to improve the thermal stability of anthocyanins, and the binding ability of pectin to anthocyanins was influenced by its structure. In this study, sunflower pectins, modified by ultrasound (40 kHz) for different periods of time, were prepared and used to bind with anthocyanins, extracted from purple sweet potato.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Characterization and thermal stability of pectin–anthocyanin complexes were investigated. The ultrasonic modification of pectin resulted in many changes in pectin chemical structure, including degradation of neutral sugar side chains, breakage of methoxyl groups, and increased molecular flexibility. Extension of ultrasonic modification time led to greater changes in pectin chemical structure. Analysis of the binding ability, as determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, revealed that the interaction between pectin and anthocyanins was driven by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction. Pectins with different ultrasonic modification times bound with anthocyanins to different extents, mainly resulting from an increase in the number of hydrogen bonds. According to high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis, during heating at 90 °C the stronger the binding ability of pectin and anthocyanin complex, the better was its thermal stability.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Ultrasonic modification of pectin could effectively enhance its binding ability to anthocyanin. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Yutong Liu, \nYingjia Tong, \nQunyi Tong, \nWentian Xu, \nZeqing Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4280916e77b6e33f9fc90bac1e80e47e36a13004279f10159c1828c482c78f43","category":"Environment"}
