{"title":"76 Effect of 0.79% top-dressed arginine supplementation at different gestation periods and seasons on the colostrum composition and productive performance of sows and piglets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/36/7664966?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of supplementation with 0.79% top-dressed arginine (Arg) at different gestation periods and seasons on the productive performance and colostrum composition of sows. A total of 320 sows were divided into 4 feeding groups (80 sows/group) under 2 different seasons (summer and winter): a control group (CO) fed a standard diet and 3 groups supplemented with 0.79% Arg either for the first 35 d of gestation (TRT35), the last 45 d of gestation (TRT45), or the entire gestation period (TRTCOM). Colostrum was collected at farrowing from 12 sows per group per season. Productive performance and individual piglet body weight (BW) were recorded at birth (d 0), d 6 of age, weaning (d 28) and 14 d post-weaning (d 14p). Data were analyzed using a general linear mixed model including diet, season, their interaction, and parity class as fixed factors. At the end of the gestation, sows from the TRTCOM group had a greater BW (<span>P</span> = 0.003) and average daily gain (ADG; <span>P</span> = 0.009) than the CO group. The diet did not influence the number of total born and total born alive piglets. The stillborn % was less in the TRT35 group than CO and TRTCOM groups (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). The TRTCOM group had a greater crushed % and hypo-vital % than CO group (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Colostral IgG was reduced in the Arg groups compared with the CO group (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) while no differences were found for IgA and IgM between the groups. The BW of pilets at d 0, d 6, d 28 and d 14p and ADGs were not affected by the diet; however, the TRT35 had a reduced % of low-birth BW piglets than CO (<span>P</span> = 0.02). The TRT45 tended to have greater % in low-birth BW piglets than CO (<span>P</span> = 0.051) and greater % in high-birth BW piglets than the other groups (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). The sows having the gestation in summer had decreased BW at the beginning of gestation, a greater final BW and ADG (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001), a lower number of total born (<span>P</span> = 0.003), mummified % but a greater crushed % (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). Piglets BW at birth, d 28 and d 14p was greater in winter. Lactose (<span>P</span> = 0.001) and IgG (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) were greater in the winter. In conclusion, 0.79% of on top-dressed Arg had a negative effect on the productive performance of the sows during the entire gestation period. Conversely, supplementing Arg during the first 35 d of gestation led to a decrease in the percentage of stillborn and low-birth BW piglets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"8e7a5e845d5dab800c5beffe1b1ae631a652e1d03bf9d173a59a57ed5e5af444","category":"Environment"}
