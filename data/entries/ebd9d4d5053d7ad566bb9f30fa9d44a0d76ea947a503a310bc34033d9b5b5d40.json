{"title":"Improving childhood cancer medicines access in developing countries: Towards an implementation framework to inform the Global Platform for Access to Childhood Cancer Medicines for Nigeria","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003275","date":1725631200000,"content":"<p>by Otuto Amarauche Chukwu, Isaac Folorunso Adewole, Avram Denburg, Beverley M. Essue</p>\r\n\r\nChildren and adolescents in developing countries continue to be disproportionately affected by cancer and have significantly lower survival rates (30%) than their counterparts in high-income countries (80%). This disparity is driven by poor access to childhood cancer medicines. The World Health Organization and St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital launched the Global Platform for Access to Childhood Cancer Medicines to provide continuous supply of quality childhood cancer medicines to developing countries. As much movement has not been seen with the platform, this research aimed to develop a stakeholder-informed guidance to support effective implementation of the platform and maximize opportunities to deliver on its intended goals. This study was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Participants were recruited based on the stakeholder categories framework and included policymakers from the Ministry of Health, organizations implementing access to medicines programs in Nigeria, medicines logistics providers, and health professionals and personnel at service delivery points such as oncologists and pharmacists. Data collection involved key informant interviews using a pilot-tested semi-structured interview guide. Data analysis was done by thematic content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria and the Ethics Review Board of University of Toronto. The findings reveal critical insights spanning five domains of the CFIR framework, each contributing uniquely to understanding the multifaceted issues of childhood cancer medicine access with a view to understanding pathways to implementation of the platform. Successfully implementing the platform could entail a partner-driven approach, integration with existing programs to avoid fragmentation, supporting capacity strengthening at the primary care level, and engaging patients and communities. This information was used to suggest a nuanced implementation framework for the platform in Nigeria and similar settings which could be beneficial for improving access for children who desperately need childhood cancer medicines to survive.","author":"Otuto Amarauche Chukwu","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"ebd9d4d5053d7ad566bb9f30fa9d44a0d76ea947a503a310bc34033d9b5b5d40","category":"Environment"}
