{"title":"Flexible Mechanical Sensors Fabricated with Graphene Oxide-Coated Commercial Silk","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1547/v1","date":1716459816000,"content":"Many studies on flexible strain and pressure sensors have been reported due to growing interest in wearable devices for healthcare. However, most are fabricated with multiple ingredients and complicated methods even though commercial textiles, such as cotton, nylon, polyester, and silk were used. Here we present flexible pressure and strain (motion) sensors prepared with only graphene oxide (GO) and commercial silk fabrics and yarns. The pressure sensors were fabricated by simply dipping the silk fabric into GO solution followed by thermal treatment at 400 °C for reduction of GO (rGO). The pressure sensors were made from rGO-coated fabrics, which were stacked in 3-, 5-, and 7-layers. The super-sensitivity of 2.58 ×103 kPa-1 at low pressure was observed in the 7-layer pressure sensor. The strain sensors were obtained from rGO-coated twisted silk yarns whose gauge factor was 0.307. Although this value is small or comparable to other sensors, it is appropriate for motion sensing. The results of this study show a cost-effective and simple method for the fabrication of pressure and motion sensors with commercial silk and GO.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6cb0cfc64bb6ae704bbd2f58937924e0c0e799a7f4cc10111ddf10b815a34314","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
