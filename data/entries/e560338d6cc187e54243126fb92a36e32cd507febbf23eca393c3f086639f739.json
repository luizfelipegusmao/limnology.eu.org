{"title":"Effects of short-term pre-competition weight loss on certain physiological parameters and strength change in elite boxers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304267","date":1716472800000,"content":"<p>by Yavuz Yasul, Faruk Akçınar, Muhammet Enes Yasul, Ahmet Kurtoğlu, Özgür Eken, Georgian Badicu, Luca Paolo Ardigò</p>\r\nBackground <p>Athletes in certain sports aim to gain an advantage by competing in a lower body mass class instead of competing in their own body mass class. This study aims to reveal certain physiologic and strength changes in elite male boxers who lost body mass rapidly before the competition.</p> Methods <p>30 thirty boxers who were aged between 19–24 years and having a mean age of 7.4 years participated in the study. To evaluate the effect of short-term dietary intake interventions on body composition and muscle strength before the competition, boxers were divided into three groups: control (C), exercise+diet1 (E+D1) and exercise+diet2 (E+D2) groups. The dietary habits of the participants were controlled and they participated in the training program. The data of the study consisted of variables such as body mass, height, regional muscle mass, body fat percentage, biceps and femur bicondylar circumference measurements before the competitions. Isometric strength measurements of knee extensors and flexors and shoulder internal and external rotators were also recorded.</p> Results <p>Physiologic parameters such as body mass change, BMI level, body fat percentage and leg muscle ratios of E+D2 were significantly decreased compared to C and E+D1 groups. Furthermore, submaximal and maximal strength production in knee extensors and flexors as well as shoulder internal and external rotators were significantly decreased in E+D2 compared to C and E+D1 groups.</p> Conclusion <p>The tendency to lose body mass quickly in a short of time may give the desired results in terms of BMI, body mass and fat percentage, but it may cause strength losses in boxers during the competition period.</p>","author":"Yavuz Yasul","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e560338d6cc187e54243126fb92a36e32cd507febbf23eca393c3f086639f739","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
