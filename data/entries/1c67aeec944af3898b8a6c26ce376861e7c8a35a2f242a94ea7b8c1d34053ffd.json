{"title":"Relationship between Interlimb Asymmetries and Performance Variables in Adolescent Tennis Players","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0106/v1","date":1717637270000,"content":"Tennis is an individual sport characterised by high intensity action, including sprints and changes of direction (COD). There is a gap in the knowledge of limb asymmetries in adolescent tennis players and their association with performance. This study aimed to examine the relationship between asymmetry in vertical and horizontal jump tests (CMJ and HJ) and COD with lower limb performance variables in adolescent tennis players. Forty-five adolescent tennis players (age: 13.81 ± 1.08 years; height: 167.64 ± 9.9 cm; body mass: 57.48 ± 10.94 kg; body mass index: 20.27 ± 2.18 kg/m2) performed the CMJ test (unilateral and bilateral), horizontal jumps (unilateral and bilateral), 25 m sprint and 180º COD test. The single-leg countermovement jump showed the greatest asymmetries among the different tests (6.62 ± 9.35%). Significant negative relationships were found between CMJ asymmetry and COD asymmetry with unilateral horizontal jump variables (r = -0.30 to -0.53). In addition, CMJ asymmetry showed significant relationships with CMJR (r=0.49) and COD180R (r=0.29), whereas COD asymmetry showed a significant relationship with COD180L (r=0.40). On the other hand, HJ asymmetry showed no significant relationships with any variable. The main findings of this study indicate that greater imbalances in the CMJ and COD tests are associated with a reduced capacity to perform unilateral horizontal jumps. These results suggest the need to incorporate training protocols that reduce interlimb asymmetries in growing athletes to improve their performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1c67aeec944af3898b8a6c26ce376861e7c8a35a2f242a94ea7b8c1d34053ffd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
