{"title":"Traffic jam by GPS: A systematic analysis of the negative social externalities of large-scale navigation technologies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308260","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Eve Schade, Gian-Luca Savino, Yasemin Gunal, Johannes Sch√∂ning</p>\r\n\r\nThe increased usage of navigation technologies has caused conflicts in local traffic management, resulting in congested residential areas among other challenges for residents. This paper uses content analysis to investigate such negative social externalities within local communities and neighbourhoods. Through a corpus of 90 news articles about traffic incidents caused by navigation technologies, we identified negative traffic and safety-related externalities, including congestion, damage, pollution, and accidents. We also report on countermeasures by local communities and governments, including street closures, speed limit reduction, and turn bans. Based on our results, we discuss the implications for designing mobile navigation technologies that reduce negative social externalities.","author":"Eve Schade","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"35a960201f87fc806a1fc8c71e780b50a597fc17861efc9bc9d59b29ec4e678b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
