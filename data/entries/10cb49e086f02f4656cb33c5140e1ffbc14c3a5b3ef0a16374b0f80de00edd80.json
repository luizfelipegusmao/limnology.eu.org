{"title":"Effect of Synthetic Polypeptide &ndash; Bio-Surfactant Composition on the Formation and Stability of Foams","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0185/v1","date":1727945989000,"content":"In recent decades, numerous studies have focused on finding environmentally friendly substitutes for commonly used petrochemicalâ€“based compounds. This paper explores the potential use of poly-L-lysine/rhamnolipids and poly-L-glutamic acid/ethyl lauroyl arginate mixtures, for foam formation and stabilization. Two complementary methods were employed to investigate the synergistic and antagonistic effects of these mixed polyelectrolyte/surfactant systems: (1) the thinning and rupture of thin foam films formed under dynamic conditions were monitored using a dynamic fluid-film interferometer (DFI), and (2) foamability tests were conducted using a standard dynamic foam analyzer (DFA). The results demonstrated that adding polyelectrolyte to an oppositely charged surfactant primarily induces a synergistic effect, enhancing foaming properties and extending foam lifetime. Furthermore, interferometric methods confirmed improved stability and slower drainage of thin foam films in systems containing synthetic polypeptides.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"10cb49e086f02f4656cb33c5140e1ffbc14c3a5b3ef0a16374b0f80de00edd80","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
