{"title":"Improved Subsidence Assessment for a More Reliable Excavation Activity in Tehran","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1737/v1","date":1721686774000,"content":"This paper presents a particular tunneling method or new Austrian tunneling method (NATM) which plays an important role in reducing the subsidence of the Earth surface and the damage to the structures in urban areas. It has a wide range of applications in shallow tunneling projects all over the world. In this study, numerical modeling of third-line Metro tunnel in Tehran is under discussion which is designed and stabilized by NATM. The foregoing tunnel is excavated manually with a one-meter advancing step. In this project, the constructors used a lattice girder and sprayed concrete with 31 cm thickness as the initial lining. A suitable numerical software for this modeling is Plaxis 3D tunnel, which allows performing high-resolution finite element modeling (FEM) of the studied object. The performance of this method is investigated and compared with other NATM methods. As a result of numerical modeling, we give a value of 30.01 mm earth subsidence in the most damaged area of the settlement, in comparing with that of earth surface monitoring, which confirmed it with a dramatically low difference. Moreover, this tunnel was drilled and excavated with various methods, among which the less settlement has obtained by the proposed method. The results are promising to continue the tunneling with this method to expand the subway line in the city.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e5b7d99a217d592bdf110ba9710c8984a27b79aa89ce5bf0faa68a7235b15dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
