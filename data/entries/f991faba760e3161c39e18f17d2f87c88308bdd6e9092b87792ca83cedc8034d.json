{"title":"Hydrogen Yield Enhancement in Biogas Dry Reforming with Ni/Cr Catalyst: A Numerical Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2352/v1","date":1727699816000,"content":"This numerical study investigates the impact of reaction temperature, molar ratio of CH4:CO2, and catalyst porosity (p) on H2 yield and H2 selectivity during biogas dry reforming over a Ni/Cr catalyst. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we conducted detailed simulations to elucidate the underlying reaction characteristics. Our findings reveal that increasing p significantly enhances H2 production and H2 selectivity, while simultaneously reducing CO selectivity. This effect is attributed to the improved mass transfer within the catalyst bed, leading to more efficient reactant conversion and product formation. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between higher reaction temperatures and increased H2 yield and H2 selectivity, confirming the endothermic nature of the reforming process. By optimizing these operational parameters, our results suggest that Ni/Cr catalysts can be effectively employed for the sustainable production of H2 from biogas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f991faba760e3161c39e18f17d2f87c88308bdd6e9092b87792ca83cedc8034d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
