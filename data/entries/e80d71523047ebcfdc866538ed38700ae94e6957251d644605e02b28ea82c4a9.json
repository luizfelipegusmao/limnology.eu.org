{"title":"Like a Stone in a Pond: Chemistry as a Trigger Point for an Ever-Increasing Concentric Knowledge towards Global Citizenship and Sustainability Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1604/v1","date":1716532700000,"content":"The principal function of science education is to introduce students to core scientific concepts and practices; nevertheless, it is now impossible, in such a complex world, to neglect the ethical issues involved. Placing school science in a broader context motivates students and equips them with valuable critical skills. A meaningful example was from palm oil production and pervasive use worldwide: plantations result in major deforestation occurring in species-rich tropical regions, making the palm oil issue global in scope and highly critical for several aspects related to sustainability. This paper reports a sequence of didactic activities starting from palm oil chemistry, gradually extended initially by a multidisciplinary approach, then by interdisciplinary-systemic maps and, ultimately, through a holistic vision - involving anthropological and cultural considerations about indigenous people of deforested territories. This progressive broadening corresponds to an ever-greater penetration into the personal sphere, a condition for a real ethical consciousness. The increased studentsâ€™ awareness was tested by qualitative considerations, supporting the teaching dimension more than the learning one. Contrary to disciplinary contents, the emergence of moral feelings cannot be measured but only perceived. Therefore, chemistry provides key concepts essential for global competences development in order to deal with sustainability issues with an increased ethical awareness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e80d71523047ebcfdc866538ed38700ae94e6957251d644605e02b28ea82c4a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
