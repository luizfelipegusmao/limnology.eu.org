{"title":"FDG Imaging for Assessing Cardiovascular Inflammation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1129/v1","date":1728966370000,"content":"FDG PET has been widely used in oncology studies as well as for cardiovascular diseases. This technique has recently been applied to detect active cardiovascular inflammation, mainly owing to enhanced glucose utilization by the activation of granulocytes and macrophages. To identify active inflammation by FDG PET, physiological uptake in the normal myocardium should be suppressed by appropriate patient preparation. FDG PET has been used to detect active lesions and assess the response to anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. In addition, other active cardiovascular inflammations, such as endocarditis, aortitis, and unstable atherosclerosis may be identified by FDG PET. After cancer treatment, FDG PET is considered an elegant approach not only for the assessment of tumor response to cancer therapy, but also for early detection of possible cardiovascular involvement. This review summarizes the clinical values of FDG PET for the assessment of active cardiovascular inflammation under suitable patient preparation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7c41ad27450f2ed87e07ac965bd4f18075a84b5991539a8d7a78844a0ae279ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
