{"title":"A genome-wide association study identifies genes associated with cuticular wax metabolism in maize","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/2616/7516262?rss=1","date":1704931200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The plant cuticle is essential in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. To systematically elucidate the genetic architecture of maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.) cuticular wax metabolism, 2 cuticular wax–related traits, the chlorophyll extraction rate (CER) and water loss rate (WLR) of 389 maize inbred lines, were investigated and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 1.25 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, 57 nonredundant quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining 5.57% to 15.07% of the phenotypic variation for each QTL were identified. These QTLs contained 183 genes, among which 21 strong candidates were identified based on functional annotations and previous publications. Remarkably, 3 candidate genes that express differentially during cuticle development encode β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS). While ZmKCS19 was known to be involved in cuticle wax metabolism, ZmKCS12 and ZmKCS3 functions were not reported. The association between <span>ZmKCS12</span> and WLR was confirmed by resequencing 106 inbred lines, and the variation of WLR was significant between different haplotypes of <span>ZmKCS12</span>. In this study, the loss-of-function mutant of <span>ZmKCS12</span> exhibited wrinkled leaf morphology, altered wax crystal morphology, and decreased C32 wax monomer levels, causing an increased WLR and sensitivity to drought. These results confirm that ZmKCS12 plays a vital role in maize C32 wax monomer synthesis and is critical for drought tolerance. In sum, through GWAS of 2 cuticular wax–associated traits, this study reveals comprehensively the genetic architecture in maize cuticular wax metabolism and provides a valuable reference for the genetic improvement of stress tolerance in maize.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"984b024b75931edcef1fb9aa72eb2ba4f2810a2cc85fd1f0c6bb5bdbb849156a","category":"Environment"}
