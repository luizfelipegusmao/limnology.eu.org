{"title":"Live and carcass production traits for progeny of an F1 USDA Prime—Yield Grade 1 carcass clone sire compared to progeny of popular beef terminal sires","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae126/7740503?rss=1","date":1724457600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The cloning of beef carcasses that grade United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Prime—yield grade (YG) 1 (P1) has produced a sire that ranked well against high-performing bulls from multiple breeds. An F1 (P1 × P1 - first generation offspring) sire would ideally outperform its high-performing parents. A terminal sire study was conducted comparing progeny of an F1 (P1 × P1) sire (AxG1) against progeny (heifers and steers) of four high-performing sires of varying breeds {P1 (ALPHA); Angus; Simmental; Angus × Simmental}. Production traits included morbidity and mortality frequencies, weaning weight, feedlot arrival weight, and days on feed; carcass traits included frequency of abscessed liver and lung health, quality grade and YG parameters, total carcass value (US$), and carcass value per hundredweight (CWT [45.4 kg]; US$). A completely randomized experimental design was used; data were analyzed using a mixed model with a fixed effect of sire and random effects of harvest date, sex, and pen. AxG1 sired heifers had the highest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) marbling score, the highest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) carcass value per CWT, and numerically had the lowest calculated YG and highest frequency of YG one carcass. Steers sired by AxG1 had the least (<span>P</span> = 0.05) backfat, lowest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) calculated YG, highest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) marbling score, highest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) frequency of USDA Prime carcasses, the greatest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.03) total carcass value, and greatest (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) carcass value per CWT. Collectively, AxG1 steer and heifer carcasses exhibited the least 12th rib fat thickness and lowest USDA YG in addition to the largest longissimus muscle area, highest marbling score, and greatest frequency of USDA Prime. These data suggest that AxG1 performed comparably to other high-performing industry terminal sires in carcass quality and YG outcomes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"7915c5b9287cf4e8a172b8f3f9bae8a18237fb2b81893dd5dc7262b81a86966c","category":"Environment"}
