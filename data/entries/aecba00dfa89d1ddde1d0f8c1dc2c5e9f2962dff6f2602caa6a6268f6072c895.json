{"title":"High-Resolution Monitoring of Deforestation and Carbon Sequestration Using Satellite Data in Costa Rica","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0134/v1","date":1727860359000,"content":"This study aims to assess the impact of deforestation and carbon sequestration within the Gandoca-Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge, Costa Rica, using high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet NICFI and Sentinel-2. The research evaluates the impact of forest degradation on forest health and carbon absorption during two periods in 2024 (January and August). Advanced vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, and SAVI) were applied to assess changes in forest cover and health. Planet NICFI data revealed a 0.41% loss in forest cover, identifying subtle degradation less detectable with Sentinel-2. In terms of carbon sequestration, Sentinel-2 showed a modest increase in CO₂ absorption from 180,231.88 tons to 186,211.33 tons, while Planet NICFI indicated a decrease from 3,984,470.82 tons to 3,820,917.83 tons, suggesting forest degradation. These findings highlight the importance of high-resolution satellite imagery in detecting fine-scale disturbances that lower-resolution data might miss. However, the study’s short timeframe, covering only two periods in 2024, limits long-term trend analysis. The research underscores the need for improved remote sensing technologies and stronger legal frameworks to protect areas like Gandoca-Manzanillo from illegal logging. Despite programs like Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) in Costa Rica, significant challenges remain in protecting biodiversity-rich regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aecba00dfa89d1ddde1d0f8c1dc2c5e9f2962dff6f2602caa6a6268f6072c895","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
