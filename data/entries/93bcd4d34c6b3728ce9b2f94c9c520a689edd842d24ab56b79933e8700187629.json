{"title":"Differential feeding on ornamental plants by Duponchelia fovealis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) larvae","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/3/472/7630509?rss=1","date":1710547200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Duponchelia fovealis</span> (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is a polyphagous pest that feeds on a variety of ornamental and crop plants. At least 47 plant families have been identified as hosts for <span>D. fovealis</span> in literature based on empirical data and observations. This list is surely incomplete based on the broad feeding habits of <span>D. fovealis</span>. We sought to expand the list of known <span>D. fovealis</span> host plants and to identify species that may be less preferred or not fed upon by <span>D. fovealis</span>. We used laboratory feeding assays to measure <span>D. fovealis</span> consumption rate of leaf disks from 32 herbaceous plant species and 32 woody species grown outdoors throughout the Southeastern United States, and 24 tropical species typically grown as house plants. These plants were from 65 genera and 36 families. Between the 3 ornamental plant groups, we tested (herbaceous, woody, and tropical) that, after 24 h, plants in the tropical group were the least consumed by <span>D. fovealis</span>. After 24 h, the average proportion of leaf disks eaten by <span>D. fovealis</span> was 0.80 or higher for 5 herbaceous and 12 woody species. Proportions of leaf disks eaten varied at the family and genus level in many cases. Our research can improve integrated pest management of <span>D. fovealis</span> by informing growers that plants may be at more or less risk of infestation and damage by larvae.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"93bcd4d34c6b3728ce9b2f94c9c520a689edd842d24ab56b79933e8700187629","category":"Environment"}
