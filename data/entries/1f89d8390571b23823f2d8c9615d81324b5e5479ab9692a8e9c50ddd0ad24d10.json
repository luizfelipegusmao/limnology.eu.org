{"title":"Unwanted Skin Reactions to Acrylates â€“ an Update","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1295/v1","date":1718788132000,"content":"Acrylates and methacrylates are widely used, especially in the dental industry, but can cause adverse skin reactions. These compounds, including 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate, are strong contact irritants or allergens. Found in dental prostheses, composite resins, dentin bonding materials, and glass ionomers, they pose a higher risk of exposure for dental personnel. Clinically, acrylate allergies manifest as facial rashes, eczema with cracked skin on fingers (pulpitis), nail dystrophy, and periungual dermatitis. Recently, the highest frequency of allergic reactions to acrylates has shifted from dentistry to the beauty industry due to increased use in artificial nails, eyelashes, and hair extensions. This has led to greater sensitization. Acrylates are also used in medical applications, such as bone cement for orthopedic endoprostheses, soft contact lenses, hearing aids, histological preparations, and wound dressings, which can also cause allergic reactions. Severe dermatitis from surgical glue containing acrylates has been documented, and diabetic medical devices are potential sources of allergic contact dermatitis. Given the extensive use and prolonged skin contact of products containing acrylates and methacrylates, this review aims to present current knowledge and literature on reactions to these compounds across different industries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f89d8390571b23823f2d8c9615d81324b5e5479ab9692a8e9c50ddd0ad24d10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
