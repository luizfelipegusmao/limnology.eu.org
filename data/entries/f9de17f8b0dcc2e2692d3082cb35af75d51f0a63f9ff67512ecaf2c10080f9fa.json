{"title":"Dormancy of a specialist herbivore, Anthonomus rufipennis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in a dry tropical forest","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/4/687/7686198?rss=1","date":1717200000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The life history aspects of dormancy of the weevil <span>Anthonomus rufipennis</span> LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were studied a 57-month period in a seasonally dry tropical forest of central Mexico. Weevil populations and their physiological status were monitored on both the reproductive host tree, <span>Senna polyantha</span> (Collad.) H.S: Irwin &amp; Barneby (Fabales: Fabaceae) and the highly favored refuge host, <span>Tillandsia recurvata</span> L. (Poales: Bromeliaceae) or “ball moss.” During the dry season, weevils were only found on the refuge host with a mean total density of 1.014 ± 2.532 individuals/ball moss (<span>N</span> = 1,681). Weevil densities on <span>T. recurvata</span> between early and late dry seasons were not significantly different, suggesting that dry season survival was relatively high. Weevils collected during these seasons revealed little reproductive development and relatively high-fat accumulation in both sexes. During 5 of 6 yr, densities of the weevils in <span>T. recurvata</span> dropped significantly during the early rainy seasons, when the reproductive host trees leafed out and began producing oviposition sites (flower buds). At this time, more males than females initially moved to vegetative trees and showed significant signs of reproductive development. Recolonization of ball moss by weevils began during the late rainy season when oviposition sites (flower buds) were still available. A proportion of the weevils remained on the reproductive host, suggesting that <span>A. rufipennis</span> is facultatively multivoltine. The methodologies and results of the study can serve as a model system for future studies of the dormancy of other insects in dry tropical forests and provide insight into the dormancy of other anthonomine weevils of economic importance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"f9de17f8b0dcc2e2692d3082cb35af75d51f0a63f9ff67512ecaf2c10080f9fa","category":"Environment"}
