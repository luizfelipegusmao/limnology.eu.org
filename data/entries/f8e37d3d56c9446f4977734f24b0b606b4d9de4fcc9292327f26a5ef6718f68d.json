MXene, a 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides, has emerged as a star material owing to its outstanding metallic conductivity, tunable chemical functionalities, remarkable mechanical properties, and unique surface chemistry [<a href=\"#ozae044.792-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.792-B2\">2</a>]. With surpassing performance compared to traditional metal oxides, MXene is highly promising for energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors [<a href=\"#ozae044.792-B3\">3</a>], as well as flexible electronics and structural components due to its outstanding mechanical strength and flexibility [<a href=\"#ozae044.792-B4\">4</a>]. However, MXene is highly susceptible to oxidation, which results in performance degradation. Although this is a long-standing problem for the stability and performance of MXene, the oxidation mechanism for MXene remains not well studied. To close this knowledge gap, a controlled, real-time observation at nanoscale is required.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f8e37d3d56c9446f4977734f24b0b606b4d9de4fcc9292327f26a5ef6718f68d","category":"Environment"}
