{"title":"Interaction of Sweet Bran inclusion and corn processing method in beef finishing diets","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae023/7613803?rss=1","date":1708732800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The study objective was to determine the effects of corn processing method and Sweet Bran (Cargill, Blair, NE) inclusion in beef finishing diets on performance and carcass characteristics. Four hundred and eighty crossbred yearling steers (363 ± 15 kg) were assigned to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments, consisting of two corn processing methods, steam-flaked corn (SFC) or a high-moisture corn: dry-rolled corn blend (HMC: DRC), and three inclusions of Sweet Bran (0%, 20%, or 40% of diet dry matter). Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS as a generalized block design with pen as the experimental unit and block as a fixed effect. Dry matter intake increased linearly as Sweet Bran increased in the diet, regardless of corn processing method (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). A corn processing × Sweet Bran interaction (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) was observed for feed efficiency (G:F), average daily gain (ADG), and hot carcass weight (HCW).The G:F of steers fed SFC did not change with increasing Sweet Bran concentrations (<span>P </span>= 0.19) and the G:F of SFC-fed steers was 12.4% greater than those fed HMC:DRC without Sweet Bran, but was only 5.3% greater when Sweet Bran was included at 40% (<span>P </span>= 0.04). The ADG of steers increased linearly with increasing concentration of Sweet Bran in both SFC and HMC:DRC-based diets. However, the interaction occurred (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) because ADG increased at a greater rate in HMC:DRC-based diets (1.93 to 2.21 kg/d for 0% and 40% Sweet Bran, respectively) compared to SFC-based diets (2.18 to 2.27 kg/d for 0% and 40% Sweet Bran, respectively;). Accordingly, while the ADG of steers fed SFC was 13% greater than steers fed HMC:DRC without Sweet Bran (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.01), there was no difference in ADG due to corn processing method at 40% Sweet Bran (<span>P</span> = 0.30). In SFC-based diets, HCW tended to increase from 446 to 455 kg as Sweet Bran increased (<span>P</span> = 0.06). In HMC: DRC-based diets, HCW linearly increased from 421 to 449 kg (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01), resulting in similar HCW at 40% Sweet Bran (<span>P</span> = 0.28). These data suggest HMC:DRC-based diets are more competitive with SFC-based diets due to similar gains and more similar feed efficiencies when Sweet Bran is fed.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"a1352dd971ab0741f697fa4c978f7535758413c63ce5380f1d62e67bed107264","category":"Environment"}
