However, a major drawback is that acquiring very high-resolution images leads to negative effects such as radiolysis and knock-on damage [<a href=\"#ozae044.1024-B1\">1</a>]. It has been shown that damage is reduced by sub-sampling the beam positions and decreasing dwell time, speeding up data acquisition at the cost of an increased signal-to-noise ratio [<a href=\"#ozae044.1024-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"83b1a63f4035522a01f08742e046838d35054b85286ef256535ee4fbd9144de8","category":"Environment"}
