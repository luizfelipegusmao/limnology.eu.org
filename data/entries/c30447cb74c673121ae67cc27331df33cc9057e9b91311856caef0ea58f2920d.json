{"title":"Enhanced Mechanical Properties of Ceramic Rod Reinforced TWIP Steel Composites: Fabrication, Microstructural Analysis, and Heat Treatment Optimization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0717/v1","date":1723206446000,"content":"This study explores the development and characterization of ceramic rod reinforced TWIP (Twinning Induced Plasticity) steel matrix composites, fabricated using a lost foam casting process. The incorporation of ceramic rods aims to enhance the mechanical properties of TWIP steel, which is known for its excellent plasticity. Mechanical testing demonstrated a significant improvement in flexural strength and ductility, with the composite exhibiting over double the strength of the unreinforced TWIP steel. Heat treatment at 500Â°C for 60 minutes further enhanced these properties, increasing the composite's flexural strength to 1023 MPa and improving its ductility. The observed improvements are attributed to the synergistic effects of the hard ceramic reinforcement and the ductile matrix, as well as the microstructural modification conferred by heat treatment. These findings suggest that ceramic rod reinforced TWIP steel composites are promising materials for applications requiring a combination of high strength and ductility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c30447cb74c673121ae67cc27331df33cc9057e9b91311856caef0ea58f2920d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
