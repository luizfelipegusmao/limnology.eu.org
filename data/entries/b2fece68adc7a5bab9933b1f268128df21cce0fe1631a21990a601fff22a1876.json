{"title":"Populus trichocarpa EXPA6 Increases Salt Sensitivity by Facilitating Radial and Longitudinal Transport of Sodium Ions in Poplars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0833/v1","date":1723467129000,"content":"Expansins are cell wall (CW) proteins that mediate the CW loosening and regulate salt tolerance in a positive or negative way. The transcription of Populus trichocarpa expansin A6 (PtEXPA6) was downregulated upon prolonged duration of salt stress (48 h) after a transient increase induced by NaCl (100 mM). The role of PtEXPA6 in salt tolerance was determined by transferring the PtEXPA6 gene into the hybrid species Populus alba × P. tremula var. glandulosa clone 84K (84K) and Populus tremula × P. alba INRA '717-1B4' (717-1B4). The PtEXPA6-transgenic poplars of 84K and 717-1B4 showed a greater reduction in photosynthesis, stem height and diameter growth under salt stress and a reduced capacity for ROS scavenging by antioxidant enzymes, which is associated with excessive Na+ accumulation in roots and shoots. NMT flux recordings showed that the radial translocation of Na+ salt into the root xylem and real-time Na+ translocation from roots to leaves were greater in PtEXPA6-transgenic poplars than in wild-type poplars. Analysis of comparative contractility and comparative extensibility of intact root tips indicated that PtEXPA6 increased the CW loosening in the transgenic poplars of 84K and 717-1B4. Noteworthy, the PtEXPA6-promoted CW loosening was shown to facilitate radial and longitudinal transport of Na+ in transgenic poplars. We conclude that overexpression of PtEXPA6 leads to CW loosening that facilitates radial translocation of Na+ into the root xylem and subsequent Na+ translocation from roots to leaves, resulting in excessive Na+ accumulation and consequently reduced salt tolerance in transgenic poplars.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b2fece68adc7a5bab9933b1f268128df21cce0fe1631a21990a601fff22a1876","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
