{"title":"Transforming African Healthcare with AI: Paving the Way for Improved Health Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1610/v1","date":1711552048000,"content":"The healthcare situation in Africa is characterized by limited resources and a high burden of disease, presenting significant challenges to the healthcare systems in the region. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in African healthcare holds immense potential for addressing these challenges and improving health outcomes. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current healthcare landscape in Africa and the urgent need for AI-driven solutions.In addition to discussing the potential applications of AI in African healthcare, such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical imaging analysis, this manuscript seeks to shed light on the specific challenges hindering the implementation of AI in the region. By providing detailed examples and case studies, we aim to offer insights into the obstacles that need to be overcome and potential solutions that can be pursued.By leveraging AI technologies, Africa has the opportunity to revolutionize its health systems, bridging the gap in access to quality healthcare across the continent. The objective of this review article is to not only highlight the potential benefits that AI can bring to African healthcare but also to emphasize the urgent need for action and collaboration in implementing and scaling up AI innovations in the region. By doing so, African countries can pave the way for improved health outcomes and ensure that their populations receive the healthcare services they deserve.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6db669b475fce6fa0f319616a8494fb01efcaf4d18e466daaf65ce5efd88c775","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
