{"title":"Polysaccharide-Based Bioplastics: Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Solutions for Packaging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1552/v1","date":1726803999000,"content":"Over the past few decades, synthetic petroleum-based packaging materials have increased, and the production of plastics has surpassed all other man-made materials due to their versatility. However, the excessive usage of synthetic packaging materials has led to severe environmental and health-related issues due to their nonbiodegradability and their accumulation in the environment. Therefore, biobased packages are considered alternatives to substitute synthetic petroleum-based packaging material. Furthermore, the choice of packing material in the food industry is a perplexing process as it depends on various factors, such as the type of food product, its sustainability, and environmental conditions. Interestingly, due to proven mechanical, gas and water vapor barrier properties and biological activity, polysaccharide-based bioplastics show the potential to expand the trends in food packaging, including edible films or coatings and intelligent and active food packaging. This review discusses the structure, properties and recent developments in polysaccharide-based bioplastics as green and sustainable food packaging materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51c300bd2bbfd3b8aa806ca888848966c24fbe4b46a92323f08f614ee933ed84","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
