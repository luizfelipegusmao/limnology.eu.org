{"title":"Modification of gel properties of Meretrix meretrix (clam) with polysaccharides: physical characterization and interaction mechanism","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13937?af=R","date":1728041144000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This study investigated the contribution of 11 polysaccharides (2%, <i>w/w</i>), including pectin (PC), <i>κ</i>-carrageenan (KC), <i>ι</i>-carrageenan (IC), gellan gum (GG), guar gum (GM), sodium alginate (SA), konjac gum (KG), gum arabic (GA), fucoidan (FC), locust bean gum (LBG), and curdlan (CD), to the gel and microstructural properties of <i>Meretrix meretrix</i> clam gel (MMG).</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The hardness, springiness and chewiness of MMG with KC, IC, GG, SA and FC addition increased by ~10%–250%, while PC, GM, KG and LBG groups decreased by ~0.6% to 69%. KC, IC, SA, GG and FC decreased the cooking loss rate (CLR) by 69.4% to 88.7% and correspondingly enhanced the water holding capacity (WHC) by 10.2% to 21.4%, which was accompanied by an increased bound water and immobilized water area and high hydrogen proton density. The addition of KC transformed the MMG microstructure from a loose network with large pores to a compact, dense network, reducing lacunarity by 57.9%. The primary intermolecular forces in MMG with the incorporation of KC, IC, GG, SA and FC were hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds, which increased by 32.8%-105.3% and 45.6%-114.5% than MMG alone, respectively.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Collectively, KC, IC, GG, SA and FC could improve the gel properties of MMG and the strongest synergistic combination was found in the MMG/KC system. This study suggests that the incorporation of polysaccharides is a strategy with potential for modifying the gel properties of shellfish surimi products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jia‐Cheng Liu, \nLin‐Da Zhang, \nYue Liu, \nTian‐Qi Zhou, \nBin Lai, \nCe Wang, \nJia‐Nan Yan, \nHai‐Tao Wu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5e7770cf8b5616db1dba0a3f7fce97227672e7db2ff6d944772d40340b79044a","category":"Environment"}
