{"title":"Synergistic enhancement of maize crop yield and nutrient assimilation via zinc oxide nanoparticles and phosphorus fertilization","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13500?af=R","date":1720851246000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Low recovery of conventional fertilizers remains a significant bottleneck for maize production globally. In particular, with phosphate fertilization, zinc (Zn) is prone to precipitation in soil, reducing recovery of both phosphorus (P) and Zn by maize.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The present study was designed to investigate the synergistic effect of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) and P on maize crop growth, yield, and nutrient uptake under ZnO seed coating and foliar application in a randomized complete block design. However, plants were subjected to two ZnO NPs levels (0.5 and 12 kg ha<sup>−1</sup>) amended with two P levels (45 and 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup>). ZnO NPs, especially in the form of foliar application, with a P dose of 90 Kg ha<sup>−1</sup> significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) improved maize crop growth, yield, and nutrient uptake compared with control. In comparison with the control group, plants grown in these conditions absorbed higher levels of Zn and P. Zn uptake rose to 16.34 g ha<sup>−1</sup>, 137.88 g ha<sup>−1</sup>, and 166.89 g ha<sup>−1</sup> in roots, grains, and stover respectively, and P uptake increased to 0.80 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, 10.066 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, and 12.17 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> respectively. Additionally, seed emergence rate, plant height, and cob length increased by up to 2%, 1177 cm<sup>2</sup>, and 3.3 cm respectively compared with control. Furthermore, Zn use efficiency was increased up to 38.55% in ZnO NPs foliar application.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>\n<p>Application of ZnO NPs at 0.5 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> in the form of foliar application with 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> P dose produced a more pronounced increment in the parameters studied than ZnO NPs seed coating did. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Ibrar Ahmad, \nWiqar Ahmad, \nJaya Nepal, \nMuhammad Bilawal Junaid, \nNajat A Bukhari, \nMuhammad Usman, \nNoman Ahmad, \nRab Nawaz Khan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"4d2373ad689b78e1489ff8e24751abea37b828a75995e6e1a7d5cacbdbf8df34","category":"Environment"}
