In this paper we examine multiple discrete emotions people experience in reaction to climate change, and assess the strength of these emotions as predictors of support for different types of mitigation and adaptation policies. Using multi-wave, cross-sectional, nationally representative samples of American adults, we test whether guilt, anger, hope, fear, and sadness are uniquely associated with support for different types of climate policies. Guilt is most strongly related to support for personally costly policies, hope to support for proactive policies, and fear to support for regulatory policies. This research suggests that communicators should consider how their climate campaignâ€™s emotional tone aligns with their policy goals.","author":"Teresa A.
