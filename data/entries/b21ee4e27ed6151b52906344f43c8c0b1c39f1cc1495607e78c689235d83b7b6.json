{"title":"Curated Polyoxometalate Formula Dataset","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2238/v1","date":1725267419000,"content":"Reticular and cluster materials often feature complex formulas, making a comprehensive overview challenging due to the need to consult various resources. While datasets have been collected for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and zeolites, among others, there remains a gap in systematically organized information for polyoxometalates. This paper introduces a carefully curated dataset of 1984 polyoxometalate (POM) and related cluster metal oxide formula instances, currently connecting over 2,500 POM material instances. These POM instances incorporate 75 different chemical elements, with compositions ranging from binary to octonary element clusters. This dataset not only enhances accessibility to polyoxometalate data but also aims to facilitate further research and development in the study of these complex inorganic compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b21ee4e27ed6151b52906344f43c8c0b1c39f1cc1495607e78c689235d83b7b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
