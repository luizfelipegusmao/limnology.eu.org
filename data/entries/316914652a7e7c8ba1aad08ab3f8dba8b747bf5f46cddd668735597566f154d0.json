Modelling animal network data in R using STRAND. <i>Journal of Animal Ecology</i>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14021\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14021</a>. One of the most important insights in ecology over the past decade has been that the social connections among animals affect a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes. However, despite over 20 years of study effort on this topic, generating knowledge from data on social associations and interactions remains fraught with problems. Redhead et al. present an R package—STRAND—that extends the current animal social network analysis toolbox in two ways. First, they provide a simple R interfaces to implement generative network models, which are an alternative to regression approaches that draw inference by simulating the data-generating process. Second, they implement these models in a Bayesian framework, allowing uncertainty in the observation process to be carried through to hypothesis testing. STRAND therefore fills an important gap for hypothesis testing using network data. However, major challenges remain, and while STRAND represents an important advance, generating robust results continues to require careful study design, considerations in terms of statistical methods and a plurality of approaches.</p>","author":"Damien R.
