{"title":"Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury","link":"https://academic.oup.com/eep/article/doi/10.1093/eep/dvad002/6988930?rss=1","date":1673913600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Human epidemiological studies reveal that dietary and environmental alterations influence the health of the offspring and that the effect is not limited to the F1 or F2 generations. Non-Mendelian transgenerational inheritance of traits in response to environmental stimuli has been confirmed in non-mammalian organisms including plants and worms and are shown to be epigenetically mediated. However, transgenerational inheritance beyond the F2 generation remains controversial in mammals. Our lab previously discovered that the treatment of rodents (rats and mice) with folic acid significantly enhances the regeneration of injured axons following spinal cord injury <span>in vivo</span> and <span>in vitro</span>, and the effect is mediated by DNA methylation. The potential heritability of DNA methylation prompted us to investigate the following question: Is the enhanced axonal regeneration phenotype inherited transgenerationally without exposure to folic acid supplementation in the intervening generations? In the present review, we condense our findings showing that a beneficial trait (i.e., enhanced axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury) and accompanying molecular alterations (i.e., DNA methylation), triggered by an environmental exposure (i.e., folic acid supplementation) to F0 animals only, are inherited transgenerationally and beyond the F3 generation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Epigenetics Current Issue","siteHash":"5549213f473d96cee0cf7ca1db1da1a69239cc267977bfd813fd34781f2cddbb","entryHash":"e9587b02b6d10ffcdb55a4d9b5d5101540a4ffc3772a239fe5e0106fabc3d502","category":"Environment"}
