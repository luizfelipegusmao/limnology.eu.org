{"title":"In Silico Development of SARS-CoV-2 Non-covalent Mpro Inhibitors: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0073/v1","date":1725263484000,"content":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have recently emerged as significant causes of respiratory disease outbreaks. The novel coronavirus pneumonia of 2019, known as COVID-19, are highly infectious and triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding virus-host interactions and molecular targets in host cell death signalling is crucial for treatment development. Small natural compounds like celastrol and curcumin, acting as proteasome inhibitors, can potentially modify NF-ÎºB signalling for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. Various natural constituents, including alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, diarylheptanoids, and anthraquinones, inhibit viral infection, progression, and amplification of coronaviruses. Derived from medicinal herbs, these compounds possess anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, impacting the viral life cycle, including entry, replication, assembly, and release of COVID-19 virions. This review focuses on the development of small molecules of non-covalent inhibitors targeting the Main Protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the design using molecular dynamics (MD) studies and computational methods for further improvements in Mpro inhibitor design. The in-silico approach, which is pivotal in this process, provides an accelerated virtual avenue for exploring and developing potential inhibitors, representing the latest advancements in drug design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8114568660c2a2316656699c037c6672dd4c209eb05b5ef09ffbab23b67bed65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
