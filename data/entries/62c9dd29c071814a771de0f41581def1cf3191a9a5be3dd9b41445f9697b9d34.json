{"title":"Investigation on Full-Scale Crash for Reinforced Divided Central Median W-Beam Barriers with Post-Densification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1676/v1","date":1719302470000,"content":"In this study, the team employed full-scale crash tests to investigate the impact of post-densification technology on the safety performance of separated central median W-beam barriers under low compaction conditions. By precisely simulating the design and construction environment of the central median, the study comprehensively evaluated the barrier's containment, redirection, buffering, and anti-intrusion performances, as well as the deformation of both the barrier and vehicles under various collision scenarios. The results indicate that under low compaction soil conditions, the A-level separated central median barriers reinforced with post-densification technology effectively meet the specified protection requirements. By comparing the influence of soil strength variations on barrier performance under simulated rainfall conditions, it was confirmed that enhancing soil compaction significantly improves soil stability, effectively increases the overall strength and stability of the barriers, reduces deformation, and significantly enhances safety performance. This study not only validates the effectiveness of the reinforcement scheme but also provides new perspectives for the scientific research of safety barriers and offers crucial technical support for the optimal design of road safety protection facilities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62c9dd29c071814a771de0f41581def1cf3191a9a5be3dd9b41445f9697b9d34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
