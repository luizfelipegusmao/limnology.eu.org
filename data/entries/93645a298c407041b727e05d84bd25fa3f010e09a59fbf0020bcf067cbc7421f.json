{"title":"High-throughput field phenotyping reveals that selection in breeding has affected the phenology and temperature response of wheat in the stem elongation phase","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/7/2084/7491230?rss=1","date":1703203200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Crop growth and phenology are driven by seasonal changes in environmental variables, with temperature as one important factor. However, knowledge about genotype-specific temperature response and its influence on phenology is limited. Such information is fundamental to improve crop models and adapt selection strategies. We measured the increase in height of 352 European winter wheat varieties in 4 years to quantify phenology, and fitted an asymptotic temperature response model. The model used hourly fluctuations in temperature to parameterize the base temperature (<span>T</span><sub>min</sub>), the temperature optimum (<span>r</span><sub>max</sub>), and the steepness (lrc) of growth responses. Our results show that higher <span>T</span><sub>min</sub> and lrc relate to an earlier start and end of stem elongation. A higher <span>r</span><sub>max</sub> relates to an increased final height. Both final height and <span>r</span><sub>max</sub> decreased for varieties originating from the continental east of Europe towards the maritime west. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) indicated a quantitative inheritance and a large degree of independence among loci. Nevertheless, genomic prediction accuracies (GBLUPs) for <span>T</span><sub>min</sub> and lrc were low (<span>r</span>≤0.32) compared with other traits (<span>r</span>≥0.59). As well as known, major genes related to vernalization, photoperiod, or dwarfing, the GWAS indicated additional, as yet unknown loci that dominate the temperature response.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"93645a298c407041b727e05d84bd25fa3f010e09a59fbf0020bcf067cbc7421f","category":"Environment"}
