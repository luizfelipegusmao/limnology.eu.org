{"title":"Working conditions for burns junior doctors – Better now than ever?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1468/v1","date":1721278203000,"content":"Background: The work and life of a junior doctor has changed dramatically over the past 50 years. Descriptions of historic working conditions are usually anecdotal and tinted with nostalgia. But presented with the facts, do heath care professionals feel working conditions things have improved or declined in the last 50 years?\n\nMethods: An interview was conducted with a retired surgeon who, in 1970, worked as a house surgeon (Foundation Year 2, FY2 equivalent) at a regional burns service. This was compared with a review of available literature to assess objectively working conditions in that period.  The information generated from this produced a poster summarizing the key differences over a 53-year timeframe. This information was presented to the current medical work force and a survey was conducted to determine their preference. Statistical analysis including binary logistic regression was performed. \n\nResults:  The questionnaire was completed by 76 respondent healthcare workers of mixed grades and backgrounds. The majority of respondents (64%) would choose to work in today’s burns unit. The age of the respondent was the best predictor for preference of working conditions (p = 0.043).\n\nConclusions: Multiple changes in the working conditions were identified. The majority of respondents consider today’s working conditions to be better than that of the past. However, more senior clinicians were more likely to prefer the conditions of 1970 to present day, suggesting a generational shift in opinion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f7d48e88d0fe521eb983522816bc471bd32a1c88e72f003bb0abed8044d4f0ab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
