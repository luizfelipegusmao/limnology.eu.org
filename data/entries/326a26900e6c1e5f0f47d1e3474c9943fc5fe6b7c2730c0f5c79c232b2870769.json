However, ensuring availability in adequate amount of foods rich in VA remains a challenge, mainly in low-income counties including Ethiopia. In addition, children from the poorest and less educated families of same country have disproportionately limited consumptions of foods rich in VA. Therefore, the present study aimed assessing the wealth related inequality in vitamin A consumption (VAC) and decompose it to the various contributing factors.</p> Methods <p>This study was conducted using the 2019 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data on a weighted sample of 1,497 children of age 6–23 months in Ethiopia. The wealth related inequality in VAC was quantified using concentration index and plotted using concentration curve. The Wagstaff decomposition analysis was performed to assess the relative contributions of each explanatory variable to the inequalities in the overall concentration index of VAC.</p> Result <p>The overall Wagstaff normalized concentration index (C) analyses of the wealth-related inequality in consumption of foods rich in VA among children aged 6–23 months was [C = 0.25; 95% C: 0.15, 0.35]. Further decomposition of the C by the explanatory variables reported the following contributions; primary level of women’s education (7.2%), secondary and above (17.8%), having ANC visit during pregnancy (62.1%), delivery at a health institution (26.53%), living in the metropolis (13.7%), central region (34.2%), child age 18–23 months (4.7%) contributed to the observed wealth related inequality in the consumption of foods rich in vitamin A in Ethiopia.</p> Conclusion <p>We found pro-rich wealth-related inequality in VAC among children of age 6–23 months in Ethiopia. Additionally, maternal education, region, ANC visit, and place of delivery were the significant contributors of wealth-related inequality of VAC. Nutritional related interventions should prioritise children from poorer households and less educated mothers. Moreover, enhancing access to ANC and health facilities delivery services through education, advocacy, and campaign programs is highly recommended in the study setting.</p>","author":"Mehari Woldemariam Merid","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"326a26900e6c1e5f0f47d1e3474c9943fc5fe6b7c2730c0f5c79c232b2870769","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
