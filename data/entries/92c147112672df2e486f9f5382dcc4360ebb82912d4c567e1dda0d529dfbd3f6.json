{"title":"Potato protein hydrolysate inhibits RANKL‐induced osteoclast development by inhibiting osteoclastogenic genes via the NF‐κB/MAPKs signaling pathways","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24251?af=R","date":1712924441000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In recent times, there has been growing attention towards exploring the nutritional and functional aspects of potato protein, along with its diverse applications. In the present study, we examined the anti-osteoclast properties of potato protein hydrolysate (PP902) in vitro. Murine macrophages (RAW264.7) were differentiated into osteoclasts by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), and PP902 was examined for its inhibitory effect. Initially, treatment with PP902 was found to significantly prevent RANKL-induced morphological changes in macrophage cells, as determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining analysis. This notion was further supported by F-actin analysis using a confocal microscope. Furthermore, PP902 treatment effectively and dose-dependently down-regulated the expression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenic marker genes, including <i>TRAP</i>, <i>CTR</i>, <i>RANK</i>, <i>NFATc1</i>, <i>OC-STAMP</i>, and <i>c-Fos</i>. These inhibitory effects were associated with suppressing NF-κB transcriptional activation and subsequent reduced nuclear translocation. The decrease in NF-κB activity resulted from reduced activation of its upstream kinases, including I-κBα and IKKα. Moreover, PP902 significantly inhibited RANKL-induced p38MAPK and ERK1/2 activities. Nevertheless, PP902 treatment prevents RANKL-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species generation via increased HO-1 activity. The combined antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of PP902 resulted in significant suppression of osteoclastogenesis, suggesting its potential as an adjuvant therapy for osteoclast-related diseases.</p>","author":"Yi‐Ju Chen, \nYen‐Hua He, \nYun‐Hsin Lo, \nHong‐Siang Yang, \nMosleh Mohammad Abomughaid, \nK.
