In scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the available range of operating temperatures has typically been confined to a range from about 100 K to 1500 K, and only a small subset of available tools enable significant cooling and heating in the same experimental session [<a href=\"#ozae044.677-B1\">1</a>]. Efforts to cool below 100 K have been hampered by the availability of instrumentation suited to the task, and the applications have been limited to a relatively small set of so-called “hero experiments” where achieving a certain temperature sample was among the central challenges of the experiment [<a href=\"#ozae044.677-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7f3f9d4ec94f34e2771fa1897f61be6dbf90df64239f1ec06a08101bc3a5601d","category":"Environment"}
