{"title":"Sustainable aquaculture over the last 30 years: An analysis of the scientific literature by the Text Mining approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12950?af=R","date":1725943559000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A literature search approach (using Scopus®, Elsevier© database) was established to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1960 and 2023 dealing with ‘sustainable aquaculture’ and focusing on specific aquaculture practices (aquaponics, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, biofloc and recirculating aquaculture systems). Text Mining combined with Topic Analysis was utilized to extract information from the text data of the papers identified. After an appropriate screening procedure, 1111 articles were selected. The analysis showed a gradual increase in sustainable aquaculture publications over time, peaking at more than 200 publications in 2023. The first articles on biofloc, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture and recirculating aquaculture systems as alternative aquaculture practices began to appear in 2010, while studies in aquaponics have only been published since 2015. Most publications (40%) came from Asia, in line with the leadership of this continent in aquaculture. European also showed considerable interest in sustainable aquaculture practices, with Italy (leader in publications), Portugal and Germany researchers contributing with 111 papers on the subject in the past 30 years. This study identified the main research topics on the subject and observed how these have evolved. The papers analysed dealt mainly with optimization of aquatic life, genetic in aquaculture and disease management. The topic of protein replacement in feed was also important, with the term ‘diet’ the most frequently utilized in papers. The subjects identified could serve as valuable primary data source, offering opportunities for deeper examination, such as systematic reviews on research topics or geographic regions.</p>","author":"Isabella Tucciarone, \nGiulia Secci, \nBarbara Contiero, \nGiuliana Parisi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"42f4b1dd9a7c76285936fa6b0619c610145b9fbd69e98be31f66be054872e185","category":"Environment"}
