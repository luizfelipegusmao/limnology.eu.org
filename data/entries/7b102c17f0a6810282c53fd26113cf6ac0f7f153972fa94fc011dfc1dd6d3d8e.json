{"title":"A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Lung Cancer Prediction: From Traditional Algorithms to Deep Learning Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1742/v1","date":1716808728000,"content":"Driven by the importance of early detection for improving patient outcomes, this study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting lung cancer based on clinical data. Lung cancer remains a significant global health concern, and this research seeks to contribute to advancements in early diagnosis through the application of machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 385 training and 97 test samples, with a k-fold cross-validation approach (k=5) utilized to mitigate overfitting. Additionally, the ADASYN oversampling technique is employed to address class imbalance. Our analysis includes traditional algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, as well as ensemble methods like XGBoost, LGBM, and AdaBoost. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of deep learning models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Results demonstrate promising accuracy rates across all models, with some outperforming others in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings reveal that LGBM achieves the highest accuracy among all models, with an accuracy rate of 96.91%. It also exhibits superior performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly in classifying both positive and negative instances of lung cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b102c17f0a6810282c53fd26113cf6ac0f7f153972fa94fc011dfc1dd6d3d8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
