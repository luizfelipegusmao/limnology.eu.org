{"title":"Electron Tomography as a Tool to Study SARS-CoV-2 Morphology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0235/v1","date":1728263379000,"content":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel betacoronavirus, is the causative agent of COVID-19, which has caused economic and social disruption worldwide. To date, many drugs and vaccines have been developed for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and have effectively controlled the global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 is highly mutable, leading to the emergence of new variants that may counteract current therapeutic measures. Electron microscopy (EM) is a valuable technique for obtaining ultrastructural information about the intracellular process of virus replication. In particular, EM allows us to visualize the morphological and subcellular changes during virion formation, which would provide a promising avenue for the development of antiviral agents effective against new SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this review article, we present our recent findings using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with electron tomography (ET) to demonstrate the morphologically distinct types of SARS-CoV-2 particles and the application of EM analysis to evaluate genetically engineered viruses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"937a6cc330ff23880385d08fa7a1b8efca6deb2df5ee00b2b62942bd46b4a407","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
