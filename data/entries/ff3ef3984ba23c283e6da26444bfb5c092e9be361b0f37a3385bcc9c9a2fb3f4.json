{"title":"Use of Detached Leaf Inoculation Method for the Early Selection of Coffea arabica L. for Resistance to Hemileia vastatrix Berk &amp; Broome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0086/v1","date":1714644256000,"content":"The development and evaluation of techniques that increase the efficiency of selection for planta plant resistance to pathogens is a challenge in all breeding programmes for disease resistance. Under field and laboratory conditions, hybrid populations (F1) of Coffea arabica derived from sources that carry the rust resistance gene SH1 and the CX.2385 line obtained from the Caturra variety Ã— Timor Hybrid CIFC-1343 were evaluated. By means of survival curves, under controlled conditions, the probable times (P&amp;lt;0.05) for the development of symptoms associated with coffee rust were found to be highly variable. Similarly, phenotypic variation in resistance reactions was detected, and plants with incomplete resistance to rust, late development of the incubation period (PI), and no development of a latency period (PL) were identified. The results suggest the use of the detached leaf method as an alternative for the preselection of genotypes for resistance to coffee rust, which could reduce the number of plants used for field evaluations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff3ef3984ba23c283e6da26444bfb5c092e9be361b0f37a3385bcc9c9a2fb3f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
