{"title":"A Study on the Role of Leaders in Achieving Sustainable Competitiveness and Sustainability During Change","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0634/v1","date":1728464449000,"content":"Effective change management, corporate sustainability, and employee resilience are crucial factors influencing organizational success. This study explores how demographic factors impact these dimensions, specifically focusing on the role of leaders during change, sustainability, sustainable competitiveness, and employee resilience within a diverse workforce. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and regression, were performed to examine the associations between demographic factors (gender, age, salary range, sector, job position, and total job experience) and the measured scales. The study found significant variations in employee perceptions of sustainable competitiveness based on gender and sector, with males and employees in the education sector reporting higher scores. Age and salary range significantly affected employee resilience, with younger employees and those in lower salary brackets showing higher resilience scores. The findings highlight the importance of considering demographic factors in assessing organizational performance, sustainability, and employee resilience. Gender and sector differences suggest targeted strategies may be necessary to address specific perceptions and experiences. Additionally, younger employees and those with lower salaries demonstrate higher resilience, which could inform organizational support programs. These insights can guide future research and organizational practices aimed at enhancing employee and organizational outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbb65c7a0d28321dd213f74b0f1736ff1b5a873638eb1aa5c7f1431dabde30d4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
