{"title":"Motivations for and experiences of childbirth abroad amongst Nigerian women: A qualitative study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003737","date":1726236000000,"content":"<p>by Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas, Olayinka Lewis, Adeola Duduyemi, Olakunmi Ogunyemi, Teeroumanee Nadan</p>\r\n\r\nBirth tourism, the practice of a woman travelling out of her country of residence to another country to give birth, is common globally. Despite this, there is limited literature on the motivations and experiences of women who gave birth abroad. This study aims to address this gap by seeking to understand the motivations for and experiences of childbirth abroad among Nigerian women. Using purposive and snowball sampling, 27 Nigerian women who had children abroad were recruited via social media platforms. In-depth interviews were conducted remotely, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically. Braun and Clarke’s six-step thematic analysis was used, which included data familiarisation, code generation, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining themes, and producing the report. We found that motivations for seeking childbirth abroad varied based on the mother’s desires for their children, needs, and circumstances. These motivations were formed at different times before and after pregnancy and evolved over time. The experience of childbirth abroad is mostly good. However, there are also bad experiences, with some women feeling like they were treated differently because they were <i>“self-paying”</i> patients, <i>“black”</i>, or not country residents. The cost of care is deemed exorbitant, but most pay their bills. Support of loved ones around childbirth abroad was considered crucial, although not always available. Through it all, realising the expected and collateral benefits of childbirth abroad made it all worth it. In conclusion, motivation for childbirth abroad varies and evolves. While globalisation, broken health systems, and ongoing sustained economic challenges in Nigeria and similar settings continue to motivate women to seek childbirth abroad, their experiences of childbirth abroad suggest that though it might be greener on the other side, it is not necessarily dark green. Systems are needed to elevate their voices in the public discourse and safeguard them from bad experiences of childbirth abroad.","author":"Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"fe4e15a60681f8363b0ea449cb835b35ac194312a55888d5dac0aa26958928c4","category":"Environment"}
