{"title":"Caring is not always sharing: A scoping review exploring how COVID-19 containment measures have impacted unpaid care work and mental health among women and men in Europe","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308381","date":1725026400000,"content":"<p>by Hande Gencer, Regina Brunnett, Tobias Staiger, Hürrem Tezcan-Güntekin, Kathleen Pöge</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Unpaid care work is mainly performed by women, whose mental health is more affected by caregiving burden and work-family conflict compared to men. COVID-19 containment measures may have exacerbated existing gender inequalities in both unpaid care work and adverse mental health outcomes. This scoping review provides an overview of recent evidence on the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on unpaid care work and mental health for subgroups of caregivers at the intersection of gender and other social differences (e.g., ethnicity, age, class) in Europe.</p> Methods and analysis <p>Our study was informed and guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework. We searched six academic databases (Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, CINAHL, Social Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, ASSIA) and hand-searched the reference lists of selected articles to identify relevant peer-reviewed research articles published between 1 March 2020 and 7 September 2022. In addition, we conducted a grey literature search using Google Scholar and a targeted hand search on known international and European websites. We included studies that reported gender-disaggregated results on unpaid care work and mental health in the context of COVID-19 containment measures in Europe. Two reviewers independently screened all abstracts and full texts for eligibility and extracted the relevant data. The results were synthesised narratively.</p> Results and discussion <p>Our results suggest a greater gender gap in unpaid care work division and, to a lesser extent, in mental health, which is unfavourable towards women and mothers. Despite this, we see a break in the traditional division of childcare, with fathers taking on a greater role in family work, which makes us optimistic about the division of care work in the post-COVID-19 era. This research also shows that among European women, population groups often understudied, such as women who are single parents, disabled or of colour, have the highest increase in unpaid care work and greatest deterioration in wellbeing.</p>","author":"Hande Gencer","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b3c7c2318d7be748669e44acd20649b6f7e759cf009441b180b419d75e84535c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
