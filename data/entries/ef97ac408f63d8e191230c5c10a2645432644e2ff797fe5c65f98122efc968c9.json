{"title":"Rotational mobility of TEMPO spin probe in polypropylene: EPR spectra simulation and calculation via approximated formulas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1658/v1","date":1721635255000,"content":"The rotational correlation times of a small compact spin probe (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl in isotactic polypropylene were obtained over a wide temperature range by EPR spectra simulation taking into account anisotropic rotation as well as distribution of probe molecules by rotational mobility. The averaged values of rotational correlation times were compared with the corresponding values calculated using well-known approximated formulas based on the intensities and widths of the spectral lines. It was shown that the calculated values can be used as effective parameters to characterize rotational mobility of the spin probe in the polymer matrix in a wide range of rotational correlation times.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ef97ac408f63d8e191230c5c10a2645432644e2ff797fe5c65f98122efc968c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
