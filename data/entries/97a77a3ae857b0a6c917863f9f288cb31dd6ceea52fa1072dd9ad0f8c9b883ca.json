{"title":"Major Imaging Challenges in Microscopy and How to Solve Them","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mt/article/32/3/22/7687037?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Imaging artifacts often hinder the accuracy of microscopy images, affecting sample analyses and their interpretations. In this article, we explore five prominent imaging artifacts that commonly plague microscopy: blooming/saturation, pixelation, temporal/time varying noise, phototoxicity/photobleaching, and compression. Effective mitigation of these imaging artifacts hinges on careful consideration of key camera parameters, including quantum efficiency, bit-depth, resolution, and dynamic range, each crucial for optimizing image quality and fidelity. A wide range of camera solutions offered by e-con Systems provides consistent support to the various types of microscopy techniques from fluorescence microscopy to live cell imaging.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Today Current Issue","siteHash":"f96379ec955075ee4a82a30184e386fba85fa65bc9edf24926168cdf7e85fbb2","entryHash":"97a77a3ae857b0a6c917863f9f288cb31dd6ceea52fa1072dd9ad0f8c9b883ca","category":"Environment"}
