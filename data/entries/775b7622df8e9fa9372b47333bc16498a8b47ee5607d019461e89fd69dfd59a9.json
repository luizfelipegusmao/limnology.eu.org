{"title":"Rapid Image Segmentation Pipeline to Support Multimodal STEM Acquisition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.204/7719830?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The nanoscale investigation of materials, especially the identification and analysis of phase and chemical boundaries, defects, and interfaces within particles, is significantly advanced by Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and its associated analytical techniques. A key part of this process is to identify a suitable area of interest for detailed analysis. Here, we present a fully automated pipeline for processing and segmenting grayscale images for subsequent analytical data acquisition (e.g., EELS, EDS, 4D-STEM). This system is the second phase of an initiative aimed at expediting the characterization of gradients of millions to billions of distinct nanoparticles within combinatorial material libraries â€“ namely, megalibraries - as previously outlined in [<a href=\"#ozae044.204-B1\">1</a>]. Our initial machine learning framework effectively distinguishes between high-quality nanoparticles, marked for in-depth analysis, and those of lesser quality [<a href=\"#ozae044.204-B2\">2</a>]. Utilizing computer vision and unsupervised segmentation tools, the current project identifies and adaptively sizes regions within high-quality images for further data acquisition [<a href=\"#ozae044.204-B3\">3</a>]. Our pipeline aligns with visual inspection standards in &gt;95% of instances and is projected to perform &gt;9 times faster on average than current benchmarks. At the conference, we will detail our preprocessing techniques and describe two streamlined algorithms developed to output precise acquisition coordinates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"775b7622df8e9fa9372b47333bc16498a8b47ee5607d019461e89fd69dfd59a9","category":"Environment"}
