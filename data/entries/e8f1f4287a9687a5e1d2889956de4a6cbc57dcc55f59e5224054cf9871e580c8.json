{"title":"Quantum-Relativistic Diffusion in Nano-Transport","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0982/v1","date":1728956825000,"content":"In this paper we present the complete technical analysis of the diffusion function D(t) in the hypothesis of quantum-relativistic effects inside a nanostructure. The calculation is carried out through the use of a novel analytical model, known as DS model, that have a wide scale range of applicability and is usable for every oscillating process in Nature. The nanoscale will be considered in the paper, but the presence of a gauge term inside the model allows its application from sub-pico-level to macro-level. In addition to the theoretical framework, the graphical behavior of the function D(t) in some cases is considered and examples of application are performed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8f1f4287a9687a5e1d2889956de4a6cbc57dcc55f59e5224054cf9871e580c8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
