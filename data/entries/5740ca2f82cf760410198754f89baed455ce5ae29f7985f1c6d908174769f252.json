{"title":"Hawking Radiation as a Manifestation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0547/v1","date":1710145687000,"content":"We demonstrate that the black hole evaporation can be modelled as a process where one symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken continuously. We then identify three free-parameters of the system. The sign of one of the free-parameters, governs whether the particles emitted by the black-hole are fermions or bosons. The present model explains why the Black Hole evaporation process is so universal. Interestingly, this universality emerges naturally inside certain modifications of gravity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5740ca2f82cf760410198754f89baed455ce5ae29f7985f1c6d908174769f252","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
