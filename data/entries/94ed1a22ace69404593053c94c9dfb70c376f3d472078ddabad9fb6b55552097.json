{"title":"Spectral characterization of human leg EMG signals from an open access dataset for the development of computational models","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302632","date":1714399200000,"content":"<p>by Roberto Martins de Freitas, Andr√© Fabio Kohn</p>\r\n\r\nLarge-scale neuromusculoskeletal models have been used for predicting mechanisms underlying neuromuscular functions in humans. Simulations of such models provide several types of signals of practical interest, such as surface electromyographic signals (EMG), which are compared with experimental data for interpretations of neurophysiological phenomena under study. Specifically, realistic characterization of spectral properties of simulated EMG signals is important for achieving powerful inferences, whereas considerations should be taken for myoelectric signals of different muscles. In this study, we characterized spectral properties of surface interference pattern EMG signals and motor unit action potentials (MUAP) acquired from three plantar flexor muscles: Soleus (SO), Medial Gastrocnemius (MG), and Lateral Gastrocnemius (LG); and one dorsiflexor muscle: Tibialis Anterior (TA). Surface EMG signals were acquired from 20 participants using the same convention for electrode placement. Specifically, interference pattern EMG signals were obtained during isometric constant force contractions at 5%, 10% and 20% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), whereas surface MUAPs were decomposed from surface EMG signals obtained at low contraction forces. We compared the spectrum median frequency (MDF) estimated from interference pattern EMG signals across muscles and contraction intensities. Additionally, we compared MDF and durations of MUAPs between muscles. Our results showed that MDF of interference pattern EMG signals acquired from TA were higher compared to SO, MG, and LG for all contraction intensities i.e., 5%, 10%, and 20% MVC. Consistently, MUAPs acquired from TA also had higher MDF values and shorter durations compared to the other leg muscles. We provide herein a dataset with the surface MUAPs waveforms and interference pattern EMG signals obtained for this study, which should be useful for implementing and validating the simulation of myoelectrical signals of leg muscles. Importantly, these results indicate that spectral properties of myoelectrical signals should be considered for improving EMG modeling in large-scale neuromusculoskeletal models.","author":"Roberto Martins de Freitas","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"94ed1a22ace69404593053c94c9dfb70c376f3d472078ddabad9fb6b55552097","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
