{"title":"Pathophysiology, Risk Factors, and Advances in the Management of Peptic Ulcers: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0492/v1","date":1728369213000,"content":"Peptic ulcers, characterized by mucosal erosion in the stomach or duodenum, continue to pose significant health challenges worldwide. This comprehensive review explores the pathophysiology of peptic ulcers, including the roles of Helicobacter pylori, acid secretion, and mucosal defense mechanisms. We examine key risk factors such as NSAID use, smoking, alcohol consumption, and genetic predisposition. Advances in diagnostic techniques, including endoscopy, biopsy, and non-invasive tests like urea breath tests and stool antigen tests, are discussed, alongside recent improvements in molecular diagnostics and imaging. The review also covers current management strategies, focusing on pharmacological treatments like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 receptor antagonists, as well as surgical interventions for complicated cases. Emerging treatment modalities, such as novel drugs, probiotics, and minimally invasive surgical techniques, are highlighted. Additionally, the paper identifies future research directions, including the exploration of new therapeutic targets, enhanced diagnostic tools, and the impact of gut microbiota on ulcer formation. By integrating recent advancements and identifying gaps in current knowledge, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of peptic ulcers and inform future research and clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b22427a9b4fcd71e2c24d59d4619a26c0c158d41e7d1c24310ddc3b920409d11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
