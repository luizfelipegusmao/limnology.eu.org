{"title":"Enhanced Bone Healing Through Systemic Capsaicin Administration: An Experimental Study on Wistar Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1770/v1","date":1711629590000,"content":"Background and Objectives: The healing of bone defects is a serious challenge worldwide. One branch of dentistry deals with bone defects. capsaicin has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and cholesterol-reducing effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of systemic capsaicin administered at different doses on bone healing. Materials and Methods: A total of 32 male wistar rats was used, their weight varying between 250 and 300 g. The rats were randomly divided into four groups of eight rats each. The analyses served to evaluate the effect on healing of different doses of capsaicin and grafts. A significant increase was observed in the number of osteoblasts in the capsaicin-applied groups compared to the control group. Conclusions: As a result of the analyses, positive effects on bone healing were observed when capsaicin 0.25 mg/kg and 0.50 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally. However, more studies are needed for more accurate information.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"51a44837fd69e555e45bee6ea216d3f0ff495de59d006ffa7ac1a96447f09576","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
