{"title":"A Communication Toolkit to Assist Families Access Dental Care Services in Scotland: A Qualitative Evaluation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1002/v1","date":1723616438000,"content":"Childsmile is Scotland’s national child oral health improvement programme designed to reduce inequalities in oral health and ensuring universal access to NHS dental services by working closely with children and their families. Research has shown that parents with more dental concerns are less likely to bring their children for regular preventive dental check-ups. Therefore, a communication toolkit named ‘Chatterbox’ was created to help families access dental care services. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of Chatterbox from the perspective of parents with young children and from staff who work with them. Thirty parents of young children, volunteers, and staff affiliated with three third-sector family support organisations in Dundee participated in in-depth interviews, focus groups, and observations to assess the objectives of Chatterbox. Framework analysis was conducted to capture the themes, patterns, and findings triangulated using observations and field notes. Chatterbox was found to promote effective communication, identify barriers to dental attendance, provide a platform for reflection, convey the complexities of daily life, and boost parents' confidence to seek assistance. Chatterbox has the potential to help parents in accessing preventive dental care for their young children, when used with trained support workers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0dcc5b95195272eff81cb64cf82846623099cb6c7808a287300ceadae2aa25d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
