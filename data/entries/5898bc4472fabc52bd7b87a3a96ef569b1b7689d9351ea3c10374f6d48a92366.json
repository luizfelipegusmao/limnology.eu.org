{"title":"Expanding the cyanobacterial flora of India: Multiple novel species of Nostoc and Desmonostoc from Jammu and Kashmir, India using a polyphasic approach","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpy.13498?af=R","date":1727696666000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This investigation reports the polyphasic characterization of six cyanobacterial strains that were isolated from Basantgarh village of district Udhampur in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Morphological examination of the isolated strains indicated that the strains are members of the genus <i>Nostoc</i> or its morphotypes. Phylogenetic analyses using the 16S rRNA gene showed that five strains clustered in the <i>Nostoc</i> sensu stricto clade, whereas one strain clustered in the <i>Desmonostoc</i> clade. Further, comparative studies with their phylogenetically related taxa, based on morphology, folded secondary structures, phylogeny of the ITS rRNA region, and the percent genetic homology of 16S rRNA gene and ITS rRNA region clearly established the strains as novel taxa belonging to the genera <i>Nostoc</i> and <i>Desmonostoc</i>. Also, two strains 21A-PS and 2JNA-PS emerged as conspecific to each other, representing the same species of <i>Nostoc</i>. Hence, in accordance with the International code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, this study describes <i>Nostoc jammuense</i>, <i>Nostoc globosum</i>, <i>Nostoc breve</i>, and <i>Nostoc coriaceum</i>, as novel species of the genus <i>Nostoc</i>, while <i>Desmonostoc raii</i> is described as a novel species of the genus <i>Desmonostoc</i>. This study adds novel species of <i>Nostoc</i> from Indian habitats and reinforces the need to explore the <i>Nostoc</i> sensu stricto clade for more novel taxa.</p>","author":"Naresh Kumar, \nAniket Saraf, \nSagarika Pal, \nPrashant Singh","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Phycology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"075314558bff8e0edacb3dfb38f8f4294da4472e850554531438d5242e6a587b","entryHash":"5898bc4472fabc52bd7b87a3a96ef569b1b7689d9351ea3c10374f6d48a92366","category":"Environment"}
