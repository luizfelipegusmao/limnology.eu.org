For example, with single particle analysis (SPA) on purified and isolated biomolecular complexes, (integrated) differential phase contrast (iDPC-)STEM demonstrated the first map at near-atomic resolution with a STEM technique [<a href=\"#ozae044.903-B1\">1</a>]. Furthermore, recent demonstrations have shown that SPA with ptychography, can resolve protein structures at a sub-nanometer level [<a href=\"#ozae044.903-B2\">2</a>]. However, for thin, single-particle type of specimens, energy filtering TEM (EFTEM) with the state-of-art instrumentation can routinely determine macromolecular structures at atomic and near atomic resolution. In this study, we demonstrate two 4D-STEM phase imaging techniques applied to diverse biological specimens: tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF-)STEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.903-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.903-B4\">4</a>] (also known as parallax [<a href=\"#ozae044.903-B5\">5</a>]) and ptychography.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"25d06937d638c730c15020291d12d18991c0c46cd8ba89f7ac0a5d220096b503","category":"Environment"}
