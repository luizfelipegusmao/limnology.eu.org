{"title":"Neobank Adoption and Satisfaction: Insights from University Students","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0805/v1","date":1710493881000,"content":"This research explores the influence of nationality and financial literacy on satisfaction with neobank services among university students. Through a comparative analysis between German and international students, the study unveils that international students exhibit significantly higher satisfaction levels, suggesting that cultural differences and the requirement for international financial services play a crucial role Oishi et al., 1999. Although financial literacy was anticipated to have a strong impact, its effect on satisfaction did not reach statistical significance, indicating a nuanced relationship. This perhaps because the study sample of students partaking in the survey was mostly Graduate students in the field of Economics, Finance and Management. Demographic factors such as gender and age were found to be less influential compared to nationality and financial acumen Gelfand et al., 2011. These findings highlight the importance of tailored financial services and the potential of financial education in enhancing neobank satisfaction Gerrans et al., 2014. The study contributes to the understanding of consumer behavior in digital banking, offering insights for neobanks aiming to improve service adoption and customer loyalty within the university student demographic.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4fd79cf2f19d0dbdea2f030d6a5613acc299d0f8157c5f66a941390e52d15bf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
