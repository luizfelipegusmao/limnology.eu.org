{"title":"432 Genomic strategies to improve the efficiency of rumen function","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/182/7757392?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The rumen harbors a complex symbiotic microbiome (bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and viruses), which degrades plant cell walls and ferments sugars to the volatile fatty acids that provide energy to host. Extensive recent research has revealed that variation in rumen microbiome composition and function can directly and in directly influence many phenotypes in cattle such as feed efficiency, methane emission, metabolic health, milk and meat quality. Such findings highlight the opportunity to intervene rumen microbiome for improved productivity, health and reduced environmental footprint. More and more evidence revealed the individualized rumen microbiome and host genetics could be one of the factors in colonizing of selective rumen microbiome. This presentation will focus on to date knowledge on “heritability” of rumen microbes and explore the opportunities to breed cattle with a desired rumen microbiome for improved feed efficiency and lower emission of greenhouse gases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"c7ed31c3570933624a90701f8ef489fad146e11f50aff715a69828de15302fc9","category":"Environment"}
