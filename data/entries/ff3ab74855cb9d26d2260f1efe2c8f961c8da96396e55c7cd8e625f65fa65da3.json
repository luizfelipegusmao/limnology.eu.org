{"title":"Sustainable Supply Chain Mapping of Nipa Palm (Nypa Fruticans Wurmb)  in Thailand","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0910/v1","date":1728637493000,"content":"Nipa palm is a plant of great value to communities due to its social, environmental, and\neconomic benefits. Effective management of the supply chain for products derived from nipa palm resources is essential to provide communities with suitable channels for selling each type\nof product. This study aims to map the supply chain structure of six different nipa palm products. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 100 households engaged in nipa palm cultivation. The analysis focused on the characteristics of the products, existing challenges, and the current supply chain dynamics. The findings revealed that among\nthe six products, palm sugar had the highest production volume. The most significant challenges identified were related to labor shortages and limited marketing channels. To achieve sustainable supply chain management, it is crucial to maintain a balance between supply and demand. The study recommends exploring appropriate marketing channels for each\nproduct, with particular emphasis on online platforms that allow communities to sell directly to consumers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff3ab74855cb9d26d2260f1efe2c8f961c8da96396e55c7cd8e625f65fa65da3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
