{"title":"Real‐World Study of Serum Neurofilament Light Chain Levels in Ocrelizumab‐Treated People with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2030/v1","date":1717068746000,"content":"Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels have been proposed as a biomarker of the clinical activity, disability progression, and response to treatment of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS); however, questions remain about its implementation in clinical practice. Ocrelizumab (OCR) has proven effective to improve clinical and radiological outcomes and to reduce sNfL levels. This real-life study followed the sNfL levels of 30 PwMS treated for 12 months with OCR and evaluated the usefulness of this biomarker for the short-term prognosis, considering expanded disability status scale (EDSS), annualized relapse rate (ARR), radiological activity, and NEDA-3 values. OCR reduced the ARR in 83% of PwMS and the radiological activity in 80%. Their EDSS was maintained, while NEDA-3 was achieved in 70% at 12 months. OCR produced an early reduction in sNfL levels (at 3 months). At baseline, greater MRI-evaluated radiological activity was associated with higher sNfL levels. sNFL levels over the first 12 months of treatment did not predict a suboptimal response or sustained control of the disease. Longer-term studies are needed to explore the predictive usefulness of sNfL levels in PwMS treated with high-efficacy drugs","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4b458a6e5840673357133c0c0f7aeb248597a83ae3bd735c5c08639a9cd03e6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
