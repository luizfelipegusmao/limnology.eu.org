{"title":"Towards New Methodology for Cross-Validation of Clinical Evaluation Scales and Functional MRI in Psychiatry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0140/v1","date":1719920052000,"content":"Objective biomarkers have been a critical challenge for the field of psychiatry, where diagnostic, prognostic and theranostics assessments are still based on subjective narratives. Psychopathology operates with idiographic knowledge and subjective evaluations incorporated into clinical as-sessment inventories, but is considered to be a medical discipline and, as such, uses medical in-tervention methods (e.g., pharmacological, ECT; rTMS; tDCS), and therefore is supposed to oper-ate with the language and methods of nomothetic networks. The idiographic assessments are pro-visionally “quantified” into “structured clinical scales” to in some way resemble nomothetic measures. Instead of fostering data merging and integration, this approach further encapsulates the clinical psychiatric methods, as all other, biological tests (molecular, neuroimaging) are per-formed separately, only after the clinical assessment has provided diagnosis. Translational cross-validation of clinical assessment instruments and fMRI is an attempt to address the gap. The aim of this approach is to investigate whether there exist common and specific neural circuits, which underpin differential item responses to clinical self-rating scales during fMRI session in pa-tients suffering from the two main spectra of mental disorders: schizophrenia and major depres-sion. The current status of this research program and future implications to promote the devel-opment of psychiatry as a medical discipline are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"43515766964d3293cfca47c8707a5e33ddd6de820b9faa93be9de88fd823d9e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
