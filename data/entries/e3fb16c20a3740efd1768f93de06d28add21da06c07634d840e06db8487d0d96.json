This is particularly true for van der Waals ferroelectric material α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> has seen a rise in interest in recent years due to its stable polarization down to nanometer thickness [<a href=\"#ozae044.551-B1\">1</a>] and promising applications for nanoelectronic devices [<a href=\"#ozae044.551-B2\">2</a>]. Previous works have discussed the theoretical electronic structure of point defects in α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, where defects dictate not only doping behavior, but also influence polarization of the material [<a href=\"#ozae044.551-B3\">3</a>]. In conventional STEM imaging, resolving atomic structure of complex defects in projection remains challenging. Multislice electron ptychography has emerged as promising computational technique to address this, enabling few-nanometer resolution depth-sectioning for imaging along the <span>z</span>-axis while offering <span>x,y</span>-resolution improved past the diffraction limit [<a href=\"#ozae044.551-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"e3fb16c20a3740efd1768f93de06d28add21da06c07634d840e06db8487d0d96","category":"Environment"}
