{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Cranial Morphology in Allosaurus and Its Implications for Feeding Mechanics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0868/v1","date":1723532161000,"content":"This literature review presents a comparative analysis of cranial morphology in Allosaurus, focusing on its implications for feeding mechanics. Allosaurus, a large theropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period, exhibits distinct cranial features that are pivotal for understanding its predatory behaviors and ecological role. By examining fossilized skulls and employing advanced imaging techniques, this research identifies key morphological traits such as tooth structure, jaw articulation, and cranial robusticity. The analysis reveals that Allosaurus had a specialized cranial architecture that supported a powerful bite force and efficient processing of prey. Comparative metrics are applied to assess similarities and differences with other theropods, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, to elucidate variations in feeding strategies among theropods. The findings suggest that Allosaurus possessed adaptations that allowed it to exploit a diverse range of prey, indicating a versatile feeding strategy. These results enhance our understanding of theropod evolution and ecological interactions, providing insights into the functional significance of cranial morphology in dinosaurian predation. This review underscores the importance of cranial features in reconstructing the behavior and diet of extinct species and contributes to the broader field of vertebrate functional morphology.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8849b36313872f1baf2186fdda29b302c6122f667a7c42ea48ff82b86402b563","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
