{"title":"Kinetic Studies on the Interaction of HIV-1 Gag Protein with the HIV-1 RNA Packaging Signal","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0775/v1","date":1723452323000,"content":"During HIV-1 virus assembly the genomic RNA (vRNA) is selected for packaging by the viral protein Gag because it contains a specific packaging signal, Psi. While there have been numerous studies of Gag-Psi interactions, there is almost no information on kinetic aspects of this interaction. We have investigated the kinetics of Gag binding to different RNAs using switchSENSE DRX2 technology. We measured the association rate of Gag binding to monomeric Psi, to a “Multiple Binding Site Mutant” Psi that is inactive for genome packaging in vivo, and to a scrambled Psi. We discovered that Gag binds more rapidly to Psi RNA than to the mutant or scrambled RNAs. Furthermore, rapid Gag association kinetics are retained within sub-regions of Psi: Gag associates more rapidly with RNA containing only the 3’ two of the three Psi stem-loops than with monomeric RNA containing the 5’ two stem-loops or a scrambled RNA. No differences were detectable with individual Psi stem-loops. Interestingly, the rate of binding of Gag molecules to Psi increases with increasing Gag concentration, suggesting cooperativity in binding. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that selectivity in packaging derives from kinetic differences in initiation of particle assembly.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"391298c296a1520ee2250ed8bb796999fe224a21131e7d2ddf6a3806d7fdbf53","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
