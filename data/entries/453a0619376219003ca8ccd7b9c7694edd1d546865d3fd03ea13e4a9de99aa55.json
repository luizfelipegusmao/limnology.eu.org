{"title":"13C-labeling reveals non-conventional pathways providing carbon for hydroxy fatty acid synthesis in Physaria fendleri","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/6/1754/7260030?rss=1","date":1693872000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Physaria fendleri</span> is a member of the <span>Brassicaceae</span> that produces in its embryos hydroxy fatty acids, constituents of oils that are very valuable and widely used by industry for cosmetics, lubricants, biofuels, etc. Free of toxins and rich in hydroxy fatty acids, <span>Physaria</span> provides a promising alternative to imported castor oil and is on the verge of being commercialized. This study aims to identify important biochemical step(s) for oil synthesis in <span>Physaria</span>, which may serve as target(s) for future crop improvement. To advance towards this goal, the endosperm composition was analysed by LC-MS/MS to develop and validate culture conditions that mimic the development of the embryos <span>in planta</span>. Using developing <span>Physaria</span> embryos in culture and <sup>13</sup>C-labeling, our studies revealed that: (i) <span>Physaria</span> embryos metabolize carbon into biomass with an efficiency significantly lower than other photosynthetic embryos; (ii) the plastidic malic enzyme provides 42% of the pyruvate used for <span>de novo</span> fatty acid synthesis, which is the highest measured so far in developing ‘green’ oilseed embryos; and (iii) <span>Physaria</span> uses non-conventional pathways to channel carbon into oil, namely the Rubisco shunt, which fixes CO<sub>2</sub> released in the plastid, and the reversibility of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which provides additional carbon for fatty acid elongation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"453a0619376219003ca8ccd7b9c7694edd1d546865d3fd03ea13e4a9de99aa55","category":"Environment"}
