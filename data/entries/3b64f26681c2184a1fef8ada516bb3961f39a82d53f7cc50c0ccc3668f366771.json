{"title":"Buparvaquone Induces Ultrastructural and Physiological Alterations Leading to Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Caspase-Independent Apoptotic Cell Death in Leishmania donovani","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/3/521/7665503?rss=1","date":1714953600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease (endemic in 99 countries) caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus <span>Leishmania</span>. As treatment options are limited, there is an unmet need for new drugs. The hydroxynaphthoquinone class of compounds demonstrates broad-spectrum activity against protozoan parasites. Buparvaquone (BPQ), a member of this class, is the only drug licensed for the treatment of theileriosis. BPQ has shown promising antileishmanial activity but its mode of action is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrastructural and physiological effects of BPQ for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the in vitro antiproliferative activity in <span>Leishmania donovani.</span> Transmission and scanning electron microscopy analyses of BPQ-treated parasites revealed ultrastructural effects characteristic of apoptosis-like cell death, which include alterations in the nucleus, mitochondrion, kinetoplast, flagella, and the flagellar pocket. Using flow cytometry, laser scanning confocal microscopy, and fluorometry, we found that BPQ induced caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death by losing plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry and cell cycle arrest at sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase. Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane leads to the generation of oxidative stress and impaired ATP synthesis followed by disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Collectively, these findings provide valuable mechanistic insights and demonstrate BPQ's potential for development as an antileishmanial agent.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3b64f26681c2184a1fef8ada516bb3961f39a82d53f7cc50c0ccc3668f366771","category":"Environment"}
