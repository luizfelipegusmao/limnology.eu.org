{"title":"Fostering Intrinsic Motivation and Mental Well-being in Today’s Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1568/v1","date":1716476157000,"content":"In the realm of digital transformation, effective leadership and motivation are pivotal for organisations navigating the complexities of today’s systems. This study explores the intersection of intrinsic motivation and mental well-being among mature students—an analogy that sheds light on strategies applicable to organisational contexts. In developed nations like the UK, mental health for mature students is increasingly recognised as a crucial component of their educational journey. Mature students, who typically enrol in higher education after an educational gap and upon turning 21, often face specific challenges that can impact their mental well-being while pursuing academic goals. The primary objective of our study was to assess the relationship between intrinsic motivation and the mental well-being of mature students. Our research revealed a significant positive correlation between these two variables. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results supported a one-factor solution for the sample data from mature students. Additionally, we found that intrinsic motivation is a significant predictor of the mental well-being of mature students. Recognising and addressing the unique difficulties individuals encounter and providing appropriate support can enhance their well-being and contribute to the overall success of the higher education community.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"64bc4edfea250921027904f6cd459a0fdb2b69a9ea0cb75e7536aa1bfa9b3d9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
