{"title":"The Rise and Transfer of the River Chief System: A Review of Chinese Water Governance and Its Potential to Transfer to the Global Community","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0184/v2","date":1724841252000,"content":"China has enacted a range of policies to improve its water ecosystem since the middle of the 20th Century. Some of these measures include the creation of Seven River Conservancy Commissions, the development (combination and recombination) of series of ministries and departments to address environmental pollution and degradation, and recently the implementation of the river chief system. To understand if the river chief system can transfer to other political jurisdictions the authors gathered data using key word searches of the Web of Science and Google Scholar, official government sites, media sites and key international organizations. Based on this the authors review the development of the river chief system in the context of broader ecological reforms, place the rise of the river chief in the context of potential lessons for future improvement, and speculate on the possibility that China could transfer the river chief to countries facing similar challenges in their water governance regimes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b5cb1fc4bf7138e83a7f34bf1655866d4e73db0feb45b20e32379792dcd65f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
