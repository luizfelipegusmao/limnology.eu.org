{"title":"What Does “Training to Independence” Mean for Cryo-EM?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.442/7720100?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The Pacific Northwest Cryo-EM Center (PNCC) was created in 2018 by the NIH Common Fund Transformative High-Resolution Cryo-electron Microscopy Program to promote access and training to high-end cryo-electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B1\">1</a>]. Our overall training mandate was to focus on training <strong>groups</strong> to <strong>independence</strong>, which at PNCC we approached with an emphasis on “hands-on” training opportunities that cover practical skills needed when doing cryo-EM experiments. Over the past six years, PNCC has created and run many such training workshops that cover most of the single-particle cryo-EM workflow [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B2\">2</a>] from grid preparation to data processing. Of course, these training efforts also included substantial collaboration with a working group of other cryo-EM centers (NCCAT [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B3\">3</a>] and S2C2 [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B4\">4</a>]) as well as cryo-EM curriculum developers (CryoEM 101 [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B5\">5</a>], Getting Started in CryoEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B6\">6</a>], CryoVR [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B7\">7</a>], CryoEDU [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B8\">8</a>], Principles of CryoEM [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B9\">9</a>]). The team effort needed to integrate all this training content and workshops occurred is what nucleated the cryo-EM merit badge program [<a href=\"#ozae044.442-B10\">10</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"3cc79cf25c08f34135adabc8856d94ca802bcddc69b604c2a84b65763df6b34c","category":"Environment"}
