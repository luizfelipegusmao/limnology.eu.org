{"title":"Eco-Epidemiological Model of Predator-Prey with Two-Strain Infections: The Impact of Herd Behavior","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0819/v1","date":1728557973000,"content":"This study presents an eco-epidemiological model exploring a prey population infected by two distinct pathogen strains in the presence of an unaffected predator population. The model investigates how prey herding behavior provides protection against predation under multi-strain infections. A well-posedness and boundedness analysis of the populations ensures the robustness of the model. Linear stability analysis reveals that, under specific herd shapes and predator mortality rates, prey infected with either strain can vanish. Bifurcation analysis uncovers critical dynamics: a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs at a threshold prey herd shape (k), indicating the onset of stable oscillatory population cycles. As predator mortality (Î´) varies, both subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations emerge, marking shifts between stable and unstable dynamics, potentially leading to prey extinction or sharp population collapses. The analysis further identifies a Generalized Hopf bifurcation, distinguishing between predictable cycles and more complex. Numerical simulations confirm these findings, offering insights into predator-prey dynamics in ecosystems subject to multi-strain infections. The results have potential implications for understanding disease control, population stability, and ecological resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e85971beb692d375cef10dbd62ebe0e8506e365130cef764a53cf5a7c35de75f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
