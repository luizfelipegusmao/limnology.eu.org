{"title":"Impact of Chronic Stress on Physical and Mental Health: A Detailed Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1287/v1","date":1724062472000,"content":"Chronic stress is a pervasive issue that significantly impacts both physical and mental health. Unlike acute stress, which is short-lived and can be beneficial, chronic stress persists over extended periods, leading to a range of adverse health outcomes. This paper explores the myriad physical, mental, and behavioral consequences of chronic stress, emphasizing the underlying physiological mechanisms and potential long-term health implications. Through a comprehensive literature review and data analysis utilizing Python, we aim to provide an in-depth understanding of chronic stress and its effects. Key findings include the critical roles of cortisol and other stress-related chemicals in exacerbating health issues, and the potential for the normalization of high stress levels as an adaptive yet harmful response.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3c1afc36031debdfa37f16b5ba52d2507bb186b11cbc6d448825f01852b0d2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
