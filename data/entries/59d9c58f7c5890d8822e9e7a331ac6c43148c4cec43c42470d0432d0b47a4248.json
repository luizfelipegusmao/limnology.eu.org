{"title":"A Note on Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202109.0480/v7","date":1723528285000,"content":"Around $1637$, Pierre de Fermat famously scribbled, and claimed to have a proof for, his statement that equation $a^{n} + b^{n} = c^{n}$ has no positive integer solutions for exponents $n&gt;2$. The theorem stood unproven for centuries until Andrew Wiles' groundbreaking work in $1994$, with a notable caveat: Wiles' proof, while successful, relied on modern tools far beyond Fermat's claimed approach in terms of complexity. The present work potentially offers a solution which is closer in spirit to Fermat's original idea.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59d9c58f7c5890d8822e9e7a331ac6c43148c4cec43c42470d0432d0b47a4248","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
