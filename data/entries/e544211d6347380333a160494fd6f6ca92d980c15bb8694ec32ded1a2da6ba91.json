{"title":"Pharmacist-Led Identification of Discrepancies and Drug Related Problems within Two Surgery Wards: A Prospective Observational Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1083/v1","date":1721041562000,"content":"Background: Medication errors often stem from incomplete or incorrect transfer of drug information during reviews. To enhance medication review processes, a collaborative healthcare team, including a pharmacist in the surgical ward, is essential. This study aimed to identify the frequency and the kind of intentional and unintentional discrepancies related to the prescriptions within two surgical wards. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among adult patients admitted to two surgical settings. The patients were selected between May 30th and November 30th, 2021. The study followed a three-phase structure: patient selection, medication review to identify discrepancies and DRPs, and the detection of any such issues in the discharge letter. Results: The most frequent types of discrepancies collected were substitutions (60.9%) for the Endocrinological Surgery and omissions for General Surgery (53.4%). In Endocrinological Surgery, 45.9% of cases exhibited class C drug interactions. In General Surgery, class D drug interactions were predominantly observed (54.1%), with 93.3% attributed to drugs carrying an elevated risk of prolonging the QT interval. Conclusions: Frequently, the medication review process is superficially carried out, introducing errors that may adversely affect patient health. This study explores the potential positive impact of involving the clinical pharmacist in identifying and managing discrepancies and DRPs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e544211d6347380333a160494fd6f6ca92d980c15bb8694ec32ded1a2da6ba91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
