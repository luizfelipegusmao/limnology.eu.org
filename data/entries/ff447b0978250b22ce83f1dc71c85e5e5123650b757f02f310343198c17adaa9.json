{"title":"Effects of Basal Division of Posterior Pallial Amygdala on the Motor Behaviors in Pigeons Based on Transcriptome Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1460/v1","date":1729241555000,"content":"The basal division of posterior pallial amygdala (PoAb) was one important part of the amygdala in birds. PoAb mainly mediated turning behavior. However, the regulating neuromechanisms of PoAb in motor behavior was not clear yet. In this study, we selected septalis lateralis (SL) as the stimulated nucleus because it was closely associated with PoAb and had clear neuroregulatory functions, and the unrelated nuclei (entopallium) and unstimulated blank treatment (CK) selected as controls. A total of 622 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from PoAb after comparing the SL stimulating group with the CK control group. GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated 608 DEGs mainly involved energy supply and fluid balance. A total of 345 DEGs were obtained when comparing SL stimulation group and entopallium stimulation group. The upregulated 187 DEGs were mainly involved in cell communication and signal transductions. The study indicated that PoAb may modulate motor behaviour mainly by increasing ATP production and facilitating synaptic transmission, in which genes such as SMAD3, TMED3, GRIA2, HTR1B and SNCG play an important role. We revealed the neuromechanisms of brain regulation behaviour from gene level, and provided the theoretical foundation for understanding the avian brain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ff447b0978250b22ce83f1dc71c85e5e5123650b757f02f310343198c17adaa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
