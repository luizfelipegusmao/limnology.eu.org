{"title":"Egeria najas Planchon (Hydrocharitaceae) responses to abiotic short-term environmental changes","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-024-05496-4","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Understanding the factors that control the growth of macrophytes is of paramount importance in predicting their distribution and management. This study describes the effect of short-term variation of pH, light intensity (10–390 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), and temperature (15–30 °C) over the gross photosynthetic rate, respiration rate and net photosynthetic rate (NP) of <em>Egeria najas</em> in nutrient limited condition, and high nutrient availability. The light and dark bottles method was utilized to measure photosynthesis. The pH increase from 4.0 to 8.5 promoted a continuous decrease in NP. Temperature had an important effect on the NP value, with variations in Q<sub>10</sub> from 1.42 to 2.23. Although maximum NP rates occurred under low light intensity (158–204 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), in short-term, the availability of light can represent the main factor controlling photosynthesis in rooted <em>E. najas</em>; nevertheless, dissolved nutrients can highly induce the growth of free-float specimens. Our results facilitate the understanding of <em>E. najas</em> potential to colonize since it easily adapts to changes in environmental conditions.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"7ce0065fc147701bb4c082dda0be990a5ebfc215ce6efc4f9c66e0b0bad3034b","category":"Environment"}
