{"title":"Accumulation of Phosphorylated SnRK2 Substrate 1 Promotes Drought Escape in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/2/259/7424505?rss=1","date":1700092800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plants adopt optimal tolerance strategies depending on the intensity and duration of stress. Retaining water is a priority under short-term drought conditions, whereas maintaining growth and reproduction processes takes precedence over survival under conditions of prolonged drought. However, the mechanism underlying changes in the stress response depending on the degree of drought is unclear. Here, we report that SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) substrate 1 (SNS1) is involved in this growth regulation under conditions of drought stress. SNS1 is phosphorylated and stabilized by SnRK2 protein kinases reflecting drought conditions. It contributes to the maintenance of growth and promotion of flowering as drought escape by repressing stress-responsive genes and inducing <span>FLOWERING LOCUS T</span> (<span>FT</span>) expression, respectively. SNS1 interacts with the histone methylation reader proteins MORF-related gene 1 (MRG1) and MRG2, and the SNS1–MRG1/2 module cooperatively regulates abscisic acid response. Taken together, these observations suggest that the phosphorylation and accumulation of SNS1 in plants reflect the intensity and duration of stress and can serve as a molecular scale for maintaining growth and adopting optimal drought tolerance strategies under stress conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"eb69c271cea5c44a35e7f8c6b4cdfa050834d1dd09f917afb6218a20dccde3bb","category":"Environment"}
