{"title":"A Journey through the Minefield of the Discovery and Characterization of LR-RNA/LAT","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0502/v1","date":1725608418000,"content":"Scientific knowledge evolves in small steps, with occasional backsteps to correct inaccuracies, all occurring within a competitive environment.  This perspective for the first time looks at the history of latency-related RNA (LR-RNA) that was later renamed latency-associated transcript (LAT). At the 1986 International Herpesvirus Workshop (IHW) meeting in Leeds, England, Daniel L Rock and Anthony B Nesburn first reported the discovery of human herpes virus 1 (HSV-1) latency-related (LR)-RNA that is antisense to ICP0. Less than a month after the IHW meeting a paper was submitted to Science magazine and 8 months later appeared in print thanking “D. Rock for suggesting RNA complementary to the ICP0 message may be present in latently infected cells”. This perspective is not a review of LAT literature but intends to clarify the timeline of LAT discovery and subsequent breakthroughs such as reactivation, apoptosis, CD8+ T cell exhaustion, and LAT expression in different cell types detected during latency. While many review articles have been written about LAT since 1987, the most comprehensive and balanced review about LAT was written by Dr. David Bloom’s group (1). In this overview, I will discuss our original collaboration with Dr. Dan Rock and subsequent work that our group performed, which is still ongoing. Finally, I will discuss the controversies associated with LAT from its inception to current times.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e8798a3d824c26ee9974b866a1bf59419c11c69f48ba3f84b1dcfdf4e5b76f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
