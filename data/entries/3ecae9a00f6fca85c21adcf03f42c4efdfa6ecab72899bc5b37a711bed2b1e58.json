{"title":"Double Polarized Optical Link for Mobile Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1904/v1","date":1719449190000,"content":"The demand for improved service in mobile networks is always increasing. That means signal transmission with higher capacity is required. To achieve that goal a combined optical and wireless link using double polarization multiplexing has been developed. A high quality signal transmission is achieved by applying high polarization extinction ratio. The new concept is validated by experiments varying the bit rate and fiber length. A signal with 12 Gbit/s bit rate was transmitted over a 25 km long combined link with about 1.10-8 bit error rate. That result is much better than the already published data which were measured on links transmitting information with 2.5 Gbit/s bit rate. The polarization multiplexing technique is very practical for capacity enhancement in a specific section of an existing optical fiber by inserting a new link into it without deploying a new fiber.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ecae9a00f6fca85c21adcf03f42c4efdfa6ecab72899bc5b37a711bed2b1e58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
