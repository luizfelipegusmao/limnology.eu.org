Based on the efforts of a growing international community, researchers have easier access to the latest information for improving imaging platforms, sample preparation methods, and image analysis workflows [<a href=\"#ozae044.486-B1\">1</a>]. Additionally, the introduction of deep leaning (DL) algorithms for image analysis provided options for end-users to handle large vEM datasets in a reasonable time frame, especially since some software such as Dragonfly, Amira, or Microscopy Image Browser (MIB) integrated DL models into their software user interface.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5e92e00bd0739714714f94b84d5d4d948d3e06703705479cfa2c873a3abc9fc5","category":"Environment"}
