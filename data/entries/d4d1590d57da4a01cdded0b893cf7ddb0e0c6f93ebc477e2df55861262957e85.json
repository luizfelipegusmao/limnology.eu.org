{"title":"Oxynoemacheilus fatmae, a new species from the Güzelhisar Stream in the Aegean Sea basin, Türkiye (Teleostei: Nemacheilidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15779?af=R","date":1716959457000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p><i>Oxynoemacheilus fatmae</i>, a new species, is found in the Güzelhisar Stream in the northern Aegean Sea basin. It is differentiated from all other species of <i>Oxynoemacheilus</i> in the northern Aegean Sea and adjacent basins by having four to eight irregularly shaped narrow black bars on the posterior part of flank, and anterior parts of the flank with a marbled pattern. <i>O. fatmae</i> is differentiated from the closest species <i>Oxynoemacheilus theophilii</i> by having 14 fixed diagnostic nucleotide substitution sites, and the pair-wise genetic distance is 2.22%. It further differs from <i>O. theophilii</i> by having a slenderer body (body at dorsal-fin origin: 15%–17% standard length [SL] vs. 17%–18%), a slenderer caudal peduncle (10%–12% SL vs. 12%–13%), a more forked caudal fin (length of middle caudal-fin lope: 16%–19% SL vs. 19%–23%), and the absence the dorsal and ventral adipose crests on the caudal peduncle behind the vertical of the posterior anal-fin base (vs. present). Three species delimitation tests (assemble species by automatic partitioning (ASAP), automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD) and generalized mixed yule-coalescent (GMYC)) and phylogenetic analyses reinforce the validity of <i>O. fatmae</i> as a distinct species.</p>","author":"Davut Turan, \nSadi Aksu, \nSalim Serkan Güçlü, \nGökhan Kalaycı","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"d4d1590d57da4a01cdded0b893cf7ddb0e0c6f93ebc477e2df55861262957e85","category":"Environment"}
