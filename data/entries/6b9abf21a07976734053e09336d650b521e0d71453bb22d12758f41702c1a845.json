In the course of research, data on municipalities from the Local Data Bank were used, and that made it possible to trace the changes occurring in 2002-2021. The selection of ana-lytical characteristics took into account a wide range of socio-economic diversities of the area related to changes in population, construction activity and housing stock, land use and spatial policy, economic and associated with investment attractiveness. The components of diversification were used to develop the typological classes of municipalities. The final result of the study is the identification of the specificity of suburbanization in the OMW which is reflected in the social, economic and spatial aspects of the functioning of municipalities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b9abf21a07976734053e09336d650b521e0d71453bb22d12758f41702c1a845","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
