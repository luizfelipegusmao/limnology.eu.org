{"title":"Analysis of Genotype X Environment Interaction for Grain Yield of Wheat Genotypes Using Biplot Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1507/v1","date":1711436386000,"content":"Understanding the genotype x environment (GE) interaction for traget trait is valuable for growers, agronomists, breeders and the seed industry. The objective of this study was to see and explore the genotype x environment interaction for grain yield of wheat to better guide genotype selection and breeding. The genotype main effect and GE interaction effect (GGE) biplots resolved the following three genotypes: 85 (ETW17-377), 82 (ETW17-374) and 13 (ETW17-281) for being the best yielding and stable. The Kulumsa site planted on 4th of July 2017 (environment 7=E7) and the DebreZeit site on 20th of July 2017 (E3) were the most effective environments in distinguishing the test genotypes and are thus suitable environments for future evaluation and selection with specific adaptation. Melkasa site planted on 4th July (E9) was a representative environment where genotypes can be evaluated for wide  adpaptation. The genetic covariate biplot indicated that thousand kernel weight (TKW) and plant height (PH) had significant positive associations with grain yield implying the possible concurrent indirect selection of both traits for exploiting GE interaction for grain yield of wheat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f067c4c69991ae7c117c85988d9ccdd276907cdf3515a89acba102f9e957dddc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
