{"title":"A Comparison of Laminectomy and Hemilaminectomy Approaches for Resection of Spinal Schwannomas and Meningiomas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1738/v1","date":1711686204000,"content":"Background: Spinal schwannomas and meningiomas are the most common spinal cord benign tumors in adults and total excision is the goal of the treatment. The traditional surgical approach is performed by total laminectomy, but recently unilateral hemilaminectomy has been recognized as a valuable surgical alternative. \nWe report the clinical results of patients affected by spinal schwannoma and meningioma in whom total laminectomy or unilateral hemilaminectomy were performed.\nMaterial and Methods: A retrospective study of patients who underwent resection of spinal meningioma or schwannoma by laminectomy or unilateral hemilaminectomy approaches in our Institute from January 2013 to January 2023 was made. The baseline data of these patients, operative approach and postoperative outcome were compared.\nResults: The study was performed on 41 patients with mean age of 62.5 ±14.6 years. Our series included 24 (59%) cases of schwannomas and 17 (41%) cases of meningiomas, with a prevalent location in the thoracic spine. The average schwannomas volume was 3,6 ±2,7 cm3, whereas the average meningiomas volume was 1.1 ±0.5 cm3. Total excision was achieved in all cases. Operative time of schwannomas was longer (p=0.001) respect to meningiomas with higher intra-operative blood loss (p=0.000). Total laminectomy approach was performed in 24 out of 41 patients (59%) and unilateral hemilaminectomy approach in 17 out of 41 (41%) patients. Unilateral hemilaminectomy was associated with shorter postoperative bed rest (p=0.003), shorter hospitalization (p=0.028) and lower postoperative pain (p=0.02) respect to total laminectomy.\nConclusions: Both spinal schwannomas and spinal meningiomas in various size can be safely and effectively treated with unilateral hemilaminectomy approach. This approach grants more advantages compared with standard total laminectomy, including shorter postoperative bed rest, shorter hospitalization and reduced postoperative pain.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77d2cc8010bed3e6f5b2c1d22d29ef39d968286f4c3913c7d858db96e7d078ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
