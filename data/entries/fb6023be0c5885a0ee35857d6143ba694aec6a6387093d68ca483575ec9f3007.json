{"title":"A Low-Cost Direct Digital Synthesis Based On-Chip Waveform Generation for Analog/Mixed Signal BIST Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1716/v1","date":1727142596000,"content":"Waveform generation as part of an on-chip built-in self-test (BIST) circuitry often necessitates sufficient linearity without expensive hardware overhead. Achieving high linearity is critical for accurate signal generation, especially in applications requiring high precision, such as biomedical and instrumentation. Currently, achieving the high linearity and precision required in signal generators often relies on costly hardware such as automated test equipment (ATE). This paper presents a DAC based hardware synthesizable arbitrary waveform generator. We use a low-cost DAC and a fully digital on-chip testing and calibration approach to nullify the effect of the DACâ€™s non-linearity on the generated waveform. The ultra-low cost and high linearity benefit of the proposed waveform generator makes it highly suitable for integration into resource-constrained systems. The proposed approach is validated using simulation results of the small-area DAC designed in TSMC 0.18um technology and the testing and calibration algorithms implemented in MATLAB. The DAC, designed with a matching accuracy at only the 5-bit level, is able to generate a signal with an ENOB of 12 bits alongside a SFDR and THD surpassing 100 dB. This high level of signal purity is consistently maintained across 100 Monte-Carlo simulations, demonstrating the robustness of the architecture against PVT variations as well as random mismatches.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb6023be0c5885a0ee35857d6143ba694aec6a6387093d68ca483575ec9f3007","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
