{"title":"The Effect of Carbon Nanotubes and Carbon Micro Fibers on the Piezoresistive and Mechanical Properties of Mortar","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0937/v1","date":1718315611000,"content":"In this study, the mechanical and piezoresistive properties of mortars reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon micro fibers (CMFs) are determined. Silica fume as well as a polymer with polyalkylene glycol graft chains were used as dispersant agents for the CNTs and CMFs incorporation into the cement paste. The mechanical properties of the mortar composites were investigated in respect to their flexural and compressive strength. A four-probe method was used for the estimation of their piezoresistive response. The test outcomes revealed that the combination of the dispersant agents along with a low content of CNTs and CMF by weight of cement (bwoc) result in the production of a stronger mortar with enhanced mechanical performance and durability. More specifically, there was an increase in flexural and compressive strength up to 38% and 88%, respectively. Moreover, the piezoresistive response of the reinforced cementitious materials was attributed to the variation of electrical resistivity due to tunneling transport of electrons stemming from two different mechanisms due to the incorporation of the conductive admixtures (CNTs and CMF). This work aims to contribute to the progress acceleration in the field of developing structural materials with self-sensing and electrical actuation related properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc873fb6e5e45cd3e85fc09d09c227f3f25c5927a44b5a173cd8cc3b4b68789f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
