{"title":"Health Benefits of Epigallocatechin Gallate and Forskolin with a Special Emphasis on Glaucoma and Other Retinal Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1335/v1","date":1729127727000,"content":"This review highlights the therapeutic potential of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and forskolin in managing retinal diseases, with a focus on glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy. EGCG, a potent polyphenol from green tea, exhibits significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects, making it a promising candidate for reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in ocular tissues. Forskolin, a diterpene from Coleus forskohlii, increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which helps lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and provides neuroprotection. Both compounds target critical pathways involved in retinal disease progression, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, offering complementary therapeutic benefits. The review consolidates preclinical and clinical studies, highlighting the potential of EGCG and forskolin as adjunctive or alternative treatments for retinal diseases. Future research should explore the synergistic effects of these compounds, particularly in combination therapies aimed at addressing multiple pathogenic mechanisms in retinal health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f42e0d7c3eec477a2c101a910e1b2f7d91e9dd07c537bfa4dd020ddcfd27583","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
