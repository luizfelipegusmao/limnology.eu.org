{"title":"The Sensitivity and Consistency Comparison Between Next-Generation Sequencing and Sanger Sequencing in HIV-1 Drug Resistance Testing for Pre-Treated Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2356/v1","date":1727701956000,"content":"Next-generation sequencing(NGS) for HIV drug resistance(DR) testing has an increasing number of applications for detection of Low-abundance drug resistant variants(LA-DRVs) as its features of quasispecies. However there is less information on detection performance in DR detection with NGS.To determine the feasibility of NGS technology in LA-DRVs detection for HIV-1 pre-treated patients.In this study,80 pre-treated patients’ samples accepted both NGS and Sanger sequencing(SS) in HIV-1 drug resistance testing. The results show that NGS presents higher sensitivity in mutation sites discovery at 5% threshold. NGS shows a satisfactory consistency comparing with SS in both protease inhibitors(PIs) and Integrase inhibitor(INSTIs), more than 90%. But worse consistency in Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NRTIs), only ranging from 61.25%-87.50%. The consistency of Non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NNRTIs) between NGS and SS was around 85%. NGS shows the highest sensitivity of 91.3% at 5% threshold. The application of NGS technology in HIV-1 genotype resistance detection in different populations infected with HIV needs more documents and to be confirm further.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90f7ea3fff53cdbdfa93468249518c21d6cd8c3f1e0e70768fba57a944cd04c9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
