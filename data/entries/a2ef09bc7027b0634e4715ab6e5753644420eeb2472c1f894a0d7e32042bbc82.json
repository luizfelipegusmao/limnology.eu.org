Linear regression was used to assess associations with population characteristics and biomarkers of liver function, serum lipids and oxidative stress. Regression models were adjusted for potential confounding variables and false discovery rate procedure was applied to account for multiplicity.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Results</h3>\n                      <p>The BTs ranged from undetected up to 46.8 ng/mL. 2-hydroxy-benzothiazole was the most predominant compound (detection frequency 83%; median 1.95 ng/mL). 1-methyl-benzotriazole (1M-BTR) was measured in human samples for the first time, with a detection frequency 77% and median 1.75 ng/mL. Professional firefighters had lower urinary 1M-BTR compared to non-firefighters. Urinary 1M-BTR was associated with levels of γ-glutamyl transferase (β = − 17.54%; 95% CI: − 26.127, − 7.962).</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n                      <p>This is the first study to investigate BT exposure in Central Europe, including potentially exposed firefighters. The findings showed a high prevalence of BTs in the study population, the relevance of 1M-BTR as a new biomarker of exposure, and an urgent need for further research into associated adverse health outcomes.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Graphical abstract</h3>\n                      <p><span>\n                        <span>\n                          <img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/MediaObjects/420_2024_2059_Figa_HTML.png\" />\n                        </span>\n                      </span></p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"a2ef09bc7027b0634e4715ab6e5753644420eeb2472c1f894a0d7e32042bbc82","category":"Environment"}
