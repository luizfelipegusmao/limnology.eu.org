It is unique in Stomatopoda by its unusual telson ornamentation in which the short intermediate and lateral primary teeth, accompanied by a row of short, graded serrations inward of the intermediate teeth, partially overhang a row of minute submarginal denticles. Although distinctive as a new genus and species, <span>Incertasquilla chimera</span><strong>gen. et sp. nov.</strong> does not fit clearly into existing lysiosquilloid families as currently diagnosed and, in some respects, shares a mosaic of features present in several families. <span>Incertasquilla chimera</span><strong>gen. et sp. nov.</strong>, however, currently fits best into Tetrasquillidae, where it is tentatively placed, although further phylogenetic study may show it belongs in a separate family altogether. In the light of the new character combinations presented by the discovery of <span>Incertasquilla chimera</span><strong>gen. et sp. nov.</strong>, a revised diagnosis for Tetrasquillidae and updated key to the genera are provided. The discovery of <span>Incertasquilla chimera</span><strong>gen. et sp. nov.</strong> expands the described lysiosquilloid fauna to 14 genera and 30 species in Australia, and 10 and 16 in Japan, respectively.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"640619a2fccc4e77eeee81dc26185943c525e897cc8cf87a4694faefdac3f1bc","category":"Environment"}
