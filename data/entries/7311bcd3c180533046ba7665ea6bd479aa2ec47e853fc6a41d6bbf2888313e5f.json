{"title":"The Indissociable Triad: Vascular Impairment, Muscle Atrophy, and Cognitive Decline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0728/v1","date":1723471094000,"content":"The triad of vascular impairment, muscle atrophy, and cognitive decline represents critical age-related conditions that significantly impact health. Vascular impairment disrupts blood flow, precipitating muscle mass reduction seen in sarcopenia and the decline of neuronal functions characteristic of neurodegeneration. Our limited understanding of the intricate relationships within this triad hinders accurate diagnosis and effective treatment strategies. This review ana-lyzes the interrelated mechanisms that contribute to these conditions, with a specific focus on ox-idative stress, chronic inflammation, and impaired nutrient delivery. The aim is to understand the common pathways involved and to suggest comprehensive therapeutic approaches. Vascular dysfunctions hinder the circulation of blood and the transportation of nutrients, resulting in sar-copenia characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness. Vascular dysfunction and sarcopenia have a negative impact on physical function and quality of life. Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit comparable pathophysiological mechanisms that affect cognitive and motor functions. Preventive and therapeutic approaches encompass lifestyle adjustments, addressing oxidative stress, in-flammation, and integrated therapies that focus on improving vascular and muscular well-being. Better understanding of these links can refine therapeutic strategies and yield better patient out-comes. This study emphasizes the complex interplay between vascular dysfunction, muscle de-generation, and cognitive decline, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary treatment ap-proaches. Advances in this domain promise improved diagnostic accuracy, more effective thera-peutic options, and enhanced preventive measures, all contributing to a higher quality of life for the elderly population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7311bcd3c180533046ba7665ea6bd479aa2ec47e853fc6a41d6bbf2888313e5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
