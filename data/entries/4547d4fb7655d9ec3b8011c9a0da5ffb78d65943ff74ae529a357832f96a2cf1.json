{"title":"Bone Regeneration with Stem Cells from Dental Pulp in a Rat Experimental Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1012/v1","date":1710753860000,"content":"The increase in the rate and prevalence of diseases associated with the localized and general loss of bone mass calls for an investigation into therapeutic alternatives that largely involve the de-velopment of new biomaterials and cell therapy, converting tissue bioengineering into a prom-ising option. An experimental model of a critical mandibular lesion in rats has been used to study bone re-generation by treating the ostectomy with the biomaterials Evolution® and Gen-Os® (OsteoBiol®, Italy) combined, or not, with dental pulp stem cells (DP-MSC). The results obtained through the Micro-CT and histological study reveal the almost complete re-covery of the lesion in the group with DP-MSC. These results are supported by increases in endoglin, TGF-β, protocollagen I, parathormone, and calcitonin, generating an environment of bone generation and development when combining Evolution® and Gen-Os® (OsteoBiol®, Italy) with DP-MSC. These promising results confirm the transcendental role of DP-MSC in combina-tion with osteogenic biomaterials for bone regeneration, and warrant further studies, including its assessment in clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4547d4fb7655d9ec3b8011c9a0da5ffb78d65943ff74ae529a357832f96a2cf1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
