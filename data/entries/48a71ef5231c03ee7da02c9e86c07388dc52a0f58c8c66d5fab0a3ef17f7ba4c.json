{"title":"How Different Forms of Knowledge Transfer at Workplace Are Related to Self-Rated Work Performance?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2026/v1","date":1724831843000,"content":"Successful work performance is an important part of everyday functioning. Different factors could contribute to efficiency at the workplace. Two studies aim to establish how different forms of knowledge transfer at the workplace are related to self-rated work performance and whether better work performance is related to mindfulness as an aspect of cognitive functioning. The participants were 742 working Bulgarians in Study 1 and 259 workers in Study 2. Ten scales were used in Study 1, measuring different forms of knowledge transfer and self-rated work performance, and two scales were used in Study 2, measuring self-assessed work performance and mindfulness. The results revealed that higher self-assessment of work performance correlated positively but weakly with the sharing of tacit knowledge at the workplace, sharing knowledge with colleagues in dyads, work climate encouraging mastership, sharing knowledge in teams, knowledge transfer by means of cooperation between different generations, institutionalized transfer of knowledge, knowledge receiving, and estimated effectiveness of participation in supervision as a supervisee. Some forms of knowledge transfer (sharing of tacit knowledge and sharing knowledge with colleagues in dyads) seemed more closely related to self-assessed work performance than others. Self-assessment of work performance did not correlate statistically significantly with performance motivational climate at work. The different forms of knowledge transfer correlated with each other. Better work performance is related to better cognitive functioning, as the second study of 259 workers additionally revealed that higher self-assessment of work performance correlated with better self-awareness measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, i.e., more attention focused on own thoughts, emotions, and needs, i.e., on what is happening right now. Interconnectedness between the different forms of knowledge transfer indicates that stimulating one kind of knowledge transfer could also stimulate many other forms of knowledge transfer, but this may happen only when organizations support a mastery-motivated climate at work. Established connections between the different forms of knowledge transfer and self-rated work performance, as well as between self-assessed work performance and mindfulness, suggest that good cognitive functioning accompanied good functioning, and both may be facilitated by knowledge transfer at the workplace.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48a71ef5231c03ee7da02c9e86c07388dc52a0f58c8c66d5fab0a3ef17f7ba4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
