This was a cross-sectional multi-center study conducted from first February 2022 to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2022 in the preselected main teaching hospitals of Uganda and Eastern DRC. We surveyed the surgical workforce (practicing surgeons, Obstetrician-Gynecologists, and residents in surgery/ Obstetrics-Gynecology) who had experienced postoperative complications in their career. Data was analysed using SPSS version 23. One hundred ninety-eight participants responded to the questionnaire. Worry about patient and reputation were the commonest psychological impacts in 54.0% and 45.5% of the participants respectively. Majority of the participants (55.1%) used positive coping mechanisms with a positive impact on their practice (94.4%). Being a female doctor (AOR = 2.637, CI 1.065–6.533, P = 0.036), worrying about reputation (AOR = 3.057, CI = 1.573–5.939, P = 0.001) and guilt after a complication (AOR = 4.417, CI = 2.253–8.659, P = &lt;0.001) were predictors of a negative coping mechanism. Postoperative surgical complications continue to cause a huge psychological impact on the operating doctors in Uganda and the Eastern DRC. Female doctors, those that worry about the reputation and those that feel guilty following a complication should be given more support and guidance by peers when surgical complications occur to their patients.","author":"Franck Katembo Sikakulya","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"44d990c472faa84cbd327eedf8e0ff2b4c009261a3d35deaf255a979e8bd9fdf","category":"Environment"}
