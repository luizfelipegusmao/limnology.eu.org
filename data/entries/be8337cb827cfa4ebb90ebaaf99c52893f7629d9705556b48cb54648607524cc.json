{"title":"The omission of seed banks in demography as an example of bias in ecology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/10/677/7680180?rss=1","date":1716854400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Despite enthusiasm for big data in the life sciences, challenges arise because of biases and incomplete data. Demographic studies often overlook dormant life stages, which can skew inferences. They also tend to focus on few populations and short time spans. We assessed omissions of seed banks in demographic studies, exploring trends across life forms, climates, and taxonomic groups. We compared 172 species (192 cases) with independent seed bank and demographic studies. Approximately 25% of the demographic studies excluded known seed bank stages. The probability of omissions was lower for annuals and shrubs and higher for perennial herbs. We found no evidence that ecoregion or phylogeny explained these omissions. Modeling choices and study designs may explain patterns of seed bank omissions. Considering more populations reduced the chance of omissions. Omissions raise concerns for ecological analyses using databases. Leveraging large data is important, but we must be careful to understand their biases and limitations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"BioScience Current Issue","siteHash":"b284d132cf96f029686596d0a1781780964c795fe639c624cd504e01b404d8ff","entryHash":"be8337cb827cfa4ebb90ebaaf99c52893f7629d9705556b48cb54648607524cc","category":"Environment"}
