{"title":"Constructing the Early-Stage Framework of Cultural Identity Enlightenment in Heritage Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0480/v1","date":1725603075000,"content":"Education and heritage are fundamental to achieving sustainable development goals. Integrating heritage into education is crucial for cultivating children's connection to heritage and promoting sustainable development. However, the lack of a scientific framework to guide educational goals across age groups results in unclear integration. This study aims to develop a framework for cultural identity enlightenment within heritage education by conducting literature research and validating it through field observations in kindergartens. It identifies cognitive, emotional and behavioral dimensions, outlining the developmental trajectory of these goals. This framework illustrates how children's understanding progresses from direct experiences to deeper appreciation and creative involvement. It provides teachers with a tool to set goals that empower children as agents, fostering the emergence of cultural awareness and identity. This approach not only enhances cultural identity but also supports sustainable development by advancing the transmission and innovation of cultural heritage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4c93dc848126ce68f91c0a12befc025c8de71e72771d0728ab43a958feeae749","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
