The study reveals how protist communities are being reshaped by increasing temperatures and carbon dioxide levels. The authors find an unexpected functional divergence amidst a compositional convergence of protists across warming and CO<sub>2</sub> level treatments, which is aligned with established hypotheses if only warming is considered, but counters those established ideas once CO<sub>2</sub> levels are considered. This research not only sheds light on the intricate dynamics of peatlands, an ecosystem essential for global carbon storage, but also signals a call to action for further studying these ecosystems amid rising environmental challenges.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Microbes affect the global carbon cycle that influences climate change and are in turn influenced by environmental change. Here, we use data from a long-term whole-ecosystem warming experiment at a boreal peatland to answer how temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> jointly influence communities of abundant, diverse, yet poorly understood, non-fungi microbial Eukaryotes (protists). These microbes influence ecosystem function directly through photosynthesis and respiration, and indirectly, through predation on decomposers (bacteria and fungi). Using a combination of high-throughput fluid imaging and 18S amplicon sequencing, we report large climate-induced, community-wide shifts in the community functional composition of these microbes (size, shape, and metabolism) that could alter overall function in peatlands. Importantly, we demonstrate a taxonomic convergence but a functional divergence in response to warming and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> with most environmental responses being contingent on organismal size: warming effects on functional composition are reversed by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and amplified in larger microbes but not smaller ones. These findings show how the interactive effects of warming and rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels could alter the structure and function of peatland microbial food webs—a fragile ecosystem that stores upwards of 25% of all terrestrial carbon and is increasingly threatened by human exploitation.</p>","author":"Christopher L.
