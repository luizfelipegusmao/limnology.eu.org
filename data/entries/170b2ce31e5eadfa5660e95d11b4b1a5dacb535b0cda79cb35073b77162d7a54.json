{"title":"Landscapes of Watermills: A Rural Cultural Heritage Perspective in an East-Central European Context","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2310/v1","date":1722251581000,"content":"Recent studies in rural heritage tourism have highlighted that an evolutionary economic geography perspective could be helpful in determining whether cultural heritage tourism could stand as a branching-innovating trajectory. Its evolution can be understood by presenting specific mechanisms of layering, recombination and conversion that leads to path development. We contribute to rural heritage tourism by basing our study on perceptions of tourists and local officials on the RudÄƒria Watermills, Romania. Based on survey and interview data, we document the strengths and limits of local watermills for tourism and describe the entrepreneurial agents involved in path development. Our findings point to the important role played by a local NGO in developing a path for tourism for the watermills, as well as the active involvement of local authorities and other local cultural leaders for including the mills in national and international tourism circuits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"170b2ce31e5eadfa5660e95d11b4b1a5dacb535b0cda79cb35073b77162d7a54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
