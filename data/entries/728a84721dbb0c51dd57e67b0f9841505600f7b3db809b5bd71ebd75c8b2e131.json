{"title":"Investigating the Misguided Path of the Superior Epigastric Artery: An Explorative Anatomical Study of 40 Specimens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0189/v1","date":1727874093000,"content":"Background: This study addresses a longstanding discrepancy between the observed course of the superior epigastric artery in anatomical specimens and its depiction in many German-language anatomy textbooks. While the artery typically runs ventral to the diaphragm, textbooks inaccurately describe it as passing through the sternocostal triangle (Larrey's fissure). Methods: Anatomical dissections were performed on 40 formalin-fixed cadavers at the Medical University of Vienna. The thoracic and abdominal walls were dissected, and the course of the superior epigastric artery was documented. Literature from the time of Dominique Larrey to present was reviewed to trace the origin of the incorrect anatomical description.Discussion: Findings confirm that the superior epigastric artery does not traverse Larrey's space but remains ventral to the pleural and peritoneal cavities. The erroneous description appears to have originated from a 19th-century misinterpretation by Joseph Hyrtl and was perpetuated in German-language textbooks.Conclusion: The study refutes the long-standing but incorrect description of the superior epigastric artery's course in German-language anatomy textbooks. The findings highlight the importance of revising anatomical literature to correct historical inaccuracies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"728a84721dbb0c51dd57e67b0f9841505600f7b3db809b5bd71ebd75c8b2e131","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
