{"title":"Exploring the Rise in Precocious Puberty: Interplay of Genetic and Environmental Factors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0719/v1","date":1723427705000,"content":"The rise in precocious puberty cases can be attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors play a significant role, with studies identifying genetic abnormalities in genes such as KISS1, KISS1R, MKRN3, DLK1, GABRA1, LIN28B, NPYR, TAC3, and TACR3, which are associated with central precocious puberty (CPP). Epigenetic factors like DNA methylation and histone modifications may mediate the relationship between genetic and environmental influences on CPP development. Environmental factors such as exposure to secondhand smoke, cesarean section, and BMI have also been linked to precocious puberty, particularly in girls, highlighting the multifactorial nature of this phenomenon. Understanding the interplay between these genetic and environmental factors is crucial in addressing the increasing prevalence of precocious puberty in children. The published literature in the past five years was systematically reviewed and summarized highlighting the interplay of genetic and environmental factors for the rise in the precocious puberty.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bbbf189e8834b1d77202ac382e72ea1784a94e38f63b5b0b427d66bfb019b83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
