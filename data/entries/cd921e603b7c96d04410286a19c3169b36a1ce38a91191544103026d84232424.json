{"title":"Evaluating the Impact of Green Supply Chain Practices on Sustainable Development in Bangladesh","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2058/v1","date":1719881885000,"content":"This research aims to explore the adoption and impact of green supply chain practices (GSCP) on sustainable development in Bangladesh. The study seeks to understand the current state of GSCP adoption across various industries, identify key drivers and barriers, assess the perceived benefits and challenges, and evaluate the overall impact on environmental sustainability, economic performance, and social well-being. The research employs a qualitative approach, utilizing interviews with key stakeholders, document analysis, and literature review to gather data and insights. Interviews were conducted with representatives from government agencies, businesses, civil society organizations, and academia to obtain diverse perspectives on GSCP adoption and its implications for sustainable development in Bangladesh. The findings reveal a mixed scenario of GSCP adoption across different industries in Bangladesh, with sectors such as textiles leading the way. Key drivers of GSCP adoption include regulatory pressures, market forces, corporate social responsibility initiatives, and financial incentives. However, organizations face significant barriers such as high upfront costs, lack of awareness and expertise, regulatory uncertainty, and supply chain complexity. Despite these challenges, GSCP offer various benefits, including environmental sustainability, economic performance, and social well-being. Successful initiatives demonstrate tangible impacts, highlighting the potential of GSCP to contribute to sustainable development. The research is limited by its qualitative nature and focus on selected industries and stakeholders. Future studies could employ quantitative methods and broader sampling to provide a more comprehensive understanding of GSCP adoption and its implications in Bangladesh. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers, industry leaders, and other stakeholders to promote GSCP adoption and enhance sustainable development in Bangladesh. Strategies for overcoming barriers and maximizing benefits are outlined, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and capacity-building initiatives. GSCP adoption can have positive social implications by promoting ethical labor practices, improving working conditions, and fostering community engagement. By prioritizing sustainability, businesses can contribute to social well-being and inclusive growth. This research contributes to the literature on GSCP adoption and sustainable development in Bangladesh by providing empirical insights and practical recommendations. The study adds to the understanding of the drivers, barriers, benefits, and challenges associated with GSCP adoption, highlighting the importance of integrating environmental, economic, and social considerations in supply chain management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd921e603b7c96d04410286a19c3169b36a1ce38a91191544103026d84232424","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
