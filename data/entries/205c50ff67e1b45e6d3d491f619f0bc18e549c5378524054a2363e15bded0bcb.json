{"title":"Rice SRO1a Contributes to Xanthomonas TAL Effector-mediated Expression of Host Susceptible Genes","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/65/8/1261/7675873?rss=1","date":1715904000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Xanthomonas</span> species infect many important crops and cause huge yield loss. These pathogens deliver transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors into the cytoplasm of plant cells. TAL effectors move to host nuclei, directly bind to the promoters of host susceptible genes, and activate their transcription. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TAL effectors induce host transcription remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that TAL effectors interacted with the SIMILAR TO RCD ONE (SRO) family proteins OsSRO1a and OsSRO1b in nuclei. A transactivation assay using rice protoplasts indicated that OsSRO1a and OsSRO1b enhanced the activation of the <span>OsSWEET14</span> promoter by the TAL effector AvrXa7. The AvrXa7-mediated expression of <span>OsSWEET14</span> was significantly reduced in <span>ossro1a</span> mutants. However, the overexpression of <span>OsSRO1a</span> increased disease resistance by up-regulating the expression of defense-related genes, such as WRKY62 and PBZ1. This was attributed to OsSRO1a and OsSRO1b also enhancing the transcriptional activity of WRKY45, a direct regulator of WRKY62 expression. Therefore, OsSRO1a and OsSRO1b appear to positively contribute to transcription mediated by bacterial TAL effectors and rice transcription factors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant and Cell Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4cc6f9f83376b07c027fd7e94a91f237de774cefb179ee46a5bc732f13bf71a5","entryHash":"205c50ff67e1b45e6d3d491f619f0bc18e549c5378524054a2363e15bded0bcb","category":"Environment"}
