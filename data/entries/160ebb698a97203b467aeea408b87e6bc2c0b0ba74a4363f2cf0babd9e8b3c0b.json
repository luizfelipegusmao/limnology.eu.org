{"title":"Effect of juggling expertise on pointing performance in peripheral vision","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306630","date":1720792800000,"content":"<p>by Tristan Jurkiewicz, Ludovic Delporte, Patrice Revol, Yves Rossetti, Laure Pisella</p>\r\n\r\nJuggling is a very complex activity requiring motor, visual and coordination skills. Expert jugglers experience a “third eye” monitoring leftward and rightward ball zenith positions alternately, in the upper visual fields, while maintaining their gaze straight-ahead. This “third eye” reduces their motor noise (improved body stability and decrease in hand movement variability) as it avoids the numerous head and eye movements that add noise into the system and make trajectories more uncertain. Neuroimaging studies have shown that learning to juggle induces white and grey matter hypertrophy at the posterior intraparietal sulcus. Damage to this brain region leads to optic ataxia, a clinical condition characterised by peripheral pointing bias toward gaze position. We predicted that expert jugglers would, conversely, present better accuracy in a peripheral pointing task. The mean pointing accuracy of expert jugglers was better for peripheral pointing within the upper visual field, compatible with their subjective experience of the “third eye”. Further analyses showed that experts exhibited much less between-subject variability than beginners, reinforcing the interpretation of a vertically asymmetrical calibration of peripheral space, characteristic of juggling and homogenous in the expert group. On the contrary, individual pointing variability did not differ between groups neither globally nor in any sector of space, showing that the reduced motor noise of experts in juggling did not transfer to pointing. It is concluded that the plasticity of the posterior intraparietal sulcus related to juggling expertise does not consist of globally improved visual-to-motor ability. It rather consists of peripheral space calibration by practicing horizontal covert shifts of the attentional spotlight within the upper visual field, between left and right ball zenith positions.","author":"Tristan Jurkiewicz","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"160ebb698a97203b467aeea408b87e6bc2c0b0ba74a4363f2cf0babd9e8b3c0b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
