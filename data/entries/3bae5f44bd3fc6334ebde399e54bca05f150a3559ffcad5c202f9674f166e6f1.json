{"title":"Time for Care: Male and Female Voices Based on Their Caregiving Experiences","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1018/v1","date":1728896760000,"content":"Background/Objectives: To understand the lived experiences of the informal caregivers of people with chronic noncommunicable diseases and their interpretations of the significance of that care. The perspectives of men and women interacting with people in a situation of chronicity are examined. Methods: This qualitative phenomenological-hermeneutic study was based on Van Manen’s comprehensive and interpretative vision. Criterion-oriented non-probability random sampling was used. In-depth interviews were used to collect the information. Twenty caregivers participated in the study. Results: The following five themes emerged: transformation of the caregiver’s world; uncertainty of care; tireless guardianship and unwavering devotion; isolation and emotional exhaustion; and imbalance between caring for others and the self. Conclusions: The experience of informal caregivers reveals that both men and women face significant challenges, albeit from gender-differentiated perspectives and experiences. Men and women elaborate different meanings of caregiving, reflecting their gender roles and expectations. Therefore, an inclusive and equitable approach that recognizes and addresses these gender differences is essential in order to improve the support and quality of life for all informal caregivers, respecting and valuing their unique voices and experiences. An inclusive and equitable approach that recognizes gender intersections is required to improve support and the quality of life for caregivers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bae5f44bd3fc6334ebde399e54bca05f150a3559ffcad5c202f9674f166e6f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
