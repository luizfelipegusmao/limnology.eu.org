The indeterminate FLLs were classified according to the degree of malignancy on a 5-point scale on MRI and combined MRI and CEUS. The final diagnosis was made either pathologically or based on more than one-year follow-up. The diagnostic performance was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the net reclassification improvement (NRI) was calculated.</p> Results <p>A total of 97 patients (mean age, 49 years ± 16, 41 men, 80 benign and 17 malignant lesions) were included. When CEUS was added to MRI, the area under the ROC curve increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (0.87 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.77–0.98] for MRI vs 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87–0.99] for CEUS added to MRI, <i>P</i> = 0.296). The overall NRI was 0.473 (95% CI, 0.100–0.845; <i>P</i> = 0.013): 33.8% (27/80) of benign lesions and 41.2% (7/17) of malignant lesions were appropriately reclassified, whereas 10.0% (8/80) of benign lesions and 17.6% (3/17) of malignant lesions were incorrectly reclassified.</p> Conclusions <p>Although performing CEUS with Sonazoid did not significantly improve the overall diagnostic performance in characterizing indeterminate FLLs on gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI in patients without risk factors for HCC, it may increase radiologist’s confidence in classifying FLLs.</p>","author":"Ji Yoon Ban","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a7d88242c0f0bb99d32dc74b6ba934c3071bb2c6a8270b0c76b2a9d87919f2e1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
