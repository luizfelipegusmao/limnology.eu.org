{"title":"Superconductivity in Carbonaceous Sulfur Hydride:  Further Analysis of Relation between Published AC Magnetic Susceptibility Data and Measured Raw Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202201.0003/v1","date":1728458818000,"content":"In arXiv:2111.15017v1 [1], Dias and Salamat posted some of the measured data for ac magnetic susceptibility of carbonaceous sulfur hydride, a material that was reported in  Nature 586, 373 (2020)  [2] to be   a room temperature superconductor. They provided  additional measured data in arXiv:2111.15017v2 [3]. Here I provide an analysis of these data. The results of this analysis indicate that  the claim  of ref.  [2] that magnetic susceptibility measurements support the conclusion that the material is a room temperature superconductor is not supported by valid underlying data.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ee1b05d43a9d69028dd2f77e9c4632517370abe2481e98cd133d7954d2b1d4b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
