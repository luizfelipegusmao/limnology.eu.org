{"title":"The Role of Propionate-Induced Rearrangement of Membrane Proteins in the Formation of the Virulent Phenotype of Crohn&rsquo;s Disease-Associated Adherent-Invasive Escherichia coli","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1083/v1","date":1723772720000,"content":"Adhesive-invasive E. coli have been suggested to be associated with the development of Crohn's disease (CD). It is assumed that they can provoke the onset of the inflammatory process as a result of the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells, and then, due to survival inside macrophages, stimulate chronic inflammation and the development of granuloma. In previous reports, we have shown that passage of the СD isolate ZvL2 on minimal medium M9 supplemented with sodium propionate (PA) as a carbon source stimulates, and with glucose - inhibits the adherent-invasive properties and the ability to survive in macrophages. This effect was reversible and not observed for the laboratory strain K12 MG1655. We were able to compare the isogenic strain AIEС in two phenotypes - virulent (ZvL2-PA) and non-virulent (ZvL2-GLU). We showed that, unlike ZvL2-GLU, the ZvL2-PA activates the production of ROS and cytokines when interacting with neutrophils. The laboratory strain does not cause a similar effect. Differences in neutrophil NADH-oxidase activation and ζ potential for ZvL2-GLU and ZvL2-PA are associated with changes in the abundance of membrane proteins. Using differential 2D electrophoresis and LC-MS, we identified membrane proteins that may be associated with the activation of the virulence properties of the СD isolate ZvL2.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7a2c8ed54ca97631924d9fd60e65b3d224442ff293eab5e5d184bc37cfbe4ccf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
