{"title":"Optical Particle Tracking in the Pneumatic Conveying of Metal Powders Through a Thin Capillary Pipe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0385/v1","date":1722940688000,"content":"Directed Energy Deposition (DED) processes necessitate a consistent material flow to the melt pool, typically achieved through pneumatic conveying of metal powder via thin pipes. This study aims to record and analyze the multiphase fluid-solid flow. An experimental setup utilizing a high-speed camera and specialized optics was constructed, the flow through thin transparent pipes was recorded. The resulting information was analyzed and compared with coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics - Discrete Element Modeling (CFD-DEM) simulations, with special attention to the solids flow fluctuations. The paper details the experimental design, video analysis using Particle Tracking, and a novel method for deriving volumetric concentrations and flowrate from flat images. The findings confirm the accuracy of the CFD-DEM simulations and provide insights into the dynamics of pneumatic conveying, which could be used to enhance the efficiency of DED processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f745a3542adc87a9da371cf3c0ec344225b6581b5ce857556c161328cd56e9f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
