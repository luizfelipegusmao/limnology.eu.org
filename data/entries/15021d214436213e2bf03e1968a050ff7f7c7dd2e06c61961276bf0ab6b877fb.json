Particularly, in last few decades, global water and sediment quality degraded due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization. This study aimed to determine the concentration of nine heavy metals and metalloid (Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg, As, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and assess the ecological risks using different pollution indices (e.g., heavy metal pollution index [HPI], Nemerow pollution index [NI], geo-accumulation index [Igeo], contamination factor [CF], degree of contamination [CD] and pollution load index [PLI], ecological risk index [ERI]) in water and sediment of the Shitalakshya River, an industrially affected urban river of Bangladesh. For the first time, 20 water and sediment samples were collected across a wider geographical area of the Shitalakshya River during both monsoon and dry seasons and analyzed using the atomic absorption spectrometer. Average concentrations of heavy metals and metalloid in water were within the Bangladesh standard except for Cr (51.69 ppb) and Mn (228.20 ppb) during monsoon season, portraying potential ecological and human health risks. Besides, average concentration of Mn (549.75 and 370.93 ppb), Ni (549.75 and 370.93 ppb), and Cu (45.34 and 36.09 ppb) in sediment during both seasons were above international standard, implying risk to aquatic sediment biota. The average HPI values indicated moderate to high contamination, whereas the NI values implied polluted water in monsoon season with severe pollution in port area of the river. Similarly, Igeo, CF, CD, and PLI elucidated different levels of contamination in the sediment, particularly during dry season. The ERI values also referred moderate ecological risk in the sediment during dry season. Overall, our findings highlight the alarming level of heavy metal pollution in the Shitalakshya River, necessitating immediate action to protect the aquatic environment, sediment biota, and human health.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nThis study determined the concentration of heavy metals and metalloid in water and sediment of the Shitalakshya River, Bangladesh.\nThe study revealed that the average concentration of Cr and Mn in water exceeded national standard, whereas Mn, Ni, and Cu in sediment exceeded international limit.\nPotential ecological risk of heavy metals was also assessed using different pollution indices.\nCalculated pollution indices indicated different degree of pollution, implying critical ecological condition due to heavy metal pollution in aquatic environment and sediment biota.\n</p>","author":"Booshra Ahmed, \nShamaila Islam, \nShamshad Begum Quraishi, \nMd.
