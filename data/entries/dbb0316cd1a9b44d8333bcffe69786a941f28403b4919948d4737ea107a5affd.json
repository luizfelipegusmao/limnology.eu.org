{"title":"Descartes&rsquo; Error with Training for Dive Rescue","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0823/v1","date":1710411068000,"content":"Introduction: While preparing for dive exams, divers are trained to perform rescue exercises. Currently, divers think they will manage and control their body at any time.Methods: At the bottom of the water, the student takes the instructor who simulates a sickness, up to the surface, by controlling the going up. Then, if the exercise is wrong, both divers go down and exercise again. If the exercise is successful, both divers go down to perform another exercise until they are tired or until they have no more air. Results: I discovered that there was a mistake in the preparation of divers for rescue training due to Descartes’ error, “I think, thus I am”, which is part of our collective memory. Going up and going down after a sickness simulation is a repetitive action of the body and going down is therefore part of the automatisms of rescue, which is very dangerous. Conclusions: The body is not necessarily controlled by the present thinking, and if divers forget sickness while going up in a real rescue situation, they will go down automatically because their bodies were trained like this. In addition, it is very easy to forget sickness. Divers should not go down after rescue, they should be on the dive boat or on the land. Descartes’ error has to be reversed: “I am, thus I think” is right. The divers’ rescue exercises must be simplified and divers should never go down after the simulation of a sickness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbb0316cd1a9b44d8333bcffe69786a941f28403b4919948d4737ea107a5affd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
