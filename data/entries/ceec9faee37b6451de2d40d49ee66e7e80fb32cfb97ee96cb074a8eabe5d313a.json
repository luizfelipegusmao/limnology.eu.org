{"title":"Celebrating the American Society of Plant Biologists centennial anniversary: A compendium of review articles in plant biology","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/1/7636950?rss=1","date":1711584000000,"content":"<span>This year we celebrate 100 years of the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB; formerly the American Society of Plant Physiologists). A major motivation for the society was the intent to publish a journal devoted to plant physiology (<a href=\"#kiae141-B13\">Hanson 1989</a>), and the first issue of <span>Plant Physiology</span> was published in January 1926. <span>The Plant Cell</span> began publication in January 1989, to fill a gap in the rapidly progressing areas of modern plant molecular cell and developmental biology (<a href=\"#kiae141-B12\">Goldberg et al. 2019</a>). To celebrate the 100-year milestone of ASPB and the society's role in the publication of the highest-quality plant science over the ensuing years, we are pleased to present, in this issue of both journals, a compendium of review articles covering a range of topics in plant biology. The list of topics was divided more or less randomly between the 2 journals, and in each case, a more senior author was invited and asked to consider, where feasible, bringing on board one or more early- or mid-career coauthors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ceec9faee37b6451de2d40d49ee66e7e80fb32cfb97ee96cb074a8eabe5d313a","category":"Environment"}
