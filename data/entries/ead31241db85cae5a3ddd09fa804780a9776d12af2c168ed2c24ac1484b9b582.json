{"title":"Using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for Non-functional Requirements","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1061/v1","date":1718603858000,"content":"Context: In Software Engineering, there must be clarity in communication among interested parts to elicit the requirements aimed at software development through frameworks to achieve the behaviors expected by the software. Problem: Lack of clarity in the requirements elicitation stage can impact subsequent stages of software development. Solution: We proposed a case study to achieve the proposed goal focusing on the performance efficiency characteristic expressed in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 25010 Standard using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Method: The case study was performed with professionals who use BDD to elicit the non-functional requirements of a company that develops software. Summary of Results: The results obtained were aspects related to the elicitation of non-functional requirements aimed at the performance efficiency characteristic of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 25010 Standard using BDD through the point of view of industry professionals. Contributions and impact: The articleâ€™s main contribution is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using BDD to elicit non-functional requirements about the performance efficiency characteristic of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 25010 Standard.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ead31241db85cae5a3ddd09fa804780a9776d12af2c168ed2c24ac1484b9b582","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
