As fintech has been widely accepted, the art market has undergone transformations, including increased transaction transparency, enhanced liquidity, improved risk management capabilities, reduced entry barriers to the market, and more developed copyright protection. Using a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, this paper clarifies the significant effects of fintech, especially the NFTs, on the size and profitability of the art market. The findings not only emphasize the importance of NFTs in developing the art market and increasing investment returns but also provide insights and constructive suggestions for the future growth and sustainable development of the art market. By fostering transparency, efficiency, and accessibility, fintech contributes to a more resilient and sustainable art market, ensuring its long-term prosperity and cultural enrichment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"48e9403ce556ff71520858fa1c3c2d2efb8a973241b2e4f5a0a2650efd4be3de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
