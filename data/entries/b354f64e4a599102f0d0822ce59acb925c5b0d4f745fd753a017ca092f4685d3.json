{"title":"Subjective perception of visual field defects using random noise-moving images in patients with glaucoma: A comparison of computer graphics and analog noises","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303849","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Arata Inoue, Eiko Koike, Naoyuki Maeda, Chota Matsumoto</p>\r\nPurpose <p>Random noise-moving images (noises) can make glaucoma patients with no subjective symptoms aware of visual field abnormalities. To explore this concept, we developed a noise using computer graphics (CG) and investigated the difference in the subjective perception of visual field abnormalities between CG and conventional analog noises.</p> Methods <p>We enrolled individuals with glaucoma (205 eyes), preperimetric glaucoma (PPG; 19 eyes), and normal eyes (35 eyes). For a CG noise, a series of still images was made by randomly selecting five monochromatic tones on 2-mm square dots, and these images were drawn at 60 frames per second (fps) to create a noise-moving image. The participants were asked to describe their perceived shadows on a paper. The results were categorized as follows based on the pattern deviation probability map of the Humphrey field analyzer (HFA): “agreement,” “partial agreement,” “disagreement,” and “no response.” The glaucoma stage was classified into four stages, from M1 to M4, based on the HFA’s mean deviation.</p> Result <p>The detection rates (agreement and partial agreement) were 80.5% and 65.4% for the CG and analog noises, respectively, with CG noise showing a significantly higher detection rate in all glaucoma eyes (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The detection rates tended to increase as the glaucoma stage progressed, and in Stage M3, these were 93.9% and 78.8% for the CG and analog noises, respectively. The PPG eyes did not exhibit subjective abnormalities for both noises. The specificity values were 97.1% and 100% for the CG and analog noises, respectively.</p> Conclusion <p>The CG noise is more effective than the analog noise in evaluating the subjective perception of visual field abnormalities in patients with glaucoma.</p>","author":"Arata Inoue","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b354f64e4a599102f0d0822ce59acb925c5b0d4f745fd753a017ca092f4685d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
