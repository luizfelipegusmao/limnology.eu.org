In this study, the gut microbiota of postparturient dams was compared with that of their offspring in three Finnish pig farms at three growth phases. The differences in fecal microbiota of three study development groups (Good, Poorly, and PrematureDeath) were analyzed at birth (initial exposure phase), weaning (transitional phase), and before slaughter (stable phase). Dam <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> abundance was lower than in piglets at birth. <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> and <i>Lactobacillus amylovorus</i> were dominantly expressed in dams and their offspring. Altogether 17 piglets (68%) were identified with <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> at the initial exposure phase, divided unevenly among the development groups: 85% of Good, 37.5% of Poorly, and 75% of PrematureDeath pigs. The development group Good was identified with the highest microbial diversity, whereas the development group PrematureDeath had the lowest diversity. After weaning, the abundance and versatility of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> in piglets diminished, shifting towards the microbiome of the dam. In conclusion, the fecal microbiota of pigs tends to develop towards a similar alpha and beta diversity despite development group and rearing environment.","author":"Emilia König","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"07484ddbc68003531e6f059dc90888dd567e7ef2d79354f6e6ed03f9347edf69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
