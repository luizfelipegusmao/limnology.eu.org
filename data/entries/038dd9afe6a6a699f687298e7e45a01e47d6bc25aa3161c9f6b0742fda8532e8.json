{"title":"Punctuated evolution of bill morphology in the largest family of songbirds (Thraupidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/doi/10.1093/ornithology/ukae001/7517515?rss=1","date":1705017600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>We assessed correlations between speciation rate and bill morphology in an ecologically diverse and continental-scale songbird radiation, the tanagers (Thraupidae). Our analyses showed that bill size, shape, and their evolutionary rates are not correlated with speciation rate. However, we did find evidence that each axis of variation in bill morphology diversifies at speciation events interspersed with periods of gradual evolution, consistent with a punctuated equilibrium model of character change. To determine correlations, we incorporated a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny and high-resolution three-dimensional surface scans of bill structure from museum study skins. Overall, our findings suggest that bill size and shape diversify in association with the speciation process, but not through any effect on the rate of speciation. Previous studies have shown other traits, such as song, ecological niche, and plumage do influence speciation and, ultimately, species richness in tanagers.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Ornithology Current Issue","siteHash":"4b42e15d9ceec568e037973cb16bc8a0448c103c6eaf3f714117d3650f8eefe7","entryHash":"038dd9afe6a6a699f687298e7e45a01e47d6bc25aa3161c9f6b0742fda8532e8","category":"Environment"}
