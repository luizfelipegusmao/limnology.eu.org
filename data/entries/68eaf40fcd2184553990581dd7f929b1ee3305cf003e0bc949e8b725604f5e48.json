{"title":"Why It Remains Statistically Probable That SARS-CoV-2 Was Isolated and Then Accidentally Lab-Leaked before the First COVID-19 Outbreak","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1184/v1","date":1718693328000,"content":"The SARS-CoV-2-induced acute COVID-19 pandemic disorder seems to have begun all of the sudden in 2020, with very little data available regarding prior times in which people experienced mysterious flu-like illness symptoms characteristic of the pandemic disease. The scientific community seems to be divided into a few parts with regards to the belief of the kind of viral origins. A significant number of scientists believe that the virus solely has natural origins and that it underwent a thorough process of zoonosis, independent of laboratory research-based research that would only catalyse zoonosis due to helping the virus gain additional function of transmission and virulence. Many other scientists believe that the virus has wide origins characteristic of “gain-of-function” laboratory research, whilst many other scientists believe that most of the viral genome has natural origins, with the zoonotic process having been artificially catalysed only in its latter part of transmission to humans. Considerable extent of scientific evidence suggests that the virus underwent a restricted, but considerable extent of “gain-of-function” research, prior to having been accidentally leaked into the nearby environment, whilst its process of zoonotic spillover into humans was influenced by such events, given for example the multidimensional pathogenetic process displayed by the virus and its main antigen of action, the spike glycoprotein, causing all kinds of immune pathophysiology - including transient immunosuppression. Investigations into the origins of the novel coronavirus have been lasting for years, seemingly with no concrete end in sight, and the available molecular testing methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection displaying less than perfect results have not significantly helped the process. Evidence even started pointing toward the existence of artificial, laboratory research-based viral origins, exposing a probable accidentally-induced artificial process of “accelerated viral evolution”, which could be particularly dangerous because of the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic agent. Likewise, it is possible that the prevention of distribution of scientific data regarding scenarios as such in fact constitutes censorship, rather than regulation of data that may be considered not to be significantly evidence based. Simultaneously, it is important not to regard all hypotheses and preliminary reports of scientific research as evidence-based, but to ensure that due diligence is performed in all cases. The integrity of scientific research and ultimately of the innovation process of medical solutions depends on the integrity of democracy and the rule of law, as well as on regulating partnerships with scientific companies from world nations where autocracy rules their society.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68eaf40fcd2184553990581dd7f929b1ee3305cf003e0bc949e8b725604f5e48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
