{"title":"&ldquo;The State of the Art of Digital Twins in Health &ndash; A Quick Review of the Literature&rdquo;","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1922/v1","date":1719463539000,"content":"A Digital Twin can be understood as a representation of a real asset, in other words, a virtual replica of a physical object, process or even a system. As virtual models, they can integrate with all the latest technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), among others. Digital twins have applications in a wide range of sectors, from manufacturing and engineering to healthcare. They have been used in managing healthcare facilities , streamlining care processes, personalizing treatments , and enhancing patient recovery . By analyzing data from sensors and other sources, healthcare professionals can develop virtual models of patients, organs, and human systems, experimenting with various strategies to identify the most effective approach. This approach can lead to more targeted and efficient therapies while reducing the risk of collateral effects . Digital twin technology can also be used to generate a virtual replica of a hospital to review operational strategies, capabilities, personnel, and care models to identify areas for improvement, predict future challenges, and optimize organizational strategies. The potential impact of this tool on our society and its well-being is quite significant. This article explores how digital twins are being used in healthcare. The article also introduces some discussions on the impact of this use and future research and technology development projections for the use of digital twins in the healthcare sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96ae96c2af8cf4795f7775a3b98a235004c837e70e2068eeac45672bb6004118","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
