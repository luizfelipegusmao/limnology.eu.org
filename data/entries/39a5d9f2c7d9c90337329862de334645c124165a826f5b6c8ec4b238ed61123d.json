{"title":"33 An evaluation of Oklahoma beef producer decision factors regarding the implementation of calf best management practices","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/8/7617916?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Oklahoma State Ag Economics and Animal Science Specialists implement the Oklahoma Beef Management and Marketing Survey approximately every 5 yr. Data from the 2017 survey indicated that 82% of producers practiced castration, 87% dewormed, 75% trained calves to feed bunks, 63% weaned calves for a minimum of 45 days, and 49% administered two rounds of respiratory vaccinations (Barnes et al., 2023). Using data from the 2017 survey, the objectives of this study were to evaluate incentives and constraints to producer implementation of calf best management practices and to analyze relationships between individual management practices and marketing calves at weaning ( &lt; 30 d weaned) or following a weaning period (â‰¥ 30 d weaned). Management practices evaluated included castration, deworming, feed bunk training, a minimum 45-d weaning period, and the administration of two rounds of respiratory vaccines. A total of 1,495 surveys were returned. When asked to indicate management incentives (why the practice was implemented), n = 1,375, n = 1,348, n = 1,070, n = 937, and n = 937 responses were recorded regarding castration, deworming, bunk training, 45-d weaning period, and respiratory vaccination, respectively. Survey data indicated 30%, 17%, 18%, 21%, and 21% of respondents felt that buyers paid a premium for the practices of castration, deworming, bunk training, 45-d weaning period, and respiratory vaccination, respectively. Survey responses illustrated that 22% and 19% of producers felt that deworming and bunk training, respectively, improved calf marketability. A total of 12% of respondents indicated that announcing days weaned and vaccination history at the time of sale improved calf value. When asked to indicate constraints to implementing management practices, n = 211, n = 277, n = 258, n = 388, and n = 542 responses were recorded regarding castration, deworming, bunk training, 45-d weaning period, and respiratory vaccination, respectively. According to survey results 15%, 26%, 20%, 17%, and 25% of producers felt that castration, deworming, bunk training, 45-d weaning period, or administering respiratory vaccinations, respectively, provided no benefit to their operations. Data illustrated that 7%, 9%, 10%, 9%, and 9% of respondents were unaware of any added value for the practices of castration, deworming, bunk training, 45-d weaning period, and administering respiratory vaccines. Relationships between the management practices of castration, deworming, and providing respiratory vaccines and the decision to market calves at weaning or post-weaning were evaluated. Data indicated weak significant negative correlation coefficients of -0.25, -0.28, and -0.21 for castration, deworming, and respiratory vaccines, respectively, and marketing at weaning. Conversely, weak significant positive correlations of 0.25, 0.30, and 0.25, respectively, were observed for castration, deworming, and respiratory vaccines with marketing post-weaning. A substantial percentage of producers subscribed to calf best management practices. However, because the observed correlation coefficients were weaker than expected producer education regarding optimal marketing strategies may lead to an improvement in capturing market premiums related to management practices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"39a5d9f2c7d9c90337329862de334645c124165a826f5b6c8ec4b238ed61123d","category":"Environment"}
