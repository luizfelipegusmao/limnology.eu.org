{"title":"Effects of the Position and Size of the Air Injection Holes in the Flow Structure of a Trapped Vortex Combustor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1586/v1","date":1729514397000,"content":"The efficiency and the flame stabilization are two of the main parameters in the design of combustors according to the current policies imposed to the commercial aircraft industry. An alternative for flame stabilization and high efficiency in the combustion process in combustors is the concept of trapped vortex combustor (TVC). The objective of this study is to determine the optimal location and size of the injection holes for the airflow supplied to a TVC by means of a numerical simulation for non-reactive flow. The results showed a two vortex flow structures in the cavity that change their size and intensity according to the allocation and size of the injection holes. The total pressure lost, flow stability, velocity distribution, vortex size and intensity were the parameters for evaluating the different configurations. The optimal behavior was for a set of air injection holes at the top fore wall of the cavity in combination with a second set located at the bottom of the after wall.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"445132a0557e15e8840115610ebec3f1e17a403a4bcb28b873d4c464969b4c54","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
