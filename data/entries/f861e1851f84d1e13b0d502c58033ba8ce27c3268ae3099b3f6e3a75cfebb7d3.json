{"title":"The Meioflume: A New System for Observing the Interstitial Behavior of Meiofauna","link":"https://academic.oup.com/iob/article/doi/10.1093/iob/obae016/7682412?rss=1","date":1716595200000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Meiofauna (benthic invertebrates &lt; 1 mm in size) facilitate sediment biogeochemical cycling, alter sediment microbial community structure, and serve as an important trophic link between benthic micro- and macrofauna, yet the behaviors that mechanistically link individuals to their ecological effects are largely unknown. Meiofauna are small and sediments are opaque, making observing the <span>in situ</span> activities of these animals challenging. We developed the Meioflume, a small, acrylic flow tunnel filled with grains of cryolite, a transparent sand analog, to simulate the <span>in situ</span> conditions experienced by meiofauna in an observable lab environment. The Meioflume has a working area (28.57 mm × 10.16 mm × 1 mm) that is small enough to quickly locate fauna and clearly observe behavior but large enough that animals are not tightly confined. When connected to a syringe press, the Meioflume can produce low velocity flows consistently and evenly across the width of its working area while retaining the contents. To demonstrate its functionality in observing the behavior of meiofauna, we placed individual meiofaunal animals (a protodrilid annelid, a harpacticoid copepod, and a platyhelminth flatworm) in Meioflumes and filmed their behavioral response to a sudden initiation of porewater flow. All animals were clearly visible within the flume and could be observed responding to the onset of flow. The design and construction of the Meioflume make it an accessible, affordable tool for researchers. This experimental system could be modified to address many questions in meiofaunal ecology, such as studying behavior in response to chemical cues, allowing us to observe meiofaunal behaviors to better understand their ecological effects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative Organismal Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"ad96bcf7a80ab7e3a1a88c34298d761f9695964c0badbbef4e1166baa6580fcc","entryHash":"f861e1851f84d1e13b0d502c58033ba8ce27c3268ae3099b3f6e3a75cfebb7d3","category":"Environment"}
