{"title":"Novel Fermentates Can Enhance Key Immune Responses Associated with Viral Immunity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1515/v1","date":1711436581000,"content":"Fermented foods have long been known to have immunomodulatory capabilities and fermentates derived from the lactic acid bacteria of dairy products can modulate the immune system. We have used skimmed milk powder to generate novel fermentates using Lb. helveticus strains SC234 and SC232 and we demonstrate here that these fermentates can enhance key immune mechanisms that are critical to the immune response to viruses. We show that our novel fermentates SC234 and SC232 can positively impact on cytokine and chemokine secretion, nitric oxide (NO) production, cell surface marker expression, and phagocytosis in macrophage models. We demonstrate that fermentates SC234 and SC232 increase the secretion of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-27, and IL-10, promote an M1 proinflammatory phenotype for viral immunity via NO induction, decreases chemokine expression of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP), increasing cell surface marker expression, and enhance phagocytosis in comparison to their starting material. These data suggest that these novel fermentates have potential as novel functional food ingredients for the treatment, management and control of viral infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f13bd49b257a291cbd15ba5a32a77c8db27eeb1e8af7b7fe934f6ce3d4df53e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
