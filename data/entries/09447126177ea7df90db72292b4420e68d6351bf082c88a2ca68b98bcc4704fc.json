{"title":"Orthopedic Challenges in a Pediatric Case of Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis (Cipa): A Case Report of 3 Years Old Female Patient","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1374/v1","date":1729153804000,"content":"Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), also known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN IV), is an exceedingly rare genetic disorder characterized by the inability to perceive pain, inability to sweat, and various neurological and orthopedic complications. This is a case report of a 3-year-old female patient diagnosed with CIPA syndrome who presented repeatedly to Childrenâ€™s Clinical University Hospital (CCUH) in Riga, Latvia with severe orthopedic manifestations. The patient had repeated fractures, several surgeries, and extensive spread of the disease throughout the left leg, which caused significant functional impairment and decreased quality of life. Despite aggressive orthopedic interventions including surgical interventions and physical therapy, the patient's condition remained challenging to manage due to the inherent limitations posed by the insensitivity to pain. The council of doctors discussed the patient's condition and changes, deciding that reconstructive surgery is not feasible, and amputation is recommended. Through this case report, we aim to highlight the unique orthopedic challenges encountered in the management of CIPA patients, emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving orthopedic surgeons, pediatricians, geneticists, and physiotherapists. Additionally, we discuss the need for further research to elucidate optimal management strategies and improve outcomes in this rare and complex patient population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09447126177ea7df90db72292b4420e68d6351bf082c88a2ca68b98bcc4704fc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
