{"title":"Bioaccessibility of Metals of Lead and Steel Shot and Soils at the Area of Shooting Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0426/v1","date":1717740145000,"content":"By using a two-stage physiologically based extraction test (PBET) and (W-PBET), the authors of this paper have estimated the bioaccessibility of metals (Pb and Fe) and their compounds in the GI tract of waterfowl and mammals. It has been shown that the metals (Pb and Fe) have low bioaccessibility; combined with the short time of shot exposition at the GI tract, this eliminates the risk of toxic effects in the case of shot ingestion by waterfowl. It has also been discovered that there is a significant difference in the bioaccessibility of metals and their compounds. A model was proposed and tested to predict the toxic effects of lead on biological objects depending on the threshold mass of consumption. This model takes into account data on the bioavailability of lead and regulatory values indicating dangerous concentrations of lead.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"588b64bacbbcecb28158ebbcc837bf8fb52aef8c875c7bfc55287a34a77a49b9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
