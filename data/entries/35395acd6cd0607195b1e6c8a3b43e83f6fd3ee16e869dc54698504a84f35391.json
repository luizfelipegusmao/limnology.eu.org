{"title":"Green Solvent-Assisted Fabrication of CNT-Enhanced PLA Nano  Biocomposite for 3D Printed Biosensors","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1541/v1","date":1729497931000,"content":"The current study explores for the first time an eco-friendly solution casting method using a green solvent, Ethyl Acetate, to prepare feedstock/filaments from Polylactic Acid (PLA) biopolymer reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), followed by 3D printing and surface activation for biosensing applications. Comprehensive thermal, electrical, rheological, microstructural, and mechanical properties of developed feedstock and 3D printed parts were performed and analyzed. Herein, adding 2 wt.% CNTs to the PLA matrix marked the electrical percolation, achieving conductivity of 8.3Ã—10-3 S.m-1, thanks to the uniform distribution of CNTs within the PLA matrix facilitated by the solution casting method. Rheological assessments paralleled these findings; the addition of 2 wt.% CNTs transitioned the nanocomposite from liquid-like to a solid-like behavior with a percolated network structure, significantly elevating rheological properties compared to composite with 1 wt.% CNTs. Mechanical evaluations of the printed samples revealed improvement in tensile strength and modulus compared to virgin PLA by a uniform distribution of 2 wt.% CNTs into PLA, with an increase of 14.5% and 10.3%, respectively. To further enhance the electrical conductivity and sensing capabilities of developed samples, an electrochemical surface activation treatment was applied to as-printed nanocomposite samples. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis confirmed that this surface activation effectively exposed the CNTs to the surface of 3D-printed parts by removing a thin layer of polymer from the surface, thereby optimizing the composite's electroconductivity performance. The findings of this study underscore the potential of the proposed eco-friendly method in developing advanced 3D printed bio nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes and biopolymers, using a green solution casting and cost-effective material extrusion 3D printing method, for electrochemical sensing applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35395acd6cd0607195b1e6c8a3b43e83f6fd3ee16e869dc54698504a84f35391","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
