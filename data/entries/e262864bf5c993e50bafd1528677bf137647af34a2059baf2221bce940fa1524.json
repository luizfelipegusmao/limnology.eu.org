{"title":"Let&rsquo;s Get Biophysical &ndash; How to Get Your Favorite Protein&rsquo;s Digits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0781/v1","date":1718196141000,"content":"In these days of information overload and high-throughput analysis, it is easy to lose focus on the study of individual proteins. It is our conjecture that such investigations are still crucially important and offer uniquely penetrative insights. We thus present a discussion of biophysical methods to allow readers to get to know their protein of interest better. Although this perspective is not written with the expert in mind, we hope that for interdisciplinary scientists, or researchers who do not routinely perform biophysical analyses, the content will be helpful and inspiring.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e262864bf5c993e50bafd1528677bf137647af34a2059baf2221bce940fa1524","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
