{"title":"Evaluating Wireless Network Technologies (3G, 4G, 5G) and Their Infrastructure: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1331/v1","date":1729150703000,"content":"Wireless network technologies, including 3G, 4G, and 5G, are transforming telecommunications infrastructure globally. However, the adoption and effectiveness of these technologies vary significantly across regions and industries, posing unique challenges and opportunities for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Understanding the critical factors influencing network deployment and optimization in different contexts is essential for telecom companies and business leaders. This systematic review aims to evaluate the infrastructure, performance, and strategic implications of wireless network technologies (3G, 4G, and 5G) across multiple industries and geographic regions, providing insights for SMEs and telecom companies on adopting these technologies to enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness. A comprehensive search of academic databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, was conducted using keywords such as “wireless network,” “3G,” “4G,” “5G,” “evaluation,” and “infrastructure.” Studies were selected based on pre-established eligibility criteria, and a risk of bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Statistical synthesis and sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify key trends and challenges. A total of 121 studies were included, with the majority focusing on 5G technology (42%) and its infrastructure. Key findings highlight the importance of network densification, high-speed connectivity, and low-latency applications, particularly in urban regions. The analysis also revealed significant regional disparities in infrastructure deployment, with developing countries facing challenges in expanding coverage and integrating advanced technologies. Industry-specific customization of wireless networks is essential for sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, and retail. Wireless network technologies present vast opportunities for SMEs, but their successful implementation requires addressing regional infrastructure gaps and tailoring solutions to industry-specific needs. Telecom companies must prioritize strategic investments in network densification, scalability, and security to fully leverage the benefits of 5G. The findings of this review provide actionable insights for business leaders and policymakers aiming to optimize wireless technology deployments for enhanced performance and competitiveness.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d278e89726f2e995d1274c6852923899cd7fedaa319899f43861676f34609bb8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
