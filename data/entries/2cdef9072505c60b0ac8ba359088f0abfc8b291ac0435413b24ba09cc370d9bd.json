{"title":"Brilliant Blue Discoloration by Ozonation. Kinetic Modelling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1187/v1","date":1726474500000,"content":"This paper presents the results of investigations on the kinetic of Brilliant Blue FCF (BB) discoloration reactions in aqueous solutions with different ozone concentrations and pH conditions. Kinetic studies involve knowledge of the structure and properties of the dye and ozone, as well as the experimental conditions. In general, scientists admit that the predominant oxidation pathway is direct (by free oxygen atoms) or indirect (by free hydroxyl radicals), it will depend on influencing factors such as: the physicochemical properties of the dye, the pH of the aqueous solution, ozone concentration, reaction time and the contact mode with/without stirring. In the experimental research, two pathways were chosen following CBB = f(t): 1. constant dye concentration and different ozone concentration on the concentration range (100 - 250 mg/L) at three pH media (acidic, neutral and basic) with and without stirring; 2. Constant concentration of ozone and different dye in the range of concentrations (2.5 - 10 mg/L) under the conditions of point 1. With obtained experimental data the curves CBB = f(t) were drawn and were processed by the integral method of classical kinetic based on first and second order equations. Unfortunately, this simple procedure this not yield any minim full results and any pH level. The rate constants been negative and/or the reaction order been dependent on initial conditions. Due to its structure, the BB dye has several chromophore groups, thus multiple attack centers, resulting in more oxidation by-products, which is why the 1H - NMR spectrum of BB discoloration with ozone was recorded.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2cdef9072505c60b0ac8ba359088f0abfc8b291ac0435413b24ba09cc370d9bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
