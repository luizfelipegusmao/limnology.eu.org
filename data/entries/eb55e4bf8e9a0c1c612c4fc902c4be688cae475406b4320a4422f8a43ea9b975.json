{"title":"Fresh Herbs Addition to Fresh-Cut Iceberg Lettuce: Impact on Quality and Storability","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0588/v1","date":1718022736000,"content":"The aim of this study was to develop a ready-to-eat vegetable-herb mixes with high nutritional and sensory values, as well as good storability. In this regard the suitability of fresh herbs (peppermint, oregano, green basil, red basil, and parsley) was tested for use in mixes with fresh-cut iceberg lettuce. Lettuce-herb mixtures were stored for 6 days at 5°C.\nThe reason for the decrease in the appearance of the salads was the browning of the cut surface of the lettuce, as well as discoloration on the cut herbs.  Comparing the storage ability of cut herbs, red basil and parsley retained the best appearance for 6 d at 5 °C. A small addition of herbs to fresh-cut iceberg lettuce caused a significant increase in contents of pro-health ingredients in the mixes. There were large discrepancies in the sensory quality of the mixes, but the highest quality and consumer acceptance were found for salads with parsley (5% and 10%) and red basil (5%). After harvest, the fresh herbs were more contaminated by molds than the iceberg lettuce. Bacterial, yeast and mold contamination increased during storage, but the rate of mold growth was much lower in the mixes with parsley compared to lettuce alone.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb55e4bf8e9a0c1c612c4fc902c4be688cae475406b4320a4422f8a43ea9b975","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
