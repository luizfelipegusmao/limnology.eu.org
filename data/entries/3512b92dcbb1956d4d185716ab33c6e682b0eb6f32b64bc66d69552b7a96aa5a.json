{"title":"Dietary Supplementation of Pistacia lentiscus: Hepato‐Protective Potential Against 7,12‐ dimethylbenz(a)anthracene Carcinogen in C57Bl/6 Mice, Alongside In Vitro Anti‐Cancer Efficacy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0726/v1","date":1712747011000,"content":"The pervasive presence of atmospheric pollution, particularly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, instigates aberrant cellular and tissue conditions, precipitating oxidative damage and inflammatory cascades conducive to the onset of cancer, notably mammary cancer. Given the hepatic metabolism of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, the imperative of employing natural antioxidants becomes apparent. In this study, we delve into the antioxidant and hepato-protective properties of Pistacia lentiscus against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced toxicity, alongside exploring its potential anticancer attributes. Our investigations unveil Pistacia lentiscus's anti-proliferative efficacy against human breast cancer cell lines. Notably, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-intoxication escalates body weight, disrupts lipid profiles, and incites serum oxidative damage. Concurrently, hepatic and renal oxidative stress ensue, accompanied by heightened antioxidant enzyme activity in the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-exposed-group compared to controls (p&amp;lt;0.05). Nonetheless, Pistacia lentiscus co-administration rectifies biochemical imbalances, significantly attenuates oxidative stress aberrations, and augments antioxidant enzyme responses (p&amp;lt;0.05). Importantly, histological analysis evinces Pistacia lentiscus's shielding effect against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene induced hepatocyte injury and steatosis. Our findings underscore Pistacia lentiscus's robust anti-proliferative, antioxidant, and hepato-protective capacities, mitigating metabolic disturbances, oxidative stress propagation in liver and kidney functions, and potential histological alterations, thereby impeding 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced mammary cancer initiation. We posit that Pistacia lentiscus may serve as a prophylactic agent against breast cancer instigated by this carcinogen.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3512b92dcbb1956d4d185716ab33c6e682b0eb6f32b64bc66d69552b7a96aa5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
