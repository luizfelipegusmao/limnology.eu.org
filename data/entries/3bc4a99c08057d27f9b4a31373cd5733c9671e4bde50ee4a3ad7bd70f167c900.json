{"title":"Edible Alginate- Lecithin Films Enriched with Different Coffee Bean Extracts: Formulation, Non-Cytotoxic, Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Microbial Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0244/v1","date":1728021963000,"content":"The aim of the study was to analyze the functional properties of newly obtained films based on sodium alginate and lecithin with the addition of antioxidant-rich coffee extracts, and to verify their potential as safe edible food packaging materials. In our study we developed alginate-lecithin films enriched with green or roasted coffee bean extracts. The roasting process of coffee beans had a significant impact on the total phenolic content (TPC) in the studied extracts. The highest value of TPC (134.86 mg GAE/L) as well as antioxidant activity (AA) (0.88 mM T/L) was observed for the extract of light roasted coffee beans. Films with addition of medium roasted coffee extracts and baseline films had the highest tensile strength (21.21±0.73 N). The addition of coffee extract improved the barrier properties of films against UV light by a decrease in transmittance values (200-400 nm), regardless of the type of extract added. Studies on Caco-2, HepG2 and BJ cells shown that digestated films were non-cytotoxic materials (100-0,1 ug/mL) and had no negative effect on cell viability, an increase was noted for all cell lines, the highest after 48-hours in dose 1 ug/mL for film with medium-roasted coffee (194.43±38.30) for Caco-2. The tested films at 20% digestate concentrations demonstrated the ability to reduce nitric oxide (NO) production in the RAW264.7 cell line by 25 to 60% compared to the control. Each of the tested films with coffee extracts had growth inhibitory properties towards selected species of bacteria.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3bc4a99c08057d27f9b4a31373cd5733c9671e4bde50ee4a3ad7bd70f167c900","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
