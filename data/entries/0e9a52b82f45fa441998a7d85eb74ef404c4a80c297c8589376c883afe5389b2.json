{"title":"Polo-Like Kinase-1 as a Potential Prognostic Marker of Prostate Cancer Utilizing ORIEN Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1074/v1","date":1728913346000,"content":"Polo-Like Kinase-1 (PLK1) is a key regulator of the G2/M cell cycle and has been linked to treatment resistance in prostate cancer (PCa). This study aimed to explore the correlation between PLK1 expression, determined through RNA-seq analysis, and clinical outcomes in PCa patients. We analyzed tumor samples from 452 patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma between 2014 and 2020, sourced from nine institutions affiliated with the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN). PLK1 expression levels were determined using RNA-seq data and stratified into high (â‰¥75th percentile) vs. low (&lt;75th percentile) expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models compared overall survival between patients with low vs. high PLK1 expression, adjusting for age, race, PSA, and stage. Of the 452 tumors, 241 (53.3%) had high PLK1 and 211 (46.7%) had low PLK1 expression. Median follow-up was 2.74 years for low PLK1 and 2.71 years for high PLK1. No significant difference in overall survival was observed between low and high PLK1 groups in univariate (p=0.86; HR 1.09) or multivariate (p=1.0; HR 0.99) analyses. This study found no association between RNA-seq-based PLK1 expression and prognosis in PCa. PLK1 expression is not a prognostic marker for prostate cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0e9a52b82f45fa441998a7d85eb74ef404c4a80c297c8589376c883afe5389b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
