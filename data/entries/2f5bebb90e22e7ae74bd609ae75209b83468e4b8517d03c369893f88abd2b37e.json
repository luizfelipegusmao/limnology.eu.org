{"title":"Linguistic and Cultural Adaptation of a Self-Determination Scale for People With Intellectual Disabilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0856/v1","date":1720684641000,"content":"The main objective of this study was the adaptation of the scale named AUTODDIS in the cultural and social dimensions and analyze its reliability and validity. The reliability and validity were assessed through a pilot study conducted with a population of students with intellectual disabilities. The linguistic adaptation was done through expert judgment, including each indicator: the adequacy, the coherence, the relevance, and the clarity. After the scale adaptation, the scale pilot was conducted to explore its technical properties. It was performed in a public school for students with intellectual disabilities. For the content, the validity coefficient result was 0,998 while the complete reliability result was α, 978. For the reliability subscales, the results were the following: Autonomy α, 941; self-initiation α, 925; self-direction α, 970; self-regulation α, 804, and self-concept α, 935. The results confirm the AUTODDIS scale as a valid and reliable instrument to evaluate the self-determination. However, it is necessary to apply to a larger number of people with intellectual disability to generalize these results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f5bebb90e22e7ae74bd609ae75209b83468e4b8517d03c369893f88abd2b37e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
