{"title":"On Some Special Cases of K &uml;othe&rsquo;s Conjecture","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0039/v1","date":1725275881000,"content":"The primary purpose of this research article is to study the famous K$\\ddot{o}$the's Conjecture for the special cases - when a ring $\\mathfrak{R}$ is commutative, and when $\\mathfrak{R}$ is an Algebra over a field. Furthermore, some open problems involving tensor product of Algebras over a field has also been discussed extensively along with their proofs. Subsequently, an equivelent statement of K$\\ddot{o}$the's problem in terms of algebra of matrices has been established.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de15e79f9f885392c3195396196e0e9b5cc065c5a6776d475df75693a35c6150","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
