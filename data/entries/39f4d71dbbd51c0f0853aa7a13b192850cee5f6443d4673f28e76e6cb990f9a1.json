{"title":"Modeling Borehole Resistivity Logs with Exponentially Graded Multilayered Soil Inversion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0769/v1","date":1725954420000,"content":"In this paper, we present the application of a special soil resistivity model, the Exponentially Graded Multilayered Soil model, to the interpretation of Borehole Resistivity Logging surveys. The model, which was recently introduced by the authors, offers an alternative to the interpretation provided by constant resistivity layer models. The model is applied to synthetic soil surveys as well as to a real survey that is not satisfactorily interpreted using conventional models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39f4d71dbbd51c0f0853aa7a13b192850cee5f6443d4673f28e76e6cb990f9a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
