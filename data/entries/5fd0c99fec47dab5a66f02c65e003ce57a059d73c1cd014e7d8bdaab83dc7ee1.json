{"title":"Evidence for Hemispheric-Scale Bicentennial Periodicity in Northern Hemisphere Temperature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1645/v1","date":1711505808000,"content":"Eight reconstructions of temperature in the Northern Hemisphere covering 1192-2015 years were analyzed using both Fourier, wavelet and principal component approaches. A hemispheric-scale cyclicity with a period of 170-250 years was found present in Northern Hemisphere temperature for more than the last millennium. It is shown that this variation may have a certain contribution to warming in the first half of the 20th century. However, the last 4-5 decades are most likely a period of decline of this cycle. Possible origins of the revealed bicentennial periodicity are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5fd0c99fec47dab5a66f02c65e003ce57a059d73c1cd014e7d8bdaab83dc7ee1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
