{"title":"Positive Childhood Experiences and Subjective Well-being Among Chinese University Students: The Mediating Role of Resilience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2063/v1","date":1727318159000,"content":"This study investigates the impact of positive childhood experiences (PCEs) on the subjective well-being (SWB) of college students, with psychological resilience as a mediator. A total of 1104 students from four universities in Yunnan Province, China, participated in the study. Using the Positive Childhood Experiences Scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and the Subjective Well-being Scale, data were collected and analyzed through descriptive statistics and mediation analysis using SPSS and the PROCESS macro. Results indicate that PCEs significantly enhance SWB, and this relationship is partially mediated by psychological resilience. Specifically, psychological resilience accounted for 49.4% of the mediating effect between PCEs and SWB. These findings highlight the importance of fostering resilience to improve well-being in educational contexts. The study provides practical implications for educational interventions aimed at promoting mental health and well-being among college students.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"066f6ab9e2dd224f100d5f19608e9f79f5cbc9cb812a83564915966f12610cdd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
