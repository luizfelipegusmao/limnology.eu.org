{"title":"Evaluation of Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviors of Family Physicians about Testicular Cancer and Testicular Self-Examination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0890/v1","date":1718249766000,"content":"The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of family physicians regarding testicular cancer and testicular self-examination. This study was conducted with 307 physicians, including family physician specialists, family physician residents, contracted family physician specialist assistants (SAHU), and general practitioners, who agreed to participate in the study. All participants were administered a 33-item questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic questions and questions about testicular cancer and testicular self-examination, developed through literature review. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software. 307 family physician specialists, family physician residents, SAHU residents and general practitioners participated in the study. 10.4% of the participants were working as family medicine specialists, 67.4% as family physician assistants, 13.7% as SAHU residents and 8.5% as general practitioners. The mean time spent in the profession was found to be 5.93Â±5.89. 65.8% of the participants thought that they had partially sufficient knowledge about testicular cancers. 57.7% of the participants stated that they did not know how testicular self-examination was performed. 49.7% of male participants stated that they had never done testicular self-exam before. While 95.8% of the participants thought that regular testicular self-examination was beneficial, 71.0% stated that they did not recommend testicular self-examination to their male patients. 53.4% of the participants thought that testicular self-examination was important; It was determined that 79.2% of them thought it was as important as breast self-examination. The rate of stating that all of the risk factors presented for testicular cancer are risks was found to be statistically significantly higher in specialist family physicians than in general practitioners and resident family physicians. The study revealed that family physicians lacked sufficient knowledge about testicular cancer and testicular self-examination, leading them not to recommend self-testicular examination to patients due to inadequate knowledge. In light of these findings, although self-testicular examination may not be recommended as a screening method, increasing awareness and knowledge among both family physicians and the public is crucial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b7bf1c07121200aca7efec7ac456829ac36adac4ebf3eab9bdaee4b49c3a1ab5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
