{"title":"Exploiting the Anticancer, Antimicrobial and Antiviral Potential of Naphthoquinone Derivatives: Recent Advances and Future Prospects","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1323/v1","date":1729131668000,"content":"Cancer remains a primary cause of mortality, with over 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths globally in 2018. Chemotherapy, which utilizes a spectrum of cytotoxic drugs targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells, is a predominant treatment modality. However, the tendency of chemotherapeutics to induce drug resistance and exhibit non-specific cytotoxicity necessitates the development of new anticancer agents with heightened efficacy and minimized toxicity. In recent years, the discovery of safe and effective antibacterial/antiviral agents has also been a hot spot in medicinal chemistry. This paper comprehensively reviews the synthesis, anticancer/ antibacterial/antiviral activity, and structure-activity relationships of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones and their derivatives. It highlights their potential as efficient and low-toxicity anti-tumor and anti-infectious drug candidates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20578c5c06b9f3fce6670a922da7e9e28ad0fcf0d802d21b1e2b39131a959fbd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
