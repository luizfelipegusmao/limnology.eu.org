Well then, you should consider that nucleated cells “invented” that concept some million years before that literary genre was ever popularized. In the nucleus, cells can literally choose their own mRNAs by deciding which parts of a transcript must be skipped (spliced out) and which parts shall be kept (<a href=\"#koae093-F1\">Fig</a>.). Like pieces in a puzzle, chunks of RNA can be combined in different ways, producing multiple messages from the same DNA. At the molecular level, this mechanism of alternative splicing (AS) is governed by the spliceosome, a multi-megadalton complex formed by 5 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), and over 200 accessory proteins (<a href=\"#koae093-B5\">Wahl et al. 2009</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"4c25f43c3b9883b022631c072e81af9e97cbd2dfef3bde10adbac75159079832","category":"Environment"}
