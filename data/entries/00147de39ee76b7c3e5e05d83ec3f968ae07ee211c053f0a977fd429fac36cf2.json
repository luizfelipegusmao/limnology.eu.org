{"title":"Finding a Published Research Paper which Meaningfully Averages the Most Pathalogical Functions (V2)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0436/v4","date":1729072292000,"content":"I want to meaningfully average a pathalogical function (i.e., an everywhere surjective function whose graph has zero Hausdorff measure in its dimension). In case this impossible, we wish to average a nowhere continuous function defined on the rationals. We do this by taking the most generalized, satisfying extension of the expected value, w.r.t the Hausdorff measure in its dimension, on bounded functions with domains of finite measure which takes finite values only. As of now, I’m unable to solve this due to limited knowledge of advanced math and most people are too busy to help. Therefore, I’m wondering if anyone knows a research paper which solves my doubts. Unlike the previous paper, “Finding a Research Paper Which Meaningfully Averages Pathalogical Functions”) we add motivations, examples, and change parts of the original paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"00147de39ee76b7c3e5e05d83ec3f968ae07ee211c053f0a977fd429fac36cf2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
