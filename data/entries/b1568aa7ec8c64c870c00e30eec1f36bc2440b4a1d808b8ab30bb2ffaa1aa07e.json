{"title":"Hydrothermal Co-Liquefaction of Sugarcane Bagasse and Residual Cooking Soybean Oil for Bio-Crude Production","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0341/v1","date":1717653471000,"content":"This study investigated different conditions for the hydrothermal co-liquefaction (co-HTL) of sugarcane bagasse and residual cooking soybean oil, with and without the presence of ethanol as a cosolvent to maximize the bio-crude yield. All co-HTL reactions were carried out in a 300 mL Parr® reactor at temperatures ranging from 200 to 300 °C. Bio-crude yields of around 95 wt.% were obtained at 300 °C using ethanol and water as solvents. The highest biochar yield (16.6 wt.%) was achieved when using only sugarcane bagasse as substrate, without the presence of soybean oil. Bio-crude samples obtained at higher temperatures (280 °C and 300 °C) using ethanol as a hydrogen donor presented higher contents of both free fatty acids and fatty acid ethyl esters. This work presents a promising process to produce high-quality bio-crude using an abundant feedstock (sugarcane bagasse) in the presence of a lipid source which could cause environmental problems if poorly handled.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b1568aa7ec8c64c870c00e30eec1f36bc2440b4a1d808b8ab30bb2ffaa1aa07e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
