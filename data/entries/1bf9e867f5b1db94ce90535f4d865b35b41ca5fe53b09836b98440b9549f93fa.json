{"title":"An Image Compensation-based Range–Doppler model for SAR High-Precision Positioning","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0799/v1","date":1720614053000,"content":"The Range–Doppler (R-D) model is extensively employed for the geometric processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Refining the sensor motion state and imaging parameters is the most common method for achieving high-precision geometric processing using the R-D model, comprising a process that involves numerous parameters and complex computations. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to improve the positioning accuracy of the R-D model, implementing a low-order polynomial to compensate for the original imaging errors without altering the initial positioning parameters. We also design low-order polynomial compensation models with different parameters. The models are evaluated on various SAR images from different platforms and bands, including spaceborne TerraSAR-X and GF3-C images, manned airborne SAR-X images, and unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted miniSAR-Ku images. Furthermore, image positioning experiments involving the use of different polynomial compensation models and various numbers and distributions of Ground Control Points (GCPs) are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that geometric processing accuracy comparable to that of the classical rigorous positioning method can be achieved even when applying only an affine transformation model to the images. Compared to classical refinement models, however, the proposed image-compensated R-D model is much simpler and easy to implement. Thus, this study provides a convenient, robust, and widely applicable method for the geometric positioning processing of SAR images, offering a potential approach for the joint-positioning processing of multi-source SAR images.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1bf9e867f5b1db94ce90535f4d865b35b41ca5fe53b09836b98440b9549f93fa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
