{"title":"Fermented By-Products of Banana Wine Production Improved Slaughter Performance, Meat Quality of Broiler Chicken, and Flavor Fingerprint of Chicken Chest Meats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1740/v2","date":1727694385000,"content":"This study aimed to compare the effects of adding fermented feed to daily feed on slaughter performance, meat quality, and flavor compounds of cage chickens. Control group (CK) of the Guangxi Partridge chicken received a standard base diet (CK), pellets added with 10% fermented banana peel (Pe-10), 20% fermented banana peel (Pe-20), 10% fermented banana pulp residue (Pu-10) and 20% fermented banana pulp residue (Pu-20). The slaughter performance, meat quality, and flavor compounds in the meat samples of the chicken in these groups were evaluated. The results showed that the chicken in Pe-10, Pe-20, Pu-10, and Pu-20 had pectoral muscle percentages, thigh muscle percentages, and total fatty acids content of chest meat higher than CK. The moisture content, meat color, carcass weight, total net weight, and abdominal fat percentages of the meat samples in these experimental groups were not remarkably different. The flavor compounds in the meat samples of the chicken fed with the two concentrations of fermented banana peel and banana residue were significantly different from those in the control group. When the amount of fermented banana peel added to the daily feed increased from 10% to 20%, the flavor compounds in the chicken samples changed significantly. In conclusion, different proportions of fermented banana peels and dregs in diets can improve slaughter performance and chicken quality and affect its flavors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07146991c2369cd579a551b81408d7b5a906c3af3dd08775494c5da81e5237b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
