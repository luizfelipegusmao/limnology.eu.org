{"title":"Effect of mechanical properties on in vitro dynamic digestion of starch contained in hydrogels","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13235?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>This study evaluates the effect of mechanical properties on the <i>in vitro</i> dynamic gastrointestinal digestion of hydrogels containing starch (HCSs) as a model for studying the nutrient digestibility of solid foods. It provides a useful theoretical basis for the processing of specific foods.</p>\n<h2>RESULT</h2>\n<p>Four types of HCSs with two levels of fracture stress (17.4–20.9 kPa and 55.5–57.6 kPa) and two levels of fracture strain (25.4–28.5% and 53.7–57.4%) were prepared. For these HCSs, the degree of gastric disintegration of hydrogels reduced significantly when fracture strain exceeded 30% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The gastric emptying of HCS particles was also affected by mechanical properties. For example, even at the same level of fracture stress (ca. 20 kPa), the dry solids retention ratio decreased markedly from 0.90 to 0.43 with a decrease in fracture strain from 53.7% to 25.4% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). For the starch hydrolysis of HCSs after gastric digestion, more than 70% of starch in the particles of all types of HCSs emptied did not undergo digestion. The starch hydrolysis of HCSs during small intestinal digestion was also influenced by their mechanical properties. Fracture strains of HCSs, rather than their fracture stress, affected starch digestibility in hydrogels.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The gastric disintegration, the gastric emptying, and the starch hydrolysis of HCSs are suppressed when fracture strain exceeded 30%. Even with the amount of nutritional components contained in hydrogels being the same, the <i>in vitro</i> gastrointestinal digestion behavior of HCSs depends on their mechanical properties. This behavior has the potential to be used in the design of processed foods with controlled bioaccessibility. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zaitian Wang, \nHiroyuki Kozu, \nKunihiko Uemura, \nIsao Kobayashi, \nSosaku Ichikawa","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a09fc9bf5e3d1c4b953fb31539d869cd9b0016d6931a6594763723924bba8886","category":"Environment"}
