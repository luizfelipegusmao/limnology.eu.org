{"title":"Synthesis of diesel‐like fuels using waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene via Co‐pyrolysis process","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14413?af=R","date":1722427964000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study investigated the effects of different proportions of waste polyethylene (WP) and waste cooking oil (WCO) on the chemical and physical properties of the resulting co-pyrolysis oil produced in an indigenously developed laboratory-scale fixed bed batch-type reactor. The proportion of WCO was altered in increments of 10% from 10% to 90%, and correspondingly, the proportion of WP was adjusted from 90% to 10% (by weight). The highest liquid fuel yield, reaching 70.9% by weight, was achieved using a 40:60 ratio of WCO to WP (W40P60) at a constant heating rate of 12°C and a temperature of 500°C. The obtained fuel exhibits promising properties, including a high calorific value (max HHV around 45.63 MJ/kg) and other advantageous properties such as low viscosity, low oxygen and nitrogen content, and absence of sulfur. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GCMS) were examined on the resulting liquid fuel. The GC–MS spectra predominantly display alkanes, constituting approximately 41% by weight, and alkenes, making up roughly 20% by weight. These analyses revealed properties akin to commercial diesel, emphasizing the potential of waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene proportions in liquid diesel like fuel production.</p>","author":"Divyansh Singh, \nAbhishek Paul","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"49f2c40af8d55f91d4a1ff2213aa1753be521e48c09da5bc89e2b098e9ac89d3","category":"Environment"}
