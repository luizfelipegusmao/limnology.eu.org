{"title":"Bioactive Factors Isolated and Purified from Bovine Colostrum Can Restore Extracellular Matrix under Degradation by Metalloproteinases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1271/v2","date":1726019208000,"content":"The ECM is composed of a considerable number of biochemically and structurally diverse constituents. ECM is a highly dynamic system that constantly receives and sends biological, chemical and mechanical signals. Several studies suggest that mechanical signals derived from the extracellular microenvironment regulate skin regeneration and wound healing. We evaluated effects of a mixture of biomolecules extracted and purified from bovine colostrum on restoring the mechanical properties of ECM. Test measuring collagen contraction showed a significant difference in contraction activation in samples treated with the 2% colostrum derivative mixture compared to the control. The analysis of the supernatant showed an inhibition of metalloproteinase-2 expression and an increase in collagen secretion by fibroblasts in treatment samples. Our hypothesis is that the molecules extracted and purified from bovine colostrum restore the ECM environment qualitative and quantitative characteristics, thus guaranteeing through a mechanical action the restoration of the wound due to the transduction of the signal activated by the integrins.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e69af84dbc4024b8a9e8fa95a86bdd28479697ceaed5937c582ae7fbc628fc9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
