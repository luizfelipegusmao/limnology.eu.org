{"title":"Pharmacogenetics Determinants of Paxlovid Response: The Role of IFNAR2, OAS1, OAS3, and ACE2 in Modulating COVID-19 Patient Outcomes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0274/v1","date":1725398733000,"content":"This study aimed to investigate the impact of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on clinical and laboratory outcomes in COVID-19 patients receiving Paxlovid treatment. The primary focus was on genetic variants in IFNAR2, OAS1, OAS3, and ACE2.\nLaboratory parameters were assessed at admission and discharge, including oxygen saturation, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count, hematocrit, and various liver and kidney function tests.\nThe results demonstrated significant associations between certain SNPs and clinical outcomes. Patients with the IFNAR2 rs2236757 G allele exhibited improved oxygen saturation and lower eosinophil counts. The OAS3 rs10735079 and OAS1 rs10774671 G allele was associated with lower eosinophil and total bilirubin levels.\nFurthermore, patients with the ACE2 rs2074192 C allele showed increased segmented neutrophils and AST levels, while the T allele was associated with lower total bilirubin levels.\nThese findings indicate that the efficacy of Paxlovid treatment may be influenced by genetic variations in IFNAR2, OAS1, OAS3, and ACE2. Further research is warranted to investigate the potential therapeutic implications of these genetic markers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8c256fb3e49083393b0b2a67a80e26f6f71910a82b5212cbdd0406ab50876ab1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
