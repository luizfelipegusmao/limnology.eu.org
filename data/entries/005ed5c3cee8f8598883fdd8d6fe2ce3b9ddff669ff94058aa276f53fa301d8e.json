{"title":"A Novel Tiny Open-Source Board BioRon_EEG for Dry Active Electrode","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1703/v1","date":1727143542000,"content":"This paper introduces an open-source active high-precision signal amplifier designed for enhancing biodata acquisition, specifically focusing on EEG signals. The compact device, with a diameter of 18 mm, seamlessly integrates electronics, signal processing, and meticulous design considerations. Incorporated within the single board are circuits for low-noise amplification, an analog interface equipped with bandpass filters, and an integrated ADC for precise digitization. A comprehensive evaluation of signal quality has been conducted, encompassing aspects such as noise levels, electrode bias tolerance, and common mode rejection ratio. To facilitate this evaluation, the widely recognized Silver Chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl) has been employed. Additionally, this paper delves into an extensive discussion concerning diverse sources of noise, along with strategies to curtail input noise and minimize noise originating from electrodes and amplifiers. Leveraging the substantial advancements achieved in the design of dry contact electrodes, this specific device is poised to carve a notable niche in the realm of brain-computer interface.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"005ed5c3cee8f8598883fdd8d6fe2ce3b9ddff669ff94058aa276f53fa301d8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
