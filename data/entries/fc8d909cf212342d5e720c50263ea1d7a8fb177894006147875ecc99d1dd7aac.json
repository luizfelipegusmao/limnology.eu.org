{"title":"Growth regulation by apyrases: Insights from altering their expression level in different organisms","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1323/7382083?rss=1","date":1699401600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Apyrase (APY) enzymes are nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) diphosphohydrolases that can remove the terminal phosphate from NTPs and nucleoside diphosphates but not from nucleoside monophosphates. They have conserved structures and functions in yeast, plants, and animals. Among the most studied APYs in plants are those in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>; AtAPYs) and pea (<span>Pisum sativum</span>; PsAPYs), both of which have been shown to play major roles in regulating plant growth and development. Valuable insights on their functional roles have been gained by transgenically altering their transcript abundance, either by constitutively expressing or suppressing <span>APY</span> genes. This review focuses on recent studies that have provided insights on the mechanisms by which APY activity promotes growth in different organisms. Most of these studies have used transgenic lines that constitutively expressed <span>APY</span> in multiple different plants and in yeast. As APY enzymatic activity can also be changed post-translationally by chemical blockage, this review also briefly covers studies that used inhibitors to suppress APY activity in plants and fungi. It concludes by summarizing some of the main unanswered questions about how APYs regulate plant growth and proposes approaches to answering them.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"fc8d909cf212342d5e720c50263ea1d7a8fb177894006147875ecc99d1dd7aac","category":"Environment"}
