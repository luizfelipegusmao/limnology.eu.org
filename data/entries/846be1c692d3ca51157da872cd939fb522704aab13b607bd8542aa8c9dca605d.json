{"title":"Polymeric Infrared and Fluorescent Probes to Assess Macrophage Diversity in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid of Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1765/v1","date":1729671011000,"content":"Bronchial asthma remains a serious medical problem, as approximately 10% of patients fail to achieve adequate symptom control with available treatment options. Macrophages play a pivotal role in pathophysiology of asthma, as well as in some other respiratory disorders. Typically, they are classified into two major classes, M1 and M2, however, recent findings indicate that in fact there is a whole range of macrophage polarization and functional diversity beyond this bimodal division. Isolation of individual cell sub-populations and identification of their role and diagnostic/therapeutic significance is still a challenge. Here we have attempted to assess the differences between patient-derived macrophage populations from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples in different pulmonary disease conditions, based on their capability to interact with a range of specific as well as relatively non-specific carbohydrate-based ligands (containing galactose, mannose, trimannose, etc). Obviously, the main target of these ligands was CD206, however, other minor receptors, able to bind carbohydrates, have also been reported for macrophages. In addition, variations in receptor clustering and distribution may substantially affect affinity to the same ligand. Interestingly, with a panel of 5-6 different carbohydrate-based ligands with FTIR or fluorescent marker we were able not only to distinguish between healthy and disease states, but also between closely related diseases, such as purulent endobronchitis, obstructive bronchitis, pneumonia, and bronchial asthma. In some cases, the activated macrophage affinity to galactose base ligands was higher than that to mannose, indicating that complexes of CD-206 or other receptors may contribute substantially to macrophage functional features. For further investigation specific sub-populations of macrophages, seen as hallmarks to specific diseases, can be isolated and studied separately, probably giving new insights with diagnostic and therapeutic significance for hard-to-treat patients. Some of the markers varied from 0 to 100% in different types of bronchitis and pneumonia, which, we believe, deserves further investigation. Hard-to-treat group of patients with resistant disease can also be identified with this approach as fingerprint method, with a purpose to find a more targeted therapeutic strategy, improving their clinical outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"846be1c692d3ca51157da872cd939fb522704aab13b607bd8542aa8c9dca605d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
