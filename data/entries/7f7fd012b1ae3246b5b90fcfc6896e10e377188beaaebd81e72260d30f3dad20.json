{"title":"Anisakis spp. as indicators of latitudinal movements of short‐finned pilot whales, Globicephala macrorhynchus, in the Northeast Atlantic","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13191?af=R","date":1729315230000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In the Northeast Atlantic, it is unclear whether short-finned pilot whales, <i>Globicephala macrorhynchus</i> (SFPWs), are transient or resident above 40°N. We used <i>Anisakis</i> spp. to identify the latitudes recently visited by a SFPW pod stranded in NW Spain (43°N) in 2020. Analysis of <i>cox2</i> gene in 30 nematodes from 6 SFPWs revealed the presence of <i>A. simplex</i> sensu stricto (s.s.) (93.3%) and <i>A. pegreffii</i> (6.7%). Morphological analysis of 972 nematodes corroborated species molecular identification and relative proportions; in males (<i>n</i> = 66), the estimated proportions of <i>A. simplex</i> s.s. and <i>A. pegreffii</i> were 86.4% and 13.6%, respectively. These percentages resembled those reported in fish/cetaceans above 40°N, and L4 larvae or adults of <i>A. typica</i> (a tropical-temperate species found in SFPWs up to 38°N–39°N) were not detected. Population structure of <i>A. simplex</i> s.s. + <i>A. pegreffii in</i> SFPWs suggested a continuous recruitment of nematodes starting at least 3 weeks before stranding. We interpret that either the SFPW pod was within the range of the species (perhaps as a recent northern shift) or represented a vagrant group that visited waters off Northwest Spain for a protracted period. Future analysis on nematode assemblages could shed light on movements and climate-driven shifts in cetacean distribution.</p>","author":"Claudia Pons‐Bordas, \nRachel V. Pool, \nSofía Ten, \nJosé A.
