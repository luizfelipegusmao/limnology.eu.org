{"title":"The Mediating Role of Trait Anxiety in the Relationship between the Organizational Power Resources Used by School Principals and Teachers' Work Alienation Levels","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0758/v1","date":1718174538000,"content":"In this study, we examined the effects of the organizational power resources used by school principals on teachers' work alienation and trait anxiety levels. Then, we examined the mediating role of trait anxiety in the relationship between organizational power resources and work alienation. We used the correlational scanning model and mediation model in the research. The research sample consists of 400 teachers working in Turkish public schools. In our research, \"Organizational Power Scale in Schools\", \"Work Alienation Scale\" and \"Trait Anxiety Scale\" were used. As a result of the research, we found significant relationships between the variables. Accordingly, there is a positive relationship between trait anxiety and work alienation, a positive relationship between trait anxiety and coercive power and legal power, a negative relationship between trait anxiety and expert, charismatic and reward power, a positive relationship between work alienation and coercive power, and a positive relationship between work alienation and reward power. Negative relationships were observed between expertise and charismatic power. Finally, it was determined that trait anxiety had a mediating role in the relationship between the power resources used by school principals and the level of work alienation of teachers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7e1f455892b27bb564669a5510e62313e894b68099bfefa95fc01724e058c9da","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
