{"title":"Evaluation of candidate reference genes for RT‐qPCR analysis during developmental stages in striped murrel (Channa striata)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16152?af=R","date":1668758400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the most advanced and commonly used method for quantification of gene expression levels because of its high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The analytical capability of RT-qPCR, on the other hand, is dependent on precise normalization by using the most stable reference genes. The present study was undertaken to find the best-suited reference gene for normalization of qPCR data for ontogenetic studies of striped murrel. Four commonly used and constitutively expressed genes, namely beta-actin (<i>β-actin</i>), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>), elongation factor 1-alpha (<i>EF1α</i>) and 18 S ribosomal protein (<i>18 S RNA</i>) were screened and evaluated for their expression stability in developing larvae from 1 to 35 days post hatch (dph). The stability and suitability of these genes were determined by using four different algorithms; namely, delta Ct, BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder. The four algorithms together generated a comprehensive ranking <i>EF1α</i> being the most stable, followed by <i>GAPDH</i> and <i>β-actin</i> as the least stable gene. This is the first report evaluating the most suitable reference gene for mRNA expression studies in <i>C. striata,</i> in the context of ontogenetic development.</p>","author":"Rakhi Kumari, \nPrem P.
