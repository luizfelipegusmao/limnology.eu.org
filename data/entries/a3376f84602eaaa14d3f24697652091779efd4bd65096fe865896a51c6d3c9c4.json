In particular, twisted vdWBs (TvdWBs) hold promise for creating elusive states of matter and for studying the strongly correlated physics that emerge [<a href=\"#ozae044.181-B1\">1</a>]. First principles calculations show that the moiré lattices created by twisting two monolayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is more than an optical illusion – the in-plane modulation of electronic and topological structures changes material properties and creates a superlattice which can often be electrically tuned, or strain tuned to produce a variety of states from perfect arrays of quantum emitters to excitonic superlattices with giant spin-orbit coupling [<a href=\"#ozae044.181-B2\">2</a>]. Excitingly, experimental research is largely confirming these findings, like in the case of “magic twist angles” in graphene leading to unconventional superconductivity [<a href=\"#ozae044.181-B3\">3</a>]. As this field develops, experimentalists are realizing that strain and defect engineering can have a significant effect on TvdWBs properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.181-B4\">4</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a3376f84602eaaa14d3f24697652091779efd4bd65096fe865896a51c6d3c9c4","category":"Environment"}
