{"title":"A prenyltransferase participates in the biosynthesis of anthraquinones in Rubia cordifolia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/4/2860/7631834?rss=1","date":1710806400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Anthraquinones (AQs) constitute the largest group of natural quinones, which are used as safe natural dyes and have many pharmaceutical applications. In plants, AQs are biosynthesized through two main routes: the polyketide pathway and the shikimate pathway. The latter primarily forms alizarin-type AQs, and the prenylation of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) is the first pathway-specific step. However, the prenyltransferase (PT) responsible for this key step remains uncharacterized. In this study, the cell suspension culture of Madder (<span>Rubia cordifolia</span>), a plant rich in alizarin-type AQs, was discovered to be capable of prenylating DHNA to form 2-carboxyl-3-prenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone and 3-prenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. Then, a candidate gene belonging to the UbiA superfamily, <span>R</span>. <span>cordifolia</span>dimethylallyltransferase 1 (<span>RcDT1</span>), was shown to account for the prenylation activity. Substrate specificity studies revealed that the recombinant RcDT1 recognized naphthoic acids primarily, followed by 4-hydroxyl benzoic acids. The prenylation activity was strongly inhibited by 1,2- and 1,4-dihydroxynaphthalene. <span>RcDT1</span> RNA interference significantly reduced the AQs content in <span>R. cordifolia</span> callus cultures, demonstrating that RcDT1 is required for alizarin-type AQs biosynthesis. The plastid localization and root-specific expression further confirmed the participation of RcDT1 in anthraquinone biosynthesis. The phylogenetic analyses of <span>RcDT1</span> and functional validation of its rubiaceous homologs indicated that DHNA-prenylation activity evolved convergently in Rubiaceae via recruitment from the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway. Our results demonstrate that RcDT1 catalyzes the first pathway-specific step of alizarin-type AQs biosynthesis in <span>R. cordifolia</span>. These findings will have profound implications for understanding the biosynthetic process of the anthraquinone ring derived from the shikimate pathway.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"136bddb55e385ad760c719a4605140ed8c0ba780c807f1a5584a278a8200ca0f","category":"Environment"}
