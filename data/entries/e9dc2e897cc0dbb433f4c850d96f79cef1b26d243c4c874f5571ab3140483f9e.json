Though diversifying plant species has been regarded as a promising strategy for promoting soil nitrogen or organic carbon accumulation during vegetation restoration or afforestation, how increasing plant species diversity (PSD) would influence soil protein pool remains unknown.\n\nWe selected 45 plots covering a natural gradient of PSD, which was reflected by the Shannon index and varied from 0.15 to 3.57, in a subtropical karst forest. The major objective was to investigate the impact of increasing PSD on soil protein abundance, with soil protein depolymerization rate and multiple biotic and abiotic variables being measured to explore the underlying mechanism.\n\nThe relative abundance of soil protein, that is proportion in soil organic matter varied between 24.1 and 34.0% with an average of 29.2 ± 2.3% across the 45 plots. Soil protein abundance increased on average by 1.56% with each unit of PSD increase. Nevertheless, soil protease activity, protein depolymerization rate and microbial amino acid uptake rate all significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) decreased as PSD increased. The mechanism underlying the increase of soil protein abundance in response to higher PSD included three aspects, that is stimulating microbial biomass and subsequent microbial residue input to the soil, promoting mineral protection of soil protein via elevating levels of soil exchangeable calcium and magnesium, and decreasing soil protease activity and protein depolymerization due to aggravated soil microbial phosphorus limitation.\n\n<i>Synthesis and application</i>: Our study suggests that increasing PSD is an efficient way to promote soil protein accumulation. Given that protein is a major component of soil nitrogen or organic carbon pool, diversifying plant species during vegetation restoration or afforestation would hence benefit soil nitrogen and organic carbon sequestration.\n</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>\n\n来源于植物和微生物残体的蛋白质是土壤有机碳、氮的重要组成部分，在促进土壤碳、氮固持方面发挥着重要的作用。尽管在植被恢复与造林过程中多样化的植物物种配置已被证明是提高土壤碳、氮储量的有效策略，但植物物种多样性增加如何影响土壤蛋白质动态目前仍是一个有待解决的问题。\n\n本研究于中国西南亚热带喀斯特森林中选取了45个具有植物物种多样性(PSD)梯度的样方开展研究工作。PSD梯度以香浓-威纳指数表示，其变化范围在0.15 ~ 3.57。本研究的主要目的是探讨PSD增加对土壤蛋白质丰度的影响，同时结合蛋白质解聚速率及多个生物与非生物因子以探讨PSD对土壤蛋白质影响的机制。\n\n土壤蛋白质的相对丰度，即蛋白质在土壤有机质中的占比，介于24.1% ~ 34.0%，平均值为29.2 ± 2.3%。PSD每增加1个单位，土壤蛋白质的相对丰度平均增加1.56%。然而，随着PSD的增加，土壤蛋白酶活性、蛋白质解聚速率和微生物氨基酸吸收速率均显著降低。高PSD促进土壤蛋白质累积的机制包括三个方面，即通过增加土壤微生物生物量而促进微生物残体的输入，通过增加土壤交换性钙和镁含量以增强矿物对土壤蛋白质的保护作用，通过加剧土壤微生物受磷限制程度而抑制蛋白酶活性和蛋白质解聚速率。\n\n综合与应用:我们的研究表明增加PSD是提高土壤蛋白质水平的有效措施。鉴于蛋白质是土壤有机碳、氮的重要组成部分，因此在实施植被恢复或造林项目时，应采用多样化的植物物种配置以促进土壤有机碳、氮固持。\n</p>","author":"Zihong Zhu, \nWolfgang Wanek, \nKun Gao, \nYuantian Fang, \nDejun Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"e9dc2e897cc0dbb433f4c850d96f79cef1b26d243c4c874f5571ab3140483f9e","category":"Environment"}
