{"title":"Potential Distribution of 11 Species of the Genus Zephyranthes Herb. (Amaryllidaceae) in Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0855/v1","date":1718195089000,"content":"Potential distribution models are used to predict the presence and geographic limits of a species as a function of bioclimatic variables. The lack of knowledge of the geographic distribution of species endemic to Mexico is a limiting factor in understanding their ecology, conservation, and potential applications. Distribution models were generated with occurrence data of 11 species of the genus Zephyranthes, 19 bioclimatic and three topographic variables with the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. The dimensionality reduction analysis (PCA) allowed determining that, of the 19 variables, four contributed the highest percentage to the classification of the models, explaining more than 80% of the accumulated variance. The resulting models were evaluated according to the value of the area under the curve (AUC) and potential distribution models with AUC values &amp;gt;0.89 were obtained. The results suggest that most species are distributed in the biogeographic province of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt. Zephyranthes concolor was the species with the largest potential distribution area. The species with the most restricted potential distribution was Zephyranthes sessilis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d89b821fe87465ea189eefd496fdb5829d985a081c4e8fd7e109d3f4302572a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
