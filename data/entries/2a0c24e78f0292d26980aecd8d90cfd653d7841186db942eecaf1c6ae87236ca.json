{"title":"Reference Evapotranspiration in Climate Change Scenarios in Mato Grosso, Brazil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0931/v1","date":1715673322000,"content":"The understanding of spatiotemporal variations in reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and its long-term trends is of paramount importance for water cycle studies, modeling, and water resource management, especially in the context of climate change. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to critically evaluate the performance of various CMIP5 global climate models in simulating the Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration and its associated climate variables (maximum and minimum air temperature, incident solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed). This evaluation is based on data from nine climate models and 33 automatic meteorological stations (EMA) in the state of Mato Grosso, spanning the period 2007-2020. The statistical metrics used for evaluation include Bias, root mean square error, and Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. The projections of the most accurate model were then used to analyze the spatial and temporal changes and trends in ETo under the RCP 2.6, 4.5, and RCP 8.5 scenarios from 2007 to 2100. The HadGEM2-ES model projections indicate static averages similar to current conditions until the end of the century in the RCP 2.6 scenario. However, in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, there is a continuous increase in ETo, with the most significant increase occurring during the dry period (May to September). The areas of the Amazon biome in the north of Mato Grosso exhibit the largest increases in ETo when comparing the observed (2007-2020) and projected (2020-2100) averages. The trend analysis reveals significant changes in ETo and its variables across the state of Mato Grosso in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In the RCP 2.6 scenario, significant trends in ETo are observed only in the northern Amazon areas. Despite not being observed in all AWSs, the trend analysis of the observed data demonstrates more intense changes in ETo and the existence of the evapotranspiration paradox with an increase in the Cerrado areas and reductions in the Pantanal and southern Amazon areas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2a0c24e78f0292d26980aecd8d90cfd653d7841186db942eecaf1c6ae87236ca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
