The synaptic architecture determines limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders. Here, I address morphology modeling and storage estimation for the human synaptome at the nanoscale. A synapse is defined as a pair of pairs [(presynaptic_neuron),(presynaptic_axonal_terminal);(postsynaptic_neuron),(postsynaptic_dendritic_terminal)]. Center coordinates, radius, and identifier characterize a dendritic or axonal terminal. A synapse comprises topology with the paired neuron and terminal identifiers, location with terminal coordinates, and geometry with terminal radii. The storage required for the synaptome depends on the number of synapses and storage necessary for a single synapse determined by a synaptic model. I introduce three synaptic models: topologic with topology, point with topology and location, and geometric with topology, location, and geometry. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in the literature, four cases of neurons (30;86;100;138 billion) and three cases of synapses per neuron (1,000;10,000;30,000) are considered with three full and simplified (to reduce storage) synaptic models resulting in total 72 cases of storage estimation. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21(0.14) petabytes (PB) to 28.98(18.63) PB for the topologic model, from 0.57(0.32) PB to 78.66(43.47) PB for the point model, and from 0.69(0.38) PB to 95.22(51.75) PB for the geometric model. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the cortex needs from 86.80(55.80) TB to 2.60(1.67) PB for the topologic model, from 235.60(130.02) TB to 7.07(3.91) PB for the point model, and from 285.20(155.00) TB to 8.56(4.65) PB for the geometric model. The topologic model is sufficient to compute the connectome’s topology, but it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience. <i>Frontier</i>, the world’s most powerful supercomputer for 86 billion neurons can handle the nanoscale synaptome in the range of 1,000–10,000 synapses per neuron. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data work attempting to provide storage estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome.","author":"Wieslaw L.
