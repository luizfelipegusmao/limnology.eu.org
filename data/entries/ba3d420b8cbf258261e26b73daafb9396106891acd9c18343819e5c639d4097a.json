{"title":"Genetic and Molecular Regulation of Cotton Fiber Initiation and Elongation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0778/v1","date":1715590702000,"content":"Cotton fiber, a crucial and sustainable resource for global textile production, undergoes a complex five-stage developmental process, encompassing initiation, elongation, transition, secondary cell wall biosynthesis, and maturation. These elongated single-cell fibers originate from the outer ovule epidermis.  The development of cotton fibers involves intricate changes in gene expression and physiological processes, resulting in a nearly pure cellulose product vital for the global cotton industry.  Decoding genes associated with fiber development enhances our understanding of cotton fiber mechanisms and facilitates the cultivation of varieties with enhanced quality.  In recent decades, advanced omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have played a pivotal role in identifying genes and gene products linked to cotton fiber development, including the MYB transcription factor family which coordinates cotton fiber development.  Molecular studies have revealed transcription factors like MYB, WRKY, Homeodomain Leucine Zipper (HD-ZIP) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) influencing fiber initiation and elongation.  The intricate interplay of phytohormones like auxin, gibberellic acid (GA), brassinosteroid (BR), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and cytokinin is explored, providing a comprehensive perspective on shaping cotton fibers.  Numerous candidate genes and cellular processes affecting various aspects of fiber development hold promise for genetic engineering or marker-assisted breeding to improve fiber quality.  This review presents a comprehensive overview of key achievements in cotton molecular biology, with a specific emphasis on recent advancements in understanding transcription factors and phytohormones involved in cotton fiber initiation and elongation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba3d420b8cbf258261e26b73daafb9396106891acd9c18343819e5c639d4097a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
