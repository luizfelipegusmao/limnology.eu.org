{"title":"Environmental assessment of an innovative adhesive for the footwear industry: road map for product development","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11367-024-02314-w","date":1719792000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Purpose</h3>\n                      <p>This work presents an environmental assessment of two adhesives to evaluate the replacement of the traditional adhesive (PU) used in the footwear industry by a novel adhesive based on a microencapsulation approach (PUMC) which is more favorable from the safety and technical perspectives. The PU adhesive is polyurethane-based, while the PUMC adhesive is polyurethane-based but with its isocyanate compounds microencapsulated, increasing storage life and reducing risks related to the exposure of workers with the adhesives.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Methods</h3>\n                      <p>The potential environmental impact of the adhesives was evaluated using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. A detailed process model was developed (both for laboratory and for a pilot-scale implementation) to investigate the environmental impacts associated with these processes. The functional unit was one kilogram of adhesive (PU and PUMC adhesives) produced. A cradle-to-customers’ gate approach was defined. The system boundary starts from extraction of resources, through material production, until adhesive use. This includes microcapsule production in the case of the PUMC adhesive. This study investigates the important drivers behind the environmental impacts to help guide commercialization efforts. A scenarios study/sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the response of the PUMC adhesive system to the variability of the model, scenarios, and parameters.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Results</h3>\n                      <p>The results show that the PU adhesive environmental impact is due to acetone and polyol consumption in the production stage. In the PUMC adhesive system, acetone consumption and microcapsule production are the major factors responsible for the environmental impact. Polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), dichloromethane (DCM), and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) consumption are the major factors responsible for the environmental impact of the microcapsules’ production. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using three alternative scenarios focused on the reduction in material consumption and increase in material recuperation, as well as using an alternative renewable energy source. Although the traditional PU adhesive has a lower impact, it was found that the three alternative PUMC adhesive systems can become comparable to the traditional PU adhesive.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Conclusions</h3>\n                      <p>This study shows the advance and development of a new technology for microencapsulation of isocyanate in adhesives and its environmental advantages and disadvantages with respect to a traditional product that uses non-encapsulated isocyanate. Finally, it was shown that there is significant potential for minimizing some environmental impacts of the PUMC adhesive, such as optimizing the microcapsules’ production stage, increasing the production efficiency to decrease the required material consumption.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"09d80a3da58d77f1c96d420b16d162c7deb11629c82bc8e72fef337afc2c0153","category":"Environment"}
