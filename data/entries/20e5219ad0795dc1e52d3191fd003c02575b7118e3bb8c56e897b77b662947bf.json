These properties ensure its effectiveness in water treatment applications.\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Increasing water pollution due to anthropogenic activities prompts the quest for an effective water treatment method. Polymeric materials have gained attention as adsorbents for water purification. Membranes are majorly made from homopolymeric materials. However, recent studies have focused on using copolymeric materials for improved performance. In this review, the basics of copolymerization including various types of copolymers, synthetic approaches, and their applications in various water pollutants removal are discussed in detail. Advances in water treatment technology using copolymeric materials as adsorbent/membranes in the last 4â€‰years are covered with insights into the future outlook and areas of improvement in terms of copolymer composites for water treatment. Studies from the literature did not only reveal effectiveness of copolymer as a flocculant/antifouling materials and in removal of selective toxic metals, oil, and microbes but also demonstrated recyclability of the copolymer sorbents/membrane. Full exploration of unique copolymer textural and structural properties could lead to great advancement in water treatment process.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThe copolymer types and synthetic methods are discussed.\nApplication of copolymer as adsorbent/membranes for water treatment is presented.\nRecent advances show good pollutants removal for toxic metals, oil, and organics.\nCopolymer composites have great potential as adsorbent/membranes for future use in water treatment processes.\n</p>","author":"Raja Saad Alruwais, \nWaheed A.
