Reliability analysis, normality distribution analysis, correlation and regression analysis, independent sample t-test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed on the data obtained through IBM SPSS Statistics 25. In this way, it was determined to what extent the level of public awareness of e-waste, environmental concerns, empathy, and moral norms toward the environment are affected by socio-demographic factors. According to the study results, a significant relationship was found between environmental concerns, environmental pollution awareness, environmental responsibility, personal moral norms and educational status, and empathy and moral norms. In addition, limited growth, anthropocentrism, fragility of the balance of nature, educational status, and having children were also found to have a significant relationship with environmental concerns. However, a significant relationship was found between marital status and environmental concerns, empathy and moral norms. A significant relationship was also found between age group and empathy and moral norms.</p>","author":"Ahmet Burak Yalçın, \nSevgi Güneş‐Durak","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"b45fd74086b5a0351637ec670fd21ae24cf7079a780acef3b8a5ba6d67cd9c7d","category":"Environment"}
