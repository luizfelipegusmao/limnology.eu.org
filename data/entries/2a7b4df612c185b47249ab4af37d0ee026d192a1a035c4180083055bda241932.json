Studies emphasize the importance of childhood adversity as a risk factor for developing non-communicable diseases, including type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adulthood. This case-control study involved 137 patients with T2DM and 134 non-diabetic adults of both genders (mean age 46.9 and 45.7 years, respectively). In addition to collecting socio-demographic, behavioral, and anthropological data, a 10-item ACE scale was utilized to gather information regarding childhood adversities, while perceived stress was assessed using the perceived stress scale-4. Fasting and 2-hour post glucose load blood sugar levels, HbA1c, and fasting lipid profiles were measured. Both univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate whether ACE is a potential risk factor for T2DM, with a significance level of 0.05. Around two-thirds of T2DM patients reported having ACE scores of 4 or higher, with the mean ACE score significantly higher in the case group than in the control group (3.96 vs. 3.34; p&lt;0.0001). The logistic regression analysis found that T2DM was linked to female gender, hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of DM, higher perceived stress, and a higher ACE score of 4 and above. After adjusting for confounding factors, individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher had a significantly greater risk of developing T2DM (OR: 2.24; 95% CI 1.238â€“4.061). The study revealed a significant association between higher ACE scores and an increased risk of developing T2DM. As a recommendation, further investigation into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying this relationship is warranted.","author":"Nilima Barman","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"2a7b4df612c185b47249ab4af37d0ee026d192a1a035c4180083055bda241932","category":"Environment"}
