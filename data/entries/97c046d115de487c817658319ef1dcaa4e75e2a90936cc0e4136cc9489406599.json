{"title":"Predictors of Cancer Therapy-Related Cardiac Dysfunction in Patients Receiving Anthracyline in Lymphoma Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1022/v1","date":1710754328000,"content":"Background: Cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is a growing concern for public health, with a growing incidence due to improved survival rates for patients with hematological malignancies due to diagnostic and therapeutic advances. Identification of patients at risk CTRCD is vital to develop preventive strategies. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted between 1 January 2017 and 15 February 2023. Medical records of patients with lymphoma treated with first-line anthracyclines were reviewed. Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, biomarkers of myocardial damage and echocardiographic information were collected. Results: A total of 200 patients were included. The incidence of CTRCD was 17.4 % (35/200). Patients with CTRCD were older than those without CTRCD, with a mean age of 65.17 years vs 56.77 (p = 0.008). Dyslipidemia (DL) (31.4% vs 13.4% p = 0.017) and previous cardiovascular disease (40% vs 13.3%, p&lt; 0.001) were more frequent in the group who developed an event. Mean baseline NT-proBNP levels in the subgroup with cardiovascular events were 388.73 kg /L ± 101.02, and 251.518 kg /L ± 26.22 in those who did not (p = 0.004). Differences in Troponin I levels were identified during and after treatment without exceeding the laboratory’s upper reference limit.  Patients were followed for a median of 51.83 months (0.76-73.49). The presence of a CTCRD event had a negative impact on overall mortality from any cause (HR = 2.23 (95% CI 1.08-2.93), p = 0.031). \nConclusions: Early identification of risk factors is crucial to manage patients at risk for CTRCD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97c046d115de487c817658319ef1dcaa4e75e2a90936cc0e4136cc9489406599","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
