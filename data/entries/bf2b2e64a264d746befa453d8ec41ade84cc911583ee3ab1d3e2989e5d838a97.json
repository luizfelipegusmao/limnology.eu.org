This study aimed to evaluate multimorbidity's impact on patients with genitourinary cancer (GUC) in Chile, focusing on prevalent comorbidities, their combinations, and their association with hospitalization severity.\nMaterials and Methods\nA retrospective, population-based study was conducted using data from the Fondo Nacional de Salud (FONASA) in Chile, including patients with bladder, prostate, kidney, and testicular cancer between 2019 and 2021. Diagnosis-related group (DRG) data were used to analyze comorbidity prevalence, hospitalization type (elective vs. emergency), severity (moderate/major vs. minor/none), length of stay, and associated costs.\nResults\nAmong 4,028,597 hospital events, 11.6% were related to GUC, involving 18,792 patients. Multimorbidity was present in 67.3% of patients, with hypertension and diabetes being the most common comorbidities. These patients accounted for 69.1% of total GUC care costs. Hospital mortality was higher in multimorbid patients (7.5% vs. 3.7%; P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf2b2e64a264d746befa453d8ec41ade84cc911583ee3ab1d3e2989e5d838a97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
