{"title":"Platelet Biorheology and Mechanobiology in Thrombosis and Hemostasis: Perspectives from Multiscale Computation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0799/v2","date":1713887404000,"content":"Thrombosis is the pathological clot formation under abnormal hemodynamic conditions, which can result in vascular obstruction, causing ischemic strokes and myocardial infarction. Thrombus growth under moderate to low shear (&lt;1000 s-1) relies on platelet activation and coagulation. Thrombosis at elevated high shear rates (&gt;10,000 s-1) is predominantly driven by unactivated platelet binding and aggregating mediated by von Willebrand factor (VWF), while platelet activation and coagulation are secondary in supporting and reinforcing the thrombus. Given the molecular and cellular level information it can access, multiscale computational modelling informed by biology can provide new pathphysiological mechanisms that are otherwise not accessible experimentally, holding promise for novel first-principle-based therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the key aspects of platelet biorheology and mechanobiology, focusing on the molecular and cellular scale events and how they build up to thrombosis through platelet adhesion and aggregation in the presence or absence of platelet activation. In particular, we highlight recent advancements in multiscale modeling of platelet biorheology and mechanobiology and how they can lead to better prediction and quantification of thrombus formation, exemplifying the exciting paradigm of digital medicine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2eeb7cbd4dcf7aa6c62928d1eafd72597073f688d4a14e29bb7523e505169d7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
