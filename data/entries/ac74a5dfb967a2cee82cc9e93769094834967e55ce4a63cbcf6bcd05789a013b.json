{"title":"Cuproptosis-Associated Long Noncoding RNAs as Prognostic Markers in Glioma Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0273/v1","date":1714982004000,"content":"Cuproptosis, a copper-dependent cellular death mechanism, is typically overlooked in glioblastoma diagnosis. Lipoylation is needed for cuproptosis, and FDX1 controls this process. Cuproptosis in prognostic models may drive cancer treatment. This study evaluated cuproptosis and glioblastoma cell proliferation. The Cancer Genome Atlas provided annotated clinical, genetic mutation, and RNA sequencing data for the TCGA_GBM and TCGA_LGG cohorts. Patients with gliomas were randomly allocated to the validation or training cohort. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression models were utilized to evaluate which model best predicted prognosis in the training cohort. The models' independent predictive power was evaluated throughout the cohort. A previous study revealed 19 genes related to ferroptosis. LncRNAs associated with cuproptosis were identified by coexpression analysis. Cox discovered 17 cuproptosis-associated lncRNAs and established a predictive model. The median risk score classified patients as high- or low-risk. K‒M survival analysis demonstrated significant differences in overall survival among risk categories. Principal component analysis (PCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to test the model’s predictive power. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed risk score-related independent prognostic factors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to construct a nomogram for marker-based prognosis. The risk category affected the tumour mutation rate. High-risk glioma patients benefit from immunotherapy. Glioma drug sensitivity was also substantially linked with the risk score. The expression of 17 cuproptosis-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may assist in the stratification of glioma patient prognosis, molecular characteristics, cell cycle gene regulation pathways, the TME, and clinicopathological aspects. Our clinical sample and database analysis revealed that cuproptosis influences glioma prognosis and may guide therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ac74a5dfb967a2cee82cc9e93769094834967e55ce4a63cbcf6bcd05789a013b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
