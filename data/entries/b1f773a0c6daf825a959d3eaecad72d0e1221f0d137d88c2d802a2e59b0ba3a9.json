{"title":"Gone with the flow: Whitefish egg drift in relation to substrate coarseness under a range of flow velocities","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15923?af=R","date":1725275686000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Most major rivers in Europe have been dammed for hydropower or other purposes. Such river alterations have decimated natural reproduction of many migratory fish species, including that of the anadromous European whitefish, <i>Coregonus lavaretus</i>, which is now maintained by extensive stocking programmes. In addition to stocking, limited natural reproduction may occur downstream of dams, where peak flow bouts from the dams threaten to flush the eggs into unsuitable habitats. Here, we assessed the effects of water flow velocity and substrate coarseness on downstream drift of whitefish eggs under laboratory conditions. The experiment's two different gravel substrates retained eggs better than cobble or sand substrates; the water velocity needed for notable egg drift was higher for the gravel substrates. The results indicate that egg drift is one of the factors that should be considered when evaluating the effects of hydropower plant operations. Moreover, measures mitigating the effects of the artificial flow regimes should incorporate the type and coarseness of the riverbed's substrate.</p>","author":"Topi K.
