The potential was assessed using criterion-based indicators. After a Delphi survey, Content Validation Ratio determined indicator retention. Field trips and secondary sources identified the sites. <i>The sites with cultural significance were prioritized with other supporting factors</i>. The Weighted Sum Method assessed the heritage site potential. It was calculated for each criterion: Cultural, Physical, and Natural. Then, total potential was classified into three groups on the basis of equal intervals depicting high, medium, and low, where high ranges from 0.628 to 0.756, medium from 0.502 to 0.628, and low from 0.375 to 0.502. Being the capital city and hub of different activities, Srinagar district of the study area has maximum of the sites with high heritage potential. Owing to its long history, the study region has many heritage sites; however, its tourism potential has yet to be tapped. The study emphasizes the significance of shifting surges in tourism forms in managing sustainable tourism development.</p>","author":"Peer Jeelani, \nHuma Rashid, \nShamim Ahmad Shah, \nFarzana Ahad, \nShabana Gulzar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Natural Resources Forum: Table of Contents","siteHash":"7676559e36bee1a0185863394c45dc24d579291ceb628f3f1e31104b38f4a5af","entryHash":"fe86ccf5b83b8a7f2b4e2e832bf4e83f22f29161ec2c69ac111a67a3fcc5ed67","category":"Environment"}
