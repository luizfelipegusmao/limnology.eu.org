Cuddy</p>\r\n\r\nThis paper presents results from a study on water yield assessment across five major river basins of Afghanistan. The study was conducted using GR4J and GR4JSG precipitation-runoff models. The river basins were divided into 207 subcatchments and each subcatchment was divided into multiple functional units. The model was calibrated using observed streamflow data from 2008 to 2015 and validated over the 2016 to 2020 period. Model parameters were calibrated for an unregulated subcatchment in each basin and calibrated parameters from the best-performing subcatchment were transferred to other subcatchments. Results show that modelled water yield across the five basins varies from 0.3 mm in the Helmand basin to 248 mm in the Panj-Amu basin, with an average of 72.1 mm for the entire country. In the period of 2008 to 2020, area averaged water yield in the five basins varies from 36 to 174 mm. For the same period, mean annual precipitation for the entire country is 234.0 mm, indicating a water yield of 30.8%. The nation-wide average water yield of 72.1 mm is equivalent to 46.3 billion cubic meters (BCM) of surface water for the country. In addition, about 28.9 BCM generates annually in the neighbouring Tajikistan and Pakistan from snow and glaciers of the Hindu-Kush mountains. The elevated northern parts of Afghanistan, including parts of neighbouring Tajikistan are the primary water source. Water yield across the country varies between years but there is no consistent increasing or decreasing trends. About 60 to 70% of flow occurs between March to June. The study identified the high water yield areas and investigated variability at monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales. An importance finding is the large spatial and temporal variability of water yield across the basins. This information is crucial for long-term water resources planning and management for agricultural development.","author":"Fazlul Karim","siteTitle":"PLOS Water","siteHash":"76ba47a8597c89f4cf217272433133ba8aa6d0dba9c907d21e63f90c34e21e00","entryHash":"478cc112d4cf67ba477e255baa17ad72d4b1d42b7217ff5e85a9e62fb859894f","category":"Environment"}
