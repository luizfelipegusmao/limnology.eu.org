Suitable patients maybe successfully bridged using newer intravascular micro-axial left-ventricular assist devices [M-LVAD] for recovery or determination of definitive therapy. Methods: Between January-2020 and July-2024, 107 patients underwent placement of M-LVAD for CS. The cohort was divided into 4 groups based on their destination; group-1: 34 patients [32%] receiving transplant; group-2: 25 patients [23%] receiving durable LVAD; group-3: 42 patients [39%] bridging from post-cardiotomy CS [PCCS]; and group-4: 6 patients [5.6%] bridging decision/recovery [these were excluded from analysis]. Multivariable logistic-regression [MLR] and Cox-regression [MCR] models identified predictors of early-hospital and late mortality, with data reported as odds ratios [ORs], and hazard ratios [HRs], respectively.
