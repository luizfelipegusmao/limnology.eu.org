Salem</p>\r\n\r\nNile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>) is valued in aquaculture because of its quick development and ability to thrive in various environments. Myxosporeans are among the fish parasites that affect fish productivity, as they impact fish growth and reproduction, resulting in large fish deaths in farms and hatcheries. This study has been focused on morpho-molecular identification for the myxosporean parasites infecting Nile tilapia from three governorates in Egypt and assessment of gene expression of different cytokines (Interleukin-1βeta (<i>IL-1β</i>), major histocompatibility complex class II (<i>MHC-II</i>), and clusters of differentiation 4 (<i>CD-4</i>) and 8 (<i>CD-8</i>)) in tissues. Additionally, this work aimed to correlate the developed histopathological alterations and inflammatory reactions in gills with immunohistochemical expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (<i>iNOS</i>) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (<i>TNF-α</i>). Finally, the infected fish’s cortisol levels and blood glucose were assessed. Results of BLAST sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA for the collected protozoans confirmed <i>Myxobolus agolus</i>, <i>M</i>. <i>brachysporus</i>, <i>M</i>. <i>tilapiae</i>, and <i>Henneguya</i> species. The molecular characterization of the immunological status of gills revealed marked upregulation of different inflammatory cytokines in the gills of infected fish. There was a significantly increased serum cortisol and glucose level in infected fish compared with control, non-infected ones. Severe histopathological alterations were observed in the infected fish gills, associated with increased expression of <i>iNOS</i> and <i>TNF-α</i> and related to myxosporean infection. The present study provides new insights into oxidative stress biomarkers in Nile tilapia infected with Myxosporeans and elucidates the gill’s immune status changes as a portal of entry for protozoa that contribute to tissue damage.","author":"Reem M.
