{"title":"Bioactive Properties of Microencapsulated Anthocyanins from Vaccinium floribundum and Rubus glaucus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0158/v1","date":1727859673000,"content":"Anthocyanins, known for their antioxidant properties and potential health benefits, are prone to degradation due to environmental factors such as light, temperature, and pH. Microencapsulation, a technique involving the entrapment of anthocyanins in a protective matrix, is used to enhance their stability and bioavailability. This study investigates the bioactive properties of microencapsulated anthocyanins derived from Vaccinium floribundum (Andean blueberry) and Rubus glaucus (Andean blackberry). The extracts from V. floribundum and R. glaucus were microencapsulated using maltodextrin as the carrier agent through a spray-drying process. The microcapsules were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to assess their chemical and morphological properties. The biological activities of these microencapsulated anthocyanins were evaluated for their antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti inflammatory effects. The results demonstrated enhanced bioactivity of the microencapsulated anthocyanins, highlighting their potential use in developing functional foods and pharmaceuticals. This study provides insights into the effectiveness of microencapsulation in preserving anthocyanins' functional properties and enhancing their health-promoting effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7eeab0fdfcce0d964c68df21c95de77ff80b0c0541e6831b42e6d43b53d3e834","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
