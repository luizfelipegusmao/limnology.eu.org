{"title":"Roles of Micropillar Topography and Surface Energy on Cancer Cell Dynamics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1216/v1","date":1718704634000,"content":"Microstructured surfaces are renowned for their unique properties, such as waterproofing and low adhesion, making them highly applicable in the biomedical field. These surfaces play a crucial role in influencing cell response by mimicking the native microenvironment of biological tissues. In this study, we engineered a series of biomimetic micropatterned surfaces using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to explore their effects on primary breast cancer cell lines, contrasting these effects with those observed on conventional flat surfaces. The surface topography was varied to direct cells’ attachment, growth, and morphology. Our findings elucidate that surface-free energy is not merely a background factor but plays a decisive role in cell dynamics, strongly correlating with the spreading behaviour of breast cancer cells. Notably, on micropillar surfaces with high surface-free energy, an increase in the population of cancer cells was observed. Conversely, surfaces characterised by lower surface-free energies noted a reduction in cell viability. Moreover, the structural parameters, such as the gaps and diameters of the pillars, were found to critically influence cellular dispersion and adherence, underscoring the importance of the microstructures’ topography in biomedical applications. These insights pave the way for designing advanced microstructured surfaces tailored to specific cellular responses, opening new avenues for targeted cancer therapies and tissue engineering.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d56a9ae9a0c84cc67081d9f2052b75a01eec7dbb6cd27c13a36f341a32df2a35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
