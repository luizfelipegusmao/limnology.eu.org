{"title":"Exploring the Contrasts and Similarities of Dengue and SARS-CoV-2 Infections during the COVID-19 Era","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2464/v1","date":1727713457000,"content":"Extensive research has been conducted on the SARS-CoV-2 virus in association with various infectious diseases to understand the pathophysiology of the infection and potential co-infections. In tropical countries, exposure to local viruses may alter the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and coinfection. Notably, only a portion of the antibodies produced against SARS-CoV-2 proteins demonstrate neutralizing properties, and the immune response following natural infection tends to be temporary. In contrast, long-lasting IgG antibodies are common after dengue virus infections. In cases where preexisting antibodies from an initial dengue virus infection bind to a different dengue serotype during a subsequent infection, there is a potential for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and the formation of immune complexes associated with disease severity. Both SARS-CoV-2 and dengue infections can result in immunodeficiency. Viral proteins of both viruses interfere with the hostâ€™s IFN-I signaling. Additionally, a cytokine storm can occur after viral infection, impairing a proper response, and autoantibodies against a wide array of proteins can appear during convalescence. Most of the reported autoantibodies are typically short-lived. Vaccines against both viruses alter the immune response, affecting the course of viral infection and enhancing clearance. A comprehensive analysis of both viral infections and pathogenicity is revisited to prevent infection, severity, and mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"267cc558f9b47626be0babca02991ab4c217b96db7c61e6cfe6cbd6178966351","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
