The aim of this study was to identify the role of auxiliary general biomarkers to verify low ALP serum activity as an alert parameter for an ALPL gene pathogenic variants.\nMaterial: A retrospective analysis of adult patients with at least one reduced ALP value of less than 21 U/L was performed. 88 patients had a temporary HPE (tHPE group). 12 out of 20 patients with persistent HPE agreed to a genetic analysis. 11 patients had a pathogenic ALPL gene variant (ALPL group). Hemoglobin [HB], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], calcium, phosphate, thyrotropin [TSH], albumin, total protein, and C-reactive protein [CRP] levels) represented basic biomarkers. A statistical comparison of general biomarkers was performed between both groups.\nResults: The mean HB, ALP, AST, calcium, albumin, and total protein levels were lower in the tHPE group (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed3079bc58b21224e040a668dc63717f3f320d1b6f700ef391206924da5cff5e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
