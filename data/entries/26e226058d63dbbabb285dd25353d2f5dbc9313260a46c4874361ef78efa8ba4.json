{"title":"Catastrophic Failure Analysis of a Wind Turbine Gearbox by Finite Element Method and Fracture Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2186/v1","date":1727417277000,"content":"Wind energy is one of the main drivers of the renewable energy market. The wind turbine gearbox, used as a multiplier - is one of the main components directly related to wind turbine efficiency and lifespan. Therefore, the strict control of the gearbox project and its manufacturing processes or even minor improvements in this component heavily and positively impact energy production/generation over time. This work diagnoses a 1.6 MW gearbox fracture mechanics to identify its main reason and how the chain of events took place, leading to the catastrophic failure. The diagnoses underwent numerical simulation (Finite Element Analysis - FEA) and further analysis of the lubrication system, bearings, planetary stage gears, helical stage gears, and high-speed shaft. In conclusion, although the numerical simulation showed high contact stresses between the teeth, the region with the crack nucleated was the top land (tip of the tooth). The most likely factors that led to the premature failure were the missed lubrication for the planetary bearings, lack of gear raw material cleanliness, and excessive case depth at the tip of the sun shaft gear teeth. With the sun gear, planet bearings, and planet gears broken in pieces, those small and large pieces dropped into the oil, between the gears, and into the tooth ring, ending up as a premature gearbox failure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26e226058d63dbbabb285dd25353d2f5dbc9313260a46c4874361ef78efa8ba4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
