{"title":"Cosmic Entropy Prediction with Extremely High Precision in Rh = ct Cosmology","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1436/v1","date":1726740563000,"content":"We present how the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a growing black hole variant of Rh = ct cosmology model can be rewritten as a function of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation temperature or Hubble parameter, rather than the Hubble radius, as first pointed out by Tatum and Seshavatharam [1]. We then show how our CMB temperature formulae lead to much higher precision in the estimated entropy of the Hubble radius universe, since the CMB temperature can be measured with great precision. We also briefly discuss how the Schwarzschild metric can be rewritten as a function of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and how the entropy of the universe can be directly linked to recent estimates of the number of quantum operations in the universe since its beginning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"482e226cbcb060abf8d3082cbd9df68fa671679bdb3782a046e797714d6d4498","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
