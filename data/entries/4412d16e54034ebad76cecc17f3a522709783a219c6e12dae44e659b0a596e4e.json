IgG4 has the shortest hinge with 12 residues. The Fc subunit has two glycan chains, but the importance of glycosylation is not fully understood in IgG4. Here, to evaluate the stability and structure of non-glycosylated IgG4, we performed a multidisciplinary structural study of glycosylated and deglycosylated human IgG4 A33 for comparison with our similar study of human IgG1 A33. After deglycosylation, IgG4 was found to be monomeric by analytical ultracentrifugation; its sedimentation coefficient of 6.52 S was reduced by 0.27 S in reflection of its lower mass. X-ray and neutron solution scattering showed that the overall Guinier radius of gyration <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> and its cross-sectional values after deglycosylation were almost unchanged. In the <i>P(r)</i> distance distribution curves, the two <i>M1</i> and <i>M2</i> peaks that monitor the two most common distances within IgG4 were unchanged following deglycosylation. Further insight from Monte Carlo simulations for glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG4 came from 111,382 and 117,135 possible structures respectively. Their comparison to the X-ray and neutron scattering curves identified several hundred best-fit models for both forms of IgG4. Principal component analyses showed that glycosylated and deglycosylated IgG4 exhibited different conformations from each other. Within the constraint of unchanged <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> and <i>M1-M2</i> values, the glycosylated IgG4 models showed more restricted Fc conformations compared to deglycosylated IgG4, but no other changes. Kratky plots supported this interpretation of greater disorder upon deglycosylation, also observed in IgG1. Overall, these more variable Fc conformations may demonstrate a generalisable impact of deglycosylation on Fc structures, but with no large conformational changes in IgG4 unlike those seen in IgG1.","author":"Valentina A.
