{"title":"Effect of Total Dissolved Gas Supersaturation on Swimming Performance of Migratory Fish for Traversing Velocity Barriers","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/8846496?af=R","date":1724078050000,"content":"<p>This study investigates the impact of total dissolved gas supersaturation (TDGS) on the swimming capabilities of migratory fish (<i>S. prenanti</i>), a common issue during high dam discharges in flood seasons. We assessed fish exposed to 130% TDGS for 2 hr, focusing on their swimming performance in a controlled environment. In our experiments, control group fish, utilizing prolonged swimming, showed reduced maximum distances as flow velocities increased from 3 to 10 BL/s (body length per second), covering distances between 1,285 and 119 BL. In contrast, TDGS-exposed fish achieved only 15%–95% of these distances. Under burst swimming conditions, control group fish also demonstrated a decrease in maximum distances with increasing flow velocity, achieving 280–124 BL, while TDGS-exposed fish reached just 48%–64% of these distances. Notably, the critical flow velocity (<i>U</i>\n<sub>fcrit</sub>) for transitioning from prolonged to burst activity level was lower for the TDGS group (7.2 BL/s) compared with the control (9.8 BL/s). In open flume trials, TDGS-exposed fish displayed a stronger upstream swimming inclination beyond <i>U</i>\n<sub>fcrit</sub>, indicated by quicker times, higher speeds, and shorter trajectories. This study provides novel insights into the adaptive swimming strategies and flow velocity responses of fish under TDGS stress.</p>","author":"Quan Yuan, \nZhiguang Zhang, \nKefeng Li, \nRuifeng Liang, \nBo Zhu, \nYuanming Wang, \nChristyn Bailey","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"8a44e78a020322cf24ca5780e5fe1fa774328804bf86efd3fc5c477e943804b1","category":"Environment"}
