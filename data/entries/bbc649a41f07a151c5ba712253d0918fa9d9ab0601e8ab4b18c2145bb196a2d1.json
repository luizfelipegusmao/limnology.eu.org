{"title":"The Use of Berries in the Control of Obesity as a Reducing Factor for Mild Cognitive Decline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1902/v1","date":1721819156000,"content":"The amplified production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reduced oxidant protection is described as oxidative stress, which contributes to the increase in several disorders, notably obesity and neurodegenerative diseases. Flavonoids are polyphenol compounds found in a variety of foods of plant origin, such as berries, with a basic chemical structure consisting of an aromatic ring linked to a benzene ring and a pyran ring. Flavonoids have neuroprotective activity and promote synaptogenesis and neurogenesis and are also capable of inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Anthocyanins are water-soluble natural pigments that belong to the flavonoid class and have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, helping to reduce chronic inflammation associated with various health conditions, including obesity. In addition, flavonoids and anthocyanins can modulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, promoting the oxidation of fatty acids and the reduction of lipid synthesis, contributing to the reduction of body fat accumulation. One of the most abundant flavonoids in the natural environment, quercetin, is found mainly in the form of O-glycoside derivatives and rarely as an aglycone. Quercetin has antioxidant properties, against diseases such as cancer; It also acts to combat allergic reactions, inflammatory processes, platelet disorders, obesity, hypertension and atherosclerotic and hypercholesterolemic disorders. Anthocyanins can activate intracellular signaling pathways, such as the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) pathway, which has a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism and glycemic homeostasis. Activation of this pathway increases glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, favoring weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity. This review article aims to analyze the effects of using berries in controlling obesity and its role as a reducing factor for mild cognitive decline. A systematic review will be carried out following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyze. We will search the following electronic databases: PubMed (Medline), Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bbc649a41f07a151c5ba712253d0918fa9d9ab0601e8ab4b18c2145bb196a2d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
