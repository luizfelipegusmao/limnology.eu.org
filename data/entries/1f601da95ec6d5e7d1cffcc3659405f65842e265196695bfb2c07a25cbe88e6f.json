{"title":"Alpha Synuclein Toxicity and Non-motor Parkinson&rsquo;s","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1199/v1","date":1718696451000,"content":"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common multisystem neurodegenerative disorder affecting 1% of the population above 60 years. The main neuropathological features of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the presence of alpha synuclein (Syn)-rich Lewy bodies both manifesting with classical motor signs. Syn has emerged as a key protein in PD pathology as it can spread through synaptic networks to reach several anatomical regions of the body contributing to the appearance of non-motor symptoms (NMS) considerate prevalent among individuals before PD diagnosis and persisting throughout the patient’s life. NMS mainly include loss of taste and smell, constipation, psychiatric disorders, dementia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior impairment, urogenital dysfunction, and cardiovascular impairment. \nThis review summarizes the more recent findings showing the impact of Syn deposits on several prodromal NMS and emphasizes the importance of early detection of Syn toxic species in biofluids and peripheral biopsies as prospective biomarkers in PD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1f601da95ec6d5e7d1cffcc3659405f65842e265196695bfb2c07a25cbe88e6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
