Yet, there is a lack of knowledge of which species and areas have a high risk of zoonotic disease spillover due to wildlife hunting and trade. We combined maps of hunting pressure, recent data sets on human-shared pathogens, and trade volumes for 614 mammalian host species to map zoonotic disease risk from wildlife hunting and trade pantropically. We also assessed the relationship between zoonotic disease risk from hunting and probability of emerging zoonotic diseases using generalised least square regression. We identified hotspots of zoonotic disease risk from hunting in central America, China, and central Africa. When considering wildlife trade frequency, high risk occurs in southern Africa and China. Zoonotic disease risk from wildlife hunting aligns significantly with the risk of zoonotic emerging infectious diseases, suggesting that hunting is a key driver of zoonotic disease outbreaks of pandemic potential. Interventions that regulate the hunting of host species and considers the socioeconomic motivations behind hunting could reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover.</p>\n<h2>摘要</h2>\n<p>野生动物狩猎和贸易创造了大量人与动物直接接触的机会，可促进泛热带人畜共患病的传播。然而，对于哪些物种和地区因野生动物狩猎和贸易而具有人畜共患病外溢的高风险尚未明确。我们结合狩猎压力地图、人类共享病原体的最新数据集以及614种哺乳动物宿主物种的贸易量，绘制了泛热带野生动物狩猎和贸易导致人畜共患病风险的地图。我们还利用广义最小二乘法回归评估了狩猎造成的人畜共患病风险与新出现的人畜共患病概率之间的关系。我们在中美洲、中国和非洲中部发现了狩猎导致人畜共患病风险的热点地区。考虑到野生动物贸易频率，南部非洲和中国的风险较高。狩猎野生动物导致人畜共患病的风险与人畜共患新发传染病的风险显著一致，这表明狩猎是导致可能大流行的人畜共患疾病爆发的关键因素。对狩猎宿主物种进行监管并考虑狩猎背后的社会经济动机的干预措施可以降低人畜共患病外溢的风险。<span>【审阅：王易孚】</span></p>","author":"Jacqueline Choo, \nLe T.
