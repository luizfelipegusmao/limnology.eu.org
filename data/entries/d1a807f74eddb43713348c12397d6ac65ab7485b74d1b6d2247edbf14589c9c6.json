{"title":"Evaluating O2 : Ar, N2 : Ar, and 29,30N2 using membrane inlet mass spectrometry configured to minimize oxygen interference","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10644?af=R","date":1725112185000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) provides detailed measures of dissolved <sup>28,29,30</sup>N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and argon (Ar) for estimating important gas fluxes and concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies demonstrated a large O<sub>2</sub> scavenging effect while using a MIMS, where varying concentrations of O<sub>2</sub> can affect measured N<sub>2</sub> : Ar because O<sub>2</sub> interacts with N<sub>2</sub> in the ion source to produce NO<sup>+</sup> (<i>m</i>/<i>z</i> = 30), potentially decreasing the detected current for <sup>28,29</sup>N<sub>2</sub> and increasing the detected current for <sup>30</sup>N<sub>2</sub>. A common solution is to use a muffle furnace heated to 600°C with a copper reduction column to reduce the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> to minimal levels and accurately measure <sup>28,29,30</sup>N<sub>2</sub>. However, this solution eliminates the detection of O<sub>2</sub> in environmental samples, which is a major benefit of using a MIMS. We questioned whether the MIMS was sensitive enough to provide accurate O<sub>2</sub> estimates when using the furnace and whether the O<sub>2</sub> scavenging effect was real and consistent among MIMS. We conducted four separate experiments on three different MIMS to test the O<sub>2</sub> scavenging effect and the potential detection of O<sub>2</sub> when using a MIMS with furnace. The furnace removed ~ 99% of O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub> scavenging had little to no detectable effect on N<sub>2</sub> : Ar and an unclear effect on <sup>29</sup>N<sub>2</sub> : <sup>28</sup>N<sub>2</sub>, but increased <sup>30</sup>N<sub>2</sub> : <sup>28</sup>N<sub>2</sub>. In most cases, accurate O<sub>2</sub> data could be retrieved despite using the furnace. The need for O<sub>2</sub> reduction may be limited to measuring accurate <sup>30</sup>N<sub>2</sub> : <sup>28</sup>N<sub>2</sub> in isotope pairing studies, but without substantial loss of MIMS measurements used to describe O<sub>2</sub> dynamics.</p>","author":"Ashlynn R.
