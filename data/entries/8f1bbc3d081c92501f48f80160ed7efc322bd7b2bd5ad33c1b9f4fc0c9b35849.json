{"title":"All-Cause Mortality According to COVID-19 Vaccination Status: an analysis of the UK Office for National Statistics Public Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202302.0414/v2","date":1718603843000,"content":"The COVID-19 pandemics has had an unprecedented global impact, and the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign has been commonly regarded as crucial to overcome the pandemics. Since all-cause mortality is the best way to measure the consequences of a health intervention, the present study was devised to analyze the all-cause mortality data of the United Kingdom (UK), which are made publicly available broken down by vaccination status. Data from April 2021 to May 2023 were retrospectively collected and analyzed according to age groups and vaccination status and the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) for all-cause mortality and for non-COVID-19 were calculated in comparison to the corresponding unvaccinated groups. Results show that, since an age group dependent date, the all-cause mortality SMRs were increasing in any of the age groups considered. Initially, the all-causes death SMRs were less than 1 for all age groups, but due to their growth, for the age groups 18-39, 80-89 and 90+ years by a certain date they exceeded the reference value. For the other age groups, as long as the trend is maintained, it is possible to predict the date in which the SMR would reach the value 1. Non-COVID-19 SMR values show a very similar trend. Their initial values much lower than 1 suggest the presence of significant biases in the ONS dataset which lead to an underestimation of the risks for those vaccinated, as it is not plausible that the vaccine protects from causes other than COVID-19. The finding that all-cause mortality SMRs in vaccinated in comparison to unvaccinated people increases over time requires careful examination to understand the underlying factors. Meanwhile, the other major countries should undertake a systematic collection of all-causes mortality broken down by vaccination status, and should be implemented a moratorium of the promotion of mass vaccination campaigns.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f1bbc3d081c92501f48f80160ed7efc322bd7b2bd5ad33c1b9f4fc0c9b35849","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
