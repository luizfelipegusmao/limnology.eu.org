The study was motivated by the need to understand how family-run businesses contribute to preserving and promoting cultural heritage in Malaysia. Through a qualitative analysis, we examined the business strategies, cultural values, and operational models of family businesses engaged in cultural heritage sectors. Our findings reveal a unique blend of traditional values and modern business understanding, highlighting how these businesses play a crucial role in sustaining cultural heritage. Family businesses in Malaysia have developed distinctive approaches to cultural heritage management, blending traditional values with innovative strategies to navigate the challenges of modernisation and globalisation. This has implications for business practices and cultural preservation, offering insights into sustainable cultural heritage management in a rapidly evolving global landscape. The study underscores the importance of family business-based culture in the stewardship of cultural heritage. It argues for greater recognition of these businesses in policy formulation and heritage management strategies. It shows that Malaysia's symbiotic relationship between family businesses and cultural heritage presents a model that balances economic viability with cultural preservation, offering lessons for the business world and cultural heritage sectors globally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"071c0733f2284edd20ca53a0710eb8d1728fa6b52ea6f4b3d694b416bedf611a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
