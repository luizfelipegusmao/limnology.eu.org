{"title":"Unveiling Complex Breakup Dynamics in the Transitional Regime of Entrapped Air within High-Density Media","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0861/v1","date":1728712321000,"content":"The dynamics of a quiescent finite-size air filament in a static liquid is investigated through axisymmetric numerical simulations. Due to surface tension, the two ends of the air filament retract and form bulges. We categorize the observed breakup behavior into four distinct regimes on a phase diagram, labeled I, II, III, and IV, each with its appropriate scaling. For Ohnesorge number, Oh ≤ Oh lim = 0.1, the mass of the detached bubble is approximately more than 2.1 times the size of the initial radius of the filament. Using this assumption, a first-order approximate mathematical model is reported for Oh ≤ Oh lim that shows if the aspect ratio (Γ) of the filament is greater than 11, the filament will always breakup. In the neck-reopening regime, the jump distance from the neck to the center of the filament exhibits an increasing trend with an increase in Γ and decreases when Oh is increased. For the same regime, a recirculating flow generated around the stagnation point at the center of the filament induces the reopening of the neck, ultimately resulting in a breakup at the center of the filament.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecf6e92bdd4382c650664c9c5547733059e1a3a70eb7539ef27c86c8a65fc5e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
