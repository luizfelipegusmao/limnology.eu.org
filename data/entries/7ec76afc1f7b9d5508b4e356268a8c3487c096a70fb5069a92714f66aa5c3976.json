{"title":"Modern Management of Pregnancy in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: From Prenatal Counselling to Postpartum Support","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1182/v1","date":1715942977000,"content":"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women in the childbearing age. Pregnancy in SLE patients poses unique challenges due to the po-tential impact on maternal and fetal outcomes. We provide an overview of the management of SLE during pregnancy, including pre-conception risk stratification and counselling, treatment, and disease activity monitoring. These assessments are critical to minimize maternal and fetal adverse events in SLE pregnant patients.  Disease flares, preeclampsia, antiphospholipid syn-drome complications, and maternal mortality are the major risks for a woman with SLE during gestation. Timely treatment of SLE relapse, differentiation of preeclampsia from lupus nephritis, and tailored management for antiphospholipid syndrome are essential for a successful pregnan-cy. Fetal outcomes include neonatal lupus (NL), preterm birth, cesarean delivery, fetal growth re-striction (FGR), and small for gestational age (SGA) infants. We focused on NL, linked to mater-nal anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies, which can lead to various manifestations, partic-ularly cardiac abnormalities in newborns. While there is a common consensus regarding the pre-ventive effect of hydroxychloroquine, the role of echocardiographic monitoring and fluorinated steroid treatment is still debated. Finally, close postpartum monitoring and counseling for sub-sequent pregnancies are crucial aspects of care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ec76afc1f7b9d5508b4e356268a8c3487c096a70fb5069a92714f66aa5c3976","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
