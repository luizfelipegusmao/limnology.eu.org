{"title":"Validation of Electromechanical Transient Model for Large-Scale Renewable Power Plant Based on Fast-Responding Generator Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1362/v1","date":1729152551000,"content":"The requirements for accurate models of renewable energy power plant are urgent for power system operation analysis. Most existing model research in this area is for wind turbine and photovoltaic (PV) power generation unit, a rare renewable power plant model validation mainly adopts the single-machine infinite-bus system. The single equivalent machine method is always used, and the interactions between the power plant and the grid are ignored. The voltage at the interface bus is treated as constant, although this is not consistent with its actual characteristics. The phase shifter method of hybrid dynamic simulation has been applied in the model validation of wind farm. However, this method is heavily dependent on phasor measurement units (PMU) data, resulting in limited application scope, and it is difficult to realize the model error location step by step. In this paper, the fast-responding generator method is used for renewable power plant model validation. The complete scheme comprising model validation, error localization, parameter sensitivity analysis, and parameter correction is proposed. Model validation is conducted based on measured records from a large-scale PV power plant in northwest China. The comparison of simulated and measured data verifies the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed scheme.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4524a4ef421c355a6c5b7e366d6e1de504341529e46b6cd4163bede7f07716c1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
