{"title":"Tetramethylpyrazine Nitrone (TBN) Reduces Amyloid β Deposition in Alzheimer&#039;s Disease Models by Modulating APP Expression, BACE1 Activity, and Autophagy Pathways","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1707/v1","date":1719236202000,"content":"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder. A wealth of evidence indicates that the amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates result from dyshomeostasis between Aβ production and clearance, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Consequently, therapies targeting Aβ reduction represent a promising strategy of AD intervention. Tetramethylpyrazine nitrone (TBN) is a novel tetramethylpyrazine derivative with the potential for the treatment of AD. Previously, we demonstrated that TBN markedly improved cognitive functions and reduced Aβ, APP, BACE 1 and hyperphosphorylated tau levels in 3 × Tg-AD mice. However, the mechanism by which TBN inhibits Aβ deposition still unclear. In this study, we employed the APP/PS1 mice treated with TBN (60 mg/kg, ig, bid) for six months and N2a/APP695swe cells treated with TBN (300 μM) to explore the mechanism of TBN on the Aβ reduction. Our results indicated that TBN significantly alleviated cognitive impairment and reduced Aβ depositions in APP/PS1 mice. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that TBN decreased the expression of APP and BACE1, activated the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 autophagy pathway and inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ULK1 autophagy pathway, as well as decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK and ERK in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, TBN was found to significantly reduce the mRNA levels of APP and BACE1, as well as those of SP1, CTCF, TGF-β, and NF-κB, transcription factors involved in regulating gene expression. Additionally, TBN was observed to decrease the level of miR-346 and increase the levels of miR-147 and miR-106a in the N2a/APP695swe cells. These findings indicate that TBN may reduce Aβ levels likely via reducing APP expression by regulating APP gene transcriptional factors and miRNAs, reducing BACE1 expression, and promoting autophagy activities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0f6b0c784490b0a1b06efb83df478a89478218c71596be6e6a10322de78244a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
