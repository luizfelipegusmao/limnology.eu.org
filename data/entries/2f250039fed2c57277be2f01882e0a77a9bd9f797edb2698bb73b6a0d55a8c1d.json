People can improve their pronunciation and communicate more clearly and confidently by developing their capacity to perceive and manipulate sounds. This combined emphasis on improving speech and reducing anxiety draws attention to the many benefits of incorporating phonemic awareness interventions into speech therapy plans and educational courses. The aim of this article review is to gather and collect relevant literature that solidifies the idea that phonemic awareness is one of the solutions to speech anxiety problems. Through the consistent practice of diverse phonemic exercises, people can become less sensitive to the anxiety-inducing elements of verbal communication, thus cultivating a sense of mastery and control over their speech. Through gradual exposure, people can gradually develop resilience and confidence, which is an essential component in the effective management of speech anxiety. In order to enable people to overcome speech anxiety, this conclusion emphasizes the importance of including phonemic awareness interventions within educational and therapeutic settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f250039fed2c57277be2f01882e0a77a9bd9f797edb2698bb73b6a0d55a8c1d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
