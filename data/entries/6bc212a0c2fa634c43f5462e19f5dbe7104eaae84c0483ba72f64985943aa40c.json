{"title":"Diagnostic Value of Menstrual Blood Lipidomics in Endometriosis: A Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1326/v1","date":1716304956000,"content":"Endometriosis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a considerable delay between initial symptoms and diagnosis through surgery. The pressing need for a timely, non-invasive diagnostic solution underscores the focus of current research efforts. This study examines the diagnostic potential of the menstrual blood lipidome. The lipid profile of 39 samples (23 women with endometriosis and 16 patient of control group) was acquired using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with LipidMatch processing and identification. Profiles were normalized based on total ion counts. Significant differences in lipids were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Lipids for the diagnostic model, based on logistic regression, were selected using a combination of variance importance projection filters and Akaike information criteria. Levels of ceramides, sphingomyelins, cardiolipins, triacylglycerols, acyl- and alkenyl-phosphatidylethanolamines, and alkenyl-phosphatidylcholines increased, while acyl- and alkyl-phosphatidylcholines decreased in cases of endometriosis. PE P-16:0/18:1 and CL 16:0_18:0_22:5_22:6 serve as marker lipids in the diagnostic model, exhibiting a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 85%. The diagnostic approach based on dried spots of menstrual blood holds promise as an alternative to traditional non-invasive methods for endometriosis screening.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bc212a0c2fa634c43f5462e19f5dbe7104eaae84c0483ba72f64985943aa40c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
