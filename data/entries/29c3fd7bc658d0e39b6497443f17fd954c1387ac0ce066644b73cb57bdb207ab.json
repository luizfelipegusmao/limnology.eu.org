Since aluminium gravel bikes are cheaper to manufacture than carbon gravel bikes or titanium gravel bikes, they are ideal if you’re just dipping your toe into gravel riding and don’t want to spend too much.</p>\n<p>Aluminium gravel bikes also tend to make great <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/whats-the-best-bike-for-commuting/\">commuter bikes</a>, because they’re robust and can take wide tyres but still usually enable you to fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-mudguards/\">gravel mudguards</a> and a rear rack.</p>\n<p>Here’s our pick of the best aluminium gravel bikes that our expert testers – who clock up thousands of hours of ride time and years of experience between them – have ridden and rated.</p>\n<p>Towards the bottom of the page, we’ve got a <a href=\"#buyersguidealloy\">buyer’s guide to aluminium gravel bikes</a>, which explains why they feature among the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re attracted to aluminium gravel bikes because of their value for money, you can also check out our guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes-under-2000/\">best gravel bikes under £2,000</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-gravel-bike/\">best gravel bikes under £1,000</a>.</p>\n<h2>Best aluminium gravel bikes in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Boardman ADV 8.9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now</strong> from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=71026X1519955&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fbikes%2Fadventure-bikes%2Fboardman-adv-8.9-mens-adventure-bike-2021---s-m-l-xl-frames-389606.html\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Boardman ADV 8.9 road bike\" title=\"Boardman ADV 8.9 - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boardman ADV 8.9 remains startling value.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£1,150 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Good spec for the money; energetic ride; proper all-rounder</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Handlebar can transmit vibration at high tyre pressures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Boardman ADV 8.9 uses the brand’s alloy frame.

Its alloy frame provides plenty of stiffness for good power transmission and it’s equipped with quality Boardman finishing kit.</p>\n<p>It’s equipped with a Shimano GRX RX400 10-speed groupset, which gives a wide range of ratios, mechanical disc brakes and tubeless-ready wheels.

As such, it’s very practical with mounts for mudguards, but also space for 52mm tyres if you want to head off-road.</p>\n<p>The Tripster AT is an enjoyable ride with enough stiffness for sprints, as well as tackling gnarlier off-road terrain. There’s the gearing from the SRAM <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrain</a> to tackle climbs and the simplicity to manage hostile conditions.

As such, they offer a cheaper alternative if you’re just getting into gravel and aren’t sure if it’s for you or what you want.</p>\n<p>That also means they tend to offer lower-priced specs, which is an advantage when it comes time for parts replacement – components wear quickly in off-road conditions.</p>\n<p>As with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes/\">best aluminium road bikes</a>, you may find you get more for your money from an aluminium gravel bike.</p>\n<h3>Are aluminium gravel bikes heavy?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist riding the Cannondale Topstone Alloy 2 gravel bike\" title=\"Cannondale Topstone Alloy 2 gravel bike_13\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some aluminium gravel bikes are lighter than similarly priced carbon gravel bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Not necessarily, it depends on how they’re constructed.
