{"title":"Threats posed by water transfer in Iran | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1743","date":1718283660000,"content":"Iran is experiencing unparalleled challenges related to water scarcity (1), including the desiccation of lakes and rivers, a decrease in groundwater levels, land subsidence, the degradation of waterquality, desertification, soil erosion, and dust storms (2). In response, the Iranian government has begun transferring lake water and desalinated seawater to regions plagued by desertification and scant rainfall to provide drinking water and meet agricultural and industrial water demands (3â€“6). Many water transfer projects are underway, and more are planned, but few have undergone a thorough evaluation of their environmental, economic, and social implications (4). Iran should consider the environmental effects of transferring water and focus on other solutions to water scarcity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"bd88558257f9e67de8df8656094b477d06c8665a3879ee67c07ba0edc22f07af","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
