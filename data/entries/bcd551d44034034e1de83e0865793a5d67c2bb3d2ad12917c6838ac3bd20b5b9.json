This process unfolds within the chloroplast, a green organelle. Chloroplasts are semi-autonomous entities, meaning their development and function hinge on the expression of genes from both the nucleus and chloroplast. Gene expression between the spatially separated cellular compartments, the nucleus and the chloroplast, is highly coordinated, which ensures proper chloroplast development and function (<a href=\"#kiae310-B2\">Jarvis and LÃ³pez-Juez 2013</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"bcd551d44034034e1de83e0865793a5d67c2bb3d2ad12917c6838ac3bd20b5b9","category":"Environment"}
