{"title":"Translational Regulation of Duplicated Gene Expression Evolution in Allopolyploid Cotton","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1407/v1","date":1724121520000,"content":"Polyploidy, a prevalent event in plant evolution, drives phenotypic diversification and speciation. While transcriptional changes and regulation in polyploids have been extensively studied, the translational level impact remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a com-parative transcriptomic and translatomic analysis of cotton leaves from allopolyploid species G. hirsutum (AD1) and G. barbadense (AD2) relative to their model A-genome and D-genome diploid progenitors. Our data revealed that while allopolyploidization significantly affects the transcrip-tional landscape, its impact on translation was relatively modest, evidenced by a narrower ex-pression range and fewer expression changes in ribosome-protected fragments than in mRNA levels. Allopolyploid-specific changes commonly identified in both AD1 and AD2 were observed in 7,393 genes at either transcriptional or translational levels. Interestingly, the majority of translational changes exhibited concordant down-regulation in both ribosome-protected fragments and mRNA, particularly associated with terpenoid synthesis and metabolism. Regarding translational efficiency (TE), at least one-fifth of cotton genes exhibit translational level regulation, with a general trend of more down-regulation than up-regulation of TE. The magnitude of translational regulation was slightly reduced in allopolyploids compared to diploids, and allopolyploidy tends to have a more profound impact on genes and functional associations with ultra-low TE. Moreover, we demonstrated a reduced extent of homeolog expression biases during translation compared to transcription. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the regulatory consequences of allopolyploidy post-transcription, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of regulatory mechanisms of duplicated gene expression evolution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0ab71955567bb10df849d81c3aadacc64de5fdad6b346c531b0aa28945a4d622","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
