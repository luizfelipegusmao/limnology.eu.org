{"title":"“You have to stay in your house…because trouble can come”: The impact of education, policy, and COVID-19 on menstruation experiences in Florence, Italy","link":"https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0003439","date":1726840800000,"content":"<p>by Meagan R.

DeMaria</p>\r\n\r\nStarting from menarche to menopause, menstruators have an overall negative view of menstruation, and there is a prevalent need for community awareness to increase regarding this topic. Menstruators in Italy and Europe arrive at menarche earlier than they have in previous decades, allowing less time for them to receive preparatory knowledge. Some European countries have started employing menstrual policies, yet current menstruation education minimally supports menstruators in terms of recognizing irregular symptoms and learning how to manage them. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused menstrual lifestyle patterns and experiences to be altered. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of menstruation-related education and policies accessible to menstruators and the impact COVID-19 had on menstruators. Researchers conducted 28 in-depth interviews in English with menstruators aged 18+ years who lived in or around Florence, Italy. All interviews were transcribed verbatim. Researchers used thematic analysis during coding to explore and understand participants’ menstruation education at menarche, menstrual leave policy opinions, and how COVID-19 impacted their menstruation experiences and the availability of menstrual resources. Participants discussed varying timelines regarding when they were taught about menstruation. Their education sources varied between family, peers, personal experiences, and school. Most participants expressed enthusiastic feelings toward menstrual leave policies. Many participants reported having faced challenges accessing menstrual products during COVID-19. Most participants expressed having positive impacts, while few expressed negative impacts during COVID-19. Results found most menstruators learned about menstruation through their family before menarche but did not consider themselves prepared for their first cycle. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced many menstruators to adopt some lifestyle habits, shedding light on the varying opinions on the need for a menstrual leave policy. Revamped policies related to timing, education type, and personal leave should be considered.","author":"Meagan R.
