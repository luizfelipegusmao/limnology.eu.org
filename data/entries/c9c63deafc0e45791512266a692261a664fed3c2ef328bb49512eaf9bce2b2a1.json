CKD is a global health issue that can lead to severe complications such as kidney failure and death.</p> Objective <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the actual causes of the alarming increase of kidney failure cases in Saudi Arabia using the supersaturated design analysis and edge design analysis.</p> Materials and methods <p>A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to the general population in the KSA, and data were collected using Google Forms. A total of 401 responses were received. To determine the actual causes of kidney failure, edge and supersaturated designs analysis methods were used, which resulted in statistical significance. All variables were studied from factor <i>h</i><sub>1</sub> to factor <i>h</i><sub>18</sub> related to the causes of kidney failure.</p> Results <p>The supersaturated analysis method revealed that the reasons for the increase in kidney failure cases are as follows: <i>h</i><sub>9</sub>(Bad diet), <i>h</i><sub>8</sub>(Recurrent urinary tract infection), <i>h</i><sub>1</sub> (Not drinking fluids), <i>h</i><sub>6</sub> (Lack of exercise), <i>h</i><sub>14</sub> (drinking from places not designated for valleys and reefs), <i>h</i><sub>18</sub> (Rheumatic diseases), <i>h</i><sub>10</sub> (Smoking and alcohol consumption), <i>h</i><sub>13</sub> (Direct damage to the kidneys), <i>h</i><sub>2</sub> (take medications), <i>h</i><sub>17</sub> (excessive intake of soft drinks), <i>h</i><sub>12</sub> (Infection), <i>h</i><sub>5</sub> (heart disease), <i>h</i><sub>3</sub> (diabetes), <i>h</i><sub>4</sub> (pressure disease), <i>h</i><sub>15</sub> (Dyes used in X-rays), and <i>h</i><sub>11</sub> (The presence of kidney stones) are all valid. The design analysis method by edges revealed that the following factors contributed to an increase in kidney failure cases: <i>h</i><sub>8</sub> (Recurrent urinary tract infection), <i>h</i><sub>6</sub> (Lack of exercise), <i>h</i><sub>7</sub> (Obesity), and <i>h</i><sub>11</sub>.</p> Conclusion <p>The findings showed that there were causes of kidney failure that led to the statistical significance, which is <i>h</i><sub>8</sub> (Recurrent urinary tract infection) and <i>h</i><sub>11</sub> (The presence of kidney stones)</p>","author":"Alanazi Talal Abdulrahman","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c9c63deafc0e45791512266a692261a664fed3c2ef328bb49512eaf9bce2b2a1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
