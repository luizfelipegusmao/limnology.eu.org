{"title":"Alena Tensor and Its Possible Applications in Unification Theories","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1872/v7","date":1718281616000,"content":"Alena Tensor is a recently discovered class of energy-momentum tensors that provides a mathematical framework in which, as demonstrated in previous publications, the description of a physical system in curved spacetime and its description in flat spacetime with fields are equivalent and the metric tensor is not a property of spacetime, but a method of describing it. The use of Alena Tensor to describe a system with an electromagnetic field, leads to reconciliation of physical descriptions. In the curvilinear description, EFE were obtained with Cosmological Constant related to the invariant of the electromagnetic field tensor, which can be interpreted as negative pressure of the vacuum, filled with the electromagnetic field. In the classical description for flat spacetime, three densities of four-forces were obtained: electromagnetic, gravity, and the force responsible for the Abraham-Lorentz effect (radiation reaction force). There was obtained Lagrangian density and generalized canonical four-momentum, containing the four-potential of electromagnetic field and a term responsible for the remaining two forces. In the quantum picture, a QED Lagrangian density simplification was obtained, and the Dirac, Schr√∂dinger and Klein-Gordon equations are approximations of the obtained quantum solution. The article also shows, that the distribution of charged matter can be expressed as polarization-magnetization stress-energy tensor, what indicates explanation why gravity is not visible in the spinor-based description of matter used in QED. The description used also leads to a conclusion, that charged particles cannot remain at complete rest and that they should have spin. Obtained connection of the Einstein tensor with gravity and the radiation reaction force, after transition to curvilinear description, excludes black hole singularities. Finally, a method for verifying Alena Tensor within QM was presented, and the article discusses prospects for farther use of Alena Tensor in unification applications, against the background of existing research directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75a6fde87a7d4001ef1bf61bc0ef163cd4e62c3be0ac0b29277f96026af4489e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
