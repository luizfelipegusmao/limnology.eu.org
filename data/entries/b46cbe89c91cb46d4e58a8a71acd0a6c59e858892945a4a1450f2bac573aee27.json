{"title":"How Recent World Events Affect Empathy and Socio-Emotional Competencies? The Perception of Portuguese Adolescents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0439/v1","date":1722953002000,"content":"The recent world events seem to play a significant influence in the acquisition and upgrowth of empathy and socio-emotional competencies (SEC). In this study we sought to assess how the perception of these events affects the level of socio-emotional competencies and interpersonal reactivity of Portuguese adolescents and analyze differences due to sex and relationship status on its dimensions. Participants were 230 adolescents of both sexes, living in Portugal, with ages between 16 and 18 years old, mostly female, with the secondary educational level, living in an urban area and not in a relationship. An online questionnaire was applied, with the Social and Emotional Competencies (SEC-Q) scale and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). As results, it was found that adolescents have an above-average global interpersonal reactivity, with empathic concern and perspective taking presenting the higher values. Adolescents show a medium high average level of SEC, with the highest domains being self-awareness and social awareness and prosocial behavior. Girls showed significantly more interpersonal reactivity in empathic concern, personal distress and fantasy, and boys presented more self-awareness. As for the relationship status, adolescents not in a relationship manifest more personal distress, while those in a relationship present higher values in all dimensions of SEC. Although the perception of Portuguese adolescents does not seem to have been greatly affected by recent world events, these results can contribute to thinking about youth protection policies and designing more appropriate interventions to promote well-being in this crucial period of life, especially in times of instability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b46cbe89c91cb46d4e58a8a71acd0a6c59e858892945a4a1450f2bac573aee27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
