In this study, a comprehensive analysis was conducted, including epidemiological, phylogenetic, and pathological aspects, with particular emphasis on neuropathology, to better understand the impact of HV in these animals. Our results show a higher presence of HV in males compared to females, with males exhibiting a greater number of positive tissues. Additionally, adults were more frequently affected by HV infection than juveniles, with no infections detected in calves or neonates. The affected species were striped (<i>Stenella coeruleoalba</i>) and bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>). The highest positivity rates were observed in the genital system, cerebrum, and skin tissues. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a higher occurrence of Gammaherpesvirus (GHV) sequences but increased genetic diversity within Alphaherpesvirus (AHV). Key neuropathological features included astro-microgliosis (n = 4) and meningitis with minimal to mild perivascular cuffing (n = 2). The presence of concurrent infections with other pathogens, particularly cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV), underscores the complex nature of infectious diseases in cetaceans. However, the presence of lesions at the Central Nervous System (CNS) with molecular positivity for GHV, excluding the involvement of other potential neurotropic agents, would confirm the potential of this HV subfamily to induce neurological damage. Pathological examination identified lesions in other organs that could potentially be associated with HV, characterized by lymphoid depletion and tissue inflammation. These findings enhance our understanding of HV in odontocetes and highlight the need for ongoing research into the factors driving these infections and their broader implications.","author":"Ignacio Vargas-Castro","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"18d5e6ba1d334d20c1a24574e4ec5e20c874f33645a0e77410a7dd8d4e78ad4c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
