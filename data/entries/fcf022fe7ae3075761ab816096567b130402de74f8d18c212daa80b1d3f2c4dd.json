{"title":"Hidden in the depths, discovery of a new spiny sucker eel of the genus Lipogenys Goode and Bean 1895 (Teleostei, Notacanthiformes, Notacanthidae) in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15769?af=R","date":1713932367000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This study describes <i>Lipogenys hyalinumvelum</i>, a new species of the genus <i>Lipogenys</i> found on the Portuguese coast on the northeastern Atlantic during a crustacean survey. Information on the classification history and known distribution of the genus <i>Lipogenys</i> is provided. Dichotomous keys to the genera of Notacanthidae and the species of <i>Lipogenys</i>, based on morphology, are provided. The specimens were analysed using both morphological and molecular methods, including DNA sequencing of the <i>COI</i> and <i>16S</i> genes. The distinct genetic characteristics support the recognition of the present specimens as a new species. The hyaline color of the flap at the posterior edge of the operculum is a characteristic that differentiates <i>L. hyalinumvelum</i> from <i>Lipogenys gillii</i> and provides the etymology of the species name.</p>","author":"Pedro Gomes, \nHelena Silva, \nCatarina Churro","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"fcf022fe7ae3075761ab816096567b130402de74f8d18c212daa80b1d3f2c4dd","category":"Environment"}
