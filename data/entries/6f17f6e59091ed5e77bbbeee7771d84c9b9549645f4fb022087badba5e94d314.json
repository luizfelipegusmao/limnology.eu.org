{"title":"Highly Sensitive and Flexible Capacitive Pressure Sensors Combined with Porous Structure and Holes Array by Sacrificial Templates and Laser Ablation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0750/v1","date":1723428659000,"content":"Flexible wearable pressure sensors offer numerous benefits, including superior sensing capabilities, a lightweight and compact design, and exceptional conformal properties, making them highly sought after in various applications including medical monitoring, human-computer interaction, and electronic skin. Because of their excellent characteristics, such as simple fabrication, low power consumption, and short response time, capacitive pressure sensors have received widespread attention. As a flexible polymer material, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely used in the preparation of dielectric layers for capacitive pressure sensors. The Young's modulus of the flexible polymer can be effectively decreased through the synergistic application of sacrificial template and laser ablation techniques, thereby improving the functionality of capacitive pressure sensors. In this study, a novel sensor was developed through a series of processes including sacrificial template method using NaCl microparticles, COâ‚‚ laser ablation, and sandwiching a porous PDMS dielectric layer between two flexible electrodes to create a capacitive pressure sensor. The sensor demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.694 kPa-1 within the pressure range of 0-1 kPa, and can effectively detect pressures ranging from 3 Pa to 200 kPa. The sensor demonstrates stability for up to 500 cycles, with a rapid response time of 96ms and a recovery time of 118ms, coupled with a low hysteresis of 6.8%. Furthermore, our testing indicates that the sensor possesses limitless potential for use in detecting human physiological activities and signaling emergencies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6f17f6e59091ed5e77bbbeee7771d84c9b9549645f4fb022087badba5e94d314","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
