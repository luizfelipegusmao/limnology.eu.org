{"title":"The Current Landscape of Clinical Trails","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0559/v1","date":1725634201000,"content":"Clinical trials are essential in the development of new medical treatments, offering crucial data on their safety and effectiveness. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, examining trends, challenges, and innovations that have shaped the field over the past century. Data were extracted on July 15, 2024, and analyzed to identify patterns in trial design, sponsorship, participant demographics, and geographical distribution. The analysis reveals a significant increase in clinical trial registrations, peaking in 2021, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most trials focus on cancer, reflecting its global burden, and are predominantly interventional, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) being the most common study design. However, challenges persist, including underrepresentation of certain demographics, limited global distribution, and insufficient reporting of trial results. Additionally, the underrepresentation of pediatric, elderly, and minority populations in trials limits the generalizability of findings. The analysis underscores the need for more inclusive and globally distributed research to address disparities in health outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7edea995594f3a3f21bb24ef6046b10c58b0d79bb8bf05171c01df161ca81f7b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
