{"title":"A Note on R&eacute;nyi Entropy Production for Markovian Evolution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0866/v1","date":1726067021000,"content":"Entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics is defined as the average over all the possible system trajectories of a quantity (observable) which measures the divergence between a trajectory and its time-reversal. In this way a quantitative measure of the irreversible evolution of a system out of equilibrium can be given. In this note we consider a Markov system and substitute the linear average with a more general notion of average over the trajectories (Kolmogorov-Nagumo mean) which corresponds to substituting Shannon entropy with RÃ©ny entropy. We show that, unlike the linear average case, the resulting notion of entropy production depends on how the observable is defined.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91fa2f5d3724a9b0048db925dcfd700fa5c065e9c402b65359a5ade644758172","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
