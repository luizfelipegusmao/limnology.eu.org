{"title":"“It let me merge my love of teaching with research”: A qualitative investigation of the career pathways of biology education researchers","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312243","date":1729173600000,"content":"<p>by Emily P. Driessen, Ariel L. Steele, Robin A. Costello, Peyton Brewer, Cissy J. Ballen</p>\r\n\r\nDiscipline-based education research—a field of research that investigates teaching and learning within STEM disciplines—has emerged over the last few decades to improve the quality of STEM education worldwide. Simple qualitative questions concerning the career backgrounds and motivations of the individuals who conduct this research have yet to be explored. Here, we surveyed and interviewed discipline-based education researchers about their career trajectories and motivations to pursue this field of research. We focused specifically on recruiting biology education research faculty members at colleges and universities. We used the Social Influence Model and Social Cognitive Career Theory to develop and analyze survey and semi-structured interview questions. Findings revealed participant career paths all began with disciplinary undergraduate and graduate-level biology education. We noticed participants began conducting biology education research due to their <i>values</i> and <i>personal interests</i>, while additionally being swayed by <i>contextual factors</i>. Specifically, participants <i>valued</i> biology education research because it allowed them to make a difference in the world and provided them with a community open to change and collaboration. Biology education research allowed them to explore their <i>interests</i> in teaching and evidence-based approaches to education. These <i>values</i> and <i>interests</i> were impacted by <i>contextual factors</i>, including discoveries of opportunities, positive (or negative) experiences with mentorship, exposure to evidence-based teaching literature, considerations of salary and job security, and experiences with gender-based discrimination. Our results underscore the importance of harnessing individual values and interests—especially those centered on evidence-based teaching practices and making a difference in the world—while fostering a positive and supportive academic environment. This research reveals pathways toward discipline-based education research careers. Additionally, this research can inform the development of graduate programs and funding opportunities.","author":"Emily P.
