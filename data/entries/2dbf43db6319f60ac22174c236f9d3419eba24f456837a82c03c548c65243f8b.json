{"title":"Process Parameters as Tools to Intensify the Freeze-Drying Process and Modify the Sorption Properties of the Obtained Freeze-Dried Products","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0731/v1","date":1723471012000,"content":"The aim of this study was to investigate and effect of application of different conditions of freeze-drying on the kinetics of process and the sorption properties of dried apples. Slices of apple were frozen and subjected to freezing-drying process with different combination of a shelf temperature (-20, 10, 20, 30°C) and pressure (37, 63, 103, 165 Pa). During the freeze-drying, the temperature in the centre of material was recorded. The moisture content in dried material and changes of water content dried apples stored at humidity of 75.3% were obtained. The Midilli et al. model was used to describe drying kinetics of the freeze-drying with good fit. Drying time decreased from 660 (variant with a constant shelf temperature of 30°C, pressure 63 Pa) to 1305 minutes (variant with temperatures −20: 10: 20: 30°C, pressure 63 Pa). For this reason, the most favourable experimental parameters were: temperature of 30°C and pressure of 63 Pa. However, application of these parameters caused higher absorption of water vapour during storage. Therefore, the selection of freeze-drying parameters should also be related to the expected properties of the final product","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2dbf43db6319f60ac22174c236f9d3419eba24f456837a82c03c548c65243f8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
