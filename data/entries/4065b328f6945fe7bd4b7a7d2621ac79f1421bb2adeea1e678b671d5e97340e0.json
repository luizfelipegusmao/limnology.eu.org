Bohemia, CZ). Comparisons between the peak-season and off-season data and several stoichiometric relations calculated from them provided an insight into the mineral nutrient economy of the examined types of the fishpond littoral vegetation. It is rooted in relatively nutrient-poor sandy soil, but differently enriched with nutrients contained in either the percolating fishpond water, or that of springs located at the landward edge of the littoral zone. The degree of eutrophication of our sampling sites and their vegetation thus seem to be positively correlated with the degree of contact of the plants´ rhizosphere with the nutrient-richer fishpond or spring water.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"4065b328f6945fe7bd4b7a7d2621ac79f1421bb2adeea1e678b671d5e97340e0","category":"Environment"}
