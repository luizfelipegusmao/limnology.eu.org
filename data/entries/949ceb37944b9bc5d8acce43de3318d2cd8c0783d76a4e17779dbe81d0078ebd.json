{"title":"Habitat loss and small‐scale fishery: A controversial issue","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12795?af=R","date":1706591602000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Fishery is one of the most impacting human activities and is responsible for habitat loss in marine systems. While the effects of large-scale fisheries have been largely investigated, impacts of small-scale fisheries (SSF) on seafloor integrity are more often assumed than quantitatively investigated. We carried out a literature review at global scale, resulting in 19 studies with quantitative data on sessile benthic bycatch and only one documenting habitat loss driven by SSF. We also conducted a fine-scale assessment within a Mediterranean partially protected area (PPA). Results showed that 513 m<sup>2</sup> of the <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> meadow are removed annually by local SSF within the PPA, considering bycatch, fishing effort, and shoot density. Knowledge on fishing effort and fine-scale mapping is critical to assess habitat loss, suggesting the need for specific recommendations for eco-sustainable local fisheries.</p>","author":"Chiara Silvestrini, \nAlberto Colletti, \nAntonio Di Franco, \nFrancesco Colloca, \nGiacomo Milisenda, \nSerena Zampardi, \nMaria Cristina Mangano, \nGiorgio Aglieri, \nMarco Ranù, \nGianluca Liguori, \nRoberto Danovaro, \nFederica Foglini, \nValentina Grande, \nSimonetta Fraschetti","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"949ceb37944b9bc5d8acce43de3318d2cd8c0783d76a4e17779dbe81d0078ebd","category":"Environment"}
