{"title":"Choroidal and Retinal Thicknesses in Healthy Eyes Measured with Ultra-Wide Field Optical Coherence Tomography","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0434/v1","date":1715174110000,"content":"Ultra-wide field optical coherence tomography (UWF-OCT) has been recently introduced into clinical ophthalmological practice. To date, there is little data on the reference values of retinal thickness (RT) and choroidal thickness (CT) measured with this technique. This study aimed to analyze the variance of RT and CT in healthy eyes with UWF-OCT tests performed with the largest available scan size of 23 x 20 mm. The data were analyzed with reference to the patients' age, gender, and the axial length of the eyeball. The results of UWF-OCT scanning enabled us to picture the shape of the retina and choroid in a large portion of the eyeball. Both anatomical entities become significantly thinner at the periphery. The peripheral CT is greater in the upper and temporal sectors; the RT is higher in the nasal compared to the temporal sectors. Both choroid and retina lose thickness with age, however, CT and RT do not show a statistically significant correlation with the axial length after adjusting for age and gender. Age-related variations in thickness are especially prominent in the choroid. The CT in UWF-OCT testing is significantly greater in females while the RT is greater in males. UWF-OCT testing provides additional information on the anatomical structure of the retina and choroid compared to standard-field OCT","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"23b863193bd0cba48fcae8442d696ce9452afa1077c543a09fdcf522ae578977","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
