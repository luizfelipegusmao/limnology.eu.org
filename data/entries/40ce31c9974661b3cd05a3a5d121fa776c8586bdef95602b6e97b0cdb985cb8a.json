{"title":"Chronically Increased Levels of Circulating Insulin Secondary to Insulin Resistance: A Silent Killer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1125/v1","date":1726302456000,"content":"This review aims to show, by an analysis of the literature on the topic, that hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance is a multiple risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cellular senescence and cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. This condition is progressively increasing in developed and developing countries, and its prevalence has now exceeded 50% of the general population. Since it is asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic, it can last for many years before manifesting itself in the form of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, neoplasm, cognitive impairment or dementia, therefore determining enormous social and health care costs. For these reasons, we strongly believe that a screening plan for this pathology should be implemented, in order to identify affected subjects and promptly start them on preventive treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40ce31c9974661b3cd05a3a5d121fa776c8586bdef95602b6e97b0cdb985cb8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
