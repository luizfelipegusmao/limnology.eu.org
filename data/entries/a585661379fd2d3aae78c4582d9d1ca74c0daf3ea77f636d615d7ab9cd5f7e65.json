{"title":"Monitoring of Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA in Kidney Allograft Recipients during Two Years: Experience of One Center","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0492/v1","date":1720179854000,"content":"(1) Background: donor-derived circulating free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is an innovative biomarker with great potential for the early identification and prevention of graft damage; (2) Methods: Prospective study to analyze dd-cfDNA plasma levels in 30 kidney transplant patients during their post-transplant follow-up (15 days, 3, 6 and 9 months), to determine if the result could be of interest in the identification of possible adverse events, specially allograft rejection. In addition, the aim is also to verify the obtained data on sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV; (3) Results: Plasma levels of dd-cfDNA could be considered a novel biomarker of graft rejection after first term post-transplant up to several months before its clinical presentation, mainly in TCMR or ABMR.  In this study, it appears to have no positive predictive value for borderline rejection or TCMR IA. Our results show a low NPV of the technique because other pathologies or biological post-transplant complications can also affect dd-cfDNA levels and they must be considered in the interpretation of the result.; (4) Conclusions: dd cfDNA could allow, together with other additional biomarkers in the context of a future score, avoid invasive biopsies in most cases, mainly in the case of suspected TCMR or ABMR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a585661379fd2d3aae78c4582d9d1ca74c0daf3ea77f636d615d7ab9cd5f7e65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
