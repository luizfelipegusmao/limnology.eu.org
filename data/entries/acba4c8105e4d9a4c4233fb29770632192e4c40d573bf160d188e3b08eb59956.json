{"title":"Exploring the Heat Mitigation Effects of Urban Climate Adaptation Facilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1217/v1","date":1729013190000,"content":"Urban heat islands (UHI), exacerbated by climate change, significantly increase heat stress, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as the elderly and children. This study evaluates the effectiveness of various urban heat mitigation technologies, including cooling fog systems, cool roofs (reflective paint), shading structures, and small water paths, in reducing temperatures and enhancing thermal comfort. Field tests were conducted from 2021 to 2023 across Gimhae-si, Yechun-gun, Geyang-gu, and Sangju-si, with support from the Korean Ministry of Environment. Results demonstrated that cooling fog systems provided immediate temperature reductions, lowering ambient temperatures by up to 3.1째C, while cool roofs reduced surface temperatures by 2-3째C. Shading structures reduced surface temperatures by up to 10째C, and small water paths cooled air temperatures by up to 1.5째C, also increasing humidity and improving thermal comfort. The findings suggest that a combination of these technologies can effectively mitigate urban heat stress, especially in areas with vulnerable populations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"acba4c8105e4d9a4c4233fb29770632192e4c40d573bf160d188e3b08eb59956","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
