To measure the water intake of beef cattle reared in groups, two experiments were carried out in Brazil (South East/Middle East) using water throughs coupled with scales (Intergado, Betim, Brazil) and RFID individual identification systems, allowing the recording of individual water intake of animals. In experiment 1, young bulls (n = 96; 105 d on feed - feedlot) were randomly assigned to four treatments: 1) Control, no yeast derivative; 2) AY – 7 g·animal⁻¹·d⁻¹, Autolyzed Yeast grown on sugarcane molasses (RumenYeast, ICC, Brazil); 3) YM – 3 g·animal⁻¹·d⁻¹, yeast rich in soluble Yeast Metabolites; 4) YB – 5 g·animal⁻¹·d⁻¹, Yeast Blend (live Yeast plus autolyzed Yeast). Diets (adaptation, growing, and finishing) x treatments were treated as fixed effects on the complete randomized design. In experiment 2, backgrounding bull calves (n = 32) reared on grazing and 710 g/d of protein supplements (90 d) were randomly assigned to two treatments: 1) Control, no yeast derivative; 2) AY – 7 g·animal⁻¹·d⁻¹, Autolyzed Yeast (RumenYeast), the means were subjected to ANOVA analyses. In both experiments, additives were inserted into the diet (mineral premix or supplement), animals were the experimental unit, and differences were declared significant at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05. Yeast derivatives increased (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) water intake in both experiments (Figure 1). The average increment in water intake (L·animal⁻¹·d⁻¹ was 13.9%. Interestingly, the increment in relation to control was noted for all yeast derivatives and scenarios covered by the experiments (feedlot adaptation diet, feedlot growing diet, feedlot finishing diet, and grazing system). Until now, there seems to be no literature explanation for our findings. However, these results could help to explain the positive effects of yeast derivatives on rumen pH, protein microbial flow, and thermal stress since greater water intake increases the passage rate of rumen fluid and body heat loss. Statistical correlations may not be understood as a cause-consequence link. However, when dealing with a new question, correlations may give us a path to go on and investigate. Malheiros et al. (2023) noted a negative correlation between water intake and rumen dimethylamine. Autolyzed yeast can strongly decrease the concentration of rumen methylamines in cows facing subacute acidosis (Humer et al., 2018). Niacin metabolism should also be investigated since its supplementation enhances cows’ blood niacin levels and water intake. Yeast derivatives are rich in niacin, and autolyzed yeast supplementation can increase blood niacin and body heat loss during summer (Dias et al., 2018), probably increasing water need. In conclusion, yeast derivatives increased the water intake of beef cattle, and this finding adds to the understanding of how yeast derivatives supplementation benefits ruminants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"0eab77c420d8cd9b87c0fe16e97d655e722ab857931770ed9c8cf9dfd4d14d26","category":"Environment"}
