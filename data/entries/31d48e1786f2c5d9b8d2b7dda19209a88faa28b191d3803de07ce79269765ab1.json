{"title":"Interplay between Bile Acids and Intestinal Microbiota: Regulatory Mechanisms and Strategic Interventions for Infections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1907/v1","date":1719479881000,"content":"Bile acids (BAs) play a crucial role in the human body's defense against infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. BAs counteract infections not only through interactions with intestinal bacteria exhibiting bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) activity but also directly combat infections. Building upon our research group's previous discoveries highlighting the role of BAs in combating infections, we have initiated an in-depth investigation into the interactions between BAs and microbiota. Leveraging existing literature, we offer a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between BAs and 16 key microbiota. This investigation encompasses bacteria (e.g., Clostridioides difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacteroides, Clostridium scindens, Streptococcus thermophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii, Clostridium butyricum, Lactic Acid Bacteria), fungi (e.g., Candida albicans), and viruses (e.g., Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, norovirus). Our research underscores the critical role of the interplay between BAs and intestinal microbiota, including Bacteroides, Clostridium scindens, Streptococcus thermophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii, Clostridium butyricum, and Lactic Acid Bacteria, in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and combating infections. It is imperative to note that Primary bile acid (PBA) and Secondary bile acid (SBA) often exhibit distinct roles in the anti-infection process. In the antimicrobial action of BAs, SBA demonstrate antagonistic properties against a wide range of microbiota, with the exception of Norovirus. Given the intricate interplay between BAs and intestinal microbiota, and their regulatory effects on infections, we assert that BAs hold significant potential as a novel approach for preventing and treating intestinal microbial infections.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31d48e1786f2c5d9b8d2b7dda19209a88faa28b191d3803de07ce79269765ab1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
