{"title":"Tropical Building Sustainability and the Energy Regulations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1595/v1","date":1724256840000,"content":"Tropical regions face unique challenges in building sustainability due to high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall. While building energy regulations are essential for promoting energy efficiency, their effectiveness in addressing tropical climate conditions needs to be studied more. This research aims to systematically investigate tropical building sustainability issues and evaluate the impacts of building energy regulations on these challenges. The study will identify gaps in current regulations by analyzing existing research and recommend strategies for developing more comprehensive frameworks that promote sustainable building practices in tropical regions. This research contributes to developing effective policies and strategies for achieving sustainable and energy-efficient built environments in tropical climates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"24ac321f0455db9c32df9a9dac1bf64b2881f21deeb6b15daa026ebdf22f8c73","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
