{"title":"Gut Microbiota in Regulating Natural Bioactive Polysaccharides on Metabolic Diseases: A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1445/v1","date":1721286248000,"content":"The gut microbiota constitutes a complex ecosystem, comprising trillions of microbes that have co-evolved with their host over hundreds of millions of years. Over the past decade, a growing body of knowledge has underscored the intricate connections among diet, gut microbiota, and human health. Bioactive polysaccharides (BPs) from natural sources like medicinal plants, sea-weeds, and fungi have diverse biological functions, including antioxidant, immunoregulatory, and metabolic activities. Their effects are closely tied to the gut microbiota, which metabolizes BPs into health-influencing compounds. Understanding how BPs and gut microbiota interact is critical for harnessing their potential health benefits. This review provides an overview of the human gut microbiota, focusing on its role in metabolic diseases like obesity, type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It explores the basic characteristics of several BPs and their impact on gut microbiota. Given their significance for human health, we summarize the biological functions of these BPs, particularly in terms of im-munoregulatory activities, blood sugar, and hypolipidemic effect, providing a valuable reference for understanding the potential benefits of natural BPs in treating metabolic diseases. These properties make BPs promising agents for preventing and treating metabolic diseases. The comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which BPs exert their effects through gut microbiota opens new avenues for developing targeted therapies to improve metabolic health.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9316f216465e0fa5819ff0e1c2632f7ae90e2608a942fe0d4dd2658912af871a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
