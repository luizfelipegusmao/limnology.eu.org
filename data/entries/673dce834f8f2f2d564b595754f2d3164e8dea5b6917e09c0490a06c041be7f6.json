{"title":"115 Gene editing: Where are we on campus and where can it go?","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/12/7664775?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Editing the genome of livestock provides solutions to otherwise intractable problems and can provide a tool to better understand the role of specific proteins during development. The potential benefit for production agriculture is so great that the USDA Agricultural Research Service has invested in 4 positions now located in a research unit at the University of Missouri with a focus currently on swine and poultry. Genome editing can result in introducing alleles from divergent populations or novel alleles to produce animals that have new proteins, modified proteins or animals that no longer produce a protein. Applications of genome editing include improving disease resistance (viral and bacterial), improving digestion, disseminating valuable genetics, improved thermoregulation, changing the body/milk composition, and creating hypoallergenic meat. Changes in these animals will improve animal welfare, animal productivity and the sustainability of animal agriculture. In addition to improving animal agriculture, gene editing has enabled a new understanding of maternal recognition of pregnancy in the pig and a better understanding of molecules involved in growth and development of pigs. With new developments in editing of just somatic cells [somatic cell gene editing (SCGE), rather than germline editing], it will be possible to edit some cells in existing animals and thus change their phenotype. SCGE technologies such as this are being developed via the biomedical community as models to lead to human clinical applications. One such application is to correct cells in the lungs that produce the CFTR protein. Correction of just 10% of the cells in the lungs is estimated to correct the lung symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis. Similar applications in production agriculture might produce animals that have novel phenotypes of an altered carcass composition or better use of nutrients. Application of genetic engineering technologies such as genome editing is limited by biology and the imagination of the investigator.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"673dce834f8f2f2d564b595754f2d3164e8dea5b6917e09c0490a06c041be7f6","category":"Environment"}
