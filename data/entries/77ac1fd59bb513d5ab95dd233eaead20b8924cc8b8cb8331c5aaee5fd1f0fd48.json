{"title":"Conceptual Design and Simulation of an Ankle Joint Rehabilitation Exoskeleton","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0797/v1","date":1728557893000,"content":"The study presents the conceptual development and simulation of a robotic exoskeleton for ankle rehabilitation. The device is designed for ankle rehabilitation in patients with musculoskeletal disorders, injuries, or neurological diseases. The exoskeleton is equipped with three linear electric actuators that provide precise control of joint movements in multiple planes, allowing dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, inversion, and eversion. By utilizing a screw drive, the exoskeleton provides smooth and controlled movements, significantly reducing the risk of re-injury and improving rehabilitation. Simulation of the device and simulation results showed its high compatibility with the biomechanical features of the ankle joint. Virtual testing confirmed that the exoskeleton provides the smooth, controlled movements necessary for effective rehabilitation. Due to its ability to adapt to the individual physical capabilities of the patient, the device can be used in both active and passive forms of movement support. The results of the study demonstrate the potential of the exoskeleton in clinical applications, including its use in rehabilitation centers and at home. Its cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and high accuracy of movement control make this device a promising solution for restoring the functions of the lower extremities in patients with various musculoskeletal disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"77ac1fd59bb513d5ab95dd233eaead20b8924cc8b8cb8331c5aaee5fd1f0fd48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
