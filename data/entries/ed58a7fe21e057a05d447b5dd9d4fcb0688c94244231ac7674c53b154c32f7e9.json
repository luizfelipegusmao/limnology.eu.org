{"title":"Effect of Chemical Treatment on Mechanical and Hygric Properties of an Innovative Clay-Sand Composite Reinforced with Juncus acutus Fibers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0430/v1","date":1725516344000,"content":"This work aims to investigate the impact of chemical treatment of Juncus acutus fibers on the hygric and mechanical performances of an innovative bio-sourced clay-sand-Juncus acutus fibers composite. This lightweight specimen has been produced from a mixture of 60 % natural clay and 40 % sand by mass, as a matrix, and reinforced with different amounts of Juncus fibers. The fibers were used as a partial replacement of sand in mixture by volume at 0 % (Control Specimen), 5 %, 10 %, and 20 %. In order to enhance the fiber-matrix interfacial bound, the raw fibers have undergone an NaOH alkali treatment with different concentrations of 1, and 2 wt. %. Morphological and mineralogical evaluation based on SEM micrographs and EDX analyses revealed that, the alkaline concentration of 1 wt. % is the optimized one for natural fiber surface modifications (removal of impurities without any surface damage). This optimal concentration is confirmed by tensile strength tests, showing that the treated fibers with this alkali solution presents the higher tensile stress value of 81.97 MPa, compared to those of treated fibers with 2 % NaOH (74.45 MPa), and the untreated fibers (70.24 MPa). However, mechanical test-results highlighted the benefit effect of the fiber alkali treatment on both the compressive and flexural strengths, particularly for fiber contents of 5 % and 10 %, which corresponds to a strengthening rate of 25 % and 30 %, respectively. Results also showed that the sample containing treated fibers exhibited a better moisture regulating property than that produced with untreated fibers. The specimens are classified as excellent hygric regulator based on their moisture buffer performance (MBV &gt; 2 g/(m2.%RH)), according to NORDTEST classification. Results also indicated that the capillary water absorption and the apparent moisture diffusivity of composites was lowered due to high fiber-matrix interfacial bound, after fiber treatment. Consequently, the composite with treated fibers is less diffusive compared to that with untreated fibers, and thus expected to be more durable in a humid environment.  These results were confirmed by morphological analysis of fibers-matrix interfacial transition zone.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed58a7fe21e057a05d447b5dd9d4fcb0688c94244231ac7674c53b154c32f7e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
