Despite this, rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for CL is not part of the national control strategy. This study evaluates the acceptability and micro-costing of the CL Detect Rapid Test by Inbios International. The study was conducted from June 2019 to January 2020 and included 46 healthcare professionals from 40 primary healthcare centers and district labs. Data was collected by self-administered questionnaires and interviews and analysed using NVivo, Jamovi, and Python to generate a predictive model and sensitivity analysis by calculating the average Cost-Benefit Ratio for compared CL diagnostic scenarios. The exchange rate is 1 USD = 9.6 MAD (Moroccan Dirham) in November 2019. The CL-RDT received notable acceptance for its user-friendliness and time efficiency compared to traditional microscopy. Micro-costing data revealed that the average unit cost for microscopy is 15 MAD [7–31], whereas 75 MAD [52–131] for CL-RDT. Altogether, the diagnostic cost for microscopy is 115 MAD±4, marginally higher than the 102 MAD±2 for CL-RDT (p = 0,05). Sensitivity analysis identified the most cost-benefit scenarios based on a Cost-Benefit Ratio (CBR). The optimal approach involves using CL-RDT once at a primary healthcare centre (PHC) (CBR = 1.4), especially if the unitary cost is below 79 MAD. The second-best option is using CL-RDT once at a laboratory (CBR = 1.0), which is advantageous if priced under 54 MAD. However, using CL-RDT twice for the same lesion had a less favourable CBR of 0.6 and was only beneficial if priced below 09 MAD. The reference scenario was a single CL-RDT at the PHC followed by microscopy at a laboratory. In conclusion, the forthcoming CL-RDT, expected to feature enhanced sensitivity, is advocated for deployment in resource-limited endemic areas.","author":"Issam Bennis","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"2784722c37f575ac2765db949be50febadadcb12bb6fedf148d5d3fb9c41b733","category":"Environment"}
