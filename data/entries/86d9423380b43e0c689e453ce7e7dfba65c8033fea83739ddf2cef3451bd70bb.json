{"title":"Analysis of Drinking water Quality of Larkana City (Urban Areas)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0553/v1","date":1728375874000,"content":"Water is the most important source of life. However, due to various anthropogenic activities, water is no longer pure and drinkable. Pakistan is a country that is facing an acute shortage of safe water, and safe water drinking resources in Sindh, which is the second largest province of Pakistan, are depleting day by day. Therefore, a research study was carried out to determine the Physico- Biological properties of groundwater of Larkana city of Sindh province of Pakistan, where groundwater is the only source of drinking. For this purpose, a total of 40 samples were randomly collected from various locations in Larkana city, and the Physico-Biological parameters like Color, Odor, Taste, Turbidity, Total Solids (TS), Electrical Conductivity (EC), and Fecal Coliform and E-Coli were determined in the laboratory and were compared with WHO permissible limits. The results revealed that all of the samples were colorless with no turbidity, but 20% of the samples had having odor of sewage water. Moreover, 20% of samples had having slightly bitter taste, particularly the samples collected from Ahsan Colony, Sachal Colony, and QUEST hostel. Moreover, 92% of samples had values of Total Solids and EC beyond permissible limits. Further, most of the samples were found to have no presence of E. coli, but 8% of samples were found to have faecal Coliform present.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"86d9423380b43e0c689e453ce7e7dfba65c8033fea83739ddf2cef3451bd70bb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
