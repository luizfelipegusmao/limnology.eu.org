{"title":"Factors affecting the number of influenza patients before and during COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303382","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Oiythip Yasopa, Nontiya Homkham, Pornthip Chompook</p>\r\n\r\nThis study was aimed to explore the association between potential factors including public health and social measures and the number of influenza patients in Thailand between 2014–2021. Secondary data from relevant agencies were collected. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) and regression coefficient (<i>β</i>) were performed at a significance level of 0.05. We found factors associated with number of influenza patients during the time prior to COVID-19 pandemic were monthly income per household (Adjusted <i>β</i> = -0.02; 95% CI: -0.03, -0.01), population density (Adjusted <i>β</i> = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.18), rainy season (Adjusted <i>β</i> = 137.15; 95% CI: 86.17, 188.13) and winter time (Adjusted <i>β</i> = 56.46; 95% CI: 3.21, 109.71). During the time of COVID-19 pandemic, population density (Adjusted <i>β</i> = 0.20; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.26), rainy season (Adjusted <i>β</i> = -164.23; 95% CI: -229.93, -98.52), winter time (Adjusted <i>β</i> = 61.06; 95% CI: 0.71, 121.41), public health control measures (prohibition of entering to into an area with high number of COVID-19 infections (Adjusted <i>β</i> = -169.34; 95% CI: -233.52, -105.16), and restriction of travelling also reduced the number of influenza patients (Adjusted <i>β</i> = -66.88; 95% CI: -125.15, -8.62) were associated with number of influenza patients. This study commends strategies in monitoring influenza patients to focus on the areas with low income, high population density, and in specific seasons. Public health and social measures which can be implemented are prohibition of entering to risk-areas (lock down), and restriction of travelling across provinces which their effectiveness in reducing influenza infections.","author":"Oiythip Yasopa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"229a4253896023c74c57b3261404cafdbf6abb59752c36fca16d04fc9901363a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
