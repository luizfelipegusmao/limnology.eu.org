Few studies though have focused on biological and ecological covariates of TPL, while its statistical inherences have been extensively debated. In the present study, we focused on species-specific features (i.e. functional traits) that could be influential to temporal TPL.\n\nWe combined field surveys of 180 fish species from 972 sites varying from small streams to large rivers with data on 31 ecological traits describing species-specific characteristics related to three main niche dimensions (trophic ecology, life history, and habitat use). For each species, the parameters of temporal TPL (intercept and slope) were estimated from the log–log mean–variance relationships while controlling for spatial dependencies and biological covariates (species richness and evenness). Then, we investigated whether functional traits explained variations in TPL parameters.\n\nDifferences in TPL parameters among species were explained mostly by life history and environmental determinants, especially TPL slope. Life history was the main determinant of differences in TPL parameters and thereby aggregation patterns, with traits related to body size being the most influential, thus showing a high contrast between small-sized species with short lifespans and large-bodied migratory fishes, even after controlling for phylogenetic resemblances.\n\nWe found that life history traits, especially those related to body size, mostly affect TPL and, as such, can be determinants of temporal variability of fish populations. We also found that statistical effects and phylogenetic resemblances are embedded in mean–variance relationships for fish, and that environmental drivers can interact with ecological characteristics of species in determining temporal fluctuations in abundance.\n</p>","author":"Matheus T.
