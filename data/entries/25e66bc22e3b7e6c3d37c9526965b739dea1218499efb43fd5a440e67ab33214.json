{"title":"MicroRNA in human umbilical cord blood","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0989/v1","date":1723619424000,"content":"The blood that remains in the placenta and umbilical cord after the birth of the infant is referred to as umbilical cord blood (UCB), which has the advantages of convenient source and less ethical controversy. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of non-coding RNAs that can regulate gene expression after translation and transcription. Alterations in miRNA expression involve changes in a range of gene expression pathways. An increasing body of research indicates that miRNAs are implicated in many human disorders and are involved in almost all biological medium processes. Due to their high stability in UCB, circulating miRNAs are considered promising biomarkers for diagnosis and disease prognosis. Herein, we conduct a comprehensive review to summarize the roles of diverse UCB miRNAs from different perspectives, including UCB miRNA as biomarker for developmental projections and disease diagnosis, the relationship between maternal gestational status and neonatal UCB miRNA expression, the therapeutic function of exosomal UCB miRNA, miRNA expression profiles in UCB cell lineages. Taken together, miRNAs in UCB are very promising biomarkers for indicating physiological states, disease states, drug responses, development states, or health conditions, which can help in diagnosing, classifying, and predicting diseases, prognosis, or providing personalized treatment plans for patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"25e66bc22e3b7e6c3d37c9526965b739dea1218499efb43fd5a440e67ab33214","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
