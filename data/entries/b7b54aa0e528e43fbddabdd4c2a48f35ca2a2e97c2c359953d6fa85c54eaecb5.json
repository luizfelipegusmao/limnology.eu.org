Power generation was facilitated by the exoelectrogen, <i>Shewanella putrefaciens</i> MTCC 8104. Polarization studies revealed that the graphite plate MDC attained a high power density of 2720 ± 50 μW/m<sup>2</sup> compared to carbon brush for two electrode pairs. The COD removal and desalination efficiency were better for carbon brush MDC, achieving 58.17 ± 2% and 38.14 ± 2% removal, respectively. Power production can be enhanced by increasing the cathode's ability to accept the electrons, reducing the ageing of biofilm and promoting complete oxidation of the substrates. Upon improving its performance, MDC can act as a sustainable technology, collaborating with industries seeking solutions for wastewater treatment, energy generation and agricultural sectors on a large scale.</p>","author":"Sandhya Prakash, \nSamsudeen Naina Mohamed, \nKalaichelvi Ponnusamy","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water and Environment Journal: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b8106c59269b0bf6595ebcba72d4376e8b07e3df9f0e7d2a7b1cfbc109aa602a","entryHash":"b7b54aa0e528e43fbddabdd4c2a48f35ca2a2e97c2c359953d6fa85c54eaecb5","category":"Environment"}
