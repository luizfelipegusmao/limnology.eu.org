{"title":"Identification and Quantification of Hidden Dangers in Small Scale Reservoir Engineering Based on Deep Learning for Flood control, water supply and irrigation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2034/v1","date":1727276638000,"content":"This study aims to enhance the detection and assessment of safety hazards in small-scale reservoir engineering using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. Given the critical importance of small reservoirs in flood management, water supply, and ecological balance, the effective monitoring of their structural integrity is crucial. This paper developed a fully convolutional semantic segmentation method for hidden danger images of small reservoirs using an encoding-decoding structure, utilizing a deep learning framework of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process and analyze high-resolution images captured by UAVs. The method incorporated data augmentation and adaptive learning techniques to improve model accuracy under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, the quantification data of hidden dangers (length, width, area, etc.) was obtained by converting the image pixels to the actual size. Results demonstrate significant improvements in detecting structural deficiencies, such as cracks and seepage areas, with increased precision and recall rates compared to conventional methods, and the HHSN-25 network (Hidden Hazard Segmentation Network with 25 layers)proposed in this paper outperforms other methods. The main evaluation indicator mIoU of HHSN-25 is higher than other methods, reaching 87.00%, and Unet is 85.50%, Unet++is 85.55%. The proposed model achieves reliable real-time performance, allowing for early warning and effective management of potential risks. This study contributes to the development of more efficient monitoring systems for small-scale reservoirs, enhancing their safety and operational sustainability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"99cd8ab291d8836ac3eefb9836d46acf418db8e36f7ae91b1343a19f57bd0e39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
