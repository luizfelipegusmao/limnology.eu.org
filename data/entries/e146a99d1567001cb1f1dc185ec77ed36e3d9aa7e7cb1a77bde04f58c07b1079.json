{"title":"FURNA: A database for functional annotations of RNA structures","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002476","date":1722261600000,"content":"<p>by Chengxin Zhang, Lydia Freddolino</p>\r\n\r\nDespite the increasing number of 3D RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank, the majority of experimental RNA structures lack thorough functional annotations. As the significance of the functional roles played by noncoding RNAs becomes increasingly apparent, comprehensive annotation of RNA function is becoming a pressing concern. In response to this need, we have developed FURNA (Functions of RNAs), the first database for experimental RNA structures that aims to provide a comprehensive repository of high-quality functional annotations. These include Gene Ontology terms, Enzyme Commission numbers, ligand-binding sites, RNA families, protein-binding motifs, and cross-references to related databases. FURNA is available at https://seq2fun.dcmb.med.umich.edu/furna/ to enable quick discovery of RNA functions from their structures and sequences.","author":"Chengxin Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"e146a99d1567001cb1f1dc185ec77ed36e3d9aa7e7cb1a77bde04f58c07b1079","category":"Environment"}
