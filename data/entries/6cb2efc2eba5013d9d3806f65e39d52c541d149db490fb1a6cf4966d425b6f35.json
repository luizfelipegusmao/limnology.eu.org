{"title":"The E3 ligase TaGW2 mediates transcription factor TaARR12 degradation to promote drought resistance in wheat","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/3/605/7469087?rss=1","date":1702252800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drought stress limits crop yield, but the molecular modulators and their mechanisms underlying the trade-off between drought resistance and crop growth and development remain elusive. Here, a grain width and weight2 (GW2)-like really interesting new gene finger E3 ligase, TaGW2, was identified as a pivotal regulator of both kernel development and drought responses in wheat (<span>Triticum aestivum</span>). <span>TaGW2</span> overexpression enhances drought resistance but leads to yield drag under full irrigation conditions. In contrast, <span>TaGW2</span> knockdown or knockout attenuates drought resistance but remarkably increases kernel size and weight. Furthermore, TaGW2 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates the type-B <span>Arabidopsis</span> response regulator TaARR12, promoting its degradation via the 26S proteasome. Analysis of <span>TaARR12</span> overexpression and knockdown lines indicated that TaARR12 represses the drought response but does not influence grain yield in wheat. Further DNA affinity purification sequencing combined with transcriptome analysis revealed that TaARR12 downregulates stress-responsive genes, especially group-A basic leucine zipper (bZIP) genes, resulting in impaired drought resistance. Notably, <span>TaARR12</span> knockdown in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9)-mediated <span>tagw2</span> knockout mutant leads to significantly higher drought resistance and grain yield compared to wild-type plants. Collectively, these findings show that the TaGW2â€“TaARR12 regulatory module is essential for drought responses, providing a strategy for improving stress resistance in high-yield wheat varieties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"6cb2efc2eba5013d9d3806f65e39d52c541d149db490fb1a6cf4966d425b6f35","category":"Environment"}
