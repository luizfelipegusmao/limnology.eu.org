{"title":"Triploid brown trout, Salmo trutta, develop functional gonads with age and are able to interbreed with diploid counterparts","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15739?af=R","date":1711789144000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The study investigated if gonad maturation in triploid brown trout, <i>Salmo trutta</i>, was entirely suppressed or only delayed, and if triploids could interbreed with diploid counterparts. Ten percent of the total number of 3-year-old triploid <i>S. trutta</i>, 15% of 4-year-old fish, and 17% of 5-year-old fish produced semen. Three and 4 years old triploid fish did not produce eggs, but 15% of the 5-year-old fish did so. The quantity and sperm motility of triploid semen did not differ from diploids, but the sperm concentration was significantly lower. When diploid eggs were fertilized with triploid semen (3n × 2n crosses), the percentage of eyed stage embryos, of hatched larvae, and of normal-shaped larvae did not differ from the diploid controls. Circa 90% of 3n × 2n crosses had a ploidy level of 2.4n. In the remaining percentage of 3n × 2n crosses, the ploidy level was ≥2n and &lt;2.4n. In sperm competition experiments where diploid eggs were fertilized with a mixture of diploid and triploid semen, 52% of the originating larvae had a ploidy level of 2n, 43% of 2.4n, and 5% of the fish were not exactly classified. From the start of feeding to an age of 248 days, the mortality rate of 3n × 2n interploid crosses and of 2n × 2n controls was similar. The growth of interploid crosses was significantly higher than that of controls. In triploid mature females, the egg mass per kilogram of body weight was significantly lower than in diploids. The mass of the non-hardened eggs and the percentile weight increase during hardening did not differ from diploid eggs. When triploid eggs were fertilized with diploid semen (2n × 3n crosses), the development rate to normal hatched larvae was less than 10%. All originating larvae had a ploidy level of 3n. From the start of feeding to an age of 248 days, 2n × 3n crosses had a higher mortality rate (15%) than diploid controls (&lt;5%). Growth of this type of interploid crosses was reduced in comparison to controls. Therefore, triploids introduced into natural waters for recreational fisheries or escaping from farms may interbreed with diploid counterparts. This not only alters the genotypes of local populations but also changes the ploidy levels.</p>","author":"Franz Lahnsteiner, \nAnna Dünser","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"772398d78c871cf888018a06ad5e06b07c05b7542733c0f00959268d3143d310","category":"Environment"}
