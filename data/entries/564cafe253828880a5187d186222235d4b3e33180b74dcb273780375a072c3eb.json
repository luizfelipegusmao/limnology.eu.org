{"title":"Oxidation of Eutectic Gallium-Indium Nanoparticles","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.079/7719469?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn), a room-temperature liquid metal, has received significant interest for its applications in soft electronics [<a href=\"#ozae044.079-B1\">1</a>], multifunctional materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.079-B2\">2</a>], energy engineering [<a href=\"#ozae044.079-B3\">3</a>] and drug delivery [<a href=\"#ozae044.079-B4\">4</a>]. A key factor influencing these diverse applications is the spontaneous formation of a native passivating oxide shell that not only encapsulates the liquid metal but also alters the properties from the bulk counterpart. Using environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy, we report in-situ observations of the oxidation of EGaIn nanoparticles (NPs) by ambient air under high-energy electron beam irradiation. Our findings reveal that the oxidation proceeds through inward diffusion of adsorbed O species, resulting in internal oxidation. This process ruptures the oxide shell and causes top-down self-similar replication of the core-shell liquid metal nanoparticles, wherein larger particles break down into smaller NPs. The internal oxidation also triggers phase separation within the liquid core, ultimately leading to the pulverization of the liquid metal into finer solid particles rich in indium.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"564cafe253828880a5187d186222235d4b3e33180b74dcb273780375a072c3eb","category":"Environment"}
