{"title":"Is Left Ventricle Global Longitudinal Strain by Two-Dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography Useful at Detection of Subclinical Myocardial Dysfunction in Patients After Coronavirus-2019 infection?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1641/v1","date":1719204993000,"content":"Introduction: The disease caused by Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) was initially described in December 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (Sars-Cov-2) is responsible for an important multisystem inflammatory spectrum. Cardiovascular conditions have been reported with an estimated frequency of 8-28%. In this context, transthoracic echocardiography associated with the analysis of the two-dimensional Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) of the left ventricle derived from Speckle Tracking emerges as a promising modality. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the applicability of GLS and segmental deformity assessment in detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction in patients that recovered from COVID-19 infection. Methods: The observational study involved 18 patients (mean age 52 years) with recent evidence of COVID-19 infection that underwent detailed echocardiographic evaluation with GLS, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) according to segmental assessment results. The degree of correlation between the methods was analyzed and a systematic literature review was also conducted. Results: The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 57.50 ± 9.98%. Only 16.6% of patients had reduced LVEF. The average GLS was – 18.70 ± 3.54% and in 44% of cases only one myocardial segment was affected, particularly the inferolateral basal. CMR revealed inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Discussion: Subclinical myocardial involvement is associated with major adverse cardiac events. Literature review supports the use of GLS for detecting early cardiac involvement. Conclusion: Speckle-tracking echocardiography has been shown to have clinical utility in a variety of settings and to offer superior prognostic value with a potential to enhance subclinical detection of myocardial changes in patients after COVID-19 infection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1bdca1356ec805e1bdad3d5fac4ac7174d1c7783846ae303a821c57343d00b64","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
