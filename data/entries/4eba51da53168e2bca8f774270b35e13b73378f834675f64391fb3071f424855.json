Fermentations carried out in glass jars with <i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1/<i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1 showed higher fermentation rates than <i>S. cerevisiae</i> LBTF 21.3/<i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1 or <i>S. cerevisiae</i> LBTF 21.3/<i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1. The highest cup quality was reached with <i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1/<i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1 (83.0 points). Full factorial design (2<sup>2</sup>) carried out with <i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1 revealed that the higher proportion of water added before the fermentation resulted in higher production of acetic acid. A contrary effect of this variable was observed on the production of lactic acid with <i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1. Fermentations conducted in bioreactor evidenced the production of acetaldehyde by <i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1/<i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1, <i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1, and <i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1. Additionally, the highest cup quality was reached in fermentations with <i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1 (82.5 points) followed by <i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1 (81.5 points) and <i>P. manshurica</i> LBTF 21.1/<i>Leuc. lactis</i> LBTF 21.1 (81.0 points). Fermentations of coffee with single and mixed cultures are interesting strategies for the improvement of the sensory quality.</p>","author":"Waldir D. Estela‐Escalante, \nLiz M. I.
