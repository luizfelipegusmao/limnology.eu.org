{"title":"Uncovering Pathogenic Variants in Cancer Susceptibility Genes through Genetic Testing for Pancreatic Cancer Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1473/v1","date":1711357098000,"content":"Pancreatic cancer stands out as one of the most lethal forms of malignancies, representing 2% of all cancer cases and contributing to 5% of cancer-related fatalities. Therefore, early detection of pancreatic cancer is crucial for enhancing treatment outcomes. Various hereditary cancer syndromes have been linked to an elevated risk of developing pancreatic cancer, suggesting potential benefits from surveillance strategies for individuals at risk. Presently, precision medicine employs PARP inhibitor therapy for pancreatic cancer patients carrying germline variants in Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) genes. Our objective was to ascertain the occurrence of germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes predisposing to cancer among pancreatic cancer patients. Methodologically, we analyzed 184 pancreatic cancer patients referred to our laboratory for genetic examination. Utilizing a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach, we scrutinized 52 genes implicated in hereditary cancer predisposition. Our findings revealed that 21% of the patients analyzed harbored germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. Within this subset, 48% exhibited positive results in pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes, namely ATM (17%), BRCA1 (12%), BRCA2 (7%), CDKN2A (7%), and PALB2. Significantly, 64.3% of the pathogenic variants were associated with genes involved in the HRR pathway (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FANCL, MRE11, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51B and RAD51C). In conclusion, our study underscores the significance of multigene genetic testing for pancreatic cancer patients, with 21% of individuals yielding findings linked to pancreatic or other cancer predisposition. Moreover, patients carried pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in HRR genes, potentially benefiting from targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors or platinum-based treatments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78307a489a9b97f031f9bee246a7f6399de5dc0884ed600227b0a457b1130fa6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
