{"title":"Construction and practice of a novel pharmaceutical health literacy intervention model in psychiatric hospital","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311841","date":1729692000000,"content":"<p>by Linghe Qiu, Jun Li, Weiming Xie, Fei Wang, Yuan Shen, Jianhong Wu</p>\r\nObjective <p>Pharmaceutical health literacy intervention (PHLI) plays a crucial role in influencing patients’ medical decision-making, particularly concerning medication use. However, PHLI has not been widely implemented in China. This study aims to develop a novel PHLI model within a psychiatric hospital setting and evaluate its effectiveness.</p> Methods <p>A PHLI model encompassing four modes—covering inpatients, outpatients, Internet+ and community—was established at The Affiliated Mental Health Center of Jiangnan University. The model’s operation was detailed, and its performance data from 2022 and 2023 were evaluated.</p> Results <p>In 2022 and 2023, a total of 636 PHLI cases were reported. Of these, 386 cases (60.69%) were identified through the inpatient mode. The proportion of PHLI delivered via inpatient and Internet information subscription modes gradually increased, while interventions through other methods decreased. The age group of 18–30 accounted for 21.97% of cases, with 116 instances reported. Various types of PHLI were provided, including adverse reactions (18.87%), dosage and administration (11.64%), and therapeutic drug monitoring (9.43%). In addition, intervention strategies primarily focused on adverse reaction identification (10.22%), interpretation of pharmaceutical reports (7.23%), and routine examination reminders (6.45%).</p> Conclusion <p>The PHLI model developed at our hospital offers an effective approach to health literacy intervention and represents an innovation advancement in pharmaceutical health literacy management. It can also serve as a reference framework for other hospitals.</p>","author":"Linghe Qiu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ee6763332e834670923f156797f34839709998baed8f0827d091da89626fcaba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
