{"title":"Adverse events analysis of Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) for prostate cancer based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312481","date":1729605600000,"content":"<p>by Ruibo Li, Xi Chen, Yujie Wang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Due to the limitations of clinical trials, some delayed and rare adverse events (AEs) may remain undetected, and safety information can be supplemented through post-market data analysis. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the AEs associated with Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) using data from the FAERS database, and gain a better understanding of the potential risks and side effects of Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) therapy.</p> Methods <p>Data of Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) were collected from the FAERS database covering the period from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2023. Disproportionality analysis was performed by calculating the reporting odds ratios (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian analysis confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) to detect positive signals.</p> Results <p>Totally, 5,382,189 reports were collected from the FAERS database, 4,397 reports of Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) were identified as the ‘primary suspected (PS)’ AEs. Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) induced AEs occurred in 26 organ systems. 58 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) satisfying with the four algorithms were retained at the same time. Unexpected significant AEs such as Pollakiuria, and Prostatic specific antigen increased also occur. The median time of onset was 60 days. The majority of the AEs occurred within the first 30 days after Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) initiation.</p> Conclusion <p>Common AEs included Hot flush, Fatigue, Asthenia, Constipation, and Myalgia. These AEs should be focused on when using the drug to avoid serious consequences. In addition, the study results also suggested that the drug may exist Pollakiuria, Prostatic specific antigen increased and other AEs not mentioned in the manual, to supplement the AEs in the manual. This study is helpful for clinicians and pharmacists to improve their understanding of Relugolix (Orgovyx<sup>®</sup>) related AEs, and take timely prevention and treatment measures to ensure drug safety for patients.</p>","author":"Ruibo Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"23169c1350d92019d2a9b5b67a3aa6d00342c6015789ac0c12b74391ed69d55e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
