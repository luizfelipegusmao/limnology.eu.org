{"title":"Enhancement mechanism of glycation with l‐arabinose and xylose on texture properties of silver carp mince gel","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13294?af=R","date":1712768606000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Glycation is a green processing technology. Based on our previous studies, glycation with <span>l</span>-arabinose and xylose was beneficial to enhance the texture properties of silver carp mince (SCM) gels. However, the possible enhancement mechanism remained unclear. Therefore, in this study, SCM gels with different types of reducing sugar (glucose, <span>l</span>-arabinose, and xylose) were prepared based on our previous study. The possible mechanism of texture enhancement of SCM gels was analyzed by investigating the changes in water distribution, protein structures, and microstructure in the gel system.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The glycation of <span>l</span>-arabinose and xylose enhanced the hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and resilience of SCM gels. Hardness increased from 1883.04 (control group) to 3624.54 (<span>l</span>-arabinose group) and 4348.18 (xylose group). Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) showed that glycation promoted the tight binding of immobilized water to proteins. Raman spectroscopic analysis showed that glycation increased the surface hydrophobicity and promoted the formation of disulfide bonds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that glycation promoted the formation of uniform and dense three-dimensional network structure in SCM gels.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>In summary, glycation enhanced the binding ability of immobilized water to proteins, improved the surface hydrophobicity, promoted the formation of disulfide bonds, and led to a more uniform and dense gel network structure of proteins, thus enhancing the texture properties of SCM gels. This research provided a theoretical basis for a better understanding of the mechanism of the effect of glycation on the quality of gel products and also provided technical support for the application of <span>l</span>-arabinose and xylose in new functional gel foods. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Junya Liu, \nXueshen Zhu, \nWenzheng Shi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"8ee1fd2bf5722ce587f62422ff3a91895e3b31486439461cf333b484e7fbd450","category":"Environment"}
