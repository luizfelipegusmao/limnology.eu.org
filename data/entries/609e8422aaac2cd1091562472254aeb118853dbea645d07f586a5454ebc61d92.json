This is in particular of interest when this system is affected by a respiratory disease and it’s extrapulmonary manifestations. This study assessed stride-to-stride fluctuations and gait stability in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during a self-paced, treadmill 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and its association with clinical outcomes. In this cross-sectional study, eighty patients with COPD (age 62±7y; forced expiratory volume in first second 56±19%predicted) and 39 healthy older adults (62±7y) were analyzed. Gait parameters including stride-to-stride fluctuations (coefficient of variation (CoV), predictability (sample entropy) and stability (Local Divergence Exponent (LDE)) were calculated over spatiotemporal parameters and center of mass velocity. Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and ANCOVA analyses were conducted. Correlations were calculated between gait parameters, functional mobility using Timed Up and Go Test, and quadriceps muscle strength using dynamometry. Patients walked slower than healthy older adults. After correction for Speed, patients demonstrated increased CoV in stride length (F(1,116) = 5.658, <i>p</i> = 0.019), and increased stride length predictability (F(1,116) = 3.959, <i>p</i> = 0.049). Moderate correlations were found between mediolateral center of mass velocity LDE and normalized maximum peak torque (<i>ρ</i> = -0.549). This study showed that patients with COPD demonstrate alterations in stride length fluctuations even when adjusted for walking speed, highlighting the potential of nonlinear measures to detect alterations in gait function in patients with COPD. Association with clinical outcomes were moderate to weak, indicating that these clinical test are less discriminative for gait alterations.","author":"Wai-Yan Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"609e8422aaac2cd1091562472254aeb118853dbea645d07f586a5454ebc61d92","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
