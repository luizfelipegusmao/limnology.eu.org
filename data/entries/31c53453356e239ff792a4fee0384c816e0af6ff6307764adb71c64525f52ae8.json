{"title":"The Celestial Body Language Implied By The Ayers Rock, Tasmania And Main Island of Australia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0287/v1","date":1714983431000,"content":"The Ayers Rock of Australia which is known for its charming colors at different time is actually the Celestial Body Ring of the planet Earth that implies the great Celestial Body Love happened on Earth long long ago.  The Tasmania island of Australia which is known for the World Heart is actually in the state of face to face with the main island of Australia,  which implies the image spokesperson for the inner core (the heart) of the planet Earth.  In other words,  with the outline of the main island of Australia,  the basic key information of the inner core of the planet Earth could be easily obtained by deducing logically,  just like the similarity between the fists and heart of human body.  Similar to the mechanism of the blood circulation dominated by the heart of human body,  it is dominated and motivated by the inner core of the Earth which forms the circulation of mantle magma between the crust and the inner core,  and what leads to the formation of expanding and active area on the equatorial and middle-lower latitude area and the silent and convergent area on the North and South Pole central area.  Therefore, the mantle magma whirlpools under the crust on the North and South Pole are supposed to exist logically.  The walking sideways of the crabs just implies the celestial body language of the motive trend of the main island of Australia based on their similar outline.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"31c53453356e239ff792a4fee0384c816e0af6ff6307764adb71c64525f52ae8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
