While EMF metrics may provide a coarse overview of the functioning of a system, such metrics can obscure the interactions among multiple simultaneously occurring ecosystem functions. This could limit the predictive value and overall efficacy of EMF metrics for the management of environmental change impacts on ecosystem functioning.\n\nWe carried out a mesocosm experiment with dung beetle temporal species richness (diversity) treatments in a pasture ecosystem in Aotearoa New Zealand and quantified cascading biotic and abiotic effects of introduced dung beetles (<i>Onthophagus binodis</i> and <i>Onitis alexis</i>) on multiple ecosystem functions. We measured nine individual ecosystem functions affected by dung beetles, including dung removal, total soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, soil microbial respiration, nitrate N, ammonium N, anaerobically mineralisable N and pasture biomass production.\n\nWe first tested the effects of temporal dung beetle diversity on the nine individual ecosystem functions. We then tested how introduced dung beetle temporal diversity affects ecosystem multifunctionality by calculating EMF metrics using the averaging, threshold and the Hill numbers approaches. Finally, to investigate the underlying interactions among individual functions, we tested the direct and indirect effects of introduced dung beetles on the nine ecosystem functions using structural equation modelling (SEM).\n\nOnly one out of the nine individual ecosystem functions was significantly affected by dung beetle introductions, whereas five of the six calculated EMF metrics increased significantly with temporal diversity of introduced dung beetles. However, when modelled within an SEM framework, dung beetle temporal diversity was found to directly affect dung removal, but with cascading effects on total N and anaerobically mineralisable N.\n\nOur results suggest that introducing and increasing dung beetle temporal diversity enhances the provisioning of multiple ecosystem functions, but that our ability to detect and explain changes in ecosystem multifunctionality is critically dependent on how EMF is quantified.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/06/11/measuring-many-beneficial-ecosystem-functions-that-happen-at-the-same-time-an-experiment-with-dung-beetles/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Fevziye Hasan, \nKiri J.
