{"title":"Research of the Processes of Freeze Drying Berries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2160/v1","date":1727429870000,"content":"An analysis of the current state of development in the agro-industrial complex (AIC) has established that freeze-drying is the most effective method for processing raw materials entering the drying stage. However, this drying method is hindered by the lack of modern, high-performance, energy-efficient drying technologies and equipment. The production of freeze-dried agricultural products will stimulate the development of AIC sectors. The implementation scheme of an automatic control system for a vacuum freeze-drying unit is considered, representing a promising and environmentally friendly direction in the processing of agricultural products. The drying equipment includes the following components and systems: a drying chamber, a cooling system, a vacuum pump, a control system, and a heating system. The product is placed on shelves in the drying chamber and frozen to a temperature that ensures the removal of 75-80% of the moisture contained in the product. The vacuum pump creates a pressure of 10-30 Pa and evacuates the spent air from the sublimator. Water vapor condensation occurs in the desublimator, and at the final stage of the drying process, the heating elements are activated to remove the remaining moisture. To validate the reliability of controlling the operating modes of the sublimator, experimental studies were conducted on the temperature dependence of the product on the surface and in the center over time. The graphs show temperature changes on the surface and in the center of the product throughout the drying process. The research results indicate that at a pressure of 20±5 Pa, the desublimator temperature should be below -20°C. The surface temperature of the product during the sublimation stage should be within the range of -25±5°C. Drying is completed when the chamber temperature reaches no more than 40°C, and the surface temperature of the product is around 30°C.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ca7245162a546a30879fbb9e0418f1dd1b74a5e45f1754072cfed7b9249835f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
