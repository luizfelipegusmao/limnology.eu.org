{"title":"Ultra-broadband Plasmon Resonance in Gold Nanoparticles Precipitated in ZnO-Al2O3-SiO2 Glass","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0283/v1","date":1712133029000,"content":"Optical materials with a tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are of a great interest for applications in photonics and optoelectronics. In the present study we explored the potential of generating the LSPR band with an ultra-broad range of over 1000 nm in gold nanoparticles (NPs) precipitated through the thermal treatment in ZnO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass. Using the optical absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the LSPR band's position and shape can be finely controlled by varying the thermal treatment route. Comprehensive methods including Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were used to study the glass structure, while computational approaches were used for the theoretical description of the absorption spectra. Obtained results allowed us to suggest a scenario responsible for such abnormal LSPR band broadening which includes possible interparticle plasmonic coupling effect taking place during the liquid-liquid phase separation of the heat-treated glass. The formation of gold NPs with an ultra-broad LSPR band in glasses holds promise for sensitizing rare earth ion luminescence for new photonics devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e7f62c23a25754633f3a3b1f0580f8358cd0ebff3a8ff850159a8c9963b4570e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
