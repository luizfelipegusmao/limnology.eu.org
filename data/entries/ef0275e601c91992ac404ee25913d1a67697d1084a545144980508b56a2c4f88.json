Along with summer data for the early 1980s, we can now describe changes of zooplankton biomass over four decades. The biomass of the central Barents Sea has fluctuated inversely with collapses and recoveries of the Barents Sea capelin stock, which is a major planktivore. Zooplankton biomass in the central Barents Sea was low in 1983 and 1984, driven by low abundance of <span>Calanus finmarchicus</span>, followed by a pronounced peak in 1987 associated with a “first” collapse of the capelin stock. Biomass showed another pronounced peak in 1994, driven by the small size fraction and interpreted to reflect an advective signal from the adjacent Norwegian Sea. In the two most recent decades, there have been divergent trends, with a relatively high biomass in the inflowing Atlantic water, reflecting a second summer generation of <span>C. finmarchicus</span>, and decreased biomass in the central area, reflecting a lower abundance of <span>Calanus glacialis</span> driven by a combined effect of capelin predation and climate.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"ef0275e601c91992ac404ee25913d1a67697d1084a545144980508b56a2c4f88","category":"Environment"}
