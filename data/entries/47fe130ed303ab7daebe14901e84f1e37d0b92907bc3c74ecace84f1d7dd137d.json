{"title":"DEFECTIVE KERNEL 56 functions in mitochondrial RNA editing and maize seed development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/3/1593/7416742?rss=1","date":1699833600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Proper seed development is essential for achieving grain production, successful seed germination, and seedling establishment in maize (<span>Zea mays</span>). In the past few decades, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins have been proven to play an essential role in regulating the development of maize kernels through posttranscriptional RNA modification of mitochondrial genes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized a mutant of <span>DEFECTIVE KERNEL 56</span> (<span>DEK56</span>) with defective kernels that exhibited arrested development of both the embryo and endosperm. Accordingly, we isolated <span>DEK56</span> through a map-based cloning strategy and found that it encoded an E subgroup PPR protein located in the mitochondria. Dysfunction of DEK56 resulted in altered cytidine (C)-to-uridine (U) editing efficiency at 48 editing sites across 21 mitochondrial transcripts. Notably, the editing efficiency of the <span>maturase-related</span> (<span>matR</span>)-1124 site was substantially reduced or abolished in the <span>dek56</span> mutant. Furthermore, we found that the splicing efficiency of <span>NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4</span> (<span>nad4</span>) Introns 1 and 3 was substantially reduced in <span>dek56</span> kernels, which might be a consequence of the defective MatR function. Through a proteinâ€“protein interaction test, we hypothesized that DEK56 carries out its function by recruiting the PPR-DYW protein PPR motif, coiled-coil, and DYW domain-containing protein 1 (PCW1). This interaction is facilitated by Multiple Organellar RNA Editing Factors (ZmMORFs) and Glutamine-Rich Protein 23 (ZmGRP23). Based on these findings, we developed a working model of PPR-mediated mitochondrial processing that plays an essential role in the development of maize kernels. The present study will further broaden our understanding of PPR-mediated seed development and provide a theoretical basis for maize improvement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"47fe130ed303ab7daebe14901e84f1e37d0b92907bc3c74ecace84f1d7dd137d","category":"Environment"}
