{"title":"Optical and Electronic Expert System for Diagnosing Eye Pathology in Glaucoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1038/v1","date":1720776726000,"content":"For the first time, mathematical models were obtained for evaluating biomedical images using fuzzy set methods on the basis of expert knowledge bases, which made it possible to carry out complex qualitative diagnostics and increase the reliability and efficiency of diagnosis, to form a methodology for analyzing biomedical images based on the fuzzy set apparatus, which allowed to more fully assess the level of the disease for glaucoma. Aspects of practical implementation of the optical-electronic system of biomedical information processing are considered. An algorithm and an optical-electronic system of biomedical image analysis are proposed, which are used to increase the informativeness and reliability of diagnosing eye pathologies, in particular, glaucoma.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d9212675faae4a02e71f0ec950e8780afcf228f7ea0843437afa04fb7508a59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
