{"title":"The Language of Stability: A Textual Study of Financial Reports","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2061/v1","date":1721912680000,"content":"Ensuring banking stability is essential for economic resilience and the prevention of financial crises. Financial Stability Reports (FSRs) provide critical data on the financial system. This study advocates for the use of text mining tools to enhance the analysis of FSRs. Text mining offers a systematic method for extracting insights from unstructured data, allowing analysts to uncover detailed information on capital adequacy, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Additionally, this approach identifies emerging trends and vulnerabilities that may not be apparent through traditional analysis methods. The paper examines the application of text mining techniques to FSR analysis within the Republic of Armenia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40afd92cc5a7d2014dc07094ce6fc32904faaaa67120e065751d3ad017e561d0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
