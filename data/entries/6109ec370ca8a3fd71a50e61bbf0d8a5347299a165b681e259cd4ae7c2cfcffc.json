By bioassay-guided isolation, 12 compounds were isolated and identified from <i>S. orbiculatus</i> for the first time, including iridoids: naucledal (<b>K1</b>), loganin (<b>K2</b>), loganigenin (<b>K3</b>), loganin acid (<b>K4</b>), glucologanin (<b>K5</b>) and vogeloside (<b>K6</b>), as well as flavonoids: quercetine (<b>K7</b>), luteolin (<b>K8</b>), nobiletin (<b>K9</b>), astragalin (<b>K10</b>), isorhamnetin 3-<span>d</span>-glucoside (<b>K11</b>) and rutin (<b>K12</b>). Biological assays showed that iridoids are the main active ingredients of <i>S. orbiculatus</i>. The compounds of K<b>5</b> and <b>K6</b> could inhibit both the root (IC<sub>50</sub> = 37.54 and 38.91 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) and shoot (IC<sub>50</sub> = 42.78 and 45.72 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) of <i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, which have a weeding toxicity similar to that of the commercialized plant-based herbicide pelargonic acid. In addition, the results of pot culture assay showed that <i>S. orbiculatus</i> ethanol extracts had high fresh weight control effect against <i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i> and <i>P. oleracea</i> at the concentration of 40 g L<sup>−1</sup>. After 7 days, both the soil treatment and the stem and leaf spray method resulted in severe leaf necrosis and significant leaf etiolation.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</i> and its herbicidal active compounds have the potential to develop into botanical herbicides, and are first reported in the present study. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Weijia Li, \nYuanji Xue, \nZhipeng Yao, \nHua Weng, \nBin Zhang, \nZhiqing Ma","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6109ec370ca8a3fd71a50e61bbf0d8a5347299a165b681e259cd4ae7c2cfcffc","category":"Environment"}
