{"title":"Accelerometer‐based swimming metabolism of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15774?af=R","date":1715235550000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Bioenergetics is informative for a range of fundamental and applied resource management questions, but findings are often constrained by a lack of ecological realism due to the challenges of remotely estimating key parameters such as metabolic rate. To enable field applications, we conducted a calibration study with smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>, 0.7–2 kg) surgically implanted with accelerometer transmitters and exposed to a ramp-<i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub> swimming protocol in a swim tunnel respirometer across a range of water temperatures (6, 12, 18, and 24°C). There was an exponential increase in fish acceleration with swimming speed, and acceleration per speed was higher in smaller fish and female fish, and at colder temperatures. Mass-specific fish metabolic rate (MO<sub>2</sub>; mg O<sub>2</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) increased with swimming speed, acceleration, and temperature, and decreased with fish mass, which when combined were strong predictors of MO<sub>2</sub>. Maximum metabolic rate (MMR) was estimated to peak at 22°C, but maximum sustained swimming speed (<i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub>) remained high at <i>c</i>. 90–100 m s<sup>−1</sup> above 20°C, based on second-order polynomial functions. Aerobic scope (AS) estimates peaked at 20°C (&gt;90% AS at 17–24°C; &gt;50% AS at 11–28°C). Males exhibited marginally higher MMR, AS, and <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub> than females at higher temperatures. Larger fish generally exhibited higher U<sub>crit</sub>, but smaller fish had a marginally broader performance range (AS, <i>U</i>\n<sub>crit</sub>) among temperatures, benefiting from higher MMR despite a steeper increase in resting metabolic rate with temperature. These findings enable field studies to estimate metabolic metrics of smallmouth bass in situ to characterize their ecological energetics and inform bioenergetics models.</p>","author":"Jacob W.
