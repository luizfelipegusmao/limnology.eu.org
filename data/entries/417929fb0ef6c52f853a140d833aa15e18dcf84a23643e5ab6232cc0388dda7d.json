Cole</p>\r\nBackground <p>Although COVID-19 infection has been associated with a number of clinical and environmental risk factors, host genetic variation has also been associated with the incidence and morbidity of infection. The <i>CRP</i> gene codes for a critical component of the innate immune system and <i>CRP</i> variants have been reported associated with infectious disease and vaccination outcomes. We investigated possible associations between COVID-19 outcome and a limited number of candidate gene variants including rs1205.</p> Methodology/Principal findings <p>The Strong Heart and Strong Heart Family studies have accumulated detailed genetic, cardiovascular risk and event data in geographically dispersed American Indian communities since 1988. Genotypic data and 91 COVID-19 adjudicated deaths or hospitalizations from 2/1/20 through 3/1/23 were identified among 3,780 participants in two subsets. Among 21 candidate variants including genes in the interferon response pathway, <i>APOE</i>, <i>TMPRSS2</i>, <i>TLR3</i>, the HLA complex and the ABO blood group, only rs1205, a 3’ untranslated region variant in the <i>CRP</i> gene, showed nominally significant association in T-dominant model analyses (odds ratio 1.859, 95%CI 1.001–3.453, p = 0.049) after adjustment for age, sex, center, body mass index, and a history of cardiovascular disease. Within the younger subset, association with the rs1205 T-Dom genotype was stronger, both in the same adjusted logistic model and in the SOLAR analysis also adjusting for other genetic relatedness.</p> Conclusion <p>A T-dominant genotype of rs1205 in the <i>CRP</i> gene is associated with COVID-19 death or hospitalization, even after adjustment for relevant clinical factors and potential participant relatedness. Additional study of other populations and genetic variants of this gene are warranted.</p>","author":"Lyle G.
