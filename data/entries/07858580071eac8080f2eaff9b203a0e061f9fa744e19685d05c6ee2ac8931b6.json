{"title":"An Overview of Herbal-carbon Dots","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0120/v1","date":1717484037000,"content":"A key component of nanomaterials, carbon dots (CDs) are zero-dimensional solids, smaller than 10 nm in size that include carbon as their backbone structure. Herbal medicine carbon dots (HM-CDs) are nanoparticles developed from medicinal plants. Owing to their advantageous properties, they are extensively employed in biological domains such as drug administration, bio-imaging, biosensors, and DNA interactions. It's interesting to note that, carbon dots pro-duced from herbal medicines as a raw material have surfaced as the most recent addition to the CD family.\n  This article provides an overview of the several sources of green precursor, preparation tech-niques, characterization, and applications of CDs. It reviews recent advancements in synthe-sizing CDs made from green carbon materials and their potential uses as bioimaging, catalysts and sensing. Furthermore, several difficult issues and future directions for this potent and amazing content are also covered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"07858580071eac8080f2eaff9b203a0e061f9fa744e19685d05c6ee2ac8931b6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
