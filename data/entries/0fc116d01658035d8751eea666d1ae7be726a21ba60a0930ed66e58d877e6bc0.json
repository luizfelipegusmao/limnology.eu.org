{"title":"Narrative Review on Multiple Gestation: A Clinicianâ€™s Pocket Guide to Navigate Management of Multiple Gestation with an Evidence-Based Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1429/v1","date":1713865573000,"content":"Objective: The goal of this review is to provide a succinct, yet comprehensive, guide to the an-tepartum management of multiple gestations.\nMethods: This narrative review on twins and multiple gestation provides a concise guide for providers with this ever-growing patient population. PubMED was utilized for literature search.  Each reference was evaluated and graded for quality of evidence by US Preventative Services Task Force and Cochrane Review guidelines. Screening, surveillance, and management strategies are delineated succinctly and organized by type of multiple gestation being managed from the lowest risk dichorionic twin pair to the increasingly escalating risks of twins and higher order multiples sharing a placenta and/or amniotic sac. \nResults: The incidence of twin pregnancies has grown over the past several years, due in large part to delayed reproductive timing and surge in assisted reproductive technologies. Twin pregnancies are associated with higher morbidity for both gravidas and offspring, warranting evidence-based approach in counseling and management.  \nConclusions: We note the important differences among multiples in chorionicity and amnionicity, in the importance of close surveillance and early delivery. Graded clinical pearls and evi-dence-based recommendations are presented to guide obstetric providers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0fc116d01658035d8751eea666d1ae7be726a21ba60a0930ed66e58d877e6bc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
