{"title":"Exploring a novel direct-fed microbial for ruminants to mitigate in vitro Salmonella invasion and infection","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/396/7757234?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Managing bacterial infections is of great importance in cattle production, particularly those caused by <span>Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium</span> or <span>Dublin</span>, which can impact both animal health and human food safety. Direct-fed microbial (DFM) can support gastrointestinal health and alleviate potential bacterial infections. In the present study, the capacity of a bacteria-based DFM product [BOVAMINE DEFEND Plus; BDP; Novonesis, Denmark (BDP)] containing <span>Lactobacillus animalis</span>, <span>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</span>, <span>Bacillus licheniformis</span>, and <span>B. subtilis</span> to reduce <span>Salmonella Typhimurium</span> ATCC14028 invasion was investigated using the HT29-MTX cell line (Exp. 1) and also to evaluate the possible antagonistic effect against <span>S. Dublin</span> using an in vitro agar well diffusion method (Exp. 2). Briefly, in Exp. 1, after a 30 min pre-incubation with 1.0 ×108 CFU of BDP and/or 2.5 × 106 CFU of <span>S. Typhimurium</span> were added to each transwell. The quantity of <span>S. Typhimurium</span> invading the cells was measured after 90 min of co-incubation using CFU counts. As a control, the viability of the total <span>S. Typhimurium</span> was assessed to confirm the mode of action of BDP targets the pathogen invasion properties. In Exp. 2, the antagonistic efficacy of BDP against <span>S. Dublin</span> CHCC41286, isolated from cattle, was tested by adding BDP to wells in CLED agar plates casted with the pathogen above, zones of inhibition measured after 48 h incubation. In Exp. 1, BDP significantly (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) reduced by 80.6 % the invasion of <span>S. typhimurium</span> into HT-29-MTX cells as well as from 16 % the viability of the pathogen. The antagonistic properties of BDP towards <span>S. Dublin</span> were confirmed by clear inhibition zones (8.6 mm). These two in vitro findings set the stage for exploring the potential benefits of using a novel DFM as a promising tool and strategy to mitigate <span>Salmonella</span> infections in ruminants and improve animal health, food safety, and public health. Further in vivo confirmation needs to be developed to validate these preliminary in vitro results.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"5c9d89b8aa49dd130755c8d6ef6a012d7d33b9c74da01825f96dc63b5018495d","category":"Environment"}
