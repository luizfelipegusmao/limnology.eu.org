An additional strength of APT, at least in most cases, is its ability to measure local composition and composition variations with good yet typically ill-defined quantitative accuracy. Experienced researchers know that maximizing this accuracy requires some exploration of analysis conditions to understand quantitatively how the measured composition varies, followed by rigorous data treatment that, ideally, results in some estimate of a give measurementâ€™s quantitative uncertainty.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"46c61bbc0a9a07ea83e14bd0b021b591421ac491f136a1c96b1cd9ae417df89f","category":"Environment"}
