{"title":"Early 2-Factor Transcription Factors Associated with Progression and Recurrence in Bevacizumab-Responsive Subtypes of Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1426/v1","date":1716359426000,"content":"The early 2-factor (E2F) family of transcription factors, including E2F1-8, plays a critical role in apoptosis, metabolism, proliferation, and angiogenesis within glioblastoma (GBM). However, the specific functions of E2F transcription factors (E2Fs) and their impact on the malignancy of Bevacizumab (BVZ)-responsive GBM subtypes remain unclear. This study used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to explore the impact of eight E2F family members on the clinical characteristics of BVZ-responsive GBM subtypes and possible mechanisms of recurrence after BVZ treatment.To predict the possibility of GBM patient survival and progression, we classified and comparedthe expression of E2Fs according to BVZ-responsive subtypes and employed a machine learning method-TreeBagger, one random forest algorithm. Multiple bioinformatics analyses have shown that the significant increased E2F8 post BVZ treatment may enhance the function of angiogenesis and stem cell proliferation, indicating one of the mechanisms of GBM recurrence after treatment. In addition, BVZ treatment in unresponsive GBM patients may potentially worsen disease progression. Our findings suggest that E2F family members play important roles in GBM malignancy and BVZ treatment response, highlighting their potential as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets and recommending precise BVZ treatment for GBM patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"50c9b2aaad73400eba138445665094f68dfff007d3bbe194e765de72f62b09c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
