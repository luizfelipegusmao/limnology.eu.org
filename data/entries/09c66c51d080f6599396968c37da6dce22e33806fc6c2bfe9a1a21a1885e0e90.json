{"title":"Study on the Radiation Resistance Performance of Al2O3 Composite Tritium-Permeation-Barrier and Zirconium-Based Tritium Absorbing Materials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1160/v1","date":1728974306000,"content":"The permeation of tritium from secondary neutron source rods in nuclear power plants presents a significant and unavoidable safety concern for both internal equipment and the external environment. This study primarily explores two feasible strategies for tritium permeation barriers: coating stainless steel surfaces with tritium-permeation-barrier (TPB) materials and utilizing materials with excellent tritium absorption properties. Through external ion irradiation tests, a comparative analysis was conducted on the tritium permeation performance, microstructure, and nano-hardness changes of two tritium-resistant designs, specifically Cr2O3/Al2O3 composite coatings, and a zirconium-based tritium-absorbing material under varying irradiation doses. The results indicate that both approaches exhibit exceptional radiation resistance, maintaining an effective tritium permeation reduction factor (PRF) even after irradiation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"09c66c51d080f6599396968c37da6dce22e33806fc6c2bfe9a1a21a1885e0e90","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
