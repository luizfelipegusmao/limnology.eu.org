{"title":"Condition Monitoring of a Three-phase AC Asynchronous Motor based on the Analysis of the Instantaneous Active Electrical Power in No-Load Tests","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0724/v1","date":1718108822000,"content":"This paper experimentally reveals some of the resources offered by the evolution of the instantaneous active electric power in describing the state of three-phase AC induction asynchronous electric motors (with squirrel-cage rotor) operating under no-load conditions. A mechanical power is required to rotate the rotor at no-load and this mechanical power is satisfactorily reflected in the constant and variable part of instantaneous active electric power. The variable part of this electrical power should necessarily have a periodic component with the same period as the period of rotation of the rotor. The paper proposes a procedure for extracting this periodic component description (as a pattern, by means of a selective averaging of instantaneous active electrical power) and analysis. The time origin of this pattern is defined by the time of a selected first passage through the origin of an angular marker placed on the rotor, detectable by a proximity sensor (e.g. a laser sensor). The usefulness of the pattern in describing the state of the motor rotor has been demonstrated by several simple experiments which show that a slight change in the no-load running conditions of the motor (e.g. by placing a dynamically unbalanced mass on the rotor) has clear effects in changing the shape of the pattern.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d73da820fbcd329de320d1a81580da6a31f869dfd9984f7f4e1e54e9197d22e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
