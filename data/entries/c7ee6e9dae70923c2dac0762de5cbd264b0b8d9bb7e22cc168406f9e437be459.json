Various types of natural and anthropogenic sources derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) have been identified in this study. These include soil-derived DOM, plant remnants, and soluble particles produced when organic material partially decomposes and is released by microorganisms, such as bacteria, algae, and plants. DOM was characterized using a three-dimensional excitation–emission matrix (3DEEM), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and water quality parameters from the Buriganga River, Dhaka to Patenga Seaport, Chittagong, along with the Shitalakshya River, a small portion of the Padma River, and the Meghna River. To better understand the data analysis, the study area was divided into three central regions: urban industrial rivers, industrial estuarine rivers, and marine zones. In the urban industrial river, 3DEEM and PARAFAC identified five fluorophores (peaks: A, C, M, T, and T<sub>uv</sub>) with five components: detergent-like, fulvic-like, tryptophan or protein-like, fulvic-like (C-type), and protein-like, which might originate from the industrial activities and sewage pollution. In the industrial estuarine river zone, three fluorophores have been identified (peaks: A, C, T<sub>uv</sub>) with two known components, namely, fulvic acid (A-type) and fulvic acid (C-type), with an unknown photoproduct at Ex/Em = 295/368 (peak T<sub>uv</sub>). Components in the industrial river zone may originate from terrestrial sources, indicating vegetation along the river. In the marine zone, four fluorophores have been identified (peaks: T<sub>uv</sub>, A, T, C) with two components, that is, protein- or tryptophan-like and humic acid-like from coral origin. The intensities of both fulvic-like and protein-like substances were high in urban industrial river water owing to industrial activity and sewage pollution. SUVA<sub>254</sub> suggests high aromaticity in all three regions, whereas the optical properties suggest that terrestrial and microbial components are present in the urban industrial and estuarine rivers. This further indicates that urban industrial river water quality is highly polluted. The lowest degradation potential index (DPI) in the marine zone might result from the presence of the highest number of dissolved solids in the water, and the highest DPI of industrial estuarine rivers explains the comparatively high presence of terrestrial-derived humic (A)- and humic (C)-like components in the ratio to the unknown photoproduct of mid-wavelength.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nThis study's uniqueness is a 220-km cruise from an urban river to a coastal seaport to analyze fluorescence properties.\nThe study found that most water parameters were within the DoE standards, except for DO, which was consistently low.\n3DEEM-PARAFAC identified five fluorophores linked to detergent, fulvic, and protein-like substances from sewage and industrial sources.\nOur study concludes that microbial and terrestrial sources dominate dissolved organic matter in urban, estuarine, and marine regions.\n</p>","author":"Md.
