{"title":"Exploring the role of ferroptosis-related genes as biomarkers in acute kidney injury","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307472","date":1721743200000,"content":"<p>by Gang Luo, Yi Gao, Ziyu Zheng, Baobao Gao, Lini Wang, Xuemiao Tang, Chong Lei</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe condition with high morbidity and mortality. Innovative biomarkers and treatments are essential for improving patient outcomes. This study aims to investigate the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in AKI for identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed mRNA expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: GSE139061) dataset, comparing 36 AKI samples with 9 normal samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the R software package limma. Functional enrichment analyses were conducted using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Key biomarkers were validated through area under the curve (AUC) values, and immune cell infiltration was analyzed using CIBERSORT.</p> Results <p>We identified 78 differentially expressed FRGs, with 27 up-regulated and 51 down-regulated genes. Key signaling pathways included MAPK, ferroptosis, and p53. Five genes—<i>NR4A1</i>, <i>GLRX5</i>, <i>USP35</i>, <i>AEBP2</i>, and <i>MDM4</i>—were identified as potential biomarkers, each demonstrating AUC values greater than 0.800. Specifically, <i>MDM4</i> showed significant potential by promoting the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46, enhancing mitochondrial apoptotic activity. Immune analysis revealed a significant elevation of M0 macrophages in AKI samples compared to normal samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01).</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings highlight the critical role of ferroptosis-related genes in AKI, identifying <i>NR4A1</i>, <i>GLRX5</i>, <i>USP35</i>, <i>AEBP2</i>, and <i>MDM4</i> as key biomarkers with high diagnostic potential. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of AKI.</p>","author":"Gang Luo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"28946486a9f4084db32f594986ed3af66f996b03b0d01349a5320aba2eb5fa59","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
