{"title":"Unveiling the Impact of the Enigmatic Probacterium (Bacillus) on Aquatic Life: A Comprehensive Exploration into its Effects on Fish and Shellfish","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1035/v1","date":1718380473000,"content":"Probiotics are becoming more and more popular in the growing of fin and shellfish because these species are consumed worldwide and because different techniques are employed to maximize the productivity and efficiency of fin and shellfish. Probiotic Bacillus is one of the many types of probiotics that are used, but it stands out due to its superior qualities. For instance, because of its ability to sporulate, it can survive in harsh environments, produce antimicrobial substances, and is safe to feed to fish. The different species of Bacillus used in the farming of fin and shell fish were discussed in this review, along with the benefits of using Bacillus spp. as a good substitute in sustainable aquaculture to improve feed utilization, immune system response, stress adaptation, resistance to infectious diseases, tissue preservation integrity, and water quality. Additionally, we discussed the possible risks to safety that Bacillus poses when raising these significant species.  For the purpose of future research and development regarding Bacillus application in aquaculture, a summary of the findings of recent studies about the advantages of applying Bacillus to enhance fin and shellfish aquatic animal culture has been provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"525b14c7d0f38429fe4645a0c83d87b5f01e630882c7c7ad7f744be8314f0de0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
