Several model experiments were used to verify the efficacy of the newly proposed system, confirming its ability to analyse the atomic-level structural changes during heterogeneous catalysts and the associated gas-reaction kinetics simultaneously, providing new insights into <span>operando</span> measurements in the field of environmental transmission electron microscopy.<strong>Graphical Abstract</strong>  </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy Current Issue","siteHash":"60a1297b225cb0d11d4d9bb729ba33f4e93147012db6d6a2eafbfc087077a550","entryHash":"a1ec167d442bba5c38d640b976afd92c17ff3ad266fbe11154ace93ee01b779b","category":"Environment"}
