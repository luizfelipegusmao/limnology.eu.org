The M3 chip is up to 30 percent faster than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip in terms of CPU performance, and there are notable GPU improvements with Apple adding support for Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, hardware-accelerated mesh shading, and support for AV1 decode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther improvements to the ‌MacBook Air‌ include support for two external displays when the machine is used in clamshell mode, support for Wi-Fi 6E, enhanced voice clarity for audio and video calls, and a new anodization seal to reduce fingerprints on the Midnight finish.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple retail stores in Australia are selling the new ‌MacBook Air‌ machines, and there is plenty of stock for walk-in customers.
