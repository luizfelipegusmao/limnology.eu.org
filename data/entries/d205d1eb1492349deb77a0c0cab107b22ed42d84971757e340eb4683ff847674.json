{"title":"RANS Simulation of Minimum Ignition Energy of Stoichiometric and Leaner CH4/Air Mixtures at Higher Pressures in Quiescent Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0807/v1","date":1725970779000,"content":"The minimum ignition energy (MIE) has been extensively studied via experiments and simulations. However, our literature review reveals little quantitative consistency, with results varying for f=1.0 from 0.324 to 1.349 mJ, and for f=0.9 from 0.22 to 0.944 mJ. Therefore, there is a need to resolve these discrepancies. This RANS study aims to partially address this knowledge gap. Additionally, it presents other flame evolution parameters essential for robust combustion design. Using the reactingFOAM solver we predict the threshold energy required to ignite the fuel mixture. For this, the single step using the Arrhenius law is selected to model ignition in the flame kernel of stochiometric and lean CH4/air mixtures, allowing it to develop into a self-sustained flame. The ignition power density, an energy quantity normalised with volume is incrementally varied keeping the kernel critical radius rs constant 0.5 mm in the quiescent mixture of two equivalence ratios fs 0.9, and 1.0, for varied operating pressures 1, 5 and 10 bar at constant initial temperature 300 K. The minimum ignition energy is validated with twelve independent 1 bar data sets both numerical and experiments. Finally, a mathematical formulation of MIE is devised, a function of pressure and equivalence ratio shows a slightly curved relationship.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d205d1eb1492349deb77a0c0cab107b22ed42d84971757e340eb4683ff847674","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
