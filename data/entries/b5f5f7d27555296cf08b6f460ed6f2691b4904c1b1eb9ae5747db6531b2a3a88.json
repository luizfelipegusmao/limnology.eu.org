However, when these materials are exposed to severe environmental and climatic conditions such as high humidity, changes in temperature, ultraviolet radiation, rain and seawater aging, their mechanical properties are severely affected [<a href=\"#ozae044.641-B2\">2</a>]. The effect of saline water aging on the mechanical properties of composite materials reinforced with glass fiber and kevlar has been studied [<a href=\"#ozae044.641-B3\">3</a>]. The effects of aging on the mechanical behavior of materials composed of epoxy resin with glass fiber and kevlar fiber were studied. On the other hand, the erosion behavior of solid particles in epoxy composites reinforced with unidirectional fiberglass and carbon has been investigated. SEM images revealed that erosion is characterized by microcracking and detachment of fibers from the matrix [<a href=\"#ozae044.641-B4\">4</a>]. The study of composite materials exposed in saline environments allows us to understand the effects that this aggressive environment causes on these materials for applications in the manufacturing of components such as hydrokinetic turbine blades [<a href=\"#ozae044.641-B5\">5</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b5f5f7d27555296cf08b6f460ed6f2691b4904c1b1eb9ae5747db6531b2a3a88","category":"Environment"}
