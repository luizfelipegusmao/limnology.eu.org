{"title":"Physiological Evaluation of Salt Tolerance on Different Genotypes of Sunflower Germplasms at the Seedling Stage","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1786/v1","date":1729671175000,"content":"Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is an important oilseed crop cultivated extensively across the globe. High salinity adversely impacts plant growth and physiological processes. In this study, the data of the phenotypes and various indices were collected to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying sunflower's salt tolerance with the seedlings of two salt-tolerant (182265 and 182283) and two salt-sensitive (182093 and 186096) genotypes, which were exposed to 350 mM NaCl for 4 days. The findings revealed that, during the seedling stage, salt-tolerant sunflowers accumulated less Na+ and more K+, resulting in a higher K+/Na+ ratio that mitigated ionic toxicity throughout the plants, compared to the salt-sensitive resources. Furthermore, the salt-tolerant germplasms also exerted salt tolerance through the following several pathways: they maintained robust osmotic regulation by accumulating higher levels of proline, soluble sugars, and other osmolytes; they neutralized reactive oxygen species (ROS) by elevating the activity of antioxidant enzymes; and they sustained optimal growth by boosting photosynthesis. Taken together, this study provided a more comprehensive assessment of the sunflower's physiological salt tolerance, offering valuable insights for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance and accelerating the breeding process for sunflower varieties with improved salt resilience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8d33d1f77c2f3e3c53d355fbcf3c1beaa7b2a4c6266868af2a5fc884c763f31","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
