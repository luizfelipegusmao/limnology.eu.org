This study investigated the effects of psyllium fibers on antimicrobial protein expression, focusing on the type II immunity and tuft cell-group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) circuit in the small intestine of the mouse. Supplemental psyllium fiber upregulated antimicrobial proteins, such as small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A) and resistin-like beta (RELMβ), in mouse small intestine, evidently affecting cecal microbiota composition. Psyllium fibers also increased the RNA and protein expression of molecules related to ILC2 and tuft cells, such as IL-13, IL-25, DCLK1, Gfi-1b, SH2 domain-containing protein 3C, and Spi-B. In addition, ILC2 inhibitor (disulfiram) and bitter taste receptor blocker administration reduced psyllium-induced SPRR2A and RELMβ expression. Collectively, psyllium supplementation upregulates antimicrobial proteins such as SPRR2A and RELMß via the type II immune response and tuft cell-ILC2 circuit in the mouse small intestine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aa8b91b39c40f380a18014a4ab5687fd4bd39e5d2f426f88ff79d03126dff57a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
