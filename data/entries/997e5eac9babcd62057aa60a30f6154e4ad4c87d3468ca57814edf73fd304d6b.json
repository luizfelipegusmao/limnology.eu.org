{"title":"Epigenetic Regulation During Plant Development and the Capacity for Epigenetic Memory","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070122-025047?TRACK=RSS","date":1684713600000,"content":"<div><p>The establishment, maintenance, and removal of epigenetic modifications provide an additional layer of regulation, beyond genetically encoded factors, by which plants can control developmental processes and adapt to the environment. Epigenetic inheritance, while historically referring to information not encoded in the DNA sequence that is inherited between generations, can also refer to epigenetic modifications that are maintained within an individual but are reset between generations. Both types of epigenetic inheritance occur in plants, and the functions and mechanisms distinguishing the two are of great interest to the field. Here, we discuss examples of epigenetic dynamics and maintenance during selected stages of growth and development and their functional consequences. Epigenetic states are also dynamic in response to stress, with consequences for transposable element regulation. How epigenetic resetting between generations occurs during normal development and in response to stress is an emerging area of research.</p></div>","author":"Elizabeth A.
