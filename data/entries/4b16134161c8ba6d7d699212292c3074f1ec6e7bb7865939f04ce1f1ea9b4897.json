{"title":"The Tactics of Religious Engagement and Political Participation of Chinese Buddhism during the Great Mongol Empire Era (1206-1260)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0888/v1","date":1723531382000,"content":"Influenced by the pluralistic and open-minded cultural ideologies of shamanism, the rulers of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty emphasized the implementation of religious government policies with an emphasis on coexistence, adaptability, and pragmatism. The Mongol ruling elite formed alliances with religious factions in various regions and worked closely with local spiritual leaders. During the era of the Great Mongol State, Kublai Khan valued the wealth of the Han Chinese territories. To maintain the order of Mongol Yuan rule in northern China, he used Han Chinese Buddhism and other religious forces to balance and suppress Quanzhen Dao. As a result, Chinese Buddhism became increasingly politically influential in Mongolia. Using their religious identity and talent, Chinese Buddhist monks became active in Mongolia to regulate the political activities of the Han Chinese religious forces. This led to a shift in the religious landscape of northern China during the transition from the Jin to Yuan dynasties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b16134161c8ba6d7d699212292c3074f1ec6e7bb7865939f04ce1f1ea9b4897","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
