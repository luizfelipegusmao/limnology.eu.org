Given this, this study clarifies the theoretical connotation of DE enabling HQDT,and finds that: Micro, DE promotes efficiency improvements in tourism enterprises, with its economies of scale and Matthew effect reducing average costs, its economies of scope meeting diversified demand, and its long-tail effect improving supply-demand matching mechanism. Meso, DE can transform and upgrade tourism industry structure through industrial digitization and digital industrialization, and also form a new tourist industry form and value chain through cross-border integration. Macro, DE can stimulate innovation and flexibility of market players, increase new factor inputs in tourism, improve factor allocation efficiency, and advance macro regulation of the tourism market. Accordingly, the study conducts an empirical test based on panel data for 31 provinces in mainland China during 2011–2020. Results show that: ① DE positively influences HQDT, and the sub-dimensions all positively influence HQDT. ② DE has a heterogeneous impact on HQDT and shows spatial spillover effects. Finally, the study concludes with effective paths for DE promoting HQDT: \"Promote digital infrastructure construction, accelerate tourism digital transformation, strengthen integration and innovation development, and overcome the challenges of tourism enterprises\".","author":"Min Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"94d166881ebd1502c2136558e0d4f5ef7d9473b37aa6e80c0b154609d935fd4e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
