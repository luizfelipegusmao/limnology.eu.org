{"title":"The New Lead-Free Copper Alloy CuAl8Fe5Ni4Zn4Sn1 for Plain Bearings and Its Strengthening Mechanisms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1958/v1","date":1714449381000,"content":"CuAl8Fe5Ni4Zn4Sn1 (OF 2238) is a new lead-free copper alloy for plain bearing applications that was first officially presented in a scientific journal in 2020. Soon after its invention, the use of the alloy for connecting rod bushings in heavy duty internal combustion engines was promoted and validated with customers. The aim of this article is to describe the material properties of the new alloy in more detail than previously and explain how the advantageous properties of CuAl8Fe5Ni4Zn4Sn1 are generated. At the beginning of the article, the general development trends in the field of copper alloys for sliding applications are presented. This is followed by a presentation of the latest research results about CuAl8Fe5Ni4Zn4Sn, before concluding with a brief summary and future outlook, emphasizing on the fact that recent trends in copper-based sliding applications show great additional potential for further material developments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c212536b9484e91aa109ab77fa51337340aa2258186cc7b107e2094608fb73d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
