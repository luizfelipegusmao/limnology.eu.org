{"title":"Automated acoustic monitoring of fish for near-real-time resource management","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/7/1412/7469916?rss=1","date":1702339200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Freshwater fisheries in developing regions provide livelihoods and nutrition for millions of people worldwide. These fisheries are frequently data poor, which limits fisheries management. The seasonal Cambodian dai platform fishery on the Tonle Sap River is one of the best monitored inland fisheries in Southeast Asia, yet catch sampling is limited and there is no fishery-independent monitoring. A monitoring system is needed to characterize fish migration and mortality, be cost effective, and be deployable in areas with minimal infrastructure. We integrated a Simrad wide-band transceiver mini echosounder (200 kHz), solar power, and an Internet of Things communications module as an autonomous, automated monitoring package for the deployment on upstream and downstream commercial fishing platforms. The solar panel and controller supply direct current power to the echosounder, communications module, and battery for power during dark hours. Echosounders are programmed to sample at 1 Hz for 15 min every hour. The communications module is a built cellular endpoint that accesses a local wireless network to transmit raw data files to a data server. Data are downloaded from the server for processing and analysis. This expandable system provides a flexible management tool that can be deployed at any location with wireless communication capability.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"102635a6392fbebdf47f4aa28fdc5e2e5c9719cfc2d084d16f1505c68999e955","category":"Environment"}
