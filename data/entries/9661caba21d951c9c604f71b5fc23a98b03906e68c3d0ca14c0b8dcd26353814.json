{"title":"Gut Microbiome and Metabolome Alterations in Overweight or Obese Adult Population after Weight-Loss Bifidobacterium brevis BBr60 Intervention: A Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0808/v1","date":1725968338000,"content":"Probiotics, known for regulating gut microbiota, may aid those with overweight or obesity, but their mechanisms require more research. This study involved 75 overweight or obese young adults, randomly assigned to either a Bifidobacterium brevis BBr60 group or a placebo group. Both groups received diet guidance and took either BBr60 (1Ã—1010 CFU/day) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Re-searchers analyzed body composition, serum glucose, lipids, liver and kidney function, comprehensive metabolome, and intestinal homeostasis before and after the intervention. After 12 weeks, BBr60 significantly reduced weight and BMI compared to pre-treatment levels and outperformed the placebo. The BBr60 group also showed improved blood biochemistry, with notably lower fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels than the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, BBr60 influenced vital serum and fecal metabolites related to three amino acid metabolic pathways and regulated the bacteria Dialister, Klebsiella, and Bacteroides, which correlated strongly with serum metabolites. These findings indicate that BBr60 can safely and effectively regulating BMI, body weight, serum glucose, lipids, and liver function markers, which may involve BBr60's impact on key gut bacteria, which influence metabolites related to the valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9661caba21d951c9c604f71b5fc23a98b03906e68c3d0ca14c0b8dcd26353814","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
