{"title":"Review of Meta-heuristics Methods for Machine Learning With Graph Neural Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0192/v1","date":1727936527000,"content":"In this paper, we review metaheuristic optimization techniques for machine learning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), focusing on two major categories: single-solution-based and population-based metaheuristics. We provide an in-depth analysis of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), highlighting their effectiveness in optimizing GNN hyperparameters. By exploring the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, we aim to provide insights into their application and performance in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of GNN models. We will also review the similarities of supervised learning and metaheuristic solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"da4259bf705856d4f9451f7a147b69756a5edf7a1a884a00c7a6348262418a35","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
