Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with GBV among secondary school female students in the Sarlahi district of Nepal. Using a cross-sectional study, we collected data from 225 secondary-level female students in the Sarlahi district of Nepal. Data was collected by using a semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire. Probability proportionate and simple random sampling techniques were used for sampling. The association was explored by using a chi-square test and binary logistic regression. The two-tailed significance level for all analyses was set at p&lt;0.05. The overall prevalence of GBV among the students during their lifetime was 45.33 of which physical violence was 16.89%, sexual violence was 30.22% and psychological violence was 39.56%. The prevalence of experiencing physical violence from family members was 97.36%, followed by emotional violence (41.57%). Further, the prevalence of sexual violence from non-family members was 91.17%. Type of family had a significant association with lifetime experience of GBV (p = 0.003). Gender based discrimination in the family had a significant association with lifetime (p = 0.001) as well as last 12 months (p = 0.001) GBV experience. Experience of witnessing physical violence as a child within the last 12 months was associated with GBV (p = 0.03). Different forms of GBV such as physical, sexual, and emotional acts of violence among female students were highly prevalent. However, their knowledge and awareness of confronting this issue were limited. This warrants the urgent need to establish preventive and responsive control measures within schools and communities to address GBV effectively.","author":"Laxmi Gautam","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"6b76dff902df49ae05645eaca50f4df9dbb13337f37c6b3a8e4baba30501091d","category":"Environment"}
