{"title":"Collaborative learning using open-source FPGA-based under water ultrasonic system","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0972/v1","date":1718355101000,"content":"The Digital electronics collaborative enhanced learning (DECEL) project has recently developed an international collaborative education course. Its main objective is to enhance the digital electronics skills of international students by working on a complex, multidisciplinary applied problem using a mixed digital architecture. We have developed a logic level synthesis and dedicated software layers on the Red Pitaya FPGA platform. The diversity of digital concepts to be implemented, from hardware description language (HDL) to high-level languages such as Python or Matlab, forced the students to work together and rapidly improve their skills. Their motivation was fueled by the curiosity of controlling an ultrasound probe to obtain ultrasound signatures. This particular physics, little known to the students, was an additional source of curiosity. The goal of forming an image in a liquid medium was an additional motivating factor for them.  The students reported that they learned a lot from the experiment. Thus, the technical parts and pedagogical results are documented in this work for reproducibility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33ee4a3777eea9ed74acc3889b770624b14910b1a8e0f4b4e1f4c65c631fd112","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
