{"title":"Glucose-G protein signaling plays a crucial role in tomato resilience to high temperature and elevated CO2","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/2/1025/7623298?rss=1","date":1709683200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Global climate change is accompanied by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) enrichment and high temperature (HT) stress; however, how plants adapt to the combined environments and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we show that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> alleviated plant sensitivity to HT stress, with significantly increased apoplastic glucose (Glc) levels in tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) leaves. Exogenous Glc treatment enhanced tomato resilience to HT stress under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Cell-based biolayer interferometry, subcellular localization, and Split-luciferase assays revealed that Glc bound to the tomato regulator of G protein signaling 1 (RGS1) and induced RGS1 endocytosis and thereby RGS1-G protein <span>α</span> subunit (GPA1) dissociation in a concentration-dependent manner. Using <span>rgs1</span> and <span>gpa1</span> mutants, we found that RGS1 negatively regulated thermotolerance and was required for elevated CO<sub>2</sub>-Glc-induced thermotolerance. GPA1 positively regulated the elevated CO<sub>2</sub>-Glc-induced thermotolerance. A combined transcriptome and chlorophyll fluorescence parameter analysis further revealed that GPA1 integrated photosynthesis- and photoprotection-related mechanisms to regulate thermotolerance. These results demonstrate that Glc–RGS1–GPA1 signaling plays a crucial role in the elevated CO<sub>2</sub>-induced thermotolerance in tomato. This information enhances our understanding of the Glc-G protein signaling function in stress resilience in response to global climate change and will be helpful for genetic engineering approaches to improve plant resilience.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d8cb3a5e7c9d32fbda93f0ba3c50222a1a56fc0e1deae244a89c055a21004e56","category":"Environment"}
