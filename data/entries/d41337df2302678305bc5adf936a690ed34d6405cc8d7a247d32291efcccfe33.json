{"title":"Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 1 Promotes Bladder Cancer Progression by Stabilizing C-myc","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2088/v1","date":1724849580000,"content":"Background: Ubiquitination is an important post-transcriptional modification crucial for maintaining cell homeostasis. As a deubiquitination enzyme, ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) is associated with tumor progression; however, its role in bladder cancer is unknown. This study was aimed to analyze USP1 expression and study its roles in bladder cancer. \nMethods: The web server GEPIA was used to analyze the USP1 expression. To explore USP1 function in bladder cancer, we constructed USP1-knockout cell lines in UMUC3 cells. A FLAG-USP1 (WT USP1) plasmid and a plasmid FLAG-USP1 C90S (catalytic-inactive mutant) used to overexpress USP1 in T24 cells. CCK8, colony formation, and transwell assays were used to assess cell viability, proliferation and migration. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to screen the pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were used to explore the interaction between USP1 and c-MYC. Xenograft mouse model was used to study the role of USP1 in bladder cancer.\nResults: USP1 expression is upregulated in human bladder cancer cells and correlated with poor patient prognosis. USP1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, clone formation, and migration; this was attenuated by genetic ablation of USP1. Furthermore, we observed that USP1- deficiency inhibited tumor formation in vivo.  Mechanistically, the c-MYC pathway was remarkably activated compared with the other pathways. Furthermore, USP1 could directly interact with c-MYC. and increase c-MYC stability depending on the catalytic activity of USP1. \nConclusions: Our results suggest that high expression of USP1 promotes bladder cancer progression by stabilizing c-MYC; hence, USP1 it may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating bladder cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d41337df2302678305bc5adf936a690ed34d6405cc8d7a247d32291efcccfe33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
