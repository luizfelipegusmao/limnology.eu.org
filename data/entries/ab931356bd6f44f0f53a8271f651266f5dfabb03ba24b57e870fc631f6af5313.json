{"title":"Unveiling the Burden of Nephrolithiasis in Low- and Lower-Middle Income Countries: A Review on Presentation, Risk Factors, Treatment Practices and Future Navigations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0397/v1","date":1717670319000,"content":"Background: Nephrolithiasis, or kidney stone disease, presents a significant global health burden, with incidence rates and treatment practices varying widely globally. This study aims to discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, treatment modalities, and challenges for nephrolithiasis in the lower half of the World Bank Rank; low and lower-middle-income countries. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed for each country on the list, focusing on studies published from January 2000 onwards and reporting data on prevalence, risk factors, treatment practices, and economic implications. Results: Nephrolithiasis represents a significant burden for healthcare systems, with noteworthy geographical variability in prevalence possibly dependent on socioeconomic status and gender. Risk factors include dietary habits, climate, pollution, and infectious diseases. Treatment practices in some regions still rely on open surgery due to limited access to advanced endourological techniques, while other regions demonstrate high proactivity in research. The burden is exacerbated by inadequate healthcare infrastructure and training. Conclusions: Addressing nephrolithiasis in challenging economic circumstances requires targeted interventions, including improved access to modern treatment methods, enhanced training for healthcare professionals, and better socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Future research should focus on region-specific strategies and the development of sustainable healthcare solutions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab931356bd6f44f0f53a8271f651266f5dfabb03ba24b57e870fc631f6af5313","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
