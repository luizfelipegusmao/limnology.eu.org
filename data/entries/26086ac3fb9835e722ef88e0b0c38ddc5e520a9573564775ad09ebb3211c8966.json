{"title":"<i>CLEC11A</i> methylation is correlated to AML subtypes and cytogenetic risk factors but not patient demographics","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300477","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Allyson J.

Raimondi</p>\r\n\r\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive and lethal cancer of the blood, which leads to the death of over 11,000 patients in the United States each year. Research on identifying, characterizing, and treating AML is crucial in the fight against this deadly disease. Recent studies have examined the role of <i>CLEC11A</i> in cancer, including AML. However, there have been conflicting reports related to tumor progression and survival. Because survival is based on a variety of factors, including classification of the tumor, genetic risk factors, and demographics, it is imperative that we determine what role <i>CLEC11A</i> may have in cancer survival. Therefore, utilizing data from the Genomic Data Commons, we analyzed <i>CLEC11A</i> methylation in 108 AML patients compared to FAB classification, cytogenetic risk factors, age, race, and gender. Our results show statistically significant correlations between methylation of <i>CLEC11A</i> and FAB classification as well as poor genetic risk factors. However, no difference was observed in <i>CLEC11A</i> methylation when compared to demographic data. Our results, matched with a known biological function of <i>CLEC11A</i> in early hematopoiesis, indicate that <i>CLEC11A</i> may be an important marker for AML diagnosis and prognosis and provide relevant data in the ongoing search for novel therapeutics to improve AML survival.","author":"Allyson J.
