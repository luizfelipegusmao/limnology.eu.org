Here, we explore the interplay between angiosperm genome organization and botanical diversity, empowered by genomic approaches ranging from genetic linkage mapping to analysis of gene regulation. Commonality in the genetic hardware of plants has enabled robust comparative genomics that has provided a broad picture of angiosperm evolution and implicated both general processes and specific elements in contributing to botanical diversity. We argue that the hardware of plant genomes—both in content and in dynamics—has been shaped by selection for rather substantial differences in gene regulation between plants and animals such as maize and human, organisms of comparable genome size and gene number. Their distinctive genome content and dynamics may reflect in part the indeterminate development of plants that puts strikingly different demands on gene regulation than in animals. Repeated polyploidization of plant genomes and multiplication of individual genes together with extensive rearrangement and differential retention provide rich raw material for selection of morphological and/or physiological variations conferring fitness in specific niches, whether natural or artificial. These findings exemplify the burgeoning information available to employ in increasing knowledge of plant biology and in modifying selected plants to better meet human needs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"295e91af590dc79371d05ad497e487bba9a11b948ec6aa4e62a3b285cb63e459","category":"Environment"}
