This study, it was aimed to determine the effect of olive oil extract of propolis (OEP) on short and long-term administration of TAM in rats. Wistar albino rats were divided into groups with eight animals in each. Groups: control, OEP, TAM, and OEP + TAM. At the end of the experiment, oxidative stress tests were performed with Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) on blood and tissue samples (liver, kidney, and ovary) taken from rats. After single-dose TAM administration, there was a significant increase in red blood cell, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration levels compared to the control group, a decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) value, a significant increase in liver enzymes and fasting glucose values was detected compared with the control and propolis groups. A normalizing effect was observed in the group given OEP and TAM combined. The increase in Malondialdehyde (MDA) and the decrease in enzyme activities in tissues are also noteworthy. Propolis application reduced the tissue damage caused by TAM. In addition, improved cytokine levels, which increased with TAM administration. It has been concluded that OEP can be given in supportive treatment, as it improves hematological and antioxidant parameters in TAM treatment.</p>","author":"Sibel Silici, \nLeylagül Kaynar, \nAslı Okan, \nZüleyha Doğanyiğit","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"3e66e5d3ca42213d86ecec734f4c37ef3962dc670070a3180e6e61482aa67f44","category":"Environment"}
