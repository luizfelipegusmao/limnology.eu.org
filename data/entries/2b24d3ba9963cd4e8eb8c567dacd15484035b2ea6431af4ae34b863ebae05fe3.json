{"title":"Dual-Frequency Terahertz Amplitude Modulator Based on the Coupling Effect of Cross-Shaped Structure and U-Shaped Metal Patches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0652/v1","date":1718094864000,"content":"This letter presents a dual-frequency terahertz amplitude modulator based on a cross-shaped structure and U-shaped metal patches. Its structural unit is a typical metal-substrate structure. The top metal consists of a cross-shaped structure and U-shaped metal patches, and the bottom substrate layer is made of quartz. Amplitude modulation is achieved by adjusting the temperature of the vanadium dioxide (VO2) patches. The modulation depth can be approximately 75%. The mechanism of the resonance frequency is explained by the equivalent circuit model. The proposed structure shows good amplitude modulation capability at different incidence and azimuth angles by changing the location of the VO2 patches. The dual-frequency terahertz amplitude modulator can be used in terahertz communication, imaging, etc.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b24d3ba9963cd4e8eb8c567dacd15484035b2ea6431af4ae34b863ebae05fe3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
