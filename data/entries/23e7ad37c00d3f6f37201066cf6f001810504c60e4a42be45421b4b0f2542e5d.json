{"title":"Foliar application of nettle and Japanese knotweed extracts on Vitis vinifera: impact on phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and antioxidant activity during veraison and harvest of cv. Touriga Franca","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13310?af=R","date":1708588800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Plant-based extracts have been recently used as sustainable tools to improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and increase grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) quality. However, knowledge about the effect of these extracts on secondary metabolism compounds, that are fundamental for grape and wine quality, is still scarce. In this study, a trial was installed in an experimental vineyard with the variety Touriga Franca located at University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, <i>Baixo Corgo</i> sub-region of the Douro Demarcated Region, Portugal in two growing seasons: 2019 and 2020. The aim was to evaluate the effect of foliar application of nettle (<i>Urtica</i> spp.) extract (NE) and Japanese knotweed (<i>Reynoutria japonica</i>) extract (JKE) on grapevines leaves and berries bioactive compounds contents and antioxidant activity, at veraison and harvest.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The application of NE increased the total carotenoids in leaves and the total phenolics content and the antioxidant activity (ferric reducing antioxidant power, FRAP) in berries while JKE increased flavonoids content in leaves and the antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, DPPH) in berries.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>These extracts seem to have a stimulatory effect on grapevine, enhancing bioactive compounds contents and antioxidant capacity and, consequently, the physiological performance of the plant and the quality of the berries. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Eliana Monteiro, \nMiguel Baltazar, \nSandra Pereira, \nSofia Correia, \nHelena Ferreira, \nRadek Bragança, \nIsabel Cortez, \nIsaura Castro, \nBerta Gonçalves","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"23e7ad37c00d3f6f37201066cf6f001810504c60e4a42be45421b4b0f2542e5d","category":"Environment"}
