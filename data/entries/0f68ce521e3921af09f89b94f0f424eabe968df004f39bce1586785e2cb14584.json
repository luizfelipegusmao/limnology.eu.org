{"title":"Radio Frontends for Frequency Agile Microwave Photonic Radars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1269/v1","date":1729068581000,"content":"With a recent advance in photonic integrated circuits (PIC), a new field of frequency agile coherent radar systems is being thoroughly researched. In contrast to the traditional all-electronics radiofrequency (RF) radar techniques, a fully photonics-based system does not suffer from bandwidth limitation and noise degradation when switching from S to X or K-band and can achieve excellent phase noise even at frequencies exceeding 20 GHz. However, recent state-of-the-art PICs still exhibit high processing losses in the optical domain, which must be addressed in the electrical part of the RF domain. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the challenges in designing RF front-end amplifier chains for microwave photonic radars, particularly in maintaining stability, minimizing noise, and reducing intermodulation distortion. Furthermore, a comprehensive demonstration of the RF front-end, encompassing both the optical generation of RF signals and experimental measurements of a rotor blade's Doppler fingerprint to validate the system's performance is presented.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f68ce521e3921af09f89b94f0f424eabe968df004f39bce1586785e2cb14584","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
