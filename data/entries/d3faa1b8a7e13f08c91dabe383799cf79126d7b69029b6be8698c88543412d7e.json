{"title":"Mechanism of Malignancy Development When the Metabolism of the Human Body Deteriorates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0985/v2","date":1724206763000,"content":"Globally, cancer is an important health problem worldwide, and has become one modern medicine’s most serious problems to prevent, diagnose, and treat. Many types of cancers still have non-negligible mortality rates, and new treatments need to be developed for them. This study aimed to elucidate cancer mechanisms and facilitate cancer treatment and prevention. The ideal temperature for cancer growth is 35°C; however, conditions were not consistent with chromosomal instability, loss of alleles of tumor-suppressor genes, abnormal DNA methylation, and collagen phagocytosis, which are known causes of cancer. In addition, when cancer develops, white blood cells attack the cancer tissue and remove it; however, as the decrease in body temperature drops, leads to a reduction in the immune potential of the white blood cells. Based on previous papers, this study focused on aimed to determine the effects of the low-temperature environment of 35°C, the temperature at which cancer is most likely to proliferate, and changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The study revealed that Therefore, the causes of cancer is caused by include chromosome fusion that occurs occurring due to the impaired DNA topoisomerase IIα proliferation and primary cilia rotation due to resulting from decreased intercellular adhesion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3faa1b8a7e13f08c91dabe383799cf79126d7b69029b6be8698c88543412d7e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
