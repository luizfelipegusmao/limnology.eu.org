{"title":"Cannabidiol Acts as a Predicted Inhibitor of the MAPK Pathway in Colorectal Cancer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2035/v1","date":1719904772000,"content":"Colorectal cancer (CRC), found in the intestinal tract, is initiated, and progresses through various mechanisms, including dysregulation of signalling pathways. Several signalling pathways, such as EGFR and MAPK, involved in cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, are often dysregulated in CRC. Although cannabidiol (CBD) has previously induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro in CRC cell lines, its effects on signalling pathways have not yet been determined. An in silico analysis was used here to assess partner proteins that can bind to CBD and docking simulations were used to predict precisely where CBD would bind to these selected proteins. A survey of current literature was used to hypothesize the effect of CBD binding on such proteins. The results predict that CBD could interact with EGFR, RAS/RAF isoforms, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. The predicted CBD-induced inhibition might be due to CBD binding to the ATP binding site of the target proteins. This prevents the required phosphoryl transfer to activate substrate proteins and/or CBD binding to the DFG motif, thus reducing catalytic activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc9b1efc850f69cb434aea5f3a7d367c1e33f9319ec8900b06adb27632b6607f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
