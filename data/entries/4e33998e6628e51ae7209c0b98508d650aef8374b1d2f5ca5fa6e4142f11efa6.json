{"title":"A comprehensive study of CYP2E1 and its role in carcass characteristics and chemical lamb meat quality in different Indonesian sheep breeds","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310336","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Ratna Sholatia Harahap, Asep Gunawan, Yuni Cahya Endrawati, Huda Shalahudin Darusman, Göran Andersson, Ronny Rachman Noor</p>\r\n\r\nThe role of CYP2E1 in oxidation is essential for its effects on meat quality. This study used 200 Indonesian sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>) to determine the SNP g allele frequencies. g. 50658168 T&gt;C of <i>CYP2E1</i> gene located in 3´-UTR region and their genetic association with lamb quality traits, including carcass characteristics, retail cut carcass, physicochemical lamb, fatty acid, cholesterol, flavor and odor, and mineral content. Further, the level of <i>CYP2E1</i> mRNA and CYP2E1 protein expression in muscle were determined and correlated with lamb quality traits. <i>CYP2E1</i> gene polymorphisms were identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The <i>CYP2E1</i> mRNA expression levels in phenotypically divergent sheep populations were analyzed using Quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining analysis used three samples each in the high and low lamb quality groups based on pH value and tenderness. An association study of <i>CYP2E1</i> gene polymorphisms was performed using General Linear Model (GLM) analysis. The genetic association between the CC, CT, and TT genotypes at the SNP g. 50658168 T&gt;C <i>CYP2E1</i> gene and lamb quality traits were significant (P&lt;0.05), including carcass characteristics, retail cut carcass, fatty acid, cholesterol, flavor, and odor. Lambs with the CT genotype had a higher mRNA and protein expression in high lamb quality traits. The highest CYP2E1 protein expression was localized in the longissimus dorsi. The group sample with high lamb quality had a higher area and perimeter of muscle cells. <i>CYP2E1</i> can be used as a genetic marker for selecting sheep with high meat quality.","author":"Ratna Sholatia Harahap","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4e33998e6628e51ae7209c0b98508d650aef8374b1d2f5ca5fa6e4142f11efa6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
