{"title":"Vasculogenic mimicry regulates immune infiltration and mutational status of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer to influence tumor prognosis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24165?af=R","date":1706941768000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the direct formation of microcirculatory ducts by invasive malignant tumors via cellular phenotypic transformation. However, there is a lack of VM-based biomarkers for breast cancer.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>We obtained transcriptomic expression data, single cell sequencing data, and clinical data of patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) database and GEO database, performed single cell analysis to obtain specific type annotations of breast cancer cells and analyzed their spatial expression analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) analyses as well as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analyses were performed to clarify the biological pathways and tumor functional enrichment relationships of the major expressed genes of VM in the breast cancer bulk data specimens. VM biomarkers were constructed. Meanwhile, the relationship between VM scores and tumor immune infiltration in breast cancer was analyzed using MCPcounter and ssGSEA methods. In addition, we assessed the specific relationship between NDRG1, a key VM gene in breast cancer, and tumor colonization, adhesion and invasion by biological experiments in breast cancer cell lines.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The main cell types of breast cancer (BRCA) samples were annotated by single cell transcriptome analysis. Most of the VM-high group was present in epithelial cells, whereas the VM-low group was present in immune and stromal cells. Multiple tumor pathways such as TGFÎ² p53 and MAPK were closely associated with VM-mediated breast cancer infiltration and invasion. A prognostic model of breast cancer based on VM key genes was constituted. Prognostic stratification of breast cancer was successfully achieved for the TCGA-BRCA and GSE58812 datasets. Through immune infiltration analysis, we found that differential expression of VM markers was associated with multiple immune cell regulation. In MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cell lines, we found that the NDRG1 gene significantly promoted colony formation of breast cancer cells.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our constructed VM-related gene-based model of breast cancer biology holds promise for prognostic prediction and patient stratification of breast cancer. This may provide a potentially clinically valuable aid in promoting a deeper understanding of the biological regulation of VM in breast cancer and exploring the specific mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis and breast cancer development.</p>","author":"Shurong Zheng, \nGuilong Guo, \nZhi Yang, \nYiqiao Lu, \nKangkang Lu, \nWeida Fu, \nQidi Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"7100c784a40a0ebbe0e00143d39e18783323c4a8cf51014548c287068404b2dd","category":"Environment"}
