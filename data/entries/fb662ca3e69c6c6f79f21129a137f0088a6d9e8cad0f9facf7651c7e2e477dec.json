{"title":"Pediatric Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction: A Comprehensive Exploration of Clinical Implications and Diagnostic Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0678/v1","date":1710227379000,"content":"Lower urinary tract dysfunction is clinically important because it may cause urinary tract infections, mainly due to accumulation of residual urine, and adversely affect renal function. In addition, it may cause urinary incontinence, strongly affecting the childâ€™s quality of life. The function of the lower urinary tract is closely associated with function of the bowel because constipation is commonly present with bladder dysfunction. The interplay between the lower urinary tract and bowel function, coupled with common conditions such as detrusor overactivity and voiding dysfunction, requires a nuanced diagnostic approach. Detrusor overactivity, a benign but socially harmful condition, is the principal cause of daytime urinary incontinence in childhood. It needs to be differentiated from more serious conditions such as neurogenic bladder dysfunction or urethral obstruction. Voiding dysfunction, a habitual sphincter contraction during voiding, is common in children with detrusor overactivity, may be selflimiting but may also result in residual urine and urinary tract infections. It may resemble, in severe cases, the neurogenic bladder dysfunction, most often caused by spinal dysraphism which very often leads to recurrent urinary tract infections and high intravesical pressures, jeopardizing renal function. Voiding diary is crucial in the initial evaluation of lower urinary tract function in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fb662ca3e69c6c6f79f21129a137f0088a6d9e8cad0f9facf7651c7e2e477dec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
