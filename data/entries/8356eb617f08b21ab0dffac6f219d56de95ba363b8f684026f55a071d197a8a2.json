{"title":"Trophic Level Variations of Heavy Metals in Feathers of Birds from the Awotan Landfill, in Ibadan, Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0528/v1","date":1720169416000,"content":"Pollution, urbanization and technological advancements have posed stress on the ecosystem and its matrices. Globally, pollutants are observed in all compartments of ecological communities which affect the integrity of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere. Xenobiotics bioaccumulate and biomagnify across trophic levels or webs. Heavy metals have been implicated in impacts towards biodiversity and environmental declination. In Nigeria, wastes issues are a cause of concern and landfilling or are waste disposal approaches that cause deleterious effects such as depauperation of diversity and species decline, prompting the non-invasive ecotoxicological hazard assessments. Feathers were used to assess concentration levels of 13 metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cr, Cd, Pb, Ni, Al, B, Se and Hg) using fast atomic absorption spectrophotometer (FAAS), one-way ANOVA was used in comparing variations in mean concentrations across trophic levels, diversity indices and point count methods were used to estimate diversity and abundance. Four avian species were assessed Hirundo aethiopica (insectivore), Streptoptelia senegalensis (granivore), Turdus pelios (omnivore), and Anthus leucophrys. (insectivore). Observed concentrations of important metals like iron were high with the insectivores having the highest concentrations of iron (2.6985 ± 0.1975 ppm) and granivores having the lowest (2.0100 ± 0.3172 ppm). The insectivores had the highest concentrations for cadmium, cobalt and chromium (0.0005 ± 0.0005ppm), nickel (at 00.0012 ± 0.0017 ppm) and least was observed in the granivores (0.0003 ± 0.0006 ppm). Selenium concentrations were quite high in insectivores (0.0775 ± 0.0035 ppm) and lowest in granivores (0.0433 ± 0.0015 ppm) likewise mercury for insectivores (0.0280 ± 0.0010 ppm) and granivores (0.0213 ± 0.0015 ppm). From the study, it is apparent that landfills are sources of pollution and poor management of wastes can affect biota (causing effects such as asymmetry and bioaccumulation) and ecosystem balance. The observation of heavy metals in the feathers serve as good sentinels due to their trophic levels and could be signs for what could be yet to occur. The heavy metal concentrations were significantly different at p &lt; 0.05.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8356eb617f08b21ab0dffac6f219d56de95ba363b8f684026f55a071d197a8a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
