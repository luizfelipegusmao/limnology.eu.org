{"title":"Design Considerations for RF Power Amplifiers for Driving Acousto Optical Tunable Filters","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1608/v1","date":1721468871000,"content":"Acousto-Optical Tunable Filters (AOTFs) are a promising technology, exceptionally suited for advanced applications in spectroscopy and imaging across various scientific fields, including space exploration. This is due to their flexibility and high-speed functionality for precise wavelength selection via periodic modulation of the crystalâ€™s refractive index using sound waves. These AOTFs are in turn driven by Radio Frequency (RF) signals through a transducer creating sound waves inside the crystal. This work presents a detailed comparison of three distinct topologies of Radio Frequency Power Amplifiers (RFPAs) for driving these AOTFs within the 30 to 300 MHz frequency range. The analysis focuses on three critical parameters: efficiency, bandwidth, and linearity, which are essential for optimizing the performance of AOTFs. By evaluating the trade-offs among these parameters, this research aims to identify the most effective design approach for RFPAs in this application context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65cc4c33b9a65ed1409282ad2c88a119d906474ddfa75e68f51bc5fcf8fa2c33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
