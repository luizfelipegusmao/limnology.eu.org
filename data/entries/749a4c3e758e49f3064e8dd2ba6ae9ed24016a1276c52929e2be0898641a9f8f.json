{"title":"Competitiveness Evaluation Method of Supersonic Civil Aircraft Based on Analytic Hierarchy Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0743/v1","date":1725973978000,"content":"As the demand for long-distance flights continues to increase, supersonic transport (SST) has once again become a hot research topic. However, due to its uniqueness, there was few corresponding evaluation methods to compare the supersonic civil aircraft with common subsonic aircraft. This paper proposed an evaluation method for the competitiveness of supersonic civil aircraft based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Key indicators were selected to form a competitiveness evaluation model from the perspective of four criterion factors of economy, comfort, adaptability, and environment. The evaluation method proposed in this paper could reflect characteristics of supersonic civil aircraft and other subsonic aircraft, and effectively compare their competitiveness. This work can be used to evaluate the social acceptance of supersonic civil aircraft and provide reliable decision-making support for airlines' design work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"749a4c3e758e49f3064e8dd2ba6ae9ed24016a1276c52929e2be0898641a9f8f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
