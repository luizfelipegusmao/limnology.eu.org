The online internet-famous sites are the main characteristics of \"Internet-celebrity cities\". To fully understand online users' preferences in such kind of public spaces, this article took 27 typical riverfront internet-famous sites (RIFS) in Changsha city (China), as an example. Through the online images and review comments on social media platform \"Xiaohongshu\", the study analyzed usersâ€™ perception of RIFS specially on visual and emotional preferences. It revealed the following findings:(1) The popularity of RIFS had a significant head effect and there were far more positive emotions than neutral and negative emotions in review comments. (2) According to 5 different categories of RIFS: modern buildings with river views, restaurants with strong visual impact became the main attractions on commercial RIFS. The art exhibition RIFS attracted visitors to experience traditional culture and highlight their aesthetic pursuits. In the historical and cultural RIFS, people preferred to see the historical buildings with surrounding natural environment, as well as river and mountains views. Ecological Recreational RIFS showed the similar results with the uncultivated RIFS, for the main focus was on the ecological environment, a broader vision and the specific atmosphere. Moreover, the uncultivated RIFS showed more diversified attraction points. This study can provide a new perspective on the waterfront vitality and can offer a targeted and attractive manner for waterfront regeneration that are different from traditional methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4b8436f2a19711ac6629fc61736c7037187842d82a453230fdab8530bdc43a5f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
