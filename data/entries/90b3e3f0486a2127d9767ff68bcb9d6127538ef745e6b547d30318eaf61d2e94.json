{"title":"Can flow cytometric measurements of reactive oxygen species levels determine minimal inhibitory concentrations and antibiotic susceptibility testing for Acinetobacter baumannii?","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305939","date":1719237600000,"content":"<p>by Jia Hao Yeo, Jia Qian Low, Nasren Begam, Wan-Ting Leow, Andrea Lay-Hoon Kwa</p>\r\n\r\nCurrent antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) requires 16–24 hours, delaying initiation of appropriate antibiotics. Hence, there is a need for rapid AST. This study aims to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a rapid flow cytometric AST assay to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for carbapenem-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (CRAB). Antibiotic exposure causes increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacteria. We hypothesized that ROS can be used as a marker to determine MIC. We assessed three CRAB clinical isolates across fifteen antibiotics at various concentrations in a customized 96-well microtiter plate. The antibiotics assessed include amikacin, beta-lactams (ampicillin/sulbactam, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftolozane/tazobactam, doripenem, imipenem, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam), levofloxacin, polymyxin B, rifampicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracyclines (tigecycline and minocycline). These clinical CRAB isolates were assessed for ROS after antibiotic treatment. Increased ROS levels indicated by increased RedoxSensor<sup>TM</sup> Green (RSG) fluorescence intensity was assessed using flow cytometry (FCM). MIC was set as the lowest antibiotic concentration that gives a ≥1.5-fold increase in mode RSG fluorescence intensity (MIC<sub>RSG</sub>). Accuracy of MIC<sub>RSG</sub> was determined by comparing against microtiter broth dilution method performed under CLSI guidelines. ROS was deemed accurate in determining the MICs for β-lactams (83.3% accuracy) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100% accuracy). In contrast, ROS is less accurate in determining MICs for levofloxacin (33.3% accuracy), rifampicin (0% accuracy), amikacin (33.3% accuracy), and tetracyclines (33.3% accuracy). Collectively, this study described an FCM-AST assay to determine antibiotic susceptibility of CRAB isolates within 5 hours, reducing turnaround time up to 19 hours.","author":"Jia Hao Yeo","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"90b3e3f0486a2127d9767ff68bcb9d6127538ef745e6b547d30318eaf61d2e94","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
