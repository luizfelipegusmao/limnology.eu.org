{"title":"Polycomb proteins RING1A/B promote H2A monoubiquitination to regulate female gametophyte development in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/16/4822/7667035?rss=1","date":1715126400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A functional female gametophyte is the basis of successful sexual reproduction in flowering plants. During female gametophyte development, the megaspore mother cell (MMC), which differentiates from a single subepidermal somatic cell in the nucellus, undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores; only the one at the chalazal end, referred to as the functional megaspore (FM), then undergoes three rounds of mitosis and develops into a mature embryo sac. Here, we report that RING1A and RING1B (RING1A/B), two functionally redundant Polycomb proteins in Arabidopsis, are critical for female gametophyte development. Mutations of <span>RING1A/B</span> resulted in defects in the specification of the MMC and the FM, and in the subsequent mitosis of the FM, thereby leading to aborted ovules. Detailed analysis revealed that several genes essential for female gametophyte development were ectopically expressed in the <span>ring1a ring1b</span> mutant, including Argonaute (AGO) family genes and critical transcription factors. Furthermore, RING1A/B bound to some of these genes to promote H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub). Taken together, our study shows that RING1A/B promote H2Aub modification at key genes for female gametophyte development, suppressing their expression to ensure that the development progresses correctly.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"8c92a7692914cf2140f96adb7560a75067225334dbb3af15698ff0de49ae46e4","category":"Environment"}
