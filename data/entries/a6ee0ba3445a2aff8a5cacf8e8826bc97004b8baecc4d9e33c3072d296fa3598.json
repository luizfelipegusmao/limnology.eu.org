{"title":"Ethylene-Di-Amine Modified &beta;-Cyclodextrin Catalyzed Green Synthesis of Pyrimidones and Its In Silico Study against ESBL E. coli Receptor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.2306/v2","date":1712048334000,"content":"Modern organic synthesis is majorly focused on developing environmentally benign synthetic protocols by employing green chemistry principles. Accordingly, in our recent research work, we herein report the use of modified supramolecular host cyclodextrin as an effective solid based green catalyst for accessing structurally diverse and medicinally relevant pyrimidone architectures. The catalyst and the synthesized compounds 4 (a-r) were characterized using FT-IR, NMR and GC-Mass spectroscopy. Major highlights of the reported work include: atom economical process, extremely milder reaction conditions, operational simplicity, high isolated yields, and excellent catalyst turnover number. The molecular docking studies suggest that the compound 4n has the hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and Ï€-pair interactions with the active site of active sites of CXT M 15 receptor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6ee0ba3445a2aff8a5cacf8e8826bc97004b8baecc4d9e33c3072d296fa3598","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
