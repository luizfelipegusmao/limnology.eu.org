{"title":"Analyzing Road Infrastructure and Safety in Urban Nepal: A Synthesis of Existing Research","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2058/v1","date":1727362639000,"content":"Road safety is a critical public health concern in Nepal, especially in urban areas where inadequate infrastructure exacerbates traffic incidents. This study reviews and synthesizes 21 peer-reviewed papers to investigate how road infrastructure contributes to traffic accidents. Key factors include poor road conditions, reckless driving, and inadequate traffic management. Findings indicate that road traffic accidents (RTAs) significantly increase morbidity, mortality, and economic burdens in Nepal. To address these issues, the study recommends infrastructure improvements, stricter enforcement of traffic laws, and enhanced public education on road safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9835ad89e79426948e3f387887d1d98af4dc1e5ef69e81dadaed27e4def9d4cf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
