Despite decades of studies acknowledging health disparities based on race, significant change has not occurred. There are shockingly few evidence-based antiracism interventions. New paradigms are needed to intervene on, and not just document, racism in health care systems. We are developing a transformative paradigm for new antiracism interventions for primary care settings that integrate mental and physical health care. The paradigm is the first of its kind to integrate community-based participatory research and systems science, within an established model of early phase translation to rigorously define new antiracism interventions. This protocol will use a novel application of systems sciences by combining the qualitative systems sciences methods (group model building; GMB) with quantitative methods (simulation modeling) to develop a comprehensive and community-engaged view of both the drivers of racism and the potential impact of antiracism interventions. Community participants from two integrated primary health care systems will engage in group GMB workshops with researchers to 1) Describe and map the complex dynamic systems driving racism in health care practices, 2) Identify leverage points for disruptive antiracism interventions, policies and practices, and 3) Review and prioritize a list of possible intervention strategies. Advisory committees will provide feedback on the design of GMB procedures, screen potential intervention components for impact, feasibility, and acceptability, and identify gaps for further exploration. Simulation models will be generated based on contextual factors and provider/patient characteristics. Using Item Response Theory, we will initiate the process of developing core measures for assessing the effectiveness of interventions at the organizational-systems and provider levels to be tested under a variety of conditions. While we focus on Black/African Americans, we hope that the resulting transformative paradigm can be applied to improve health equity among other marginalized groups.","author":"Sylvie Naar","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"41e1fc1937a0bccd2119e2a67f911f239be974dcd7720645a69a69998ff89ced","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
