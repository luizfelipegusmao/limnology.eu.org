{"title":"An Alternative Method to Synthesize N,2,3-Trimethyl-2H-indazol-6-amine as a Key Component in the Preparation of Pazopanib","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1689/v1","date":1721628379000,"content":"Due to its application as an anti-cancer drug, pazopanib (1) has attracted the interest of many researchers and several studies on pazopanib synthesis have been reported over the years. This paper provides a novel route for synthesizing N,2,3-trimethyl-2H-indazol-6-amine (5) which is a crucial building block in the synthesis of pazopanib from 3-methyl-6-nitro-1H-indazole (6). By alternating between the reduction and two methylation steps compound 5 was obtained in comparable yield (55.0%) to what has been reported (54%). Noteworthy, the last step of N2-methylation also yielded N,N,2,3-tetramethyl-2H-indazol-6-amine (5â€™) as a new compound ever reported. Furthermore, the data presented in this paper can serve as instrumental for future research aimed at further refining the synthesis process of pazopanib.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dbc67c0c25dd56007c28e4bff23cd1efc66de08cb77bf72c86f6171a81dbad77","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
