{"title":"Qualified kidney injury biomarkers demonstrate value during early clinical drug development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/2/206/7712951?rss=1","date":1720742400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Drug-induced kidney injury (DIKI) is of significant concern, both during drug development and in clinical practice. We report a patient-centric approach for clinical implementation of the FDA-qualified kidney safety biomarker panel, highlighting Phase 1 and 2 trials for candidate therapeutics in Pfizer’s portfolio (PFE-1 and PFE-2, respectively) that induced kidney tubular injury in rat toxicity studies. Clusterin (CLU), cystatin-C (CysC), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), <span>N</span>-acetyl-beta-<span>d</span>-glucosaminidase (NAG), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and osteopontin (OPN) were measured in urine samples from (i) Phase 1 healthy volunteers (HVs; <span>n</span> = 12) dosed with PFE-1, (ii) Phase 2 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (<span>n</span> = 266) dosed with PFE-2, (iii) lupus patients on standard-of-care therapies (<span>n</span> = 121), and (iv) healthy volunteers (<span>n</span> = 60). The FDA-defined composite measure (CM), calculated as the geometric mean response across the 6 biomarkers, was increased ∼30% in HVs administered 100 mg PFE-1 relative to placebo, providing evidence of DIKI. In contrast, the CM for RA patients dosed with PFE-2 was comparable to placebo controls, helping to de-risk the concern for DIKI at clinically relevant doses. Comparing individual biomarker concentrations across disease states revealed that CLU, KIM-1, NAG, NGAL, and OPN are elevated in the urine of RA and lupus patients (those without severe active proliferative lupus nephritis) relative to HVs. Overall, these case studies demonstrate the value of using the FDA-qualified kidney biomarker panel to guide risk assessment, dose selection, and clinical decision making for novel therapeutics, both in HVs and patient populations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"9a4d244316162b1258a2275acca98a1f66c1a7eea08b22237efdcc4747a9d621","category":"Environment"}
