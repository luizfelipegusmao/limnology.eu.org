{"title":"PSXIII-1 Sensory additives improved the recovery of commercially marketed and transported unweaned dairy beef calves at rearing farm arrival","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/798/7757921?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Calf recovery after arrival at the rearing farm in unweaned calves is impaired by periods of stress, feed restriction and fasting during marketing and transportation. The use of feed additives to enhance intake at arrival could be a strategy to minimize those negative effects. A total of 72 calves (71.4 ± 1.72 kg) gathered in a commercial assembly center and transported 9 h to a rearing farm were used to evaluate the effect of a sensory additive (SA) on performance in calves fed 2 L of milk replacer twice daily at 12.5% and ad libitum concentrate feed. Calves were allocated in 8 pens and distributed in 2 treatments (4 pens/treatment): calves fed a concentrate without SA since the beginning of the study (arrival to the rearing farm after transport) until weaning (CON; n = 36); calves fed a concentrate containing SA (SEN; n = 36) from arrival until weaning. Calf body weight (BW) and pen intake were recorded weekly. On d 21 of the study, calves were partially weaned and only milk replacer was offered in the morning, and on d 28 all calves were completely weaned. The study lasted 35 d. Data were analyzed with a mixed-effects model. Average daily gain was greater (<span>P</span> = 0.04) for SEN calves compared with CON calves (0.68 ± 0.019 kg/d and 0.61 ± 0.019 kg/d, respectively). Final BW of SEN calves (95.5 ± 0.89 kg) tended (<span>P</span> = 0.06) to be greater compared with BW of CON calves (93.1 ± 0.89 kg). Finally, average concentrate intake was greater for SEN calves (0.89 ± 0.023 kg/d) compared with CON calves (0.79 ± 0.023 kg/d). Unweaned dairy beef calves receiving sensory additive improved concentrate intake and growth at farm arrival improving their recovery.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"06e1dfb6f9f5d23b2c43869f7334100acfd7413f9fd8b6e45cb95b88bb1672ab","category":"Environment"}
