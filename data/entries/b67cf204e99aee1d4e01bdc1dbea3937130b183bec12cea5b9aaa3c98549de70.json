{"title":"Determinant Factors of Entrepreneurial Culture in University Students: An Analysis from the Theory of Planned Behavior at a Peruvian University","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1857/v1","date":1727147648000,"content":"This study analyzed the influence of attitude toward innovation and creativity, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and institutional support in the consolidation of an entrepreneurial culture among Peruvian university students, using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the theoretical framework. Data were collected from 948 students through a validated 29-item questionnaire, and the data analysis was conducted using the PLS-SEM method. The results showed that both attitude toward innovation and entrepreneurial self-efficacy have a significant positive impact on entrepreneurial culture, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy acted as a partial mediator in this relationship. However, external resources and institutional support were not significant mediators between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial culture. This study expands the understanding of TPB in the Peruvian context, highlighting the importance of fostering self-efficacy and an innovative attitude in students to strengthen entrepreneurial culture in universities. Educational institutions should consider these key factors when designing programs that promote entrepreneurship.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b67cf204e99aee1d4e01bdc1dbea3937130b183bec12cea5b9aaa3c98549de70","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
