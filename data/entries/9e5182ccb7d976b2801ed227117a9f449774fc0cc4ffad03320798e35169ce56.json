{"title":"Evaluation and Modeling the Performance of Rice Husk Gasifier Cook Stove for Household Energy Use","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0138/v2","date":1717665546000,"content":"This research paper aims to evaluate and model the performance of rice husk gasifier cook stoves for household energy use, a byproduct of rice milling. The study aims to address environmental issues and promote the use of rice husk as a renewable energy source and pest repellent in stoves. The study compared insulated and non-insulated gasifier stoves using rice husk gasification. The study compared the start-up time of insulated and non-insulated gasifier stoves, where the insulated stove showed a lower start-up time, but there was no significant difference at a 5% probability level. The temperature change also was not significant, as heat transfer and temperature change started when the husk was ignited. The burner stoves had different size and volume. The maximum operated or flame temperature was 1,190.30oC at room or minimum temperature of 27.33 oC, whereas the average temperature was 758.916oC for the non-insulated type of gasifier stove. The insulated gasifier stove also observed maximum and average temperatures of 518.30 oC and 289.014oC respectively at the same room temperature. The operating time of stoves directly influences the fuel consumption rate, specific gasification rate, and combustion zone rate of stoves. The fuel consumption rate has a significant effect on the type of gasifier stove, with the maximum rates being 3.820 and 2.099 kg/hr. The time to consume rice husks to gasify them depends on the density of the rice husk, reactor volume, and fuel consumption rate. The average specific gasification rate for insulated and non-insulated stoves is 106.45 and 120.63 kg/m2h, respectively. The fuel or rice husk holding capacity of each type of stove is significant at a 5% level, with the amount of rice husk and biochar produced being 1.18kg and 0.27kg for insulated stoves, and 2.511kg and 0.688kg for non-insulated stoves, respectively. The performance of gasifier stoves varies based on the bio char conversion rate, with non-insulated stoves producing a higher bio char mass per rice husk. Multiple regression analysis was used to model the relationship between time elapse with temperature and heat energy. The Squirrel-2020 data logger was used to measure the temperature produced by burning rice husks in the reactor of the stove as well as related generated and losses of heat. A relationship between the heat energy produced and the operating time of gasifier stoves was conducted to estimate the model. The cubic polynomial model was found to be the best predictive model fit for all variables of this study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9e5182ccb7d976b2801ed227117a9f449774fc0cc4ffad03320798e35169ce56","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
