{"title":"Potential Role of APOBEC3 Family Proteins in SARS-CoV-2 Replication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1182/v1","date":1718710258000,"content":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has acquired multiple mutations since its emergence. Analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from infected patients exhibit a bias toward C-to-U mutations, which are suggested to be caused by the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3, A3) cytosine deaminase proteins. However, the role of A3 enzymes in SARS-CoV-2 replication remains unclear. To address this question, we investigated the effect of A3 family proteins on SARS-CoV-2 replication in THP-1 cells lacking A3A to A3G genes. The Wuhan, BA.1, and BA.5 variants had comparable viral replication in parent and A3A-to-A3G-null THP-1-ACE2 cells. On the other hand, the replication and infectivity of these variants were abolished in A3A-to-A3G-null THP-1-ACE2 cells in a series of passage experiments over 20 days. In contrast to previous reports, we observed no evidence for A3-induced SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis in the passage experiments. Furthermore, our analysis of a large number of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes did not reveal conclusive evidence for A3-induced mutagenesis.  Taken together, our studies suggest that A3 family proteins can positively contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication, however this effect is deaminase-independent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"018ad1474b2dd0d80710c2e68050a5014d6297002125e3f265666e0cab66ac57","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
