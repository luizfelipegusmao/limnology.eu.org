{"title":"Hospitalisations Due to Dental Infection&mdash;A Clinical Audit From a Public Hospital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1136/v1","date":1713348117000,"content":"Background: The aim of this audit is to evaluate the characteristics of dental infections requiring hospitalisations, which may help improve preventative and management policies. \nMethods: This study retrospectively evaluated the patients’ records admitted to a public hospital due to dental infections between 2018 and 2019. \nResults: A total of 102 patients, mostly in thirties with equal gender distribution were admitted with dental infections, presenting with pain (100%), swelling (99%), Trismus (40.2%), dysphagia (27.4%), fever (21%) &gt;37°C, Tachycardia (24.75%) and Tachypnoea (9.3%). Most patients presented (68%) on weekends, outside regular working hours and public holidays. 54 (52.5%) patients had taken prior antibiotics. Dental Caries, smoking, mental health issues and illicit drug use were featured strongly. The majority of patients (56.4%) underwent treatment under local anaesthesia. The total length of hospital stay was 271 days (mean 2.66). Augmentin was the most prescribed antibiotics. Complications were reported in 8.8% patients, primarily related to airway compromise.\nConclusion: \nDental infections leading to hospitalizations continue to be a burden on the healthcare system. A notable finding was the presentations primarily on weekends, outside regular hours and public holidays and the majority requiring dental intervention under local anaesthesia. Provision of on call emergency dental services may reduce length of hospital stay and admissions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f039885b41162642641e0a641d61dfc22b876875eeb333515c673ba7336957f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
