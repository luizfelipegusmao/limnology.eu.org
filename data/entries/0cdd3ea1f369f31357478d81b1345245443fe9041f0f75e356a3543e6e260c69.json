{"title":"Research on the Application of Deep Neural Networks in Personalized Product Recommendations on E-Commerce Platforms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1167/v1","date":1728974910000,"content":"Due to the influence of factors such as user consumption habits and manufacturer service quality, e-commerce platforms cannot push personalized product information to any consumer. This project studies the push of product information on e-commerce platforms based on deep neural networks. It mines the data of users' online shopping behaviors such as browsing, collecting, and adding to cart on e-commerce platforms, and pre-processes the mined user behavior data by cleaning, integrating, and normalizing them. It builds a deep bidirectional Transformer model to learn users' historical behavior data and predict the most probable products that meet users' behavior needs, thereby realizing the automatic push of product information on e-commerce platforms. The experimental results show that the F1 value of the push result of product information on e-commerce platforms under the method designed by this algorithm is 0.97, which confirms the effectiveness and superiority of this method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0cdd3ea1f369f31357478d81b1345245443fe9041f0f75e356a3543e6e260c69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
