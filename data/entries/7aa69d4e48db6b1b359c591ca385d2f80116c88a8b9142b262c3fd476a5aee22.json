Bat occupancy and community drivers in heterogeneous urban landscapes","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11252-024-01615-0","date":1738368000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Bats are one of the most diverse mammal groups, and one of the common inhabitants of urban environments globally, dealing with artificial lightning, ambient noise, and habitat loss. However, there is usually less bat diversity in urban landscapes than in natural habitats, although cities can offer adequate conditions too. To test which were the main drivers of bat occupancy and communities’ assemblage in an urban environment, an acoustic sampling was carried out in 2019 in Salamanca (Western Iberia) during 3 months across 63 recording stations located in three different urban habitats: a riparian forest embedded in the city, a monumental historic area, and modern external neighborhoods. Light intensity, ambient noise, temperature, prey abundance, distance to water and tree cover values were recorded to study their effect on bat activity and bat communities. The results showed a diverse bat assemblage (8 ultrasound-confirmed species). The differences among the three communities were mainly explained by the dominance of more generalist species (<em>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</em>, <em>Pipistrellus pygmaeus</em>, <em>Tadarida teniotis</em> and <em>Eptesicus serotinus</em>) more than the studied covariables or species richness, although the river area showed the greatest diversity. Bat occupancy was negatively affected by artificial light and distance to water, while the temperature, tree cover and the relative abundance of insects had a positive effect.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"7aa69d4e48db6b1b359c591ca385d2f80116c88a8b9142b262c3fd476a5aee22","category":"Environment"}
