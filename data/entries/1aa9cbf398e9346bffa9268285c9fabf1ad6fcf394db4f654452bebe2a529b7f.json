{"title":"Delayed Traumatic Rupture of the Spleen in a Patient with Mantle Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma after in-hospital fall: a fatal case","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1389/v1","date":1716287346000,"content":"Splenic rupture and hematoma are significant complications that can arise in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Understanding these associations is essential for optimal patient management and patients' enhancing outcomes. Histopathological and immunohistochemistry analyses are crucial in diagnosing NHL and assessing splenic involvement. A judicial autopsy was requested by the Prosecutor's Office for a malpractice claim due to a fall in the hospital. In the Emergency Department, a 72-year-old man fell from the gurney, reporting a wound to his forehead. No other symptoms were reported. A face and brain CT scan showed no abnormalities. Nine days after discharge, the patient presented with abdominal pain. Abdominal CT revealed splenic rupture and hemoperitoneum. The patient underwent open splenectomy, but the patient showed signs of hemodynamic shock and subsequently died. The evidence emerging from the autopsy allowed us to diagnose a Mantle Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with spleen involvement, previously unknown. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to assess splenic rupture's diagnosis and time estimation. The findings strongly suggest that the splenic rupture was associated with the patient's fall and the pre-existing malignancy. This case highlights the importance of considering underlying hematological malignancies when investigating delayed splenic rupture. Immunohistochemical study of spleen samples allowed the assessment of the timing of splenic hematoma and rupture, leading to establishing a causal relationship with trauma.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1aa9cbf398e9346bffa9268285c9fabf1ad6fcf394db4f654452bebe2a529b7f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
