{"title":"Developing a Cyber-Physical Rehabilitation System for Virtual Interaction between Patients and Occupational Therapists","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0934/v1","date":1718703788000,"content":"The integration of robotic devices into healthcare settings for rehabilitation purposes represents a rapidly advancing field with significant benefits for both therapists and patients. However, standalone robot systems face limitations such as inefficient processing of patient data and logistical challenges for patients, such as travel time to rehabilitation centers. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes the integration of cyber-physical systems into rehabilitation robotics. Cyber-physical systems leverage network connectivity and real-time data processing to enhance the efficiency and convenience of robot-based rehabilitation. By seamlessly integrating sensors, actuators, and computational algorithms, cyber-physical rehabilitation systems empower therapists to more effectively treat patients by providing actionable insights derived from comprehensive data analysis. This enables therapists to tailor treatment plans precisely to each patientâ€™s unique needs, ultimately leading to improved outcomes. Additionally, cyber-physical rehabilitation systems facilitate remote monitoring and intervention, allowing therapists to oversee patient progress and make timely adjustments to treatment protocols without the need for in-person visits. This not only saves patients valuable time and resources but also ensures continuity of care, particularly for individuals residing in remote or underserved areas. Furthermore, cyber-physical rehabilitation systems enable collaborative decision-making by facilitating communication and information sharing among healthcare professionals, further enhancing the quality and efficacy of rehabilitation services. In summary, integrating cyber-physical systems into rehabilitation robotics represents a significant advancement in leveraging technology to optimize patient care and outcomes, promising to revolutionize rehabilitation therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"71502c793cb286e52eb9470c94bff4765f295b8852d9b46d9d49371ea52dbf89","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
