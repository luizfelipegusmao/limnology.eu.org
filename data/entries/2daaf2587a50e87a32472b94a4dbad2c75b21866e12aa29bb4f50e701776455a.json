{"title":"HCC: Evolving Role of Systemic Therapies as a Bridging Treatment to Liver Transplantation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0212/v1","date":1714963925000,"content":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Classically, liver transplantation (LT) can be curable for HCC tumors within the Milan criteria. Bridging strategies to reduce the dropouts from LT waiting lists or/and to downstage patients who are beyond Milan criteria are widely utilized. We conducted a literature-based review to evaluate the role of systemic therapies as a bridging treatment to liver transplantation (LT) in HCC patients. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) can be used as a bridging systemic therapy to LT in patients with contraindication to locoregional liver-directed therapies. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) treatment can be utilized either as a monotherapy or as a combination therapy with Bevacizumab or TKIs prior to LT. Acute rejection post liver transplantation is a concern in the context of ICIs treatment. Thus, a safe ICI washout period before LT and cautious post-LT immunosuppression strategies are required to reduce post-LT rejections and to optimize clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, prospective clinical trials are needed to establish definitive conclusions about the utility of systemic therapy as a bridging modality prior to LT in HCC patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2daaf2587a50e87a32472b94a4dbad2c75b21866e12aa29bb4f50e701776455a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
