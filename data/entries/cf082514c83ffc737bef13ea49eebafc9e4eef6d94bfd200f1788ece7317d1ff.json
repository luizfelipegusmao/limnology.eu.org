SRM is critical for e-commerce platforms to maintain efficient supply chains, optimize supplier interactions, and ensure competitive advantage in a dynamic marketplace. AI technologies offer advanced capabilities such as predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and natural language processing, which revolutionize traditional SRM practices by enhancing decision-making accuracy, mitigating supply chain risks, and fostering personalized supplier relationships. Through semi-structured interviews with 20 e-commerce professionals and industry experts, this study investigates AI's impact on supplier selection, operational efficiencies, and strategic supplier relationships. Findings highlight AI's ability to streamline supplier evaluation processes, improve demand forecasting accuracy, and optimize inventory management strategies. AI also facilitates personalized supplier engagement through sentiment analysis and real-time insights, promoting collaboration and trust. Ethical considerations, including algorithmic bias and data privacy, emerge as significant concerns in AI adoption for SRM. Addressing these challenges is crucial to maintaining stakeholder trust and ensuring responsible AI deployment. Furthermore, technological integration barriers and organizational readiness are identified as critical factors influencing successful AI implementation. Looking forward, the study underscores the potential of AI to drive innovation and competitiveness in e-commerce SRM, emphasizing the importance of ethical AI practices, technological infrastructure investments, and organizational preparedness for sustainable growth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf082514c83ffc737bef13ea49eebafc9e4eef6d94bfd200f1788ece7317d1ff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
