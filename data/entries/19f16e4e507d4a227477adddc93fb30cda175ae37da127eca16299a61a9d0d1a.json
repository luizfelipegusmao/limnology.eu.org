{"title":"Dissecting the causal polymorphism of the Lr67res multipathogen resistance gene","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/13/3877/7645743?rss=1","date":1715731200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Partial resistance to multiple biotrophic fungal pathogens in wheat (<span>Triticum aestivum</span> L.) is conferred by a variant of the <span>Lr67</span> gene, which encodes a hexoseâ€“proton symporter. Two mutations (G144R and V387L) differentiate the resistant and susceptible protein variants (Lr67res and Lr67sus). Lr67res lacks sugar transport capability and was associated with anion transporter-like properties when expressed in <span>Xenopus laevis</span> oocytes. Here, we extended this functional characterization to include yeast and <span>in planta</span> studies. The <span>Lr67res</span> allele, but not <span>Lr67sus</span>, induced sensitivity to ions in yeast (including NaCl, LiCl, and KI), which is consistent with our previous observations that <span>Lr67res</span> expression in oocytes induces novel ion fluxes. We demonstrate that another naturally occurring single amino acid variant in wheat, containing only the Lr67<sup>G144R</sup> mutation, confers rust resistance. Transgenic barley plants expressing the orthologous <span>HvSTP13</span> gene carrying the G144R and V387L mutations were also more resistant to <span>Puccinia hordei</span> infection. NaCl treatment of pot-grown adult wheat plants with the <span>Lr67res</span> allele induced leaf tip necrosis and partial leaf rust resistance. An Lr67res-like function can be introduced into orthologous plant hexose transporters via single amino acid mutation, highlighting the strong possibility of generating disease resistance in other crops, especially with gene editing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"19f16e4e507d4a227477adddc93fb30cda175ae37da127eca16299a61a9d0d1a","category":"Environment"}
