{"title":"A Survey of Artificial Intelligence Applications in Nuclear Power Plants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2287/v1","date":1722241104000,"content":"The different systems in the nuclear power plants (NPP) are critical and complex which requires\na continuous rigorous monitoring for both normal and abnormal conditions. However, due to the\nnonlinearity of the dynamic behavior of these systems, implementation of artificial intelligence\nwithin the NPP components is crucial to enhance the monitoring and the predictability of the key\noperating parameters trend. On the other hand, lessons learned from large nuclear accident\nproves that a remote real-time coordination between the different stakeholders involved in the\nsafety of the nuclear reactor is needed. This remote feature can be implemented in the existing\npower plants by embedding a mobile computing networks within the plant components. This\nnetwork will send early warning and transmit the NPP data on real-time to different authorities\nsuch as the regulatory authority and the decision-making committees, to enhance the\ninterpretability of the nuclear event and deliver a collaborative decision which in return mitigate\nthe risk associated with these events and increase the overall safety of the plant. The integration\nof AI and mobile computing in NPP would be most of interest in countries where nuclear\nreactors data are challenged to reach during an accident. For instance, during the meltdown of\nChernobyl, the Soviet government covered the accident from the news in an attempt to contain\nthe consequences but there was a spread of radioactive contamination to some other Europe\ncountries. Therefore, in the case of such scenario the implementation of mobile computing and\nAI would result in different outcomes as the European countries would be notified through the\nmobile networking and the spread of contamination would be forecasted by the AI algorithms.\nIn this paper, we examine the different modern AI and mobile computing technologies, the\ndifferent potential application, the associated features and challenges, and future work direction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf8c1346da0ad7c60eef1b46a39be7575a667bb41fbd2a4d97a87de1fd54dee9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
