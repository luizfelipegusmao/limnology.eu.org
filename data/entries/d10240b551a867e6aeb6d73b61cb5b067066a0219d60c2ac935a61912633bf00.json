{"title":"A Multi-Scale Graph Attention-Based Transformer for Occluded Person Re-Identification","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0471/v1","date":1723014616000,"content":"The objective of person re-identification (ReID) tasks is to match a specific individual across different times, locations, or camera viewpoints. The prevalent issue of occlusion in real-world scenarios affects image information, rendering the affected features unreliable. The difficulty and core challenge lie in how to effectively discern and extract visual features from human images under various complex conditions, including cluttered backgrounds, diverse postures, and the presence of occlusions. Some works have employed pose estimation or human keypoint detection to construct graph-structured information to counteract the effects of occlusions. However, this approach introduces new noise due to issues such as the invisibility of keypoints. Our proposed module, in contrast, does not require the use of additional feature extractors. Our module employs multi-scale graph attention for the reweighting of feature importance. This allows features to concentrate on areas genuinely pertinent to the re-identification task, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against occlusions. To address these problems, a model that employs multi-scale graph attention to re-weight the importance of features is proposed in this study, significantly enhancing the modelâ€™s robustness against occlusions. Our experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline models, the method proposed herein achieves a notable improvement in mAP on occluded data sets, with increases of 0.5%, 31.5%, and 12.3% in mAP scores.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d10240b551a867e6aeb6d73b61cb5b067066a0219d60c2ac935a61912633bf00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
