{"title":"Influence of Oviductal and Uterine Fluid Supplementation on the In Vitro Development and Quality of Sheep Cloned Embryos","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1507/v1","date":1724222270000,"content":"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has great potential in the replication of high commercial value animals, threatened wild species for conservation purposes, and transgenic animals for biomedical purposes. However, SCNT has a low success rate, due to intrinsic factors of the technique itself, which will lead to low rates of embryonic development and epigenetic alterations in the cloned embryos. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of OF-UF on the intracellular concentration of ROS, GSH, and the development of Ovis aries cloned and parthenogenetic embryos. The results did not show a beneficial effect on the development of parthenogenetic and cloned embryos at concentrations of 0.5% OF-UF. Furthermore, at 1% OF-UF, an adverse effect was observed in cloned embryos at the blastocyst stage and 2% OF and UF in parthenogenetic embryos in the first divisions. A decrease in ROS and GSH levels was observed in the parthenogenetic blastocysts treated with 1% OF-UF, but not in the clones, in which a higher concentration of GSH and a similar concentration of ROS was observed. No effect was observed of OF-UF on embryonic development and redox balance on sheep clone embryos by Handmade Cloning.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16d761caebf78dd27c874414c6f9d03f03f48e70024f4ffb6b1333b56889eb83","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
