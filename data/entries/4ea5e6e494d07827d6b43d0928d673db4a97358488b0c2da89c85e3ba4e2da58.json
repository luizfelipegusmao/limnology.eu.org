While numerical models have been extensively developed, deep learning techniques have recently shown promise in improving atmospheric forecasting accuracy. In this study, convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and convolutional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU) neural networks were applied to build for short-term global-scale forecasting model of atmospheric temperature and wind in the `near space based on the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset from 2010-2022. The model results showed that the ConvGRU model outperforms the ConvLSTM model in the short-term forecast results. The ConvGRU model achieved a root mean square error in the first three hours of approximately 1.8 K for temperature predictions, and errors of 4.2 m/s and 3.8 m/s for eastward and northward wind predictions, respectively","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ea5e6e494d07827d6b43d0928d673db4a97358488b0c2da89c85e3ba4e2da58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
