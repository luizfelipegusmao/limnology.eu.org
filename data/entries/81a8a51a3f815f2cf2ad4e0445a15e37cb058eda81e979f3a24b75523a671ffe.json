{"title":"Biological Activity of Ziziphus Spina-Christi with Special Reference to Its Antimicrobial Activity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1902/v1","date":1716947771000,"content":"Ziziphus spina-christi commonly known as Christâ€™s thorn Jujube from the family (Rhamnaceae). The leaves are applied as Bandaged for wounds and are helpful in liver diseases, asthma and fever, it was found to have antimicrobial activity against different organisms. The aim of this study is to assess anti-microbial activity of leaves extract of Z. spina-christi and compare biological activity of the plant. spina-christi dry leave was extracted with 95% methanol and fractionated with Petroleum ether, Chloroform, Ethyl acetate and aqueous extract. Antimicrobial activity of the plant extract was tested against E. coli, S. para typhi B and C. albicans. Literature of the antimicrobial activity of the plant were collected and analyzed.Antimicrobial activity of Z. spina-christi leaves extracts showed negative result on fungal species C. albicans. Negative results were observed with bacteria Salmonella para typhi B and aqueous extract formed slight inhibition zone with E. coli. Result obtained was in contrast with that reported in the literature this is might be due to the different environmental condition affecting plant material.Z.spina-christi was found to have anti-bacterial effect Further studies are needed to assess its clinical safety and biological effect in vivo inside animals and human.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"81a8a51a3f815f2cf2ad4e0445a15e37cb058eda81e979f3a24b75523a671ffe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
