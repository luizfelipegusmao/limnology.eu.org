{"title":"Exploring Extravasation in Cancer Patients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0696/v1","date":1715587832000,"content":"Extravasation, the unintended leakage of intravenously administered substances, poses significant challenges in cancer treatment, particularly during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This comprehensive review explores the pathophysiology, incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prevention strategies, management approaches, complications, and long-term effects of extravasation in cancer patients. It also outlines future directions and research opportunities, including identifying gaps in current knowledge and proposing areas for further investigation in extravasation prevention and management. Emerging technologies and therapies with the potential to improve extravasation prevention and management in both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are highlighted. Such innovations include advanced vein visualization technologies, smart catheters, targeted drug delivery systems, novel topical treatments, and artificial intelligence-based image analysis. By addressing these aspects, this review not only provides healthcare professionals with  insights to enhance patient safety and optimize clinical practice but also underscores the importance of ongoing research and innovation in improving outcomes for cancer patients experiencing extravasation events.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7e69b7c7a4e1eedc1b44937a4fbce84aa36b89894fcf23685f95b31eb91db39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
