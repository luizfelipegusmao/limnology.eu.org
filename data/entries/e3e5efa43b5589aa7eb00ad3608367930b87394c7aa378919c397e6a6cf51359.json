{"title":"Unlocking the Therapeutic Potential of Oxystelma esculentum: A Phytochemical Treasure Trove with Anticancer and Lactogenic Properties","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1609/v1","date":1726818226000,"content":"This study investigates the phytochemical profile, cytotoxic effects, and lactogenic activity of Oxystelma esculentum, a plant renowned for its traditional medicinal uses. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed a rich array of secondary metabolites, including alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, and tannins, predominantly in polar solvents such as methanol and ethanol. Spectroscopic analysis further identified key functional groups, suggesting significant bioactivity. The cytotoxic potential was evaluated against ovarian (OVCAR3), breast (T47D), and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines, demonstrating a concentration-dependent increase in cytotoxicity, with T47D cells exhibiting the highest sensitivity (IC50 = 42.82 Î¼g/ml). Additionally, the brine shrimp lethality assay indicated low toxicity, while in vivo studies highlighted the extract's ability to enhance milk yield and pup growth in lactating rats, correlating with increased prolactin levels. These findings underscore Oxystelma esculentum as a promising candidate for natural anticancer therapies and lactation enhancement, warranting further exploration of its bioactive compounds and mechanisms of action.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3e5efa43b5589aa7eb00ad3608367930b87394c7aa378919c397e6a6cf51359","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
