{"title":"Continuous Monitoring of the Ecological Quality and Its Response to Land Use/Cover Change in Rapid Urbanizing Areas: A Case Study of Xiong&rsquo;an New Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1963/v1","date":1729778381000,"content":"Rapid urbanization has facilitated socioeconomic development but has also exacerbated land use/cover change (LUCC), significantly impacting ecological environments. Timely, objective, and quantitative assessments of ecological quality changes resulting from LUCC are essential for safeguarding the natural environment and managing land resources. However, limited research has explored the potential interrelationships between the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of LUCC and ecological quality during urbanization. This study focuses on Xiong’an New Area, a region experiencing rapid urbanization, utilizing the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) to monitor ecological quality dynamics from 2017 to 2023. To address the computational challenges associated with large-scale regions, a streamlined RSEI construction method was developed using Landsat imagery and implemented via Google Earth Engine (GEE). A geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis, integrated with Sentinel-2 land use data, was employed to examine the influence of LUCC on ecological quality. The findings reveal the following: (1) Ecological quality in Xiong’an New Area exhibited an overall positive trajectory, with improvements elevating the ecological status to above moderate levels. (2) Urban expansion resulted in a 17% reduction in farmland, primarily converted into construction land, which expanded by approximately 12%. (3) Ecological protection policies have facilitated the conversion of farmland into wetlands and urban green areas, which have emerged as the principal contributors to ecological quality enhancement. (4) A positive correlation was observed between changes in ecological land and ecological quality, while a negative correlation was identified between shifts in construction land and farmland and ecological quality. This research provides valuable scientific insights into ecological conservation and land use management, thereby establishing a foundation for the development of rational land resource planning and sustainable ecological development strategies in the Xiong’an New Area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4321c5e263d0e42ae12af314d740e74857eb1d4aef5be10e2253aebe6f3715e0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
