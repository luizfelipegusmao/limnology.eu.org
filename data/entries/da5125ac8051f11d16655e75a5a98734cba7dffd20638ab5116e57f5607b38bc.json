For this purpose, bulk decay rates of ClO<sub>2</sub> at various water temperatures were determined in laboratory studies. The study revealed ClO<sub>2</sub> bulk decay rates of 0.12639 day<sup>−1</sup>, 0.17848 day<sup>−1</sup>, and 0.19621 day<sup>−1</sup> at temperatures 15°C, 20°C, and 30°C, respectively. The EPANET, a widely employed computer program for simulating the extended-period behavior of hydraulic and water quality in pressurized pipes, was utilized for the analysis of the fate and transport of ClO<sub>2</sub>. A hydraulic model was first developed, calibrated, and verified using distinct data sets. The Hazen-Williams friction coefficient of the PSA was determined to be 120 by the trial-and-error method with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.408 m. A ClO<sub>2</sub> model was then integrated with the calibrated and verified hydraulic model, revealing a wall decay rate of 0.01 m/day and an average MAE of 0.034 mg/l. After calibration and verification of the ClO<sub>2</sub> model, several management scenarios were developed, and ClO<sub>2</sub> dosing rates were determined. The study showed that ClO<sub>2</sub> dosing rates of 0.40 mg/l and 0.45 mg/l should be applied to keep ClO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within certain limits.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nDisinfectants must maintain a sufficient residual in water distribution systems.\nChlorine dioxide requires less contact time and is not affected by pH fluctuations.\nModeling serves as a decision-making tool for the management of disinfectants.\nBulk and wall decay rates of chlorine dioxide are crucial for management strategies.\nChlorine dioxide is a good alternative as a disinfectant in such systems.\n</p>","author":"I.
