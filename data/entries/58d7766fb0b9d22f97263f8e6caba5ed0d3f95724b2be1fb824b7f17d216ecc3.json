{"title":"An $E_8 \\otimes E_8$ Unification of the Standard Model with Pre-Gravitation, on an Exceptional Lie algebra - Valued  Space","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1394/v1","date":1716288741000,"content":"ct (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\\\) \n\\abstract{We propose an $E_8 \\otimes E_8$ unification of the standard model with pre-gravitation, on an exceptional Lie algebra-valued space . Each of the $E_8$ has in its branching an $SU(3)$ for space-time and an $SU(3)$ for three fermion generations. The first $E_8$ further branches to the standard model $SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y$ and describes the gauge bosons, Higgs and the left chiral fermions of the standard model. The second $E_8$ further branches into a right-handed counterpart (pre-gravitation) $SU(3)_{grav}\\otimes SU(2)_R \\otimes U(1)_g$ of the standard model, and describes right chiral fermions, a Higgs, and twelve gauge bosons associated with pre-gravitation, from which general relativity is emergent.   We account for  208 out of the 496 degrees of freedom of $E_8 \\otimes E_8$ and propose an interpretation for the remaining 288, motivated by the trace dynamics Lagrangian of our theory. We explain how the two copies of $SU(3)_{spacetime}$ together give rise to a 6D spacetime with signature $(3,3)$ which upon symmetry breaking gives rise to our 4D spacetime and to a second 4D anti-spacetime with flipped signature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"58d7766fb0b9d22f97263f8e6caba5ed0d3f95724b2be1fb824b7f17d216ecc3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
