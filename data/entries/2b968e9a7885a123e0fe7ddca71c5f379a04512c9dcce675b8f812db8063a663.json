{"title":"A Duality Principle and Related Convex Dual Approximate Formulation Applied to a Non-Linear Plate Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0460/v1","date":1725533024000,"content":"This article develops a duality principle applicable to originally non-convex primal variational formulations. More specifically, as a first application, we establish a convex dual approximate variational formulation for a non-linear Kirchhoff-Love plate model. The results are obtained through basic tools of functional analysis, calculus of variations, duality and optimization theory in infinite dimensional spaces. We emphasize such a final convex dual approximate  formulation obtained may be applied to a large class of similar models in the calculus of variations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b968e9a7885a123e0fe7ddca71c5f379a04512c9dcce675b8f812db8063a663","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
