{"title":"Leptospirosis in the Intensive Care Unit in Mayotte, Indian Ocean, Cross-Sectional Study 2009&ndash;2017 and Comparison to the Other Tropical French Overseas Territories and Mainland France","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1843/v1","date":1716947344000,"content":"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease, most common in tropical and rural settings. It's a public health problem in most of the French tropical overseas territories. The primary objective of this study was to describe severe forms of leptospirosis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on Mayotte, a French island in the Indian Ocean. The secondary objective was to compare the characteristics of these patients with those admitted to the ICU in other French tropical territories and in mainland France. \nWe conducted a retrospective study among adult patients admitted to the ICU of Mayotte hospital between 2009 and 2017. The diagnosis mainly relied on a positive PCR in blood or urine samples. The results were compared to the similar and available studies carried out in mainland France and in the other French tropical overseas territories.\nOn the study period, 55 patients were admitted in the ICU for leptospirosis (18% of the leptospirosis admitted in the hospital). Among them, 45 (82%) were male and the median age was 44 years (25-75 IQR: 33-55). The median time between first symptoms and ICU admission was 3.5 days (2-5). The median duration for antibiotic treatment, hospital stay, and ICU stay were 7 days (7-8), 9 days (6-13) and 5 days (3-9) respectively. The main acute organ impairments were acute renal failure (87%), followed by circulatory failure (58%), acute liver failure (45%) and neurological failure (22%). The most frequently used supportive cares were: vaso-active drugs (56%) and renal replacement (56%), and mechanical ventilation (27%). The case-fatality rate was low (5%). Genotype identification could be performed on 19 patientsâ€™ isolates. The strain L. borgpetersenii serogroup Mini cgMLST CG78 was predominant (n=14), followed by L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes cgMLST  CG 81 (n=4). No L. interrogans serogroup Icterohemorrhagiae was identified.\nWe publish here the first series of severe patients admitted in the ICU in Mayotte, a French island with a high incidence rate of leptospirosis but with original strain specificities. Despite very severe clinical pictures, mortality remains rather low.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"66f4fad9738c8284a3345960341dba382d989030a3c9f202ce0a9f102dc8f59b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
