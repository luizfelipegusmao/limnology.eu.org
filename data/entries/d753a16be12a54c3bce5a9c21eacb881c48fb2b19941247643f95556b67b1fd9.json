{"title":"Bat cellular immunity varies by year and dietary habit amidst land conversion","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coad102/7590390?rss=1","date":1706313600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Monitoring the health of wildlife populations is essential in the face of increased agricultural expansion and forest fragmentation. Loss of habitat and habitat degradation can negatively affect an animal’s physiological state, possibly resulting in immunosuppression and increased morbidity or mortality. We sought to determine how land conversion may differentially impact cellular immunity and infection risk in Neotropical bats species regularly infected with bloodborne pathogens, and to evaluate how effects may vary over time and by dietary habit. We studied common vampire bats (<span>Desmodus rotundus</span>), northern yellow-shouldered bats (<span>Sturnira parvidens</span>) and Mesoamerican mustached bats (<span>Pteronotus mesoamericanus</span>), representing the dietary habits of sanguivory, frugivory and insectivory respectively, in northern Belize. We compared estimated total white blood cell count, leukocyte differentials, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and infection status with two bloodborne bacterial pathogens (<span>Bartonella</span> spp. and hemoplasmas) of 118 bats captured in a broadleaf, secondary forest over three years (2017–2019). During this period, tree cover decreased by 14.5% while rangeland expanded by 14.3%, indicating increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. We found evidence for bat species-specific responses of cellular immunity between years, with neutrophil counts significantly decreasing in <span>S. parvidens</span> from 2017 to 2018, but marginally increasing in <span>D. rotundus</span>. However, the odds of infection with <span>Bartonella</span> spp. and hemoplasmas between 2017 and 2019 did not differ between bat species, contrary to our prediction that pathogen prevalence may increase with land conversion. We conclude that each bat species invested differently in cellular immunity in ways that changed over years of increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. We recommend further research on the interactions between land conversion, immunity and infection across dietary habits of Neotropical bats for informed management and conservation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"d753a16be12a54c3bce5a9c21eacb881c48fb2b19941247643f95556b67b1fd9","category":"Environment"}
