{"title":"Vibrio cholerae Gut Colonization of Zebrafish Larvae Induces Differential Behavior Responses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1167/v1","date":1723807893000,"content":"Cholera is a diarrheal disease prevalent in populations without access to clean water. Cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae, which colonizes the upper small intestine in humans once ingested. A growing number of studies suggests the gut microbiome composition modulates animal behavior. Zebrafish are an established cholera model that can maintain a complex, mature gut microbiome during infection. Larval zebrafish, which have immature gut microbiomes, provide the advantage of high-throughput analyses for established behavioral models. We identified the effects of V. cholerae O1 El Tor C6706 colonization at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) on larval zebrafish behavior by tracking startle responses at 10 dpf. We also characterized the larval gut microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing. V. cholerae-infected or uninfected control groups were exposed to either an alternating light/dark stimuli or a single-tap stimulus, and average distance and velocity were tracked. While there was no significant difference in the light/dark trial, we report a significant decrease in distance moved for C6706-colonized larvae during the single-tap trial. This suggests that early V. cholerae colonization of the larval gut microbiome has a dampening effect on sensorimotor function, supporting the idea of a link between the gut microbiome and behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4867882de9acc53108dc6399b6538bc1c7e5170d4a931b1f6e42b3126b8f409","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
