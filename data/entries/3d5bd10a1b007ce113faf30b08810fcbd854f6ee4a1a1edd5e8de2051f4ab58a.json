The field experiment was carried out at Robit Bata Kebele in the Bahir Dar Zuria district of Amhara region, Ethiopia. Each 9-m2 plot in the treatments was arranged in a 4x2 factorial configuration in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Morphological data were collected from 10 randomly selected plants grown in the middle rows of each plot. All recorded datasets were subjected to a general linear model procedure of SAS (9.0) at a significance level of alpha","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d5bd10a1b007ce113faf30b08810fcbd854f6ee4a1a1edd5e8de2051f4ab58a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
