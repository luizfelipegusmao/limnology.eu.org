Planktonic foraminifers in the Alkun Formation were studied for the first time. The available results made it possible to reveal the composition and structure of nannofossil and planktonic foraminiferal assemblages from the Alkun sediments in Ciscaucasia, to refine their stratigraphic and correlation potential and to recognize bionomic conditions of the Alkun basin in the studied area. As a result of the nannoplankton study the Cyclicargolithus floridanus Beds were recognized in the Alkun Formation and, taking into account the occurrence of the zonal species <em>Triquetrorhabdulus carinatus</em> along with <em>Tr. milowii</em>, they are correlated with the upper (Miocene) part of the Aquitanian Zone NN1. Planktonic foraminiferal data permitted to recognize the Streptochilus pristinum Beds.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"3b022c6462b615ac6f97aa4a630198e1411a21b90e7e1a0e2bc312330aa38a44","category":"Environment"}
