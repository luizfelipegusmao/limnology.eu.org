{"title":"Altered oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers concentrations in pregnant individuals exposed to oil and gas sites in Northeastern British Columbia","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/201/1/73/7696324?rss=1","date":1718755200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Northeastern British Columbia is a region of prolific unconventional oil and gas (UOG) activity. UOG activity can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can elevate oxidative stress and disrupt antioxidant activity in exposed pregnant individuals, potentially increasing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study measured biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant activity in pooled urine samples of 85 pregnant individuals living in Northeastern British Columbia, to analyze associations between indoor air VOCs, oil and gas well density and proximity metrics, and biomarker concentrations. Concentrations of catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase, total antioxidant capacity, 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (aMT6s), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2â€²-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and 8-isoprostane were measured using assay kits. Associations between exposure metrics and biomarker concentrations were determined using multiple linear regression models adjusted for biomarker-specific covariables. UOG proximity was associated with decreased SOD and 8-OHdG. Decreased 8-OHdG was associated with increased proximity to all wells. Decreased aMT6s were observed with increased indoor air hexanal concentrations. MDA was negatively associated with indoor air 1,4-dioxane concentrations. No statistically significant associations were found between other biomarkers and exposure metrics. Although some associations linked oil and gas activity to altered oxidative stress and antioxidant activity, the possibility of chance findings due to the large number of tests cannot be discounted. This study shows that living near UOG wells may alter oxidative stress and antioxidant activity in pregnant individuals. More research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms and to what degree UOG activity affects oxidative stress and antioxidant activity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicological Sciences Current Issue","siteHash":"9a1c78de8c6d4dbe6bf7afd8036a773f2a2df7314f7a3b562b04af837f4a2cf1","entryHash":"e5c7b593b143153eb66cf165e2b430f7375dfd59a114213ee85557fec78c1c22","category":"Environment"}
