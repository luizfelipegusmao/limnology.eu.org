{"title":"Understanding Teacher Readiness for Online Teaching and Learning: A Study of Cambodian Higher Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0782/v1","date":1728612431000,"content":"This study examines Cambodian higher education teachers' readiness for online teaching and learning (OTL) using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The framework centers around three key dimensions: teachers' self-efficacy in technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK), their perceived online teaching presence, and the institutional support they receive. A quantitative survey was administered to 140 teachers at the university level. Teachers' online teaching experience positively influenced their TPACK self-efficacy. Online teaching experience also had a significant positive impact on teachers perceived online teaching presences. Furthermore, teachers' perceptions of institutional support were positively associated with their online teaching experience. These results highlight the critical role of teachers' online teaching experience in shaping their readiness for OTL. The findings suggest that targeted professional development programs and institutional support mechanisms can effectively enhance teachers' self-efficacy, online teaching presence, and perceptions of institutional support in Cambodian higher education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a4d915614a6ff17b7acfa7f13884c8cff5c4293fc9127a0865ee239280d97e34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
