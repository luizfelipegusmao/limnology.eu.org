{"title":"Light signaling in plantsâ€”a selective history","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/213/7618129?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In addition to providing the radiant energy that drives photosynthesis, sunlight carries signals that enable plants to grow, develop and adapt optimally to the prevailing environment. Here we trace the path of research that has led to our current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the plant's capacity to perceive and transduce these signals into appropriate growth and developmental responses. Because a fully comprehensive review was not possible, we have restricted our coverage to the phytochrome and cryptochrome classes of photosensory receptors, while recognizing that the phototropin and UV classes also contribute importantly to the full scope of light-signal monitoring by the plant.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"95de095a1af47d1674562f64d2ed6e6d45b145331074e53dbeaddbcb922491b2","category":"Environment"}
