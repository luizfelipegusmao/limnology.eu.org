{"title":"Discovery of Natural Products to SARS-CoV-2 with Comparative Molecular Docking and Moderate Cell Proliferation Inhibition in vitro","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1884/v1","date":1711965246000,"content":"Based on screening in computational biology and biological in vitro assays, five natural products isolated from extracts of the herbal medicine toad skin, such as cinobufagin (CBFi), bufalin (BFi), arenobufagin (ABFi), telocinobufagin (TBFi), bufotalin (BFTi), were subjected to molecular docking calculations with the use of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB 6LU7 and 7BTF) and top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes were obtained. The results showed that the binding energy of ABFi to the 3CL protein was -17.044kcal/mol, which was higher than CBFi and TBFi. However, the binding energy of ABFi to the RdRp protease was -23.250 kcal/mol, which was much lower than that of CBFi and TBFi, EVEN lower than that of ABFi to the 3CL protein. ABFi also has polar interactions with amino acids such as Glu811, Ser814, Ser681 and Thr680 of RdRp enzyme. The results revealed that ABFi had a moderate inhibitory effect on the cell proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with an inhibition rate of 61.12%, even weaker than Remdesivir. This new discovery provides us with new ideas for in-depth studies on the development of natural products with this class of structural generalizations as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and provides an experimental basis for the next step of mechanistic studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9473ca29f165a44919a0531348d19477b86252c96eefc887b4b096b2ce5daf98","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
