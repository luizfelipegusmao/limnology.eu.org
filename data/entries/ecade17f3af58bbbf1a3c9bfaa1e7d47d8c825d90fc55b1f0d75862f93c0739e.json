{"title":"Indoor Air Quality Management in Dubai: Assessing the Efficacy of Air Purifiers, Photocatalysts, and Window Ventilation in Reducing HCHO","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2489/v1","date":1722409286000,"content":"This study investigates the characteristics of formaldehyde (HCHO) concentration and its reduction in newly constructed apartment buildings in Dubai. It addresses the significant health risks of high HCHO levels due to poor ventilation and extensive use of VOC-emitting materials. The research explores the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, including air purifiers, photocatalyst applications, and window ventilation, in the living room, master bedroom (MBR), Room 1, and Room 2. HCHO concentrations were measured under different conditions: sealed windows, operation of an air purifier with a VOCs filter, and the application of a photocatalyst. The study followed a quantitative approach, recording real-time HCHO levels over 24 hours. Results indicated that sealing windows led to HCHO concentrations surpassing the domestic standard of 0.1 ppm, with the MBR recording the highest concentration at 0.73 ppm. The air purifier showed minimal impact within the first 8 hours but achieved an 18% reduction after 24 hours of operation. Applying a photocatalyst to room surfaces resulted in a 50% reduction in HCHO levels. Ventilation through window openings significantly improved air exchange rates, with the air exchange per hour (ACH) increasing proportionally with window opening size. Smaller rooms with larger window-to-volume ratios, such as Room 1 and Room 2, maintained HCHO concentrations below the WHO standard of 0.1 ppm with partial window openings. The study concludes that window ventilation is the most effective strategy for reducing HCHO concentrations, highlighting the importance of integrating comprehensive ventilation designs in modern residential buildings to ensure healthier indoor environments in Dubai.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecade17f3af58bbbf1a3c9bfaa1e7d47d8c825d90fc55b1f0d75862f93c0739e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
