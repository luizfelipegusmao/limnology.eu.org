{"title":"Kullback’s Minimization of Information Discrimination as the Action Principle for Biological Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0597/v1","date":1715253890000,"content":"The identification of an action principle for directing basic system energy exchanges can be used in a general framework for the study of dynamics in systems. The application of such action principles using Lagrangian procedures has become a very powerful methodology for the analysis of complicated problems in modern physics. This form of analytics has recently been considered as the mapping of the system state information in the context of system constraints. The process of translating perceived information into adaptive responses is considered to be the driving action dynamic for the living system. Reconciliation processes that provide for a minimization of the divergence of this information signature from a state of system stability are preferred. Such a state is naturally that of maximal entropy in the context of the operational constraints of the open living system. A mathematical expression incorporating inferential information entropy processing into biologic replicator dynamics describes the mechanics of the perception-action adaptive processes of living systems. From this framework, Kullback’s Principle of Minimum Information Discrimination is identified as the innate axiomatic action principle for guiding the dynamics of biological systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8ce26f437562959bff271bc372920b3cdde7b4ab82c8c24477b88eae725056d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
