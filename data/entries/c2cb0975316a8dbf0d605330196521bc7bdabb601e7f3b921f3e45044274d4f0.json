{"title":"Spectroscopic Study of a Novel Binaphthyl Amine Fluorescent Probe for Chiral Recognition of DL-Lysine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1004/v2","date":1716285219000,"content":"Lysine plays a crucial role in promoting development, enhancing immune function, and improving the function of central nervous system tissues. The two configurational isomers of amino acids have significantly different effects. Currently, methods for chiral recognition of lysine all have drawbacks such as expensive equipment and complicated detection processes, whereas fluorescence analysis boasts high sensitivity, strong selectivity, and simple operation. In this study, we synthesized four novel Binaphthyl-Amine (BINAM)-based fluorescent probes capable of specifically identifying the L-configuration of lysine among the twenty amino acids constituting human proteins. The enantiomeric fluorescence enhancement ratio (ef or ΔIL/ΔID) reached up to 15.29, demonstrating high enantioselectivity. We also evaluated the probe's recognition ability under different pH, reaction times, and metal ion conditions, as well as the Limit of Detection of the probe. Our findings indicate that this probe is a highly stable tool for detecting chiral lysine.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2cb0975316a8dbf0d605330196521bc7bdabb601e7f3b921f3e45044274d4f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
