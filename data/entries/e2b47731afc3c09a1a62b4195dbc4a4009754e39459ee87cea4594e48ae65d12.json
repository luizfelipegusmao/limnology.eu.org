The focus of this study is the effect of different additive amount Liquor on the flavor of end products.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>In this study, four kinds of Shaoxing Jiafan wine were brewed by changing the amount of ZaoShao Liquor. HS-SPME and GC-MS were used to detect the flavor substances of four kinds of Jiafan wine. The difference of flavor of four kinds of Jiafan wine was evaluated by electronic nose analysis technology, and verified by sensory evaluation. Finally, the reliability of the experimental results was verified through the aroma reconstruction experiment of rice wine.In this study, the differences of flavoring substances under different amounts of ZaoShao Liquor were verified from various angles. The results showed that the flavors of the four kinds of wines were significantly different.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The composition of flavor substances in Shaoxing rice wine varies with the amount of ZaoShao Liquor. This study provided a scientific basis for the improvement of production technology of Shaoxing wine.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
