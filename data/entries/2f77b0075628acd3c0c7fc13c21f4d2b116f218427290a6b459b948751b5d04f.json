{"title":"Leveraging Data Warehousing for Healthcare Delivery &ndash; A case of Outpatient Department","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1899/v1","date":1719439314000,"content":"Mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa remains unacceptably high, and disproportionately affecting economically disadvantaged communities. And healthcare delivery which is considered a major contributor to this is challenged by the limited resources and high service costs, prompting many patients to opt for outpatient department services. This study addresses the need for a data-driven approach to healthcare policy formulation by proposing a model for the implementation of a data warehousing system that integrates outpatients into the national healthcare framework. By leveraging data warehousing, healthcare delivery can be made more efficient through a robust repository that supports decision-making and policy formulation. The research focuses on the outpatient department in resource-scarce settings, proposing a novel multidimensional data model and practical framework implementation. The benefits include improved patient experiences, cost-effective service delivery, and enhanced patient management through electronic health records. Additionally, mobile apps are explored for patient navigation and reminders to enhance treatment adherence. The studyâ€™s results indicate that data warehousing can significantly improve healthcare delivery by consolidating critical data and facilitating better planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation. Ultimately, this approach offers valuable insights for optimizing healthcare systems in resource-constrained environments, enabling data-driven policies, and improving health outcomes across sub-Saharan Africa.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f77b0075628acd3c0c7fc13c21f4d2b116f218427290a6b459b948751b5d04f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
