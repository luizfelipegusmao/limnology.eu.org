{"title":"Current Perspectives on Oxycodone/Naloxone Prolonged Release for Managing Severe Cancer Pain: A Comprehensive Update of Literature","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0150/v1","date":1712036245000,"content":"Severe cancer pain significantly diminishes patients' quality of life, leading to increased reliance on caregivers. Although opioid analgesics are effective, they may induce opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and constipation. While controlled-release oxycodone is a viable option, its prolonged use can lead to opi-oid-induced constipation (OIC). Addressing this, a relative novel formulation - a fixed 2:1 ratio of oxycodone and naloxone in prolonged release - aims to provide analgesia while alleviating OIC. This review critically assesses the evidence on the efficacy, safety, and patient experience of ox-ycodone/naloxone prolonged release in managing severe cancer pain, emphasizing the necessity for a targeted approach in this patient population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12a8f3e95922d052c0a15e137ff32887e4595dcab3425937c5c018a985b791ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
