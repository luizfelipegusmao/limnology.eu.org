This ring acts as a scaffold to recruit other division proteins and guide the synthesis of septal  peptidoglycan, which leads to cell constriction. In its native state, the FtsZ protein from  Escherichia coli (EcFtsZ) exists as a multi-oligomer comprising dimers, trimers, tetramers,  and hexamers in dynamic equilibrium of self-association and dissociation is dependent on  protein concentration. This study employed classical biochemical techniques, including  native PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography, sucrose gradient, and chemical cross-linking  with formaldehyde, to characterize the trimeric state of EcFtsZ. The results of size-exclusion  chromatography demonstrate that the trimer of EcFtsZ has a mass of 131 kDa and an  experimental friction quotient (Rs/Rmin) of 1.9, which is very similar to the theoretical friction  quotient (fn/f1) of 1.8 for a linear trimer. Cross-linking EcFtsZ with formaldehyde resulted in  the occurrence of a polypeptide band of 128 kDa, which was recognized by anti-FtsZ  antibodies. The result of the sedimentation of EcFtsZ cross-linking with formaldehyde  returned a value (Smax/S20,w) equal to 1.9. This experimental value was found to be equal to  the theoretical calculation of the sedimentation quotient (Sn/S1) for a lateral trimer. These  findings indicate that at micromolar concentrations, the EcFtsZ trimer may assume a linear  or lateral structure in the protein. Finally, the protein-protein interaction prediction program  (PEPPI) indicated the potential for EcFtsZ to form two protein-protein contacts in its C-terminal domain, which may be involved in trimer formation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5464b630a558938461451274ed10b8d1e7b99df521daa51b3de0f94982b1977f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
