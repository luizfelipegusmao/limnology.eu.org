{"title":"Remote liver ischemic preconditioning protects against renal ischemia/reperfusion injury via phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in mice","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308977","date":1724076000000,"content":"<p>by Qifeng Wang, Junshen Xiao, Shichao Wei, Xi Yang, Jiaxue Li, Yunxia Zuo, Zhaoyang Hu</p>\r\n\r\nPerioperative acute kidney injury (AKI), which is mainly mediated by renal ischemiaâ€’reperfusion (I/R) injury, is commonly observed in clinical practice. However, effective measures for preventing and treating this perioperative complication are still lacking in the clinic. Thus, we designed this study to examine whether remote liver ischemic preconditioning (RLIPC) has a protective effect on damage caused by renal I/R injury. In a rodent model, 30 mice were divided into five groups to assess the effects of RLIPC and ERK1/2 inhibition on AKI. The groups included the sham-operated (sham), kidney ischemia and reperfusion (CON), remote liver ischemic preconditioning (RLIPC), CON with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (CON+U0126), and RLIPC with U0126 (RLIPC+U0126). RLIPC consisted of 4 liver ischemia cycles before renal ischemia. Renal function and injury were assessed through biochemical assays, histology, cell apoptosis and protein phosphorylation analysis. RLIPC significantly mitigated renal dysfunction, tissue damage, inflammation, and apoptosis caused by I/R, which was associated with ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, ERK1/2 inhibition with U0126 negated the protective effects of RLIPC and exacerbated renal injury. To summarize, we demonstrated that RLIPC has a strong renoprotective effect on kidneys post I/R injury and that this effect may be mediated by phosphorylation of ERK1/2.","author":"Qifeng Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d838d04e2f15abe5b0a225365f1e9775d690db6e97bb8697fdb5eb63980d5a34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
