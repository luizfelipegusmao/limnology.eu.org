{"title":"Influence of temperature on hatching success of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis): Implications for spawning availability of warm habitats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15767?af=R","date":1715920238000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Exploring the effects of water temperature on egg development in skipjack tuna (<i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i>) has substantial implications for evaluations of wild spawning habitats. In the present study, we examined the hatching success and duration as a function of temperature from 21 to 33°C under captive environments. A high hatching rate of over 50% between 23 and 31°C was observed, with the shortest hatching duration at 31°C. Because the egg period is vulnerable to predators, a shortened hatching duration with warming water would be ecologically advantageous for <i>K. pelamis</i>, as its main spawning grounds are located in tropical areas.</p>","author":"Ko Fujioka, \nYoshinori Aoki, \nYuichi Tsuda, \nKei Okamoto, \nHiroyuki Tsuchida, \nAkira Sasaki, \nHidetada Kiyofuji","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"79072630b9823e03296c1a757ac02ac6f3d9b51360e111dd4d5ffdd92c8a2e95","category":"Environment"}
