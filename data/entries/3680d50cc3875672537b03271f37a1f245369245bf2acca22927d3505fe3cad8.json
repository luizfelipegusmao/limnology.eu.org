{"title":"Genetic and epigenetic basis of phytohormonal control of floral transition in plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/14/4180/7624585?rss=1","date":1709856000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The timing of the developmental transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage is critical for angiosperms, and is fine-tuned by the integration of endogenous factors and external environmental cues to ensure successful reproduction. Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to response to diverse environmental or stress signals, and these can be mediated by hormones to coordinate flowering time. Phytohormones such as gibberellin, auxin, cytokinin, jasmonate, abscisic acid, ethylene, and brassinosteroids and the cross-talk among them are critical for the precise regulation of flowering time. Recent studies of the model flowering plant Arabidopsis have revealed that diverse transcription factors and epigenetic regulators play key roles in relation to the phytohormones that regulate floral transition. This review aims to summarize our current knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the phytohormonal control of floral transition in Arabidopsis, offering insights into how these processes are regulated and their implications for plant biology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"3680d50cc3875672537b03271f37a1f245369245bf2acca22927d3505fe3cad8","category":"Environment"}
