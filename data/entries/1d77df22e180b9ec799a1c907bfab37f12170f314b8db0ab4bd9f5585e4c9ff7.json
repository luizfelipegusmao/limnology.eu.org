{"title":"Digital Methodology for Determining the Main Physical Parameters of Apple Fruits","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1949/v1","date":1727190095000,"content":"This paper presents the validation of a numerical method for quantifying the physical quality parameters of apples through a comparative analysis with a traditional measurement method. The numerical method was applied to determine the parameters of batches of Kazakh apples according to standard requirements, using image analysis of apples. Five common varieties of Kazakh apples were selected: Aport Alexander, Ainur, Sinap Almatynski, Nursat and Kazakhski Yubileinyi. The geometric parameters of the apples and the percentage of red in the images were determined. The parameters of the 5 apple varieties were processed and measured both manually and digitally, revealing a close agreement between the obtained values. The developed digital method achieved high accuracy in determining the (diameters (d) and (D) in two perpendicular planes and height (h) of each apple), with maximum relative errors of 2.99% for (d), 3.03%, and 4.12% for the (h), and (D) parameters, respectively. Regression models were developed to determine and predict the mass and volume of apples via the digital method. The best results for the apple weight prediction were obtained for Sinap Almatynski variety by stepwise linear regression, and for the apple volume prediction were obtained for Nursat variety by linear regression. Regression equations for mass, volume and geometric dimensions constitute the basis for the development of a small instrument for automatically sorting apples by commercial variety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1d77df22e180b9ec799a1c907bfab37f12170f314b8db0ab4bd9f5585e4c9ff7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
