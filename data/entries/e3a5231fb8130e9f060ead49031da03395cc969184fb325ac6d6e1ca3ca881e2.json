{"title":"A Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Detection of Skeletal Muscle Troponin I in Serum for Muscle Injury Monitoring at Point-of-Care","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1805/v1","date":1719388733000,"content":"Exercise-induced muscle injury is one of the most common types of sports injuries. Skeletal muscle troponin I (skTnI) serves as an ideal biomarker in assessing such injuries, facilitating timely detection and evaluation. In this study, we develop a fluorescent sandwich lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) combined with a desktop analyzer for rapid detection of skTnI. Through optimizing the reaction system, the assay achieves a satisfying detection performance, reaching a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 ng/mL with a turnaround time of 15 minutes. The proposed de-tection platform offers portability, ease of use, and high sensitivity, which facilitates the moni-toring of exercise-induced muscle injuries at the point of care. This feature is particularly advan-tageous for end-users, enabling timely detection of sports-related injuries and ultimately en-hancing prognosis and sports life.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e3a5231fb8130e9f060ead49031da03395cc969184fb325ac6d6e1ca3ca881e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
