{"title":"Towards Improved Inter-Institution Microscopy Collaboration in the Utah/Idaho/Nevada Region â€“ Progress in the Formation of the Great-Basin Microscopy Society","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.955/7719999?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The Great Basin region, encompassing a diverse array of geological formations and scientific opportunities, is poised to benefit significantly from the establishment of a local affiliate microscopy society. Spearheaded by a collaborative effort between members of the University of Utah NanoFab and Brigham Young University's Electron Microscopy Facility, this organization aims to address the region's specific challenges while leveraging the expertise and resources of local institutions of higher learning. Educational institutions, research, and industry partners, such as the University of Utah, Brigham Young University, Utah State University, Weber State University, Utah Valley University, University of Nevada (Reno), Idaho National Laboratory, Texas Instruments (Utah), Micron (Idaho), and others are among the key players in the region's scientific landscape. Despite their individual strengths in microscopy research and education, a lack of collaboration and resource sharing hinders the full realization of their potential.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c9996533a0d2beabc003c91d37f6473b010602c59e88799462229f35da140d2c","category":"Environment"}
