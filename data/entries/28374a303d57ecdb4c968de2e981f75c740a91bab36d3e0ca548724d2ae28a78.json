{"title":"Prenatal Exposure to Herbicide 2,4‐Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4D) Exacerbates Zika Virus Neurotoxicity In Vitro and In Vivo","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24424?af=R","date":1727439648000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can lead to a set of congenital malformations known as Congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), whose main feature is microcephaly. The geographic distribution of CZS in Brazil during the 2015–2017 outbreak was asymmetrical, with a higher prevalence in the Northeast and Central-West regions of the country, despite the ubiquitous distribution of the vector <i>Aedes aegypti,</i> indicating that environmental factors could influence ZIKV vertical transmission and/or severity. Here we investigate the involvement of the most used agrochemicals in Brazil with CZS. First, we exposed human neuroblastoma SK-N-AS cells to the 15 frequently used agrochemical molecules or derivative metabolites able to cross the blood–brain barrier. We found that a derived metabolite from a widely used herbicide in the Central-West region, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4D), exacerbates ZIKV neurotoxic effects in vitro. We validate this observation by demonstrating vertical transmission leading to microcephaly in the offspring of immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice exposed to water contaminated with 0.025 mg/L of 2,4D. Newborn mice whose dams were exposed to 2,4D and infected with ZIKV presented a smaller brain area and cortical plate size compared to the control. Also, embryos from animals facing the co-insult of ZIKV and 2,4D exposition presented higher Caspase 3 positive cells in the cortex, fewer CTIP2+ neurons and proliferative cells at the ventricular zone, and a higher viral load. This phenotype is followed by placental alterations, such as vessel congestion, and apoptosis in the labyrinth and decidua. We also observed a mild spatial correlation between CZS prevalence and 2,4D use in Brazil's North and Central-West regions, with <i>R</i>\n<sup>2</sup> = 0.4 and 0.46, respectively. Our results suggest that 2,4D exposition facilitates maternal vertical transmission of ZIKV, exacerbating CZS, possibly contributing to the high prevalence of this syndrome in Brazil's Central-West region compared to other regions.</p>","author":"Raissa Rilo Christoff, \nDébora Santos da Silva, \nRafael Ferreira Lima, \nAna Luiza Meneguci Moreira Franco, \nLuiza Mendonça Higa, \nÁtila Duque Rossi, \nCarolina Batista, \nCherley Borba Vieira de Andrade, \nTania Maria Ortiga‐Carvalho, \nLucas Ascari, \nBárbara de Azevedo Abrahim‐Vieira, \nMaria Bellio, \nAmilcar Tanuri, \nFlavia Martinez de Carvalho, \nPatricia Pestana Garcez, \nFlavio Alves Lara","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"28374a303d57ecdb4c968de2e981f75c740a91bab36d3e0ca548724d2ae28a78","category":"Environment"}
