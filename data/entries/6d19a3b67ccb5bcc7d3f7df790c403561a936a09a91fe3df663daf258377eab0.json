{"title":"Dynamics and Forms of Products of Twin, Cousin and Sexy Primes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1002/v1","date":1726142977000,"content":"Prime numbers are the building blocks of number theory, and their properties have intrigued mathematicians for centuries. In this paper, we explore a specific categorization of primes, which we refer to as \"twin primes\", “cousin primes” and \"sexy primes\". We begin by examining the form of prime numbers greater than 7 and analyze their potential to be expressed in terms of $6n + 5$ or $6n + 7$. This investigation leads to the identification of conditions under which prime numbers can form twin, cousin and sexy pairs. We further develop a general framework to characterize the product of all twin (except 15), cousin (except 21) and sexy primes, providing insights into their algebraic structure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d19a3b67ccb5bcc7d3f7df790c403561a936a09a91fe3df663daf258377eab0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
