{"title":"Study of the Physic-Chemical Processes that Occur during Selective Transfer in the Friction Pairs with the Help of Polarization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2405/v1","date":1722329170000,"content":"Based on some experiments, the paper describes with the help of polarization the physic-chemical processes that take place in the contact area of friction pairs, during the selective transfer as a result of the change in the input speed of the lubricant (glycerin), as well as how it influences their wear. Through polarization, the quantitative and qualitative transformations of glycerin are studied during frictional stress with selective transfer, the determination of the properties of the selective solution, and the damage to the metals and alloys of the friction pairs, but also after frictional stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cea109933cfff09fd08157d3735ce520960b22097beed070c588f23d1fa96c81","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
