{"title":"A Full Calibration Approach on a Drone-Borne Platform for HF Antenna Measurements in Smart Grid Energy Facilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1501/v1","date":1719198998000,"content":"Emerging data processing techniques brought back into attention the HF range communication as an interesting alternative to third-party solutions for IoT applications, such as data transmission in distributed energy production facilities. The physical size of HF antennas, often comparable to the surrounding objects, require in-situ radiation measurements. Drone-borne measuring systems are already known as a flexible solution, but mostly restricted to higher frequency ranges. In this work, we propose to use an electrically small, folded dipole as a probe for drone-borne measurements on HF antennas. We also propose a calibration approach for the effects related to the near-field zone, and to the drone body proximity. The impact of ground reflection is also investigated. We show that despite its low, realized gain figure such a probe can provide stable results for near-field measurements, even at low input power levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5cd9cc98c8589855f39f0a2b79a56586f93fa89ee903ced33ecaeafde2bcd992","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
