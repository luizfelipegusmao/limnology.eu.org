Thence, a 16-week sub-chronic toxic experiment was executed with ducks to assess the toxicity of Cd and/or Mo. Our data substantiated that Cd and Mo coexposure evidently reduced GSH-Px, GSH, T-SOD, and CAT activities and elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA concentrations in myocardium. What is more, the study suggested that Cd and Mo united exposure synergistically elevated Fe<sup>2+</sup> content in myocardium and activated AMPK/mTOR axis, then induced ferroptosis by obviously upregulating ACSL4, PTGS2, and TFRC expression levels and downregulating SLC7A11, GPX4, FPN1, FTL1, and FTH1 expression levels. Additionally, Cd and Mo coexposure further caused excessive ferritinophagy by observably increasing autophagosomes, the colocalization of endogenous FTH1 and LC3, ATG5, ATG7, LC3II/LC3I, NCOA4, and FTH1 expression levels. In brief, this study for the first time substantiated that Cd and Mo united exposure synergistically induced ferroptosis and excess ferritinophagy by AMPK/mTOR axis, finally augmenting myocardium injure in ducks, which will offer an additional view on united toxicity between two heavy metals on poultry.</p>","author":"Bingyan Huang, \nGaohui Nie, \nXueyan Dai, \nTing Cui, \nWenjing Pu, \nCaiying Zhang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"09d37d0da2a7101c50f912bc9f2249ba3e7f292384f3d3e19a6633deab4dc634","category":"Environment"}
