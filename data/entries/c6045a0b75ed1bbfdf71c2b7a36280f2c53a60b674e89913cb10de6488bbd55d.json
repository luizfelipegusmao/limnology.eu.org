Rio-kinase 2 (RIOK2) is a ribosome biogenesis factor that has recently been described an important regulator of human blood cell development. Additionally, we have previously identified RIOK2 as a regulator of protein synthesis and a potential target for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, its functional relevance in several organ systems, including normal hematopoiesis, is not well understood. Here, we investigate the consequences of RIOK2 loss on normal hematopoiesis using two different conditional knockout mouse models. Using competitive and non-competitive bone marrow transplantations, we demonstrate that RIOK2 is essential for the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as for the maintenance of fully differentiated blood cells <i>in vivo</i> as well as <i>in vitro</i>. Loss of RIOK2 leads to rapid death in full-body knockout mice as well as mice with RIOK2 loss specific to the hematopoietic system. Taken together, our results indicate that regulation of protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis by RIOK2 is essential for the function of the hematopoietic system.","author":"Jan-Erik Messling","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c6045a0b75ed1bbfdf71c2b7a36280f2c53a60b674e89913cb10de6488bbd55d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
