{"title":"A Comparative Health Disparities Analysis Across Continents : A Comparative Analysis of African and European Countries.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1290/v1","date":1726562088000,"content":"This analysis investigates health outcomes by cause and income group across European and African countries, highlighting significant disparities tied to economic status. Low and lower-middle-income countries in Africa face a greater burden of disease, particularly in acute lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, bacterial infections, HIV/AIDS, and maternal conditions. This is primarily due to limited access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare services. In contrast, high-income African countries exhibit better health outcomes. European countries show variations: lower-middle-income nations suffer more fro4m acute respiratory infections and HIV/AIDS, while high-income countries report higher incidences of cancer and bacterial infections. These differences reflect disparities in healthcare quality and social determinants. The study emphasizes the need for targeted policy initiatives to address these disparities by focusing on socioeconomic factors and improving healthcare access and quality across all income groups.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf5e66970c30fa0f071edcfcb624d843a28a72336daf6b87981a3d8c68e0b797","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
