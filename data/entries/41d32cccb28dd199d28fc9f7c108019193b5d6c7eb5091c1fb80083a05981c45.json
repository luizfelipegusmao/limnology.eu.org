{"title":"196 Metabolic characteristics and truly digestible nutrient supply to dairy cows: Effect of oat varieties and types (feed type vs. milling type)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/346/7757162?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective of this study was to investigate effects of oat varieties and types (feed type vs. milling type) on metabolic characteristics, truly digestible nutrient supply, and feed milk value (FMV). Twelve samples [4 varieties (Arborg, Haymaker, Nasser, Summit) × 3 harvested years (2018, 2019, 2020)] were used in this study. The DVE/OEB system and NRC-2001 system were applied to evaluate these parameters. The experiment design was RCBD design (oat varieties as a fixed effect and harvested year as a random block effect). MIXED procedure model of SAS 9.4 was used for statistical analysis, and significance was declared at <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05 and tendency at 0.05 ≤ <span>P</span> &lt; 0.1. Based on the DVE/OEB system, results showed that microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available nitrogen (MREN, g/kg DM), microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available energy (MREE, g/kg DM), truly absorbed microbial protein in the small intestine (DVME, g/kg DM), truly digested protein in the small intestine (DVE, g/kg DM) and feed milk value (FMV, kg milk /kg feed) of Nasser oat were least in these four varieties although Nasser oat had no significant differences on MREN content with Arborg and Summit oat. Nasser oat had highest endogenous protein loss (ENDP, g/kg DM) and undigested dry matter (UDM, g/kg DM) in these four oat varieties (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Nasser oat also had the largest degraded protein balance (OEB, g/kg DM) value compared with Arborg, Haymaker and Summit oat, and all the OEB values were positive indicating having potential N losses from rumen. There were significant differences in the MREE, DVME, ENDP, UDM, DVE, OEB and FMV between feed oat and milling oat (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), and feed oat had larger OEB values than milling oat. Based on the NRC-2001 model, oat varieties had significant impact on microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available energy (MCP<sub>TDN</sub>, g/kg DM), microbial protein synthesized in the rumen based on available protein (MCP<sub>RDP</sub><sup>NRC</sup>, g/kg DM) and truly absorbed microbial protein in the small intestine (AMCP, g/kg DM; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). Haymaker oat had higher metabolizable protein (MP) and FMV than Summit oat (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), and had similar MP and FMV with Arborg and Nasser oat. As for the oat types, no significant differences were found on all the characteristics between feed type and milling type, and feed oat had better FMV compared with milling oat.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"41d32cccb28dd199d28fc9f7c108019193b5d6c7eb5091c1fb80083a05981c45","category":"Environment"}
