{"title":"Resting metabolic rate and lung function in fasted and fed rough‐toothed dolphins, Steno bredanensis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.13068?af=R","date":1704967856000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), tidal volume (<i>V</i>\n<sub>T</sub>), breathing frequency (<i>f</i>\n<sub>R</sub>), respiratory flow, and end-expired gases in rough-toothed dolphins (<i>Steno bredanensis</i>) housed in managed care after an overnight fast and 1–2 hr following a meal. The measured average (± standard deviation) <i>V</i>\n<sub>T</sub> (4.0 ± 1.3 L) and <i>f</i>\n<sub>R</sub> (1.9 ± 1.0 breaths/min) were higher and lower, respectively, as compared with estimated values from both terrestrial and aquatic mammals, and the average <i>V</i>\n<sub>T</sub> was 43% of the estimated total lung capacity. The end-expired gas levels suggested that this species keep alveolar O<sub>2</sub> (10.6% or 80 mmHg) and CO<sub>2</sub> (7.6% or 57 mmHg), and likely arterial gas tensions, low and high, respectively, to maximize efficiency of gas exchange. We show that following an overnight fast, the RMR (566 ± 158 ml O<sub>2</sub>/min) was 1.8 times the estimated value predicted by Kleiber for terrestrial mammals of the same size. We also show that between 1 and 2 hr after ingestion of a meal, the metabolic rate increases an average of 29% (709 ± 126 ml O<sub>2</sub>/min). Both body mass (<i>M</i>\n<sub>b</sub>) and <i>f</i>\n<sub>R</sub> significantly altered the measured RMR and we propose that both these variables should be measured when estimating energy use in cetaceans.</p>","author":"Andreas Fahlman, \nKaylee Rhieu, \nBrie Alessi, \nShelly Marquardt, \nMichelle B.
