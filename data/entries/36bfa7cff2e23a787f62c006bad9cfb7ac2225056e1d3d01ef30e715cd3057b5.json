{"title":"Moxibustion for declined cardiorespiratory fitness of apparently healthy older adults: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301673","date":1712671200000,"content":"<p>by Zheng Sun, Zhihong Xu, Kuang Yu, Haitian Sun, Yiren Lin, Zilong Zhu, Yimin Zhu, Jianbin Zhang</p>\r\nBackground <p>Aging and age-related declines lead to varying degrees of decreased cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in apparently healthy older adults. Exercise training, the primary approach for enhancing CRF, encounters several constraints when used with elderly individuals. Existing evidence implies that moxibustion might enhance the CRF of older adults. However, clinical research in this area still needs to be improved.</p> Methods <p>This study will employ a randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial design involving 126 eligible participants. These participants will be stratified and randomly assigned to one moxibustion group, one sham moxibustion group, and one blank control group. Acupoints of bilateral <i>Zusanli</i> (ST36), <i>Shenque</i> (CV8), and <i>Guanyuan</i> (CV4) are selected for both real and sham moxibustion groups. The treatment will last 60 min per session, 5 sessions a week for 12 weeks. The blank control group will not receive any intervention for CRF improvement. Primary outcomes will be the mean change in peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>), anaerobic threshold (AT), and serum central carbon metabolites (CCB) from the baseline to observation points. Secondary outcome measures involve the six-minute walk distance (6MWD), the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), and the Qi and Blood Status Questionnaire (QBSQ). Outcome assessments will be conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 as part of the follow-up. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit.</p> Discussion <p>This trial can potentially ascertain moxibustionâ€™s effectiveness and safety in enhancing CRF among apparently healthy older adults.</p> Trail registration <p>ChiCTR, ChiCTR2300070303.
