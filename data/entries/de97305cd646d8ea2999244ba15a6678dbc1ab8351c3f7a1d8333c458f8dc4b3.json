{"title":"Enhancing Force Absorption, Stress-Strain and Thermal Properties of Weft-Knitted Inlay Spacer Fabric Structures for Apparel Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0410/v1","date":1725587368000,"content":"The pursuit of materials that offer both wear comfort and protection for functional and protective clothing has led to the exploration of weft-knitted spacer structures. Traditional cushioning materials such as spacer fabrics and laminated foam often suffer from deformation under compression stresses, thus compromising their protective properties. This study investigates the enhancement of the force absorption, stress-strain and thermal properties of weft-knitted spacer fabrics with inlays. Surface yarns with optimal stretchability and thermal properties are used and combined with elastic yarns in various patterns to fabricate nine different inlay samples. The mechanical and thermal properties of these samples are systematically analyzed, including their compression, stretchability, thermal comfort and surface properties. The results show that the inlay spacer fabric exhibits superior compression properties and thermal conductivity compared to traditional laminated foam and spacer fabrics, while maintaining stretchability, thus providing a better performance than traditional fabrics for protective clothing and wearable cushioning products. This study further confirms that the type of inlay yarn and inlay structure are crucial factors that significantly influence the thermal, tensile and compressive properties of fabric. This research provides valuable insights into the design and development of advanced textile structures to improve wear comfort and protection in functional garment applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de97305cd646d8ea2999244ba15a6678dbc1ab8351c3f7a1d8333c458f8dc4b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
