{"title":"Enhancing Data Compression: Recent Innovations in LZ77 Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1877/v1","date":1727279379000,"content":"The burgeoning volume of genomic data, fueled by advances in sequencing technologies, \ndemands efficient data compression solutions. Traditional algorithms like Lempel-Ziv77 (LZ77) have \nbeen foundational in offering lossless compression, yet they often fall short when applied to the \nhighly repetitive structures typical of genomic sequences. This review delves into the evolution of \nLZ77 and its derivatives, exploring specialized algorithms such as prefix-free parsing, AVL grammars, \nand LZ-based methods tailored for genomic data. Innovations in this field have led to enhanced \ncompression ratios and processing efficiencies by leveraging the intrinsic redundancy within genomic \ndatasets. We critically examine a spectrum of LZ77-based algorithms, including newer adaptations \nfor external and semi-external memory settings, and contrast their efficacy in managing large-scale \ngenomic data. Additionally, we discuss the potential of these algorithms to facilitate the construction \nof data structures such as compressed suffix trees, crucial for genomic analyses. This paper aims to \nprovide a comprehensive guide on the current landscape and future directions of data compression \ntechnologies, equipping researchers and practitioners with insights to tackle the escalating data \nchallenges in genomics and beyond.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"88d82f4832c5c7e3db0ae115ef0d554b4284ace22bb2a41ba1408c604fb4ad72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
