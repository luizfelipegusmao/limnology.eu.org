{"title":"Aminopeptidasic Enzymes as Early Biomarkers of Cardiac Surgery-Associated Acute Kidney Injury and Long-Term Events","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1844/v1","date":1721798302000,"content":"Background: Diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) relies on serum creatinine (SCr) changes. This study investigated if urinary aminopeptidases are early and predictive biomarkers of cardiac surgery associated-AKI (CSA-AKI). Methods: Glutamyl aminopeptidase (GluAp), alanyl aminopeptidase (AlaAp), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), proteinuria, albuminuria, N-acetyl-Î²-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and neutrophile gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured in urine samples from 44 patients at arrival in Intensity Care Unit (ICU) after cardiac surgery. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for diagnosis of stages 1, 2 and 3 of AKI were analyzed for the highest quartile of each marker. We also studied the relationship with SCr after surgery, 6- and 12-months glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and other long-term events over the next 5 years. Results: GluAp diagnosed the maximal number of patients that developed stage 2 or 3 of AKI, increasing diagnostic sensitivity from 0 to 75 %. Besides, GluAp and DPP4 was related to the decrease in GFR at 6- or 12-months after surgery. Conclusions: Urinary aminopeptidases are a potential tool for the early diagnosis of CSA-AKI, being GluAp the most effective marker for diagnosing stages 2 or 3 of AKI at ICU admission. GluAp and DPP4 serve as predictive biomarkers for the decrease in GFR.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"78fe52bb71dc90b6eebccf0e7d42b319873831351f1444bd67943ad4de70f326","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
