{"title":"The Next Generation of Diabetes Translation: A Path to Health Equity","link":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040218-044158","date":1546430400000,"content":"<p>Disparities in diabetes burden exist in large part because of the social determinants of health (SDOH). Translation research and practice addressing health equity in diabetes have generally focused on changing individual behavior or providing supportive approaches to compensate for, rather than directly target, SDOH. The purpose of this article is to propose a pathway for addressing SDOH as root causes of diabetes disparities and as an essential target for the next generation of interventions needed to achieve health equity in diabetes prevention and treatment. This review describes (a) the current burden of diabetes disparities, (b) the influence of SDOH on diabetes disparities, (c) gaps in and implications of current translation research, and (d) approaches to achieving health equity in the next generation of diabetes translation.</p>\r\n<p>Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 40, 2019</p>","author":"Debra Haire-Joshu and Felicia Hill-Briggs","siteTitle":"Annual Review of Public Health","siteHash":"7a16e40f33727f64c92405053603e83c5cbbe960f1756170cbd1d528ffe78607","entryHash":"ba34d5404f870303fea9511875f122cab83a1968aebea15d6968f23200fd8351","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
