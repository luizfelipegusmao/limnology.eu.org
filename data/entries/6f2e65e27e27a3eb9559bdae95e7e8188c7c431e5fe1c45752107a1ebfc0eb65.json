{"title":"Taste dysfunction as a predictor of depression in schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300935","date":1711116000000,"content":"<p>by Jia Liu, Shu-Jie Sun, Ye Lu, Xin Ping, Wan Zhang, Lin Pei</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study aims to investigate the relationship between taste dysfunction and depression among patients with schizophrenia, to achieve early detection of depression in clinical practice.</p> Methods <p>Following PRISMA guidance, a comprehensive literature search was conducted globally, covering papers published from 1961 to June 2023. A total of 17 manuscripts were selected through meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis after examining available materials from seven databases to determine the correlation between depression and taste dysfunction.</p> Results <p>The comparison of the 17 selected manuscripts revealed that individuals with gustatory dysfunction may be more likely to experience depressive symptoms (SMD, 0.51, 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.93, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Depression is associated with taste dysfunction in certain aspects, as indicated by the pleasantness ratings of sucrose solutions (SMD, -0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.11 to 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.08), gustatory identification ability (SMD, 0.96, 95% CI, 0.03 to 1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and the perce<i>p</i>tion threshold of sweet taste (MD, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.81, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001).</p> Conclusions <p>Due to variations in the methods, designs, and selection criteria employed in the included studies, it is necessary to establish a feasible framework. Future research using detailed and targeted approaches can provide clearer and more unified conclusions on the relationship between taste dysfunction and depression. Moreover, further high-quality research is needed to obtain clearer conclusions and explore the potential of taste dysfunction as an effective tool for early screening of depression.</p> Trial registration <p>This review has been registered in the PROSPERO on April 2022 with the identifier CRD42023400172.</p>","author":"Jia Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6f2e65e27e27a3eb9559bdae95e7e8188c7c431e5fe1c45752107a1ebfc0eb65","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
