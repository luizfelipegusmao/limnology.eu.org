{"title":"Hydric Environment and Chemical Composition Shape Non-avian Reptile Eggshell Absorption","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/64/1/107/7675500?rss=1","date":1715817600000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>The amniotic egg fulfils a critical role in reproduction by serving as an interface between the external environment and the embryo. Because non-avian reptiles are rarely incubated, they must be heated by, and absorb water from, the oviposition site for the developing embryo. The mechanisms by which they absorb sufficient, but not excess, water and how these mechanisms vary with local habitat is largely unknown, despite its significance to their evolution. Here, we first performed histology, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic vapor sorption experiments to elucidate the mechanisms of eggshell absorption for 56 reptile species. Then, we used phylogenetic comparative analysis to test the hypothesis that the absorptive capacity of reptile eggshells increases with aridity of the environment. We found that water absorption increases in the presence of a superficial mucopolysaccharide layer and decreases with increased calcium content. We found that eggs from arid environments have highly absorbent eggshells, but only in species with weakly calcified shells. Our results suggest that reptile eggshells have over evolutionary time tuned absorptive capacity to environmental moisture level. Since these eggs often must sustain conflicting constraints, they may serve as inspirations for new biomimetic materials, such as water filtering membranes or humidity sensors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"3118c276bda547e5933be6528bab8816e8d68badf849a144ab051b2b469f63f7","category":"Environment"}
