{"title":"Return to Sports Activity in Individuals with Surgical Stomas: A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0291/v1","date":1722860819000,"content":"In surgically treated individuals with surgical stomas, the return to sports activity is an indicator of quality of life that reflects their well-being. With the aim of synthesizing the available evidence regarding the return to physical activity and sports practice in individuals with surgical stomas, a scoping review was developed following the methodological approach of the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews criteria. Searches were conducted in Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, Cinahl, and Lilacs, as well as the meta-search engines TripDatabase and Epistemonikos, using the MeSH terms \"exercise\", \"return to sports\", and \"surgical stomas\"; including studies in Spanish, English, Portuguese, and German, without any limitation on the year of publication. A total of n = 15 studies with different designs were included (n = 2 qualitative; n = 1 cohort; n = 8 cross-sectional; n = 2 case reports; n = 1 case series; and n = 1 Randomized Clinical Trial), which showed variability in the quality of the designs. The studies revealed the complex relationship between physical activity and having surgical stomas, associated with the individuals' characteristics. There is a need to increase the number and rigor of research to understand the phenomenon of return to physical activity and sport, thus providing evidence-based clinical recommendations for sports practice in people with stomas.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6f0cf81611faf0d11896c9eb19d819eb4d506dd375751d35810ca389bc440e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
