We deployed an integrated approach for understanding the molecular mechanism of CPE using a stable ethyl methanesulfonate mutant line, CPE-109 of the Samba Mahsuri (SM) variety of rice (<span>Oryza sativa</span>), which exhibits CPE. Two consistent genomic regions were identified for CPE through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping [<span>qCPE-4</span> (28.24–31.22 Mb) and <span>qCPE-12</span> (2.30–3.18 Mb)] and QTL-sequencing [chr 4 (31.21–33.69 Mb) and chr 12 (0.12–3.15 Mb)]. Two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, namely KASP 12–12 (T→C; chr12:1269983) in <span>Os12g0126300</span>, encoding an AP2/ERF transcription factor, and KASP 12–16 (G→A; chr12:1515198) in <span>Os12g0131400</span>, encoding an F-box domain-containing protein, explained 81.05% and 59.61% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, and exhibited strong co-segregation with CPE in F<sub>2</sub> mapping populations, advanced generation lines, and CPE-exhibiting SM mutants through KASP assays. Down-regulation of these genes in CPE-109 compared with SM (wild type) was observed in transcriptome sequencing of flag leaves, which was validated through qRT-PCR. We propose that the abrogation of <span>Os12g0126300</span> and <span>Os12g0131400</span> in CPE-109 combinatorially influences down-regulation of ethylene biosynthetic genes, <span>Os01g0192900</span> (ACC synthase) and <span>Os05g0497300</span> (ethylene-responsive factor-2), and up-regulation of a gibberellic acid synthetic gene, <span>Os06g0569900</span> (ent-kaurene synthase) and the two cytokinin biosynthetic genes <span>Os07g0486700</span> (cytokinin-<span>O</span>-glucosyltransferase 2) and <span>Os10g0479500</span> (similar to carboxy-lyase), which results in complete panicle exsertion.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"341865b4a0fca27bec49d345dc656211d9297973ad369b23c31a8804a2986b96","category":"Environment"}
