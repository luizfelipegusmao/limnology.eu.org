{"title":"Reducing Insurance Costs: Adoption of Protective Wearable Artificial Intelligence Devices by Couriers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0348/v1","date":1725435777000,"content":"Reminding the courier through wearable artificial intelligence devices to prevent accidents is not only beneficial to the courier's safety but also will save a lot of insurance premiums for express companies, therefore, it is worth investigating what factors can influence the acceptance of wearable artificial intelligence devices by couriers. Push-pull-mooring (PPM) theory and affective event theory (AET) are integrated to test couriersâ€™ adoption to wearable safety detection devices. Social influence, perceived security, personal innovativeness and affective event reaction are applied to research model. Questionnaires are distributed among several listed express companies and 263 valid questionnaires are used for empirical test. Empirical results indicated that social influence, perceived safety, personal innovativeness and affective event reaction are positively related to usage with coefficients 0.218, 0.301, 0.698 and 0.309. Personal innovativeness has positively moderating effects on relationships between affective event reaction, perceived security and usage with coefficients 0.145 and 0.106, whereas has no significant moderating effect on relationship between social influence and usage. The research aims to help support the proliferation and adoption of wearable artificial intelligence devices to optimize the current state of the express industry and improve the interaction between couriers and managers, creating an active management strategy that will allow express companies to thrive. This study can help express companies reduce insurance costs and therefore reduce the premium pricing of insurance companies for the courier industry.. This study also provides design suggestions for the application of wearable artificial intelligence devices based on chat GPT in various working conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0af620178d246120126ea96e8b76809cf3a33b9562cc81395fb778f2d3977ac2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
