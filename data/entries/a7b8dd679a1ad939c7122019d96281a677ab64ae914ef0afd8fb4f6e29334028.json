{"title":"Fabrication of soy protein–polyphenol covalent complex nanoparticles with improved wettability to stabilize high‐oil‐phase curcumin emulsions","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13672?af=R","date":1728660030000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Recent studies have shown that the wettability of protein-based emulsifiers is critical for emulsion stability. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of varying epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) concentrations on the wettability of protein-based emulsifiers. Additionally, limited studies have examined the effectiveness of soy protein–EGCG covalent complex nanoparticles with improved wettability as emulsifiers for stabilizing high-oil-phase (≥ 30%) curcumin emulsions.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Soy protein isolate (SPI)–EGCG complex nanoparticles (SPIE<sub>n</sub>) with improved wettability were fabricated to stabilize high-oil-phase curcumin emulsions. The results showed that EGCG forms covalent bonds with SPI, which changes its secondary structure, enhances its surface charge, and improves its wettability. Moreover, SPIE<sub>n</sub> with 2.0 g L <sup>−1</sup> EGCG (SPIE<sub>n-2.0</sub>) exhibited a better three-phase contact angle (56.8 ± 0.3<sup>o</sup>) and zeta potential (−27 mV) than SPI. SPIE<sub>n-2.0</sub> also facilitated the development of curcumin emulsion gels at an oil volume fraction of 0.5. Specifically, the enhanced network between droplets as a result of the packing effects and SPIE<sub>n-2.0</sub> with inherent antioxidant function was more effective at inhibiting curcumin degradation during long-term storage and ultraviolet light exposure.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The results of the present study indicate that SPIE<sub>n</sub> with 2.0 g L <sup>−1</sup> EGCG (SPIE<sub>n-2.0</sub>) comprises the optimum conditions for fabricating emulsifiers with improved wettability. Additionally, SPIE<sub>n-0.2</sub> can improve the physicochemical stability of high-oil-phase curcumin emulsions, suggesting a novel strategy to design and fabricate high-oil-phase emulsion for encapsulating bioactive compounds. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Jingjing Xu, \nFuyun Ji, \nShuizhong Luo, \nShaotong Jiang, \nZhenyu Yu, \nAiqian Ye, \nZhi Zheng","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"a7b8dd679a1ad939c7122019d96281a677ab64ae914ef0afd8fb4f6e29334028","category":"Environment"}
