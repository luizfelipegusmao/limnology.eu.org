{"title":"Functional genomics and insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of psoriasis.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0763/v1","date":1710319726000,"content":"Psoriasis is a lifelong, systemic, immune mediated inflammatory skin condition, affecting 1-3% of the worldâ€™s population, with an impact on quality of life similar to diseases like cancer or diabetes. Genetics are the single largest risk factor in psoriasis, with GWAS studies showing that many psoriasis risk genes lie along the IL23/Th17 axis. Potential psoriasis risk genes determined through GWAS can be annotated and characterised using functional genomics, allowing the identification of novel drug targets and the repurposing of existing drugs. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is complex and focusing on the IL23/Th17 axis can provide insight into key cell types, cytokines and intracellular signaling pathways involved. Examination of currently available biological treatments, time to relapse post drug withdrawal and rates of drug primary/secondary drug failure show the need for greater understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms of psoriasis and how they can impact treatment. This could allow for patient stratification towards the treatment most likely reduce dis-ease burden for the longest period possible.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2ad8010d0b6952ebb4544a592ec61a59ee83ec25ce325c064e63a1513dfbdf34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
