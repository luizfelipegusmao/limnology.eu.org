Our group reported a simple method to measure d-spacing by finding the center of diffraction disks without using high-end TEMs [<a href=\"#ozae044.145-B1\">1-3</a>]. In these papers, we succeeded in distinguishing SiGe and Si whose {111} <span>d</span>-spacing differences were about 0.004 nm, and it was shown that the convergence angle did not affect the final results. Recently, we applied this technique for Ni-Al-Ti alloy and tried to distinguish the 0.002 nm d-spacing change between γ matrix and γ’ precipitates, but we did not accomplish this purpose yet [<a href=\"#ozae044.145-B4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.145-B5\">5</a>]. In this paper, we investigated the best experimental condition based on our TEM and the best analysis method for the Ni-Al-Ti specimens to achieve 0.002 nm resolution by NBD.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4a19a97c896336fffca9142de6193f3361605fe23e2ad55a94395e907639ace4","category":"Environment"}
