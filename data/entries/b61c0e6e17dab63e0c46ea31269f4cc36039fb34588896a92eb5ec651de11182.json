{"title":"Recent Advancements in Sediment Transport Modelling in Reservoirs","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0513/v1","date":1709888867000,"content":"Anthropogenic activities such as the damming of rivers have resulted in the formation of depositional systems for sediments that are naturally transported along river channels all over the world. The steady accumulation of sediments has profound effects on how reservoirs function. As the reservoir ages, the impact of sedimentation becomes more pronounced. In an alluvial channel, the dynamics of sediment movement, scour, and deposition are exceedingly complicated. The quantitative and qualitative management of river engineering heavily relies on sediment motion. One of the key concerns affecting reservoir storage capacity is reservoir sedimentation. Understanding the form and behavior of the river or reservoir is necessary for a scientific approach to sedimentation.  An overview of reservoir sedimentation processes, and models of reservoir and shallow water bodies is provided in this article. More research in the developing fields is advised for continuing studies on reservoir sedimentation due to climate change effects","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b61c0e6e17dab63e0c46ea31269f4cc36039fb34588896a92eb5ec651de11182","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
