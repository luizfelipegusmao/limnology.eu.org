{"title":"Strategic Intelligence: A Semantic Leadership Perspective","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0690/v1","date":1712743441000,"content":"Strategic intelligence covers the examination of what impacts and influences the business and the related SWOT analysis, (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats mapping). Through this research, leaders will be able to properly allocate and re-route resources, identify areas of improvement, and ensure that strategic initiatives are aligned with the organization's mission. Strategic intelligence is, therefore, effective through the use of critical thought and data-driven decisions and seeing the outcomes of different positioned alternatives. It must also form and support a culture of cooperation and open communication within the organizations, stimulating employees' inputs and learning curves. The article's subject is the necessity for strategic intelligence, a crucial competence for leaders, managers, and companies striving to remain competitive, to be utilized and best leveraged in today's volatile and dynamic business contexts. It helps the leadership turn proactive, foresee trends, and make correct, agile decisions that enforce companies' long-term growth and success. This study follows a research design that includes a thorough literature review and bibliometric research, executed via VoSViewer, illustrating the concept of strategic intelligence from a leadership point of view as a driver of competitive advantage. Further, the article points out that the limitations are acknowledged because the literature on the matter is limited, as strategic intelligence is relatively new to the business sector; moreover, more research is required to fully understand and use the potential of strategic intelligence in business growth. By overcoming these limitations and continuing to study this concept, businesses can gain a competitive edge and make informed decisions that fuel their success in an ever-evolving market. As a result, this study contributes to developing strategic intelligence in leadership and business and paves the road for further research and applications of strategic intelligence theories in organizational contexts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"978d5c8e5eebca64032480995a9e6bf5c806d99c315020b299061cf8cdc58930","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
