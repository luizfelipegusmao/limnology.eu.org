{"title":"Application of Multiplex Genome Editing Technology on Targeted Improvement of Ecological Adaptability of the Geng Rice Variety Jiahe212","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0728/v1","date":1715492678000,"content":"The flowering period of rice significantly impacts variety adaptability and yield formation. Properly shortening the reproductive period of rice varieties can expand their ecological range without significant yield reduction. Targeted genome editing, like CRISPR/Cas9, is an ideal tool to fine-tune rice growth stages and boost yield synergistically. In this study, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiplex genome editing vector containing five genes related to three traits: Hd2, Ghd7, and DTH8 (flowering stage genes), along with the recessive rice blast resistance gene Pi21 and the aromatic gene BADH2. This vector was introduced into the high-quality Geng rice variety in Zhejiang province, Jiahe212 (JH212), resulting in 34 T0 plants with various effective mutations. Among the 17 mutant T1 lines, several displayed diverse flowering dates, but most exhibited undesirable agronomic traits. Notably, three homozygous mutant lines (JH-C15, JH-C18, and JH-C31) showed slightly earlier flowering dates without significant differences in yield-related traits compared to JH212. Through special Hyg and Cas marker selection of T2 plants, we identified 7, 6, and 2 fragrant glutinous plants devoid of transgenic components, respectively. These single plants will serve as sib lines of JH212 and potential resources for breeding applications, including maintenance lines for Xian-Geng interspecific three-line hybrid rice. In summary, our research offers practical insights and potential resources for targeted improvement of Geng rice varieties, and would also promote the Geng rice varieties expending from the southward to the northward.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3790f263462f72db5855d529c29efcb08d67aa8695ccf350f24438b7cb7cc079","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
