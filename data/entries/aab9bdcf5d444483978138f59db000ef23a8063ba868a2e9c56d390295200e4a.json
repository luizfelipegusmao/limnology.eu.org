{"title":"Sediment contributions from a low‐head dam failure on the Big Blue River near Marysville, KS","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.4327?af=R","date":1717727917000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this research is to analyze the headcut propagation and downstream sediment yield as a result of a low-head dam failure. While frameworks have been presented elsewhere to track headcut propagation from a dam failure/removal, little research has been conducted to calculate the downstream sediment yield of the resulting headcut. The sediment yield is of particular interest when a reservoir is located downstream of the headcut. This paper estimates the increased sediment yield to Tuttle Creek Lake as a result of a low-head dam failure on the Big Blue River. From 2018 to 2022, the headcut contributed an estimated 859,000 m<sup>3</sup> of sediment to Tuttle Creek Lake. Erosion is unlikely to continue due to the presence of natural grade control provided by boulder riffles and bedrock.</p>","author":"Michael Mansfield, \nJohn Shelley, \nChristopher Haring","siteTitle":"Wiley: River Research and Applications: Table of Contents","siteHash":"dd8f8dcb48cf1db6f6edba43098839a842d88bad9f088e9d186fa05ae3366ba7","entryHash":"aab9bdcf5d444483978138f59db000ef23a8063ba868a2e9c56d390295200e4a","category":"Environment"}
