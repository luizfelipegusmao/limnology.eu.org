{"title":"Spent Ncm Lithium-Ion Batteries: Potential Evaluation of Mechanical Pre-Treatment for Recycling","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1195/v1","date":1726474585000,"content":"Recent increases in the demand for automotive lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have led to higher needs for critical materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Consequently, recovering materials from spent batteries has gained importance. This study aimed to (1) develop a mechanical pre-treatment method for separating and concentrating materials from spent NCM622 cells, and (2) evaluate the economic, environmental, and scarcity potentials of these fractions. The pre-treatment involved grinding and granulometric separation, producing six particle-size fractions. Analysis showed that the finest fraction (n &lt; 0.5 mm) had 85% of lithium, 77.4% of cobalt, 75.1% of manganese, and 68.5% of nickel. This fraction represented 40.4% of the processed mass and had the highest economic value (USD 3,669/ton NCM cell). This fraction was also prioritized for recycling due to its superior environmental and scarcity considerations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"34520e1eceff63cfe6b90111bd64df9052963e51f3a0b965fcb1bbad77b1edff","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
