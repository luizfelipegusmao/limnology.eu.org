{"title":"The aroma formation from fresh tea leaves of Longjing 43 to finished Enshi Yulu tea at an industrial scale","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13823?af=R","date":1724416548000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>Enshi Yulu</i> tea (ESYL) is the most representative of steamed green tea in China, but its aroma formation in processing is unclear. Thus, the ESYL volatiles during the whole industrial processing were investigated using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>A total of 134 volatiles were identified. Among these, 31 differential volatiles [<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 and variable importance in projection (VIP) &gt; 1] and 25 key volatiles [relative odor activity value (rOAV) and/or the ratio of each rOAV to the maximum rOAV (ROAV) &gt; 1.0] were screened out, wherein <i>β</i>-ionone and nonanal were the most key odorants. Besides, the sensory evaluation combined with multivariate statistical analysis of volatiles pinpointed spreading, fixation, first drying, and second drying as the key processing steps that have a pronounced influence on the aroma quality of ESYL. Furthermore, the oxidative degradation of unsaturated fatty acids, synthesis of monoterpenes, and degradation of carotenoids were the main metabolic pathway for the formation of key odorants.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The study provides comprehensive insights into the volatile characteristics during the industrial processing of ESYL and promote our understanding of the aroma formation in steamed green teas. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Mengyuan Sui, \nLili Wang, \nRong Xue, \nJun Xiang, \nYufei Wang, \nYuan Yuan, \nQian Pu, \nXin Fang, \nBin Liu, \nXingming Hu, \nXiaoying Liu, \nYouyi Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"15b222836d2cfdf532c3a3b1dc4681fc31a1720f7243c48c6a88106e22e87d06","category":"Environment"}
