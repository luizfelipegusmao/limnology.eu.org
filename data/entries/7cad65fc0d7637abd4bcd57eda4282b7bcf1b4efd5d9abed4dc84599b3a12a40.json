{"title":"The ascorbate–glutathione cycle coming of age","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/9/2682/7577645?rss=1","date":1705536000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Concepts regarding the operation of the ascorbate–glutathione cycle and the associated water/water cycle in the processing of metabolically generated hydrogen peroxide and other forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are well established in the literature. However, our knowledge of the functions of these cycles and their component enzymes continues to grow and evolve. Recent insights include participation in the intrinsic environmental and developmental signalling pathways that regulate plant growth, development, and defence. In addition to ROS processing, the enzymes of the two cycles not only support the functions of ascorbate and glutathione, they also have ‘moonlighting’ functions. They are subject to post-translational modifications and have an extensive interactome, particularly with other signalling proteins. In this assessment of current knowledge, we highlight the central position of the ascorbate–glutathione cycle in the network of cellular redox systems that underpin the energy-sensitive communication within the different cellular compartments and integrate plant signalling pathways.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"7cad65fc0d7637abd4bcd57eda4282b7bcf1b4efd5d9abed4dc84599b3a12a40","category":"Environment"}
