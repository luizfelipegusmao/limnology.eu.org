{"title":"Exploring the Dynamics of Private Higher Education in China: A Human Capital and Institutional Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1887/v1","date":1721823629000,"content":"This study delves into the transformative growth of private higher education in China, highlighting the rapid and diverse expansion following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although previous studies have reported expansion and difficulties, a thorough examination of the relationship between institutional adaptation and the development of human capital remains unexplored. This study examines how private higher education institutions modify their job-related courses to suit the demands of the job market, evaluates the effect on the employability of graduates, and investigates ways to control costs without sacrificing academic quality. This study analyzes data from the Ministry of Education, Wind Information, and Shenwan Hongyuan Research to gain insights into the impact of human capital theory and institutional theory on private higher education in China. Enrollment trends, program alignment, financial sustainability, and quality enhancement activities are all examined using detailed analysis. Private higher education institutions play a critical role in developing a skilled labor force by filling skill gaps and meeting the demands of an evolving job market. The findings also emphasize the importance of quality assurance procedures, strategic program development, and collaborations with businesses. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the imperative for more research and policy action. This is crucial to securing the lasting effectiveness and influence of private higher education institutions on China's socioeconomic progress and human capital development in the post-pandemic era.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b4c5242c0a8af1ff8998bc07e97684e99de409425a87b35da3efc1fdf25688db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
