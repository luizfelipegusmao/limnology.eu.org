In this study, we have identified 108 <i>OsWRKY</i> genes in the genome of <i>Oryza sativa</i> subsp. <i>japonica</i>, using the updated genomic data from the Rice Annotation Project Database and Oryzabase, which were further used to conduct the phylogenetic study, motif analysis, gene structure analysis, chromosomal mapping, and prediction of sub-cellular localization. The multiple sequence alignment OsWRKY proteins revealed the presence of nine different types of alterations in the conserved heptapeptide sequence WRKYGQK associated with 19 <i>OsWRKY</i> genes. Physiochemical analysis discloses the hydrophobic amino acid-rich, thermally stable, and polar nature of OsWRKY proteins. These genes were noted as highly conserved between the two cultivated sub-species of <i>Oryza sativa</i>, that is Indica and <i>japonica</i> type. Additionally, from motif analysis, we have found a new motif, which was categorized as hAT family C-terminal dimerization region associated with four members of group IIc. We have identified 21 stress-responsive <i>OsWRKY</i> genes, and their significance to the different biotic and abiotic stress-mediated cascades was further evaluated by analysing 1500 kb upstream sequences and this disclosed the presence of important phytohormone-responsive <i>cis</i>-elements in the OsWRKY gene, suggesting its direct involvement in defence against a wide range of external stressors and these 21 <i>OsWRKY</i> genes are tentatively listed as possible candidates for more study.</p>","author":"Jhumishree Meher, \nJeetu Narware, \nPrahlad Masurkar","siteTitle":"Wiley: Annals of Applied Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a403b38a3432c20b8a9e38602184acbfc416cca77ff6bdf54b49e3b6eafe9c39","entryHash":"28184a3fe432b0412078ae86dc545ea5c8624e7a6a4e68a29dff88dc299ccfbf","category":"Environment"}
