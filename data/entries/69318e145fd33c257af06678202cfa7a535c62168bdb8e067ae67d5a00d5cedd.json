{"title":"Reducing the Rebound Effect in Microscale Laser Dynamic Forming Through Multi-pulse Laser Shock Loading","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0845/v1","date":1720605697000,"content":"Microscale laser dynamic forming, as a novel high-speed microforming technique, can overcome the shortcomings of traditional microforming methods. However, in practical applications, laser dynamic microforming technology is often affected by the rebound behavior of the workpiece surface, limiting the further improvement of processing quality and efficiency. This paper aims to reduce the rebound effect in laser dynamic microforming by using multi-pulse laser shock loading. The forming results of workpieces under different laser energies and laser impact numbers were studied using experimental and numerical simulation methods. Numerical simulations of the forming results after multiple laser shocks were conducted using ANSYS/LS-DYNA software. These numerical simulation results were then experimentally validated and compared. Surface morphology and microstructure of the workpieces were characterized using a confocal microscope and scanning electron microscope, and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the chemical element content changes in the collision regions at the bottoms of the workpieces after multi-pulse loading, revealing the collision behavior patterns during the forming process. Finally, the forming laws of workpieces under multiple laser shocks were summarized.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"69318e145fd33c257af06678202cfa7a535c62168bdb8e067ae67d5a00d5cedd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
