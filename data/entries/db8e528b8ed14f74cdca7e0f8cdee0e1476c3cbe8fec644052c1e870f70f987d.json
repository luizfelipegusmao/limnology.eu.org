{"title":"Catalytic Biolubricant Production from Canola Oil through Double Transesterification with Methanol and Neopentyl Glycol","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2296/v1","date":1727588383000,"content":"In the current environmental scenario, the proposal of alternatives for petroleum-based products has considerably increased, looking for bioproducts with interesting properties like biodegradability, sustainability and efficiency, among others. In this sense, the role of biolubricants is promising, offering a wide range of possibilities through different methods and operating conditions. Specifically, double transesterification could be a suitable process in a biorefinery context. The aim of this work was to produce a biolubricant through double transesterification with methanol and neopentyl glycol (NPG) under different reaction conditions, by using homogeneous catalysis (sodium methoxide). As a result, different catalyst concentrations, among other changes in reaction conditions, were used, getting high conversion values (96%) and a final product with viscosity values (20.7 cSt) that allow its use as engine oil (SAE 5W). In conclusion, biodiesel and biolubricant production was feasible through homogeneous catalysis, proving the feasibility of this process at laboratory scale. Further studies, including the use of different heterogeneous catalysts, as well as the implementation of this process at semi-industrial scale, is recommended.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db8e528b8ed14f74cdca7e0f8cdee0e1476c3cbe8fec644052c1e870f70f987d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
