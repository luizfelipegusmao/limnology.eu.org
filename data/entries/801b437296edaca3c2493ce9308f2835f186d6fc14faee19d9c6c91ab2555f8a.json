{"title":"The Circadian Rhythm of Heart Rate Variability in Patients with Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0907/v1","date":1723547729000,"content":"Background: Anxiety disorders can be both an independent risk factor of many somatic conditions and the cause of complications of various organic disorders leading to poor prognosis. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare the heart rate variability (HRV) recorded both during the day and at night in patients with anxiety disorders and healthy individuals. Methods: The study was conducted on fifty consecutive outpatients with anxiety disorders who participated in intensive group psychotherapy. The diagnosis was made according to DSM-IV-TR criteria using the PSE-10 questionnaire. Out of 50 patients under study, 17 were diagnosed with panic disorder (PD) and 21 with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The control group consisted of 40 healthy people. The resulting three groups were compared in terms of circadian HRV using the Oxford Medilog Suprima Holter System. Results: The HRV analysis showed the nocturnal falls in the time and frequency parameters related to parasympathetic activity (rMSSD, pNN50, HF). The most unfavourable alterations were observed in the PD group, which comprised the disappearance of day vs. night amplitude of the majority of HRV parameters. Hence, the PD group was particularly susceptible to the arrhythmic events. It was noticeable that nocturnal vagotonia in the PD group was significantly lower as compared with the GAD and control group. Conclusions: The innovative aspect of the present study was to find a distinct profile of HRV with regard to the types of anxiety disorders because of the existing considerable differences between the nature of PD and GAD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"801b437296edaca3c2493ce9308f2835f186d6fc14faee19d9c6c91ab2555f8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
