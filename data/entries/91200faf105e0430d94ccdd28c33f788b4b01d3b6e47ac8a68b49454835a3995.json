{"title":"Energy Metabolism Pathways in Stem Cell Fate Regulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0923/v1","date":1715662248000,"content":"Energy metabolism regulates the proliferation of stem cells by regulating energy production and the production of substrates through biosynthetic pathways. It is an important target for cell regulation and stem cell applications, and is crucial for determining the pluripotency and cell fate of stem cells. In this context, this article focuses on reviewing the latest research progress on the association between glucose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and mitophagy with stem cell function, elucidating how key energy metabolism pathways affect stem cell function by regulating signal transduction and epigenetic modifications. In this review, we discuss the key factors affecting energy metabolism and their association with stem cell function. The integration of energy metabolism and stem cell fate regulation will open up a new path for future regenerative medicine practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91200faf105e0430d94ccdd28c33f788b4b01d3b6e47ac8a68b49454835a3995","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
