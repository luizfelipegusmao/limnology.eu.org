{"title":"Active protein ubiquitination regulates xylem vessel functionality","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3298/7725539?rss=1","date":1722556800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Xylem vessels function in the long-distance conduction of water in land plants. The NAC transcription factor VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN7 (VND7) is a master regulator of xylem vessel cell differentiation in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>). We previously isolated <span>suppressor of ectopic xylem vessel cell differentiation induced by VND7</span> (<span>seiv</span>) mutants. Here, we report that the responsible genes for <span>seiv3</span>, <span>seiv4</span>, <span>seiv6</span>, and <span>seiv9</span> are protein ubiquitination-related genes encoding PLANT U-BOX46 (PUB46), an uncharacterized F-BOX protein (FBX), PUB36, and UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE1 (UBP1), respectively. We also found decreased expression of genes downstream of VND7 and abnormal xylem transport activity in the <span>seiv</span> mutants. Upon VND7 induction, ubiquitination levels from 492 and 180 protein groups were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. VND7 induction resulted in the ubiquitination of proteins for cell wall biosynthesis and protein transport, whereas such active protein ubiquitination did not occur in the <span>seiv</span> mutants. We detected the ubiquitination of three lysine residues in VND7: K94, K105, and K260. Substituting K94 with arginine significantly decreased the transactivation activity of VND7, suggesting that the ubiquitination of K94 is crucial for regulating VND7 activity. Our findings highlight the crucial roles of target protein ubiquitination in regulating xylem vessel activity.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"4add048f3cbc0666d6cb176d452707e8d9a4a8309f52c5c0e9f838f24798fcb9","category":"Environment"}
