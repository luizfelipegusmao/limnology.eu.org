{"title":"Unique exploration method of electronic component failure time and yield strengths of circular tubes under complete flexible model","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310150","date":1728914400000,"content":"<p>by Riffat Jabeen, Mashhood Ahmad, Azam Zaka, M. Nagy, Hazem Al-Mofleh</p>\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study is to develop new exponential weighted moving average control charts based on a flexible model. These control charts created through least square and weighted least square estimators of the shape parameter of the new Kumaraswamy Pareto distribution. Exponential weighted moving average control charts based on least square and weighted least square estimators are compared for checking the performance of control charts. The results were not only explored through numerical values but also explored through half a dozen plots. The numerical results and plots exposed that the exponential weighted moving average control chart based on weighted least square estimator has better performance than the other proposed chart. Some key findings are discussed which are obtained from the comparative analysis of EWMA control charts. The simulation study of proposed charts is also reported in detail. The two data sets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed charts. The reported results, for real data sets, are not only displayed in normal plots but also displayed in three-dimension plots. We recommend that the proposed method can be adapted for different types of distributions, and also suggest some future research directions. The concluding remarks are reported at the end of this manuscript.","author":"Riffat Jabeen","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2ecbf1e150f8cf647fcf0b8229ea8d6d1055ef3f2979259df0eb5eee6a7bfd37","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
