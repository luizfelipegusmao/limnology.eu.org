{"title":"A study of the effects of four reading styles on college students’ mental health and quality of life based on positive psychology-A first-of-its-kind study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308475","date":1724853600000,"content":"<p>by Yamei Liu</p>\r\nBackground <p>The increase in mental health problems among college students has become a global challenge, with anxiety and depression in particular becoming increasingly prevalent. Positive psychology has gained attention as an important psychological intervention that emphasizes improving mental health by promoting positive emotions and mindfulness. However, with the diversity of reading styles, however, there is a lack of systematic research on these effects. Therefore, this study aims to explore the specific effects of different reading styles on college students’ mental health and quality of life based on positive psychology, with the aim of providing more effective interventions and recommendations for improving college students’ mental health.</p> Methods <p>This study used a two-round questionnaire to select students with mental health problems and divided them into four experimental groups with a control group. The study was conducted by distributing questionnaires and experimental interventions, and a total of 2860 valid questionnaires were collected. The study used the Self-Assessment Scale for Anxiety (SAS) and the Self-Depression Scale (SDS) to assess the participants’ anxiety and depression levels. In addition, the study used the Physical Composite Score (PCS) and the Mental Composite Score (MCS) to assess the participants’ quality of life. SPSS 26.0 was used for data statistics and repeated measures ANOVA was used.</p> Results <p>Paper text reading and audio reading methods were effective in reducing anxiety levels and improving sleep quality. However, the electronic text reading approach was less effective compared to paper text reading and audio reading, and the video reading approach was not effective in improving depression. In addition, the positive psychology literature reading intervention showed significant improvements in college students’ quality of life scores.</p> Conclusion <p>The results of this study suggest that paper text reading and audio reading modalities have a positive impact on the mental health and quality of life of college students, while e-text reading and video reading modalities are less effective. These findings provide suggestions for college students to choose appropriate reading styles and further demonstrate the effectiveness of positive psychology reading on mental health. These results have important academic and practical implications for promoting mental health and improving quality of life among college students.</p>","author":"Yamei Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9aae2bcb3ef9b2d607d280cf090e5da151584d1cad2444960c67cebf49825874","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
