Curtailment of wind turbines limited to short periods with intense migration can minimize these negative impacts, and near-term bird migration forecasts can inform such decisions. Although near-term forecasts are usually created with long-term datasets, the pace of environmental alteration due to wind energy calls for the urgent development of conservation measures that rely on existing data, even when it does not have long temporal coverage.\n\nHere, we use 5 years of tracking bird radar data collected off the western Dutch coast, weather and phenological variables to develop seasonal near-term forecasts of low-altitude nocturnal bird migration over the southern North Sea.\n\nOverall, the models explained 71% of the variance and correctly predicted migration intensity above or below a threshold for intense hourly migration in more than 80% of hours in both seasons. However, the percentage of correctly predicted intense migration hours (top 5% of hours with the most intense migration) was low, likely due to the short-term dataset and their rare occurrence. We, therefore, advise careful consideration of a curtailment threshold to achieve optimal results.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: Near-term forecasts of migration fluxes evaluated against measurements can be used to define curtailment thresholds for offshore wind energy. We show that to minimize collision risk for 50% of migrants, if predicted correctly, curtailments should be applied during 18 h in spring and 26 in autumn in the focal year of model assessments, resulting in an estimated annual wind energy loss of 0.12%. Drawing from the Dutch curtailment framework, which pioneered the ‘international first’ offshore curtailment, we argue that using forecasts developed from limited temporal datasets alongside expert insight and data-driven policies can expedite conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world. This approach is particularly valuable in light of increasing interannual variability in weather conditions.\n</p>","author":"Maja Bradarić, \nBart Kranstauber, \nWillem Bouten, \nJudy Shamoun‐Baranes","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Applied Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"ea12fccecb0d31a49741c726eda58c700903553dacb4deca14c5e50acabee724","entryHash":"13f38e6678bcd70c7d5ce3bc45eb0b25b817e9fff6aed5728664a1f8c67a59c1","category":"Environment"}
