{"title":"Information Properties of Consecutive Systems using Fractional Generalized Cumulative Residual Entropy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0982/v1","date":1723627131000,"content":"We investigate some information properties of consecutive k-out-of-n:G systems in light\nof fractional generalized cumulative residual entropy. We firstly derive a formula to compute\nfractional generalized cumulative residual entropy related to the system's lifetime and explore\nits preservation properties in terms of established stochastic orders. Additionally, we obtain\nuseful bounds. To aid practical applications, we propose two non parametric estimators for\nthe fractional generalized cumulative residual entropy in these systems. The efficiency and\nperformance of these estimators are illustrated using simulated and real datasets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0c81dc32da280dabcde02204f8540cc87b6276a40b4c5509369f58bdf17efbb0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
