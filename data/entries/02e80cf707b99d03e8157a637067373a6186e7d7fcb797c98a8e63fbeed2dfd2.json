However, little is known about their microstructure evolution during severe plastic deformation (SPD). SPD techniques due to the generation and rearrangement of defects produce nanostructures of unprecedented properties, e.g., high strength [<a href=\"#ozae044.413-B1\">1</a>]. In this study, the aim was to investigate the impact of the microstructure refinement in lead-free brass by SPD on its antibacterial properties. It has been proved that microstructure refinement in the case of copper led to a significant improvement in its antibacterial properties [<a href=\"#ozae044.413-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"02e80cf707b99d03e8157a637067373a6186e7d7fcb797c98a8e63fbeed2dfd2","category":"Environment"}
