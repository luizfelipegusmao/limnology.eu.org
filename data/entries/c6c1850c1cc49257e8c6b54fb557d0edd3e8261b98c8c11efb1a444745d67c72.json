{"title":"Drug Repurposing with Minocycline and Japanese Kampo Medicine for MPox: Predicting Efficacy Through In Silico Studies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1128/v1","date":1726378379000,"content":"Beginning in 2022, the Mpox outbreak, formerly known as monkeypox, has since spread to more than 100 countries and is now a global public health concern. This disease, caused by the Mpox virus, is usually mild, and most infected individuals recover within a few weeks without treatment. However, severe cases have been seen especially in children, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals. Antiviral medications such as brincidofovir, tecovirimat, and cidofovir were recently approved for Mpox; but these drugs are expensive and not easily obtainable. Therefore, identifying effective and low-cost drugs against Mpox and testing these through clinical trials remains a priority for global health. Drug repurposing is a well-known strategy for redeploying existing licensed drugs for newer indications, allowing for the shortest possible transition from bench to bedside. Recent in silico studies have determined the efficacy of minocycline, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and glycyrrhizinic acid against Mpox virus. Notably, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and glycyrrhizinic acid are some of the components of Japanese Kampo medicines, which are low-cost medicines prescribed daily in Japan. Thus, minocycline and Japanese Kampo medicines could potentially be used to treat Mpox.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c6c1850c1cc49257e8c6b54fb557d0edd3e8261b98c8c11efb1a444745d67c72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
