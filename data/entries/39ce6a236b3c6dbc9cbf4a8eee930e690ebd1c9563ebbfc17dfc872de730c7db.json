{"title":"Visual Odometry in GPS Denied Zones for Fixed-Wing UAV with Reduced Accumulative Error Based on Satellite Imaginary","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1853/v1","date":1714356499000,"content":"In this paper, we present a method for estimating GPS signals from visual information captured by a monocular camera mounted on a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. The main challenge in visual odometry from aerial images is the computation of scale due to irregularities in the elevation of the terrain. That is, it is not possible to accurately convert from pixels in the image to meters in space, and the error accumulates. The contribution of this work is to reduce the accumulated error by comparing the images from the camera with satellite images. The algorithm has been tested in real-time experiments, and the results show that it is possible to eliminate the accumulated error using satellite images.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"39ce6a236b3c6dbc9cbf4a8eee930e690ebd1c9563ebbfc17dfc872de730c7db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
