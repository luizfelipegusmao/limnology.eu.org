{"title":"Tensile Specimen Circular Grid Pattern and AI-Based Strain Calculation Method","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2393/v1","date":1722406006000,"content":"During tensile testing of materials, strain measurement is conducted using either contact or non-contact methods. Contact methods offer high accuracy and precision but are limited by the specimen's thickness and dimensions, whereas non-contact methods minimize damage to thin specimens and allow measurements in various environments, though they require longer prep-aration and calculation times. This paper proposes a circular grid marking pattern and a strain prediction algorithm using artificial intelligence (AI), which simplifies the preparation process and allows strain prediction without additional equipment. The circular grid pattern can be ar-ranged in various configurations from 1×5 to 5×7, and a laser marker, which requires minimal time, was used to engrave the pattern on the specimen to shorten the preparation time. The AI model, trained on image-based data, enables strain calculation regardless of the specimen's gauge length and size, and allows measurement of local strain as well as gauge-length strain. The reliability of this concept was verified by applying it to tensile testing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"02a5beab8cc107cd4e63314e09b51f42e152f2ab4ceb82ece9c02d7110f7d0ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
