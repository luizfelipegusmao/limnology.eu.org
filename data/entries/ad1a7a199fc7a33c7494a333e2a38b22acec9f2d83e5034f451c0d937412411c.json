{"title":"Linnean and Wallacean shortfalls of Leptophlebiidae (Ephemeroptera: Insecta) in the Brazilian Amazon","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4163?af=R","date":1715929200000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nOne of the primary challenges in biodiversity conservation is the limited knowledge of the taxonomy and geographical distribution of species, particularly in megadiverse regions such as the Amazon\nIn this context, the present study aimed to mitigate the Linnean and Wallacean shortfalls within the Family Leptophlebiidae (Ephemeroptera: Insecta) in the Brazilian Amazon, identify priority areas for conducting faunal inventories and enhance taxonomic knowledge of this group.\nUtilizing both primary Leptophlebiidae data collected in the state of Pará, and secondary data compiled from the literature on species occurring in the Amazon, we employed Species Distribution Modelling to identify areas with higher potential species richness and priority areas for faunal inventories in the Brazilian Amazon of the family.\nFor the primary data, 2,120 specimens were identified, representing 16 genera and 28 species. Among the 28 species analysed, 7 constitute new records for the state of Pará. Additionally, two new genera, five new species and six morphospecies were identified, significantly expanding the taxonomic landscape of the family in the state. Maps depicting potential species richness and priority areas for faunal inventories in the Brazilian Amazon generated from the Modelling indicated that the states of Pará and the western region of Maranhão exhibit high potential species richness, with overlapping areas identified as priorities for Leptophlebiidae faunal inventories.\nIn this context, this study represents a substantial advancement in the taxonomic knowledge of Leptophlebiidae in the state of Pará and the Amazon, underscoring the urgency of research and biodiversity conservation efforts for the group in the region. Furthermore, the identification of new taxa emphasizes the need for ongoing collaborative efforts to mitigate Linnean and Wallacean shortfalls.\n</p>","author":"Myllena Lima, \nFrederico F.
