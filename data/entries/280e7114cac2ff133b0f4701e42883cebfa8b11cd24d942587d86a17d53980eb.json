{"title":"Calibrated forecasts of quasi‚Äêperiodic climate processes with deep echo state networks and penalized quantile regression","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2833?af=R","date":1705281456000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Among the most relevant processes in the Earth system for human habitability are quasi-periodic, ocean-driven multi-year events whose dynamics are currently incompletely characterized by physical models, and hence poorly predictable. This work aims at showing how (1) data-driven, stochastic machine learning approaches provide an affordable yet flexible means to forecast these processes; (2) the associated uncertainty can be properly calibrated with fast ensemble-based approaches. While the methodology introduced and discussed in this work pertains to synoptic scale events, the principle of augmenting incomplete or highly sensitive physical systems with data-driven models to improve predictability is far more general and can be extended to environmental problems of any scale in time or space.</p>","author":"Matthew Bonas, \nChristopher K.
