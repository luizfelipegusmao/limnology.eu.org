{"title":"Results of the Second Life Metabolism Travel Awards 2024","link":"https://academic.oup.com/lifemeta/article/doi/10.1093/lifemeta/loae007/7632323?rss=1","date":1710892800000,"content":"<span>This year is the second year of the Life Metabolism Travel Prize Awards for PhD students and postdocs. The three 700 US$ awards are generously sponsored by Sable Systemsâ€“Promethion (China) who manufacture metabolic chambers. Before I announce the winners and their interesting projects, I will just reiterate how the judging of the awards works. We first remove anything from the submission that would identify the sex, affiliation, or ethnicity of the applicant. The anonymized abstracts are then sent to a panel of six independent reviewers. Each reviewer gets six votes to allocate to the abstracts that they think should win. So the maximum anyone could get would be six votes. This year we had three submissions that each polled four votes each. These are our winners. In no particular order, they are Sebastian Kreimendahl from the Pernas lab at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Dipsikha Biswas from the Sakamoto lab at the Novo-Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR), University of Copenhagen, and Xinyue Qi, from the Hui lab at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"ef4ea0d90d3005b14f1198584f187593a1947d1ebf77a669bba687ec444fefbf","category":"Environment"}
