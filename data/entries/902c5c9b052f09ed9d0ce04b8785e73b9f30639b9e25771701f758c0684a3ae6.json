{"title":"Proteomics analysis of enzyme systems and pathway changes during the moromi fermentation of soy sauce mash","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13398?af=R","date":1710844370000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>During the brewing of soy sauce, the conversion of multiple substances is driven by various microorganisms and their secreted enzyme systems. Soy sauce mash is an important source of enzyme systems during moromi fermentation, but the changes of enzyme systems in soy sauce mash during moromi fermentation are poorly understood. In order to explore the predominant enzyme systems existing during moromi fermentation and to explain the characteristics of the enzyme system changes, an enzymatic activities assay and 4D-label-free proteomics analysis were conducted on soy sauce mash at different stages of fermentation.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The activities of hydrolytic enzymes in soy sauce mash decreased continuously throughout the fermentation process, while most of the characteristic physicochemical substances in soy sauce mash supernatant had already accumulated at the early stage of fermentation. Four hydrolytic enzymes were found to be positively correlated with important physicochemical indexes by principal component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis. The proteomics analysis revealed three highly upregulated enzymes and two enzymes that were present in important metabolic pathways throughout the fermentation process. Furthermore, it was found that <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i> was able to accumulate various nutrients in the soy sauce mash by downregulating most of its metabolic pathways.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Enzymes present with excellent properties during the moromi fermentation period could be obtained from these results. Meanwhile, the characterization of the metabolic pathways of microorganisms during the moromi fermentation period was revealed. The results provide a basis for more scientific and purposeful improvement of moromi fermentation in the future. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Wen‐Bin He, \nSha Hou, \nLong‐Ying Zeng, \nHong‐Biao Tang, \nXing Tong, \nChang‐Zheng Wu, \nXiang Liu, \nGe Tan, \nLi‐Qiong Guo, \nJun‐Fang Lin","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"902c5c9b052f09ed9d0ce04b8785e73b9f30639b9e25771701f758c0684a3ae6","category":"Environment"}
