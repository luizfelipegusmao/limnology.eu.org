To elucidate this mechanism, the individual optical properties of pigments in the LHCII protein must be identified. In vitro reconstitution with apoproteins synthesized by <span>Escherichia coli</span> and pigmentâ€“lipid mixtures from natural sources is an effective approach; however, the local environment surrounding each pigment within reconstituted LHCII (rLHCII) has only been indirectly estimated using spectroscopic and biochemical methods. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the 3D structure of the rLHCII trimer and found that rLHCII exhibited a structure that was virtually identical to that of native LHCII, with a few exceptions: some C-terminal amino acids were not visible, likely due to aggregation of the His-tags; a carotenoid at the V1 site was not visible; and at site 614 showed mixed occupancy by both chlorophyll <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> molecules. Our observations confirmed the applicability of the in vitro reconstitution technique.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"d79eeda3853056a4fe05edb2ae1a2a6426107fcded5873fbc6efb30f776161c7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
