Plant functional traits and microbes under P-deficient conditions can respond positively to increase soil P bioavailability. Whether and/or how the fine-root traits (FRTs) of deep-rooted desert species affect the rhizosphere and bulk soil community of <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria and thus improve the availability of soil P, however, remains unclear.\n\nWe conducted a three-year artificial outdoor pot experiment of P supply using <i>Alhagi sparsifolia</i> Shap. (hereafter <i>Alhagi</i>) to address this gap. Fine-root samples from 1- and 3-year-old <i>Alhagi</i> seedlings and samples of the rhizospheres and bulk soil were collected. High-throughput sequencing, sequential extraction and root system scanning were used to determine soil <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria community, Hedley-P fractions and the FRTs.\n\nFine-root surface area (RSA), specific root length, foliar Mn concentration (indicating the quantities of root carboxylates that are released) and acid phosphatase (APase) activity were significantly higher in the no-P supply compared with the high-P supply conditions. APase activity was significantly higher by 27%, but the foliar Mn concentration was remarkably lower by 26%, in the 3- than the 1-year-old seedlings. The rhizospheric concentrations of labile P, moderately labile P, inorganic P and organic P in the no-P supply condition were 5%, 11%, 10% and 21% higher, respectively, in the 3- than the 1-year-old seedlings. RSA and the foliar Mn concentration were dominated root predictors for the rhizospheric <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria community for the 1-year-old seedlings, whereas fine-root P concentration was the dominated root predictor for the rhizospheric and bulk soil <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria communities for the 3-year-old seedlings. Soil water content, as the most dominant soil factor driving the variation of <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria community, notably could not be ignored. FRTs were the main factors that directly and positively determined rhizospheric <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria community and thus influenced soil P availability, but bulk soil <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria community were dominated by inorganic P concentration. The importance of fine-root morphological traits to soil P availability gradually increased as the plants grew.\n\nOverall, our results emphasize the significance of rhizospheric <i>phoD</i>-harbouring bacteria determined by the effect of FRTs on the bioavailability of soil P.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/02/rhizospheric-phod-harboring-bacteria-shaped-by-fine-root-traits-are-committed-to-mediating-soil-phosphorus-availability/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Yanju Gao, \nAkash Tariq, \nFanjiang Zeng, \nJordi Sardans, \nDhafer A.
