While scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) has proven invaluable in revealing intricate molecular and nanoscale details of these interfaces, the unique nature of hybrid composites introduces a series of challenges that complicate the assessment and establishment of structureâ€“property-function relationships [<a href=\"#ozae044.946-B1\">1</a>]. Traditional imaging techniques, including S/TEM, often struggle to meet the demands for resolution and contrast needed to fully visualize these complex interfaces, hindering our understanding of their fundamental properties. Figure 1 shows an example of a typical STEM acquisition on a Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) particle, the electron beam damage after one scanning is noticeable. This motivates this work where we dedicate our efforts towards pushing the boundaries of material characterization by optimizing electron ptychography acquisition and reconstruction algorithms, aiming to significantly improve the visualization of soft/hard interfaces. We focus on MOFs as they stand out due to their unparalleled structural versatility and functional diversity, serving as a prime example of the complexity inherent in soft/hard interfaces. Their unique combination of metal nodes and organic linkers, exhibit a wide range of properties that can be finely tuned for applications in gas storage, catalysis, drug delivery, and more [<a href=\"#ozae044.946-B2\">2-4</a>]. However, the intricate interfacial interactions within MOFs, especially when integrating soft and hard phases, pose significant analytical challenges that traditional imaging modalities struggle to overcome.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"017798c8f465a3f1e9ea1697ecc0da8d731ef5f7e481fa4fb736e808558ea7f7","category":"Environment"}
