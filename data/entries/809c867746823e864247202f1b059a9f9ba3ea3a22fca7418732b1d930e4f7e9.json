{"title":"Development of an Italian National Epidemiological Register on Endometriosis based on Administrative Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1326/v1","date":1713768509000,"content":"Background: Endometriosis is a female chronic inflammatory disease in which endometrial tissue develops outside the uterine cavity. It is a complex pathology, that significantly contributes to morbidity in premenopausal women, leading to chronic pain, infertility, and subfertility negatively impacting the physical, and emotional well-being and overall quality of life. The public health burden of endometriosis remains elusive and challenging to determine, and this uncertainty can lead to inadequate healthcare services and treatments. Objective: To estimate the incidence and prevalence of endometriosis in Italy using the hospital discharge records database. Population-based retrospective study. Nationwide between 2011 and 2020. Methods: From the National Hospital Discharge Database were selected all admissions with a diagnosis of endometriosis (ICD-9-CM, codes 617.x), supported by the presence of a procedure code of laparoscopy or any other surgical procedure allowing direct visualisation of the lesions. Main outcomes measures Incidence and prevalence of endometriosis were estimated for the entire 2010-2020 period and by individual year, analysing the time trend and variability in different geographical areas of Italy. Results: A total of 134,667,646 women aged 15â€“50 years with one or more hospitalisations for endometriosis in all Italian hospitals. The incidence of endometriosis in Italy during this period was 0.839 per 1000 women (CI95% 0.834-0.844), exhibiting a statistically significant decreasing trend over the years. A discernible north-south gradient was observed, with higher rates documented in the northern regions. The prevalence rate stood at 14.0 per 1000 during the same period, and a similar north-south geographical gradient was identifiable in the prevalence rates as well. Conclusions: The utilization of national-level hospital data enables the generation of incidence and prevalence data for endometriosis without variations in methods and definitions, facilitating the evaluation of temporal trends and regional comparisons. Understanding and quantifying this phenomenon is essential for appropriate healthcare planning in various Italian regions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"809c867746823e864247202f1b059a9f9ba3ea3a22fca7418732b1d930e4f7e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
