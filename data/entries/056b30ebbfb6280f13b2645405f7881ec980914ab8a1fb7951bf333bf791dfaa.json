{"title":"Response surface methodology for optimizing corrosion inhibition: investigating the synergistic effect of Eriobotrya japonica extract and potassium iodide","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s41207-023-00457-0","date":1717200000000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This work investigates the effects of ethanolic extract of <em>Eriobotrya japonica</em> (EEJS) and iodide ions (I<sup>−</sup>) as well as temperature and immersion time on C38 steel corrosion inhibition in hydrochloride medium. The effect of each factor on corrosion inhibition was assessed and a modeling approach that reflects the significance of each parameter via response surface methodology was developed. The results revealed positive impacts of inhibitor concentration and immersion time on the inhibitory capacity, while temperature disfavored the inhibition. Reliability was proven using an electrochemical test encompassing open circuit potential, spectroscopic impedance and Tafel curves. The analysis confirmed that there was a synergistic effect of the ethanolic extract and iodide ions: the inhibitory efficacy increased from 85.21% with EEJS only and 87.64% with iodide ions only to 93.64% with both EEJS and iodide ions when inhibition was calculated based on spectroscopic impedance, and it increased from 84.71% with EEJS only and 85.82% with iodide ions only to 94.05% with both EEJS and iodide ions when inhibition was calculated from the intensity–potential curve; in both cases, <em>C</em><sub>EEJS</sub> was 1.5 g/L,<em> C</em><sub>KI</sub> was 0.008 mol/L,<em> T</em> was 50 ℃, and the immersion time was 8 h. This study provides evidence for a synergistic effect of inhibitors. A model is developed that describes the impacts of factors and their interactions and demonstrates the applicability of response surface methodology in determining the optimum conditions for achieving high protective efficacy.</p>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Graphical abstract</h3>\n                      <p>\n      <span>\n                        <span>\n                          <img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/MediaObjects/41207_2023_457_Figa_HTML.png\" />\n                        </span>\n                      </span></p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"056b30ebbfb6280f13b2645405f7881ec980914ab8a1fb7951bf333bf791dfaa","category":"Environment"}
