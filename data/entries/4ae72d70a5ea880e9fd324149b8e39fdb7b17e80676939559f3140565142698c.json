This capacity to capture CO<sub>2</sub> makes them an attractive chassis for solar energy–driven microbial cell factories to produce useful biomolecules. In fact, model cyanobacterial strains, such as <span>Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803, <span>Synechococcus elongatus</span> PCC 7942, and <span>Synechococcus</span> sp. PCC 7002, have been engineered to manufacture commodity products such as biofuels, natural food additives, and terpenoids (<a href=\"#kiae412-B2\">Bühler and Lindberg 2023</a>). For industrial setups, highly productive, fast-growing strains are particularly attractive and have potential to increase yields, thus lowering production costs (<a href=\"#kiae412-B8\">Selão 2022</a>). However, molecular tools are largely lacking for these fast-growing strains to engineer them into cellular factories.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"4ae72d70a5ea880e9fd324149b8e39fdb7b17e80676939559f3140565142698c","category":"Environment"}
