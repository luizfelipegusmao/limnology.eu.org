{"title":"Prospects and Obstacles Associated with Community Solar and Wind Farms in Jordan Suburban Areas","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1336/v1","date":1711101714000,"content":"Presently, Jordan confronts a double substantial challenge of enhancing energy security and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most encouraging avenues to attain the objectives of sustainable development, energy security, and environmental conservation is to enhance the integration of renewable energy into the generation of electricity. In pursuit of this goal, the Jordanian government intends to expand investments in the green energy sector, with solar and wind energy poised to play a key role in satisfying energy demands and cultivating an environmental sustainability. This paper aims to examine the distinctive dynamics, challenges, obstacles, and potential solutions corresponding to the establishment of community solar and wind farms in Jordan suburban areas. It aims to highlight the opportunities and barriers influencing the track of sustainable energy adoption in the country. Through a comprehensive analysis of the Jordanian context, the goal is to extract insights that can guide policies and practices. Additionally, the findings may serve as a valuable benchmark for other regions confronting similar challenges on their pursuit for a sustainable energy future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5ecf0b26d33402aabae862a91b73d881f5c87d89fccdbfa66a5453e6c037e5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
