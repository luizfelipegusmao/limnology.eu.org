Appropriate and timely diagnosis and risk stratification for severe disease are crucial in the appropriate management of this illness. Healthcare providers (HCPs) play a key role in dengue fever diagnosis, management and prevention. The present study was conducted to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among HCPs in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional survey among 948 HCPs, using a structured questionnaire, was conducted in East Azerbaijan Province from May to July 2022. Data analysis was undertaken using descriptive methods, the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, and logistic regression. A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered for statistical significance.</p> Results <p>Out of the 948 (68.5% female) respondents, 227 were physicians and 721 were health professionals. The knowledge level of DF was found to be largely inadequate in the present study population (80.4%). The physician vs. health professional were a significant factor in differentiating attitude scores. The mean practice score regarding DF prevention and control measures among respondents was 8.40±1.97.</p> Conclusion <p>The findings call for urgent continuous education and training courses to increase KAP levels and increased capacity and capability for DF prevention and control. This is of outmost importance for the first point of care of DF patients.</p>","author":"Madineh Abbasi","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"eb0e7cd9b34535a97698c74c7492a499cc531d02b815bd643e627c72387ab4ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
