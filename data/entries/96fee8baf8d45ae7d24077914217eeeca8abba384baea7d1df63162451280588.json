{"title":"Long-COVID symptom monitoring: Insights from a two-year telemedicine study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307834","date":1722002400000,"content":"<p>by Andrea Foppiani, Chiara Montanari, Sara Zanelli, Michele Davide Maria Lombardo, Valeria Calcaterra, Gianvincenzo Zuccotti</p>\r\nBackground <p>The diverse manifestations of Long-COVID have become increasingly important due to their significant impact on patientsâ€™ lives. Telemedicine has emerged as an important tool for post COVID-19 follow-up. This study is part of a large cohort study involving COVID-positive patients monitored by the COD19 telemedicine platform operations center. We recontacted patients who were initially monitored from February 2020 to May 2020 to assess the presence of Long-COVID symptoms at a 2-year follow-up.</p> Methods <p>We conducted interviews to evaluate Long-COVID symptoms at the 2-year mark and investigated whether patients had contracted a second COVID-19 infection between the 1-year and 2-year follow-ups, and recorded their vaccination status.</p> Results <p>Out of 165 patients, 139 (84%) reported symptoms at the 1-year follow-up, while only 101 (61%) reported symptoms at the 2-year follow-up. Among patients with Long-COVID symptoms at the 2-year follow-up, the majority (80, 49%) had experienced Long-COVID at the 1-year follow-up, received the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and had not experienced a second infection between the two follow-ups. Both having Long-COVID at the 1-year follow-up and contracting a second infection were significant risk factors for presenting with Long-COVID at the 2-year follow-up.</p> Conclusions <p>To the best of our knowledge, this study stands out as one of the few that includes a 2-year follow-up on Long-COVID symptoms using telemedicine. Telemedicine has proven to be an effective and innovative tool for long-term patient monitoring, early diagnosis, and treatment. Telemedicine represents a significant future challenge for healthcare.</p>","author":"Andrea Foppiani","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"96fee8baf8d45ae7d24077914217eeeca8abba384baea7d1df63162451280588","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
