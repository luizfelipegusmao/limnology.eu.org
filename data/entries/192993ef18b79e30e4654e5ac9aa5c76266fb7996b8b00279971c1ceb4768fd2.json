{"title":"Relationship between stable cesium concentration and body size of Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus and the effect of a size‐dependent shift in diet","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15629?af=R","date":1710504692000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>To understand the relationship between the radioactive cesium (Cs) concentration in muscle of Japanese flounder <i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i> and the species' biological characteristics (size, sex, and age) under conditions of ecological equilibrium (i.e., distributed among ecosystem components over sufficient time, and with nearly constant ratios of Cs concentration in organisms to the concentration in water) as existed before the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS), Japan, in 2011, we examined stable Cs, as it is thought to exist in equilibrium in the environment and behave similarly to radioactive Cs in aquatic animals. The concentration of stable Cs in 241 <i>P. olivaceus</i> (range 216–782 mm total length [TL]) collected in Sendai Bay, approximately 90 km north of the FDNPS, in June–July 2015 was expressed as an exponential function with size as an independent variable; the results show the concentration of stable Cs doubled with an increase in TL of 442 mm. Next, to evaluate the cause of the size-dependent change in stable Cs concentration, we examined 909 individuals (200–770 mm TL) collected in September 2013–July 2015 to determine their feeding habit based on size. Analysis of the frequency of occurrence of prey organisms in stomach contents showed that sand lance <i>Ammodytes japonicus</i> (55–180 mm standard length [SL]) was the most consistently consumed across size classes. Analysis on a wet-mass basis showed that <i>A. japonicus</i> and anchovy <i>Engraulis japonicus</i> (65–130 mm SL) were the main food of <i>P. olivaceus</i> sized 200–599 mm TL, whereas chub mackerel <i>Scomber japonicus</i> (120–230 mm SL) and two species of flatfishes (180–205 mm SL) were abundant in the diet of <i>P. olivaceus</i> sized ≥600 mm TL. All these prey items were presumed to have similar concentrations of stable Cs. Based on the above, the effect of diet on the relationship between stable Cs in muscle and fish size was considered negligible. That the diet of <i>P. olivaceus</i> largely did not change with size was also confirmed by C and N stable isotope ratios in <i>P. olivaceus</i> and their prey species. Therefore, the Cs–size relationship is probably determined by changes in the balance between the rate of Cs intake from food and seawater and the excretion rate during growth, both of which change as functions of body mass. Values of stable Cs concentrations among environmental components and animals appear to be a valid indicator for understanding the radioactive Cs distribution in the marine environment and aquatic animals under the equilibrium state, as existed before the 2011 nuclear accident.</p>","author":"Yutaka Kurita, \nKotaro Shirai, \nKaoru Kubota, \nHiroyuki Togashi, \nTakami Morita","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"192993ef18b79e30e4654e5ac9aa5c76266fb7996b8b00279971c1ceb4768fd2","category":"Environment"}
