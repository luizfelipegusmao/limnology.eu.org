{"title":"RBD Specific B-Cell Memory Responses Among Individuals Vaccinated Against SARS-CoV-2","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0230/v2","date":1727693471000,"content":"During the last few years, the world witnessed one of the worst calamities affecting humankind- the COVID-19 pandemic. We also witnessed the development of vaccines at an unprecedented pace against the SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent. India, which was one of the countries most impacted by COVID-19, developed its indigenous vaccine in addition to utilizing the ones developed by other countries. Initially, the antibody level and the neutralizing antibody titer against the pathogen were considered as the correlates of immune protection from the disease. The long-term protection from the pathogen is provided by the immune memory cells viz. T and B memory cells and their ability of efficient recall responses. In this regard, global research focused mainly on the mRNA-based vaccines. The studies on immune memory response, particularly- the B cell memory response bestowed by the vaccines given to Indians is relatively obscure. In this work, we examined the level of RBD specific memory B cells in the peripheral circulation of the study participants and the ability of B cells to secrete antigen-specific antibodies among Indians vaccinated with Covaxin (BBV152), Covishield (AZD1222), Corbevax (BECOV2D) and Sputnik Light as well as unvaccinated individuals. Our study revealed that Corbevax and Sputnik Light conferred better antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17197743bc2e304a423a5da81b880f1300980c848de04641b62e36c56d88e81c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
