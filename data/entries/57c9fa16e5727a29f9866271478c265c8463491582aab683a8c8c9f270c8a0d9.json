{"title":"Thermochemical Transformation of Municipal Household Solid Waste Fractions into Bio-Oils and Bio-Adsorbents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0084/v1","date":1712053515000,"content":"This work aims to investigate the effect of process temperature and catalyst content by thermochemical degradation of municipal solid waste (MSW) fraction (organic matter + paper + plastic) on the yield of reaction products (bio-oil, biochar, H2O and gas), physicochemical properties and chemical composition of bio-oils, as well as on the morphology and crystalline phases of biochar in laboratory scale. The organic matter, paper and plastic segregated from the gravimetric composition of total waste sample were subjected to the pre-treatments of drying, crushing and sieving. The experiments were carried out at 400, 450 and 475 °C and 1.0 atmosphere, and at 450 °C and 1.0 at-mosphere, using 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0% (wt.) of FCC zeolite, bath mode, using a laborato-ry scale glass reactor. The bio-oil was characterized for acidic value. The chemical functions present in the bio-oil identified by FT-IR and the composition by GC-MS. Biochar was characterized by SEM/EDS and XRD. Thermal pyrolysis of the MSW frac-tion (organic matter + paper + plastic) shows bio-oil yields between 9.44 and 9.24% (wt.), aqueous phase yields between 21.93 and 18.78% (wt.), solid phase yields between 67.97 and 40.34% (wt.) and gas yields between 28.27 and 5.92% (wt.). The yield of bio-oil decreases with increasing process temperature. For the experiments using FCC, the biochar and gas yields increase slightly with the FCC content, while that of bio-oil de-creases and the H2O phase remains constant. The GC-MS of bio-oils identified the presence of hydrocarbons and oxygenates, as well as nitrogen-containing compounds, including amides and amines. The acidity of the bio-oil increased with increasing temperature and with the aid of FCC as a catalyst. It has been identified the presence of hydrocarbons within bio-oil by addition of FCC catalyst due to the deoxygenation of carboxylic acids, followed by decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions, producing aliphatic and aromatic hy-drocarbons.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"57c9fa16e5727a29f9866271478c265c8463491582aab683a8c8c9f270c8a0d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
