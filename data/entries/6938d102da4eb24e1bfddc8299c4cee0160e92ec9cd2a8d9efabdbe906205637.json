{"title":"Arinole, a novel auxin-stimulating benzoxazole, affects root growth and promotes adventitious root formation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/18/5681/7699441?rss=1","date":1719360000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The triple response phenotype is characteristic for seedlings treated with the phytohormone ethylene or its direct precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylic acid, and is often employed to find novel chemical tools to probe ethylene responses. We identified a benzoxazole-urea derivative (B2) partially mimicking ethylene effects in a triple response bioassay. A phenotypic analysis demonstrated that B2 and its closest analogue arinole (ARI) induced phenotypic responses reminiscent of seedlings with elevated levels of auxin, including impaired hook development and inhibition of seedling growth. Specifically, ARI reduced longitudinal cell elongation in roots, while promoting cell division. In contrast to other natural or synthetic auxins, ARI mostly acts as an inducer of adventitious root development, with only limited effects on lateral root development. Quantification of free auxins and auxin biosynthetic precursors as well as auxin-related gene expression demonstrated that ARI boosts global auxin levels. In addition, analyses of auxin reporter lines and mutants, together with pharmacological assays with auxin-related inhibitors, confirmed that ARI effects are facilitated by TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE1 (TAA1)-mediated auxin synthesis. ARI treatment in an array of species, including Arabidopsis, pea, tomato, poplar, and lavender, resulted in adventitious root formation, which is a desirable trait in both agriculture and horticulture.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"6938d102da4eb24e1bfddc8299c4cee0160e92ec9cd2a8d9efabdbe906205637","category":"Environment"}
