Clinical data show that each step of the metastatic cascade presents increasing barriers to success, limiting the number of successful metastatic cells to fewer than 1 in 1,500,000,000. As such, it is critical for scientists to employ approaches that allow for the evaluation of metastatic competency at each step of the cascade. Here, we present a flow cytometry-based method that enables swift and simultaneous comparison of both CTCs and DTCs from single animals, enabling evaluation of multiple metastatic steps within a single model system. We present the necessary gating strategy and optimized sample preparation conditions necessary to capture CTCs and DTCs using this approach. We also provide proof-of-concept experiments emphasizing the appropriate limits of detection of these conditions. Most importantly, we successfully recover CTCs and DTCs from murine blood and bone marrow. In Supplemental materials, we expand the applicability of our method to lung tissue and exemplify a potential multi-plexing strategy to further characterize recovered CTCs and DTCs. This approach to multiparameter flow cytometric detection and analysis of rare cells in <span>in vivo</span> models of metastasis is reproducible, high throughput, broadly applicable, and highly adaptable to a wide range of scientific inquiries. Most notably, it simplifies the recovery and analysis of CTCs and DTCs from the same animal, allowing for a rapid first look at the comparative metastatic competency of various model systems throughout multiple steps of the metastatic cascade.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biology Methods and Protocols Current Issue","siteHash":"69c994dba77628d461517adf354c299799d03c68fbf0494d0a5619d40a95f351","entryHash":"3c662e3cff71f246b85bcc0cfeba56474f0181ce9660083baff4916f3a1758c9","category":"Environment"}
