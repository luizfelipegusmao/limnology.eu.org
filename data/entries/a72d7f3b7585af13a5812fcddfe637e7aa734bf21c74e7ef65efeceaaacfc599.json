{"title":"Effects of Cadmium Stress on Seed Germination and Physiology and Biochemistry during Early Seedling Growth of Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/70/3/242/7638860?rss=1","date":1711929600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study evaluated the effects of cadmium (Cd) on seed germination and the physiological and biochemical characteristics of <span>Pinus massoniana</span>, which was used as the experimental material; culture dishes and germination boxes were used as testing devices. Seed germination and seedling growth in the presence of various Cd concentrations (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 2, and 0 mg/L) were explored. The germination indexes of <span>Pinus massoniana s</span>eeds used were germination percentage (GP), germination energy (GE), germination index (GI), vigor index (VI). and embryo length. The indexes of early growth of seedlings used were soluble sugar and soluble protein content, antioxidant enzyme activity, Cd content, and Cd enrichment. We found that <span>Pinus massoniana</span> presented reduced GP, GE, GI, VI, and embryo length with increasing Cd concentrations, and the VI and embryo length significantly decreased (<span>P</span> &lt; .05). The physiological and biochemical indexes of <span>Pinus massoniana</span> seedlings were promoted at low Cd concentrations and inhibited at high Cd concentrations; each index peaked under 0.4 mg/L Cd. The Cd content in seedlings and the degree of enrichment decreased and then increased with increasing Cd concentration. Grey correlation analysis results showed that the effects of Cd stress were the strongest on embryo length in seeds (correlation degree: 0.769).<strong>Study Implications</strong>: The effect of heavy metal pollution on seed germination and growth is closely related to phytoremediation of heavy metal soil. <span>Pinus massoniana</span> is the most widely distributed pine species in China. It is an economically important industrial timber with important ecological value. This study found that under the stress of different cadmium concentrations, heavy metal Cd stress inhibited the germination of <span>Pinus massoniana</span> seeds, and moderate Cd concentration promoted the physiological and biochemical of <span>Pinus massoniana</span> seedlings. <span>Pinus massoniana</span> seedlings have the ability to enrich heavy metal Cd.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Forest Science Current Issue","siteHash":"05e2fee9ae6a27cd288c89ae75adf607539d339849a171c4fab1eaa2f11b4162","entryHash":"a72d7f3b7585af13a5812fcddfe637e7aa734bf21c74e7ef65efeceaaacfc599","category":"Environment"}
