In Qinghai-Tibetan grassland communities that differed in aboveground biomass (AGB) and species diversity, we found significant influence of AGB on both species’ reproductive biomass allocation (RBA) and flowering and fruiting time, but of species diversity only on species’ reproductive time. In high-AGB or high-diversity communities, smaller and earlier flowering species generally advanced their reproductive phenology and increased their reproductive allocation for maximizing their reproductive success, whereas larger and later flowering species delayed their reproductive phenology and decreased their reproductive allocation for maximizing their vegetative growth and resource competition. This change in reproductive allocation with the variation in community structures was more pronounced in nonclonal as compared to clonal plant species. Thus, we evidence an important influence of community structure on plant sexual reproduction strategies, and the pattern of the influence depends largely on species biological attributes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"7ac4b680177e57180b689d1fb8c8659ea15f4596348f2ce8d12c6cc8c8e45c51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
