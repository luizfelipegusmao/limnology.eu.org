{"title":"Liver toxicity and repair evaluated by histopathology and electric modulus","link":"https://academic.oup.com/toxres/article/doi/10.1093/toxres/tfae175/7822188?rss=1","date":1728950400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Detoxification is one of the most important liver functions. Therefore, liver is the front line of defense when the biosystem faces drug overdose, toxins, and anything that may cause harm. Some famous antibiotics are known for their side effects on liver; one of them is amoxicillin, AM. This work has investigated the toxic effect of amoxicillin on rat’s liver with overdose (90 mg/kg) and has studied the ameliorative role of protective and therapeutic Ashwagandha seeds extract (ASE) at doses (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg) against this toxicity. To achieve this work, the authors used two modalities; the first is liver histopathology to figure out the amoxicillin and ASE effects and to detect the sensitivity of another modality; the electric modulus, and its related thermodynamic parameters of liver tissue. Histopathological examination showed that the role of therapeutic ASE in reducing amoxicillin (AM) toxicity was more effective than the protective one. Also, most dielectric and thermodynamic results achieved the same result. Histopathology confirmed the liver injury by amoxicillin and the partial repair by the biosystem using ASE. Moreover, electric modulus, related dielectric parameters, and their thermodynamic state functions showed different changes in their values under the effect of amoxicillin. Using ASE helped the biosystem to restore these changes near their control values.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"eebc651f6002d2f07c29be4cbdd2aaf47293e81bbc55d56a7396f3575ede79c9","category":"Environment"}
