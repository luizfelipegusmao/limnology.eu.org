{"title":"Effect of Lower Body, Core and Upper Body Kinematic Chain Exercise Protocol on Throwing Performance and Shoulder Muscle Strength Among University Shot Put Athletes &ndash; A Randomized Controlled Trial","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0812/v1","date":1715585572000,"content":"Background/Objectives: This study looks at how a kinematic chain exercise regimen that targets the lower, core, and upper body affects university shot put participants' shoulder muscle strength and throwing efficiency. This study fills an apparent research void on shot put training approaches by presenting a comprehensive kinematic chain workout program. It was anticipated that this method would improve performance the most, considering the complex biomechanical require-ments of the sport. Methodology: Athletes, seventy in age (19.87 Â± 1.31 years), were assigned into two groups at random: experimental (n = 35) and control (n = 35). While the control group carried on with their usual training, the experimental group participated in an 8-week kinematic chain training program, pre- and post-training evaluations were carried out to evaluate shot put throwing ability, shoulder muscle strength, and participant satisfaction with the exercise regimen. Results: demonstrated that, when compared to the control group, the athletes in the kinematic chain program had a significantly improved throwing distance (p = 0.01) and shoulder muscle strength (p = 0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant difference (p = 0.005) in the athletes' satisfaction levels with the workout program among those in the experimental group. This implies that a kinematic chain-focused strategy improves performance and emphasizes the significance this type of training is for shot put athlete performance. Conclusion: As an improvement forward in sports science, the study's finding promotes the inclusion of kinematic chain workouts in shot put training programs and calls for more research on kinematic chain-based approaches in a variety of sports.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5b73a3b686bbeb05dbed8c791a06ad13f6dfd688c1934148bd7664a90e8e881","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
