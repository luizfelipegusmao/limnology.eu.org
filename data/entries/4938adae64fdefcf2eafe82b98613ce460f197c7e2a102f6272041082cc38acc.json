{"title":"Reducing risk behaviours after stroke: An overview of reviews interrogating primary study data using the Theoretical Domains Framework","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302364","date":1714140000000,"content":"<p>by Patricia Hall, Maggie Lawrence, Thilo Kroll, Catherine Blake, James Matthews, Olive Lennon</p>\r\nBackground <p>Lifestyle changes, in addition to preventive medications, optimise stroke secondary prevention. Evidence from systematic reviews support behaviour-change interventions post-stroke to address lifestyle-related risk. However, understanding of the theory-driven mediators that affect behaviour-change post-stroke is lacking.</p> Methods <p>Electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Epistemonikos and Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews were searched to March 2023 for systematic reviews addressing behaviour-change after stroke. Primary studies from identified systematic reviews were interrogated for evidence supporting theoretically-grounded interventions. Data were synthesized in new meta-analyses examining behaviour-change domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and secondary prevention outcomes.</p> Results <p>From 71 identified SRs, 246 primary studies were screened. Only 19 trials (N = 2530 participants) were identified that employed theoretically-grounded interventions and measured associated mediators for behaviour-change. Identified mediators mapped to 5 of 14 possible TDF domains. Trial follow-up ranged between 1â€“12 months and no studies addressed primary outcomes of recurrent stroke or cardiovascular mortality and/or morbidity. Lifestyle interventions targeting mediators mapped to the TDF <i>Knowledge</i> domain may improve the likelihood of medication adherence (OR 6.08 [2.79, 13.26], I<sup>2</sup> = 0%); physical activity participation (OR 2.97 [1.73, 5.12], I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) and smoking cessation (OR 10.37 [3.22, 33.39], I<sup>2</sup> = 20%) post-stroke, supported by low certainty evidence; Lifestyle interventions targeting mediators mapping to both TDF domains of <i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Beliefs about Consequences</i> may improve medication adherence post-stroke (SMD 0.36 [0.07, 0.64], I<sup>2</sup> = 13%, very low certainty evidence); Lifestyle interventions targeting mediators mapped to <i>Beliefs about Capabilities</i> and <i>Emotions</i> domains may modulate low mood post-stroke (SMD -0.70 [-1.28, -0.12], I<sup>2</sup> = 81%, low certainty evidence).</p> Conclusion <p>Limited theory-based research and use of behaviour-change mediators exists within stroke secondary prevention trials. <i>Knowledge</i>, <i>Beliefs about Consequences</i>, and <i>Emotions</i> are the domains which positively influence risk-reducing behaviours post-stroke. Behaviour-change interventions should include these evidence-based constructs known to be effective. Future trials should address cardiovascular outcomes and ensure adequate follow-up time.</p>","author":"Patricia Hall","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"4938adae64fdefcf2eafe82b98613ce460f197c7e2a102f6272041082cc38acc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
