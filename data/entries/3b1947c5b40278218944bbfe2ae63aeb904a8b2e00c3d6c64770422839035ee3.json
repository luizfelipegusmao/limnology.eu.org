{"title":"Ansys HFSS Evaluation of Periodic ZnO Nanorod Metamaterial  Unit Cell for Terahertz Broadband Antireflection Coatings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2063/v1","date":1721974476000,"content":"This paper proposes a theoretical silicon dioxide (SiO2) solar cell based dielectric met\u0002amaterial unit surface consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO) periodic nanorods of bandgap energy of 2.2-2.4eV. It evaluates the absorptive efficiency of the film using S-parameter and Z-parameter testing of magnitude, return/insertion loss, and impedance matching with respect to a frequency band of  0.0014-10.5THz. Terahertz applications of the result are considered due to potential scope for infra\u0002red (IR) and microwave (MW) spectral selectivity with ZnO. Calculations of input n-impedance and loss tangents are also presented with emphasis on the exhibition of antireflection to gauge the performance of the thin-film meta-surface in tandem solar cells. The data for the reflectance parameters of this structure, primarily the S11 loss and impedance matching (dB/dB10) are compared to those of prior investigations with different metamaterial coatings on SiO2 solar photovoltaic cells, as well as ZnO nanorods used in photovoltaic applications, to ascertain the cylindrical meta-surface structure with the preset thicknesses of the study being an effective anti-reflector. Application can be extended to other broadband domains requiring plasmonic graded refractive surfaces, in further work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b1947c5b40278218944bbfe2ae63aeb904a8b2e00c3d6c64770422839035ee3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
