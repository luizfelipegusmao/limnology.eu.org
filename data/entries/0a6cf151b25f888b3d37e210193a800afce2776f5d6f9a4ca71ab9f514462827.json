There are many examples of plant species in which oxalate and <span>l</span>-threonate are formed from <span>l</span>-ascorbate breakdown, and a number of roles have been proposed for this: structural, physiological, and biochemical. On the other hand, the synthesis of <span>l</span>-tartrate from <span>l</span>-ascorbate remains limited to a very few species, amongst which we must be grateful to count the domesticated grapevine <span>Vitis vinifera</span> and its relatives on which wine production is based. Pathways for the degradation of ascorbate were first proposed ~50 years ago and have formed the basis of more recent biochemical and molecular analyses. The present review seeks to summarize some of these findings and to propose opportunities for future research.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"0a6cf151b25f888b3d37e210193a800afce2776f5d6f9a4ca71ab9f514462827","category":"Environment"}
