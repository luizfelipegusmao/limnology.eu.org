{"title":"Creation of an Experimental Animal Model for the Study of Postmortal Dark Scleral Spots","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1040/v1","date":1723651457000,"content":": The phenomenon of dark scleral spots postmortem is well-known in forensic pathology, first de-scribed by Sommers in 1833. Despite this, their presence is currently considered a nonspecific sign, and their pathogenesis has received little attention in forensic literature. In recent years, however, preliminary studies have suggested new mechanisms in their pathogenesis and links to specific types of death. This study aims to create a model for studying scleral spots using an animal model. Thirty-three sheep, already slaughtered for food, were used. After decapitation, the heads were transported to an environment with known temperature and humidity. The right eye underwent eyelid excision, while the left eye's eyelids were sutured. Continuous observation for approximately 24 hours was conducted, with brief interruptions to observe the closed eyes. Macroscopic obser-vation revealed dark scleral spots in 100% (20 out of 20) of the open eyes after an average of 240.96Â± 58,36 minutes. The spots did not appear in any of the closed eyes. Experimental data indicate that, despite the different location compared to human cadavers, this model serves as an excellent ex-perimental framework for studying postmortem scleral spots.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a75f48eba6cf78d3448f4eff0edf1a0b57405b10556f69c39d9ae9226bceaada","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
