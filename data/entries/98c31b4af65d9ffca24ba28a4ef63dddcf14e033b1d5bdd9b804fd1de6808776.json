{"title":"The Evolving Global Epidemiology of Human Melioidosis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1336/v1","date":1726624316000,"content":"Endemic in over 45 countries globally, recent reports of locally acquired melioidosis in novel geographical areas, such as Southern US, have highlighted the expanding geographical range of Burkholderia pseudomallei. Climate change and severe weather events have been linked to an increase in cases of melioidosis, which follows environmental exposure to the bacterium. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the possibility of the disease, with its diverse and often delayed presentations, even in areas not previously known to have risk. Over 200 cases of travel-associated melioidosis have been reported in the literature, highlighting the need to consider this disease in non-endemic areas, as diagnostic delays of up to 18 months have been identified. The review updates the global epidemiology of melioidosis focusing on new geographical areas where cases have been diagnosed and imported cases, unusual clinical presentations and co-infections, and less frequent modes of transmission (laboratory exposures and the risk of acquisition due to imported infected animals and contaminated products).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"98c31b4af65d9ffca24ba28a4ef63dddcf14e033b1d5bdd9b804fd1de6808776","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
