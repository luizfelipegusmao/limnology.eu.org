This study explores the use of an L-shaped spinal bone anchor that is intended to establish a macro-shape lock with the posterior cortical layer of the vertebral body, thereby increasing the pull-out resistance of the anchor. The performance of this L-shaped anchor was evaluated in lumbar vertebra phantoms (L1-L5) across four distinct perpendicular orientations (lateral, medial, superior, and inferior). During the pull-out experiments, the pull-out force, and the displacement of the anchor with respect to the vertebra was measured which allowed the determination of the maximal pull-out force (mean: 123 N ± 25 N) and the initial pull-out force, the initial force required to start motion of the anchor (mean: 23 N ± 16 N). Notably, the maximum pull-out force was observed when the anchor engaged the cortical bone layer. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of utilising a spinal bone anchor featuring a macro-shape lock with the cortical bone layer to increase the pull-out force. Combining the macro shape-lock fixation method with the conventional pedicle screw shows the potential to significantly enhance the fixation strength of spinal bone anchors.","author":"Esther Paula de Kater","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9cdd3d87169e2217810c49fdb40311d057f7c5060aab88cce8e412454682f466","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
