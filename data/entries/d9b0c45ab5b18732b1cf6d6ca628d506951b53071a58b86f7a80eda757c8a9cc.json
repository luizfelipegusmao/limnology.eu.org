{"title":"Analysis of Disease Activity in Axial Spondyloarthritis Reveals That the Obesity-Activity Association Could Vary Depending on the Activity Index Chosen for This Purpose","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0545/v1","date":1728375440000,"content":"Background and aims: Obesity has been related to increased disease activity in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), but this association might vary depending on the composite index chosen to assess disease activity. We aim to check that possibility. Methods: Three hundred and thirty consecutive patients were recruited from the monographic axSpA unit of a university center. To assess disease activity, BASDAI and ASDAS-CRP measurements were collected. The factors associated with the different disease activity thresholds of these instruments were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: The study included 127 women and 203 men, mean age 47.6 (SD 12.9) years, median disease duration 8 years [IQR: 4-16], and 63% on biologic therapies. Most patients met therapeutic goals with a BASDAI &lt; 4 in 187 (56.7%) and ASDAS inactive/low category in 182 (55.2%). Being male was associated with BASDAI remission (OR 2.63), but smoking reduced this likelihood (OR 0.28). Similar findings were found for ASDAS inactive disease (male: OR 2.09; smoking: OR 0.39). The variables associated with BASDAI â‰¥ 4 in the multivariate logistic model were male (OR 0.36), age (OR 1.02), smoking (OR 2.39), and obesity (OR 2.94), whereas associations with active/very active ASDAS categories were male (OR 0.49), age (OR 1.02), and smoking (OR 2.34). However, obesity was not associated with these higher ASDAS categories (p = 0.183). Conclusions: While the association between smoking and increased disease activity was consistent across all composite activity indices, the obesity-activity relationship was only apparent through the BASDAI.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d9b0c45ab5b18732b1cf6d6ca628d506951b53071a58b86f7a80eda757c8a9cc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
