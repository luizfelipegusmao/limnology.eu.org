{"title":"Design of Multichannel Spectrum Intelligence Systems using Approximate DFT Algorithm for Antenna Array based Spectrum Perception Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0403/v1","date":1720084366000,"content":"The radio spectrum is a scarce and extremely valuable resource that demands careful real-time monitoring and dynamic resource allocation. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a new paradigm for managing the radio spectrum, which requires AI/ML driven algorithms for optimum performance under rapidly changing channel conditions and possible cyber-attacks in the electromagnetic domain. Fast sensing across multiple directions using array processors, with subsequent AI/ML based algorithms for sensing and perception of the waveforms that are measured from the environment is critical for providing decision support in DSA. As part of directional and wideband spectrum perception, the ability to finely channelize wideband inputs using efficient Fourier analysis is much needed. However, a fine-grain fast Fourier transform (FFT) across a large number of directions is computationally intensive and leads to high chip area and power consumption. We address this issue by exploiting recently proposed approximate discrete Fourier transforms (ADFT) which has its own sparse factorization for real-time implementation at low complexity and power consumption. The ADFT is used to create a wideband multi-beam RF digital beamformer and temporal spectrum-based attention unit which monitors 32~discrete directions across 32~sub-bands in real-time using a multiplierless algorithm having low computational complexity. The output of this spectral attention unit is applied as a decision variable to an intelligent receiver that adapts its center frequency and frequency resolution via FFT channelizers that are custom-built for real-time monitoring at high resolution. This two-step process allows the fine-gain FFT to be applied only to directions and bands of interest as determined by the ADFT based low-complexity 2D spacetime attention unit. The fine-grain FFT provides a spectral signature that can find future use cases in neural network engines for achieving modulation recognition, IoT device identification, and RFI identification. Beamforming and spectral channelization algorithms, digital computer architecture, and early prototypes using a 32-element fully digital multichannel receiver and field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based high-speed software defined radio (SDR) is provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bd68c4565ffd87998e4ab69d1706fd4a66231b18cf4927c7c75b135e9a604299","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
