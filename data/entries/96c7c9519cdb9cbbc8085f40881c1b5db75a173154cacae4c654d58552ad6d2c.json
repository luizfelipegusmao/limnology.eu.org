{"title":"Computational Fluid Dynamics Methodology to Estimate the Drag Coefficient of Balls in Rolling Element Bearings","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0503/v1","date":1709892072000,"content":"The emergence of electric vehicles has brought new issues such as the problem of rolling element bearings (REBs) operating at high speeds. Losses due to these components in mechanical transmissions are a key issue and must therefore be taken into account right from the design stage of these systems. Among these losses, the one induced by the motion of rolling elements , known as drag loss, becomes predominant in high-speed REBs. Although an experimental approach is still possible, it is difficult to isolate this loss in order to study it properly. A numerical approach based on CFD is therefore a possible way forward, even if other issues arise. The aim of this article is to study the ability of such an approach to correctly estimate the drag coefficient associated with the motion of rolling elements. The influence of the numerical domain extension, the mesh refinement, the simplification of the ring shape and the presence of the cage, on the values of the drag coefficient is presented. While it seems possible to compromise on the calculation domain and mesh size, it appears that the other parameters must be taken into account as much as possible to obtain realistic results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"96c7c9519cdb9cbbc8085f40881c1b5db75a173154cacae4c654d58552ad6d2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
