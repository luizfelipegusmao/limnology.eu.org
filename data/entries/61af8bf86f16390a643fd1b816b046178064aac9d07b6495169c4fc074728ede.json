The relevant interaction is an energy deposition via electron-electron scattering. However, in applications like 4D-STEM, the user is interested in the spatial-resolved absolute number of incident electrons on the detector surface. Therefore, the goal is to count each electron exactly one time at the position it crosses the detector surface. The following assumptions were made for silicon as detector material but are transferable to other materials as well.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"61af8bf86f16390a643fd1b816b046178064aac9d07b6495169c4fc074728ede","category":"Environment"}
