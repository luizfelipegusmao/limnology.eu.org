{"title":"COMPARE CABG: A Meta-Analysis of Comparative Outcomes in On-Pump vs. Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1666/v1","date":1719229720000,"content":"Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be performed using on-pump or off-pump techniques. The optimal approach remains debated. Objectives: The COMPARE CABG (Comparative Outcomes of Mortality, Perioperative complications, cARdiac function, and Hospital stay in On-Pump versus Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) study aims to systematically compare the outcomes of these surgical approaches. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and other databases. Studies with a sample size &gt; 4000 were included. Outcomes analyzed included mortality, complications, cardiac function, and hospital stay. Results: Meta-analysis of 5 studies with 58,232 patients showed that off-pump CABG was associated with a slightly lower complication rate: 15% for on-pump CABG and 13.5% for off-pump CABG with a pooled effect size of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85-0.95). In terms of cardiac function and hospital stay, results were also favorable to off-pump CABG with an effect size of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.05-1.19) and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.10-1.20), respectively. The pooled mortality rate was 2.5% for on-pump and 2.4% for off-pump CABG, with an effect size of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.98-1.12), indicating no significant difference between the groups. Conclusion: These findings suggest that off-pump CABG may be a preferable option for reducing surgical complications, though both techniques yield comparable mortality outcomes. Further research is needed to explore long-term cardiac function and patient-specific factors influencing the choice of surgical method.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94671f928472e8db2bed0044e7a37f1ee2972c350c8133c53b7cc7db484d699a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
