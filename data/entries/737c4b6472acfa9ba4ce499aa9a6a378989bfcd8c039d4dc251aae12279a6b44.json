{"title":"Dynamic Observations of Dislocations and Grain Boundaries in Oxides","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.517/7719908?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Materials properties of oxides depend on the dynamic behavior under various conditions such as temperature, stress, atmosphere. For example, mechanical properties of polycrystals are influenced by the interaction of grain boundary (GB), dislocation and crack. On the other hand, oxides processing is often influenced by ion diffusion at high temperatures. So far, many atomic scale observations have been performed for understanding fracture, deformation, diffusion and so on, but these experiments were mostly carried out statically, and the dynamic behavior is still not well understood yet. In addition, these dynamic behaviors often occur at GBs. In this study, in-situ nanoindentation experiments were conducted for SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> bicrystals inside (S)TEM to understand their deformation and fracture process at GBs. For observing ion diffusion along GBs, electron irradiation technique was used to enhance GB migration in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Ti-doped Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> bicrystals were also used for the ex-situ experiments to investigate atomistic GB diffusion mechanism as a model system.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"737c4b6472acfa9ba4ce499aa9a6a378989bfcd8c039d4dc251aae12279a6b44","category":"Environment"}
