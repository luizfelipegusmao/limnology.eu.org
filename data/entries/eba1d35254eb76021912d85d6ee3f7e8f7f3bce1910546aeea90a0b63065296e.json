{"title":"Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems MPPT Controller Optimization Using IWOA and P&amp;O: A Hybrid Approach under Various Operating Conditions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1097/v1","date":1721005161000,"content":"This paper proposes a novel approach called Multi-strategy Improved Chaotic Whale fused with Perturbation Observation method (IWOA-PO) for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) con-trol, to address the challenge of low efficiency in photovoltaic (PV) power generation under local shadows, according to the features of whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and perturbation observation (P&amp;O) method. In the early stage of control algorithm, IWOA is used for global search to quickly locate the position of the Maximum Power Point (MPP). In the later stage of control algorithm, P&amp;O is used for fine-grained local search to quickly, accurately and low oscillation track the position of the global maximum power point (GMPP). In order to verify the correctness, the tracking performance of IWOA-PO is comprehensively compared with WOA-PO、WOA、PSO under four conditions including uniform illumination, static partial shade, dynamic irradiance mutation and sudden changes in temperature and irradiance. In the above four conditions, the IWOA-PO algorithm has faster convergence and less power oscillations compared to the re-maining three algorithms, indicating that the IWOA-PO algorithm is effective. Finally, a physical verification experiment process is built to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eba1d35254eb76021912d85d6ee3f7e8f7f3bce1910546aeea90a0b63065296e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
