{"title":"Selection of the Value of Power Distance Exponent for Mapping with the Inverse Distance Weighting Method - Application in Subsurface Porosity Mapping, Northern Croatia Neogene","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1694/v1","date":1714110579000,"content":"The correct selection of the value of p is a complex and iterative procedure that requires experience in the interpretation of the obtained interpolated maps. Inverse Distance Weighting is a method applied to the porosities of the K and L hydrocarbon reservoirs, discovered in the Neogene (Lower Pontian) subsurface sandstones in the northern Croatia (Pannonian Basin System). They represent small and large data samples. Also a standard statistical analysis of the data was made, followed by the qualitative-quantitative analysis of the maps, based on the selection of different values of the power distance exponent (p-value) for the K and L reservoirs maps. According to the qualitative analysis, for a small data set, p-value could be set on 1 or 2 giving the most optimal result, while for a large data set, a p value of 3 and 4 could be applied. By quantitative analysis, for the case of small data p=2 is recommended, resulting in a root mean square error value of 0.03458, a mean absolute error of 0.02013 and a median absolute deviation of 0.00546. Oppositely, a p-value of 3 and 4 is selected as appropriate for a large data set, with root mean square errors of 0.02435 and 0.02437, mean square errors of 0.01582 and 0.01509 and median absolute deviations 0.00896 and 0.00444. Eventually for a small data set, it is recommended to use a p-value of 2, and for a large data set, a p-value of 3 or 4.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f3c0b2d4201a45fe4b06e351805745da397e36da6c5df7082f77fcba0c98ec8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
