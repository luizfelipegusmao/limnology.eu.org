{"title":"Prevalence and molecular detection of <i>Babesia microti</i> in rodents in Southeastern Shanxi, China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306181","date":1720015200000,"content":"<p>by Yiping Liu, Jingrong Niu, Jia Cui, Huaxiang Rao, Juan Yu</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Babesia</i> is a tick-transmitted parasite that infects wild and domestic animals, causes babesiosis in humans, and is an increasing public health concern. Here, we investigated the prevalence and molecular characteristics of <i>Babesia</i> infections in the rodents in Southeastern Shanxi, China. Small rodents were captured, and the liver and spleen tissues were used for <i>Babesia</i> detection using traditional PCR and sequencing of the partial 18S rRNA gene. The analysis revealed that 27 of 252 small rodents were positive for <i>Babesia</i>, with an infection rate of 10.71%. The infection rates in different sexes and rodent tissues were not statistically different, but those in different rodent species, habitats, and sampling sites were statistically different. The highest risk of <i>Babesia</i> infection was observed in <i>Niviventer confucianus</i> captured from the forests in Huguan County. Forty-three sequences from 27 small rodents positive for <i>Babesia</i> infection were identified as <i>Babesia microti</i>, including 42 sequences from 26 <i>N</i>. <i>confucianus</i>, and one sequence from <i>Apodemus agrarius</i>. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all sequences were clustered together and had the closest genetic relationship with <i>Babesia microti</i> strains isolated from <i>Rattus losea</i> and <i>N</i>. <i>confucianus</i> in China, and belonged to the Kobe-type, which is pathogenic to humans. Compared to other Kobe-type strains based on the nearly complete 18S rRNA gene, the sequences obtained in this study showed the difference by 1â€“3 bp. Overall, a high prevalence of <i>Babesia microti</i> infection was observed in small rodents in Southeastern Shanxi, China, which could benefit us to take the implementation of relevant prevention and control measures in this area.","author":"Yiping Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"32517213a7f1f3d789c3bffe5f976d95cffc8276ff0edff9c6f5d2cc1c5ed43f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
