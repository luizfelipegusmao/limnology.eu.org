{"title":"Experimental and Theoretical Stark Broadenings for Several Ti II Spectral Lines of Industrial and Astrophysical Interest","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0988/v1","date":1718346781000,"content":"A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was focused on Pb-Ti alloy samples in several Laser Induced Breakdown experiments in order to measure the Stark parameters of several spectral lines (58) of single ionized Titanium including the 3504.89 Å, and the 3510.83 Ålines (where we aported new experimental and theoretical values).Diagnostics of the laser induced plasmas (electron density and electron temperature) was performed using Balmer’s H alpha line (6562.7 Å).Temperatures were obtained by the Boltzmann Plot technique with spectral lines of Pb I (after correction for its evident self-absorption).Subsequently, calculations by the Griem approach of the Stark broadening parameters for several spectral lines were performed using the Gaunt factors proposed by Van Regemorter and those proposed by Douglas H. Sampson. In the latter cases the values obtained were very close to the experimental values. It allows us to assume that the calculations made for the spectral lines of Ti II, without experimental information, are more accurate using the Gaunt factors proposed by Sampson.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ea24cef0f0319da82a8d60ed92b68eac27c998a92c345bed712b8a21febb91a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
