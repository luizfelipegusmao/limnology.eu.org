{"title":"The Y locus encodes a REPRESSOR OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC GENES protein that represses carotenoid biosynthesis via interaction with APRR2 in carrot","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/8/2798/7642920?rss=1","date":1712620800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Little is known about the factors regulating carotenoid biosynthesis in roots. In this study, we characterized DCAR_032551, the candidate gene of the <span>Y</span> locus responsible for the transition of root color from ancestral white to yellow during carrot (<span>Daucus carota</span>) domestication. We show that DCAR_032551 encodes a REPRESSOR OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC GENES (RPGE) protein, named DcRPGE1. DcRPGE1 from wild carrot (DcRPGE1<sup>W</sup>) is a repressor of carotenoid biosynthesis. Specifically, DcRPGE1<sup>W</sup> physically interacts with DcAPRR2, an ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR2 (APRR2)-like transcription factor. Through this interaction, DcRPGE1<sup>W</sup> suppresses DcAPRR2-mediated transcriptional activation of the key carotenogenic genes <span>phytoene synthase 1</span> (<span>DcPSY1</span>), <span>DcPSY2</span>, and <span>lycopene ε-cyclase</span> (<span>DcLCYE</span>), which strongly decreases carotenoid biosynthesis. We also demonstrate that the DcRPGE1<sup>W</sup>–DcAPRR2 interaction prevents DcAPRR2 from binding to the RGATTY elements in the promoter regions of <span>DcPSY1</span>, <span>DcPSY2</span>, and <span>DcLCYE</span>. Additionally, we identified a mutation in the <span>DcRPGE1</span> coding region of yellow and orange carrots that leads to the generation of alternatively spliced transcripts encoding truncated DcRPGE1 proteins unable to interact with DcAPRR2, thereby failing to suppress carotenoid biosynthesis. These findings provide insights into the transcriptional regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis and offer potential target genes for enhancing carotenoid accumulation in crop plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"cce049c44bccedf6332c5e3ee9828148f642b5caa30d9a0e248c708a39d7126f","category":"Environment"}
