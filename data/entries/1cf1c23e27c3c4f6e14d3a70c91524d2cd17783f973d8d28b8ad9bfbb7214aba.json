{"title":"Characteristics of Ni/Cr/Ru Catalyst for Biogas Dry Reforming Membrane Reactor Using Pd/Cu Membrane and Comparison of it with Ni/Cr Catalyst","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2012/v1","date":1714480543000,"content":"This study proposed the combination system consisting of biogas dry reforming reactor and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Since a biogas dry reforming is an endothermic reaction, this study adopted a membrane reactor operated due to the non-equilibrium state with H2 separation from the reaction space. This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of Ni/Cr/Ru catalyst using for a biogas dry reforming membrane reactor. Additionally, this study also investigated the comparison of the characteristics of Ni/Cr/Ru catalyst with that of Ni/Cr catalyst. The impact of operation temperature, the molar ratio of CH4 : CO2, the differential pressure between the reaction chamber and the sweep chamber and the introduction of sweep gas on the characteristics of the biogas dry reforming membrane reactor using Pd/Cu membrane and Ni/Cr/Ru catalyst was examined. The concentration of H2 using Ni/Cr/Ru catalyst was larger than that using Ni/Cr catalyst by 2871 ppmV for the molar ratio of CH4 : CO2 = 1.5 : 1 at the reaction temperature of 600 ℃ and the differential pressure of 0 MPa without a sweep gas, especially. Under this condition, CH4 conversion, H2 yield and thermal efficiency were 67.4 %, 1.77×10-2 % and 0.241 %, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cf1c23e27c3c4f6e14d3a70c91524d2cd17783f973d8d28b8ad9bfbb7214aba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
