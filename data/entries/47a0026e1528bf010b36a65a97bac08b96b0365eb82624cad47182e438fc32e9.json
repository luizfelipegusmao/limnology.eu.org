{"title":"Cerebral Malaria: Clinicians, Extracellular Vesicles, and Therapeutically-Rational Exchange (T-REX)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0280/v1","date":1712133082000,"content":"As new vaccines reduce P. falciparum (Pf) cases, clinicians can focus on rescuing more children with cerebral malaria (CM).  Adjunctive “therapeutically-rational exchange transfusion” (T-REX) refers to using special “Pf-resistant” donor red blood cells (RBCs) that secrete nano-sized RBC extracellular vesicles (EVs).  Can some RBC EVs rapidly dislodge Pf-infected RBCs (iRBCs) sequestered in blood vessels and reduce inflammation?  Does post-exchange “rebound parasitemia” reflect sequestration-reversal?  We reviewed case-reports, EV and liposome studies, expert perspectives, and  time-sequence data.  In the AQUAMAT study, median coma-recovery time was 20 hours for artesunate.  In contrast, a CM patient treated with type-O T-REX quickly began speaking (during the procedure).  For other rapid-recovery CM patients, donor RBC variables had not been specified.  Despite rapid Pf-killing, drugs need 20 hours to substantially reduce iRBC cytoadhesion while EVs can selectively bind distant inflamed tissues within 15 minutes.  RBCs stressed by blood-bank storage and Pf infection secrete EVs.  Post-exchange “rebound parasitemia” can occur within 60 minutes and may reflect release of sequestered iRBCs.  Sequestration-reversal can be assessed by monitoring Pf parasitemia and total Pf biomass.  New data suggest clinicians, working with transfusion- and laboratory-medicine physicians, can, and should, assess T-REX options and publish their findings to help clarify how RBC EVs may serve as therapeutic  “decoy ligands.”","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"47a0026e1528bf010b36a65a97bac08b96b0365eb82624cad47182e438fc32e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
