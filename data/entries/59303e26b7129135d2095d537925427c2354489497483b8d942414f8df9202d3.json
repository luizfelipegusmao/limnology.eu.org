{"title":"Allergenic Potential of Common Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) in the Context of Cross-Reactions with Pollen Allergens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1138/v1","date":1728970745000,"content":"Common hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are essential in brewing, contributing to the bitterness, flavor, and aroma of beer, and are widely used in supplements for their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. However, despite their broad applications, the allergenic potential of common hops remains underexplored, particularly in comparison to the closely related Humulus japonicus. This study aimed to investigate the allergenic potential of common hops. Immunoreactivity of hop stalks, leaves, and cones with antibodies recognizing major allergens of birch (Bet v1a), mugwort (Art v1), and timothy (Phl p5b), as well as three sera from pollen-allergic patients, was assessed using slot blot and Western blotting techniques. Phosphate-buffered saline extracts of hop stalks, leaves, and cones from three cultivars were analyzed via slot blot while Western blotting was used after SDS-PAGE protein separation. Results revealed strong immunoreactivity in native hop proteins, although fewer protein fractions were identified in denatured samples. Nevertheless, the cross reactivity of hop proteins with pollen allergens was confirmed, suggesting that hop proteins may contribute to sensitization in pollen-sensitive individuals. These finding focus the potential allergenic risk of common hops.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"59303e26b7129135d2095d537925427c2354489497483b8d942414f8df9202d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
