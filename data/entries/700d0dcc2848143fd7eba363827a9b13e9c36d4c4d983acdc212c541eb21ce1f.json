{"title":"Fault Diagnosis in Electrical Machines for Traction Applications: Current Trends and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0308/v1","date":1728022578000,"content":"The widespread diffusion of electric vehicles poses new challenges in the field of fault diagnostics. Past studies have been focused mainly on machines designed for industrial applications, where the operating conditions and requirements are significantly different. This work presents a review of the most recent studies about fault diagnosis techniques in electrical machines feasible for traction applications, with a focus on the most adopted approaches of the last years and on the latest trends. Considerations about their applicability for electric vehicle purposes, along with some areas that require further research, are also provided.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"700d0dcc2848143fd7eba363827a9b13e9c36d4c4d983acdc212c541eb21ce1f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
