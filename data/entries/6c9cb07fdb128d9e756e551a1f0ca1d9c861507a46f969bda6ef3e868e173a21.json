{"title":"Dual plastid targeting of protoporphyrinogen oxidase 2 in Amaranthaceae promotes herbicide tolerance","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/713/7603415?rss=1","date":1707350400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (TPB) takes place in plastids and provides the chlorophyll and heme required for photosynthesis and many redox processes throughout plant development. TPB is strictly regulated, since accumulation of several intermediates causes photodynamic damage and cell death. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) catalyzes the last common step before TPB diverges into chlorophyll and heme branches. Land plants possess two PPO isoforms. PPO1 is encoded as a precursor protein with a transit peptide, but in most dicotyledonous plants PPO2 does not possess a cleavable N-terminal extension. Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) PPO1 and PPO2 localize in chloroplast thylakoids and envelope membranes, respectively. Interestingly, PPO2 proteins in Amaranthaceae contain an N-terminal extension that mediates their import into chloroplasts. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence for dual targeting of PPO2 to thylakoid and envelope membranes in this clade and demonstrate that PPO2 is not found in mitochondria. Transcript analyses revealed that dual targeting in chloroplasts involves the use of two transcription start sites and initiation of translation at different AUG codons. Among eudicots, the parallel accumulation of PPO1 and PPO2 in thylakoid membranes is specific for the Amaranthaceae and underlies PPO2-based herbicide resistance in <span>Amaranthus</span> species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"6c9cb07fdb128d9e756e551a1f0ca1d9c861507a46f969bda6ef3e868e173a21","category":"Environment"}
