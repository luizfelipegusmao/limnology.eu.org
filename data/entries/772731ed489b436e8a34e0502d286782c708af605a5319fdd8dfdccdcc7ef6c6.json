{"title":"The end game(s) of photosynthetic carbon metabolism","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/67/7499153?rss=1","date":1704153600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The year 2024 marks 70 years since the general outline of the carbon pathway in photosynthesis was published. Although several alternative pathways are now known, it is remarkable how many organisms use the reaction sequence described 70 yrs ago, which is now known as the Calvin–Benson cycle or variants such as the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle or Benson–Calvin cycle. However, once the carbon has entered the Calvin–Benson cycle and is converted to a 3-carbon sugar, it has many potential fates. This review will examine the last stages of photosynthetic metabolism in leaves. In land plants, this process mostly involves the production of sucrose provided by an endosymbiont (the chloroplast) to its host for use and transport to the rest of the plant. Photosynthetic metabolism also usually involves the synthesis of starch, which helps maintain respiration in the dark and enables the symbiont to supply sugars during both the day and night. Other end products made in the chloroplast are closely tied to photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation. These include serine from photorespiration and various amino acids, fatty acids, isoprenoids, and shikimate pathway products. I also describe 2 pathways that can short circuit parts of the Calvin–Benson cycle. These final processes of photosynthetic metabolism play many important roles in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"772731ed489b436e8a34e0502d286782c708af605a5319fdd8dfdccdcc7ef6c6","category":"Environment"}
