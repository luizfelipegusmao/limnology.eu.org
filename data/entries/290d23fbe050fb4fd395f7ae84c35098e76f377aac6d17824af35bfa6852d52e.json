{"title":"Shear Thickening, Star-Shaped Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium-Ion Batteries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1801/v1","date":1719363750000,"content":"The safety concerns associated with current lithium-ion batteries are a significant drawback. A short-circuit within the battery's internal components, such as those caused by a car accident, can lead to ignition or even explosion. To address this issue, a polymer shear thickening electrolyte, free from flammable solvents, has been developed. It comprises a star-shaped oligomer derived from a trimethylolpropane (TMP) core and polyether chains, along with the inclusion of 20 wt.% nanosilica. Notably, the star-shaped oligomer serves a dual function as both the solvent for the lithium salt and the continuous phase of the shear thickening fluid. The obtained electrolytes exhibit an ionic conductivity of 10-6 S cm-1 at 20 °C and 10-4 S cm-1 at 80 °C, with a high Li+ transference number (t+ = 0.79). A nearly thirtyfold increase in viscosity to a value of 1187 Pa s at 25 °C and a critical shear rate of 2 s-1 were achieved. During impact, this electrolyte could enhance cell safety by preventing electrode short-circuiting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"290d23fbe050fb4fd395f7ae84c35098e76f377aac6d17824af35bfa6852d52e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
