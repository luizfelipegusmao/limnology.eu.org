Initially, hierarchical features are extracted by MDSC-Net through the employment of parallel multi-scale convolutional kernels, while computational complexity is reduced via depthwise separable convolutions, thus reducing the overall computational load and achieving efficient feature extraction. Subsequently, to enhance the translational invariance of features and reduce the loss of pose information, features of various scales are processed in parallel by independent capsule networks, with improvements in max pooling achieved through dynamic routing. Lastly, features of different scales are concatenated and integrated through the concatenate operation, thereby facilitating precise analysis of multi-level information in the hyperspectral image classification process. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that MDSC-Net achieves average accuracies of 94%, 98%, and 99% on the Kennedy Space Center, University of Pavia, and Salinas datasets, respectively, indicating a significant performance advantage over recent HSI classification models and validating the effectiveness of the proposed model.","author":"Lin Wei","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"0edf35c39681b8a2af6f87d0237ef68aef5e7052cc6f45108ddba39be351b8e3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
