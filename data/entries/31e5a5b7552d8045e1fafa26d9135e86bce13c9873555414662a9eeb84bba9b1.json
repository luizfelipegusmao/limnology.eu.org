Here, we show that these drugs require a minimal set of 5 cellular enzymes for activation to their common 5′-triphosphate AT-9010, with an obligate order of reactions. AT-9010 selectively inhibits essential viral enzymes, accounting for antiviral potency. Functional and structural data at atomic resolution decipher <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-purine deamination compatible with its metabolic activation. Crystal structures of human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1, adenosine deaminase-like protein 1, guanylate kinase 1, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase at 2.09, 2.44, 1.76, and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively, with cognate precursors of AT-9010 illuminate the activation pathway from the orally available bemnifosbuvir to AT-9010, pointing to key drug–protein contacts along the activation pathway. Our work provides a framework to integrate the design of antiviral nucleotide analogues, confronting requirements and constraints associated with activation enzymes along the 5′-triphosphate assembly line.","author":"Aurélie Chazot","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"31e5a5b7552d8045e1fafa26d9135e86bce13c9873555414662a9eeb84bba9b1","category":"Environment"}
