{"title":"Enhancing the Value of Arbutus unedo L.  (Strawberry Tree) Through Chemical Innovation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0004/v1","date":1727776634000,"content":"Arbutus unedo (strawberry tree) is a small Mediterranean tree capable of vigorous regrowth after disturbances like fire. Traditionally used for biomass fuel, its bark and branches hold potential for higher-value products through ecovalorisation into liquid mixtures that could replace petro-leum-based materials. This study aimed to explore the chemical composition of various compo-nents of Arbutus unedo and to produce a liquefied material from its internal (IB) and external bark (EB). Chemical compositions of internal and external bark were determined using TAPPI standards including ash, extractive content, lignin, and cellulose. Metal cations were analyzed by ICP. Liquefaction of bark was optimized in a PARR reactor, evaluating factors such as particle size, temperature, and time and the best polyols were monitored by FTIR-ATR. Polyurethane foams were made with internal and external bark liquefied materials by polymerization with isocyanate, a catalyst and water as blowing agent. \nResults showed that EB has a higher extractive and lignin content, while IB contains more cellu-lose. Liquefaction yields were higher for IB (74%) than EB (68%), with IB yielding polyols that produced stronger and more resilient foams. Mechanical properties of the foams were influenced by the NCO/OH ratio and catalyst levels. Overall, the internal bark demonstrated superior performance for foam production, highlighting its potential as an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-derived materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"45805993928559d11de90cff250e8ea8d214d082fbdfbc5fc802857aa0d96752","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
