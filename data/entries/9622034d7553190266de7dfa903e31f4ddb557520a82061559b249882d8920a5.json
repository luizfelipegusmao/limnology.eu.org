{"title":"The Drastic Turn in Neurology: From Classical Disciplines to Neurogenetics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0008/v1","date":1725259484000,"content":"The field of neurology has undergone a profound transformation over the past two decades, shifting from traditional clinical and pathological approaches to a more genetically informed perspective. This essay explores the drastic turn in neurology from classical disciplines to neurogenetics, examining the factors that have contributed to this shift and the implications for clinical practice and research. The traditional approach to neurology, grounded in clinical examination, neuroanatomy, and neuropathology, has been effective in diagnosing and treating many conditions but has had limitations in understanding the etiology of complex and rare neurological disorders. The emergence of neurogenetics has been driven by advancements in genetic technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the recognition of the genetic basis of many neurological disorders. This shift has led to more accurate diagnoses, targeted treatments, and a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. However, challenges remain, including the complexity of genetic architecture and the ethical implications of genetic testing. The future of neurogenetics holds great promise for improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neurological conditions, with new technologies and interdisciplinary approaches poised to further advance the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9622034d7553190266de7dfa903e31f4ddb557520a82061559b249882d8920a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
