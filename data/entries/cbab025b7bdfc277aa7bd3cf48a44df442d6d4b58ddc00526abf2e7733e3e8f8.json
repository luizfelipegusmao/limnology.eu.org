Early morning rise of blood pressure which is called morning surge is found to be related with some cardiovascular diseases when it is exaggerated. We wanted to search the relation of Morning blood pressure surge (MBPS) and inflammation in PD. Method: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for 24 hours, fibrinogen to albumin ratio, hs-CRP are used in this retrospective study. Fifty idiopathic PD patients and 50 age and sex matched control cases were included. MBPS, it has been defined as the difference between morning BP (measured 2 hours after awakening) and the lowest night-time BP. Body mass index (BMI) is used as an independent variable. Results: Median value of MBPS for PD group (21,63) was significantly different from the control group values (18,63) (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbab025b7bdfc277aa7bd3cf48a44df442d6d4b58ddc00526abf2e7733e3e8f8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
