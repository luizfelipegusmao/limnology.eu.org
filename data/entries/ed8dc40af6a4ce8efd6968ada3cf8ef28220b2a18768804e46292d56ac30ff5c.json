Bioactive Compounds Alleviate Human Beta-Amyloid-(1-42)-Induced Tau-phosphorylation, Neuronal Death, Oxidative Stress and Reduced LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2420/v1","date":1722319655000,"content":"Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation both at the systemic and central level, are important early events in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Purpose. To investigate the oxidative stress, inflammatory, and Tau-phosphorylation lowering effects of pomegranate polyphenols (PP) (punicalagin, ellagic acid, peels, and arils extracts). Methods. We used flow cytometry to quantify protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10) in THP-1 macrophages, as well as M1/M2 cell-specific markers (CD86 and CD163) expression in human microglia HMC3 cells. IL-10 protein expression was also quantified in U373-MG human astrocytes. The effect of PP on human amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42)-induced oxidative stress, was assessed in microglia by measuring ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, using respectively 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) tests. Neuronal viability and cell apoptotic response to Aβ1-42 toxicity were assayed using the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and the annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit; respectively. Finally, flow cytometry analysis was also performed to evaluate the ability of PP to modulate Aβ1-42-induced Tau-181 phosphorylation (pTau-181). Results. Our data indicate that PP were significantly (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed8dc40af6a4ce8efd6968ada3cf8ef28220b2a18768804e46292d56ac30ff5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
