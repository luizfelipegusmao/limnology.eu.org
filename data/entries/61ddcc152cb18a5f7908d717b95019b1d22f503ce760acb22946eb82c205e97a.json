{"title":"Experimental and Numerical Investigation of the Use of Ultrasonic Waves to Assist Laser Welding","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1290/v1","date":1713506636000,"content":"This study explores the use of remote ultrasound vibration to enhance welding strength. It examines the effects of 20 kHz, and 40 kHz High Power Ultrasound Transducers (HPUT) in contact and contactless modes during ultrasonic assistance laser welding. Employing shear tests and microscopy for assessment, the research evaluates ultrasound's impact on welding strength and identifies the optimal transducer. Theoretical and numerical analyses investigate vibration transmission into the welding area, particularly examining the vibration distribution and cavitation initiation within the molten pool area. Results indicate that ultrasound-assisted welding increases pull test performance, including the resistance force and strain, and improves microscopic structural integrity. Numerical simulations suggest that narrow-band vibration intensifies pressure in specific welding zones. Contactless ultrasound application also shows enhanced welding quality, offering a promising alternative to current methods. This work contributes to electric car technology by suggesting improvements in welding techniques for power battery systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"61ddcc152cb18a5f7908d717b95019b1d22f503ce760acb22946eb82c205e97a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
