The results of the present study, together with those of previous water-choice experiments, suggest that salinity enhances the odor preferences of glass eels. Compared to <i>A. marmorata</i> glass eels, <i>A. japonica</i> glass eels were more strongly attracted to water collected from a leaf detritus-accumulating backwater area than to normal river water under the same salinity conditions. These results suggest that interspecific differences in odor preferences may facilitate their habitat segregation.</p>","author":"Yusuke Kumai, \nMari Kuroki, \nTakashi Yamakawa","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"f0b908b88d36cb7a16b09a38e158e3fbbd56b224bb660a73f9d7ba00c6a8dd40","category":"Environment"}
