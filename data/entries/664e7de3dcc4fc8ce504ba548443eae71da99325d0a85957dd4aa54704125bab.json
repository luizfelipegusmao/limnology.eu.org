{"title":"Open innovation and confidentiality agreements as key factors of innovative performance in the manufacturing and service industries","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303802","date":1716213600000,"content":"<p>by Fernando Barrios Aguirre, Diana Maritza Alvarez Ovalle, Nancy Milena Riveros Chávez, Carla Johana Martinez Garcia</p>\r\n\r\nThe innovative performance of manufacturing and service companies can be impacted by the existing relationship between open innovation (OI) and the generation of confidentiality agreements (NDAs) as a tool for the protection of intellectual property. Based on the analysis of a cross-sectional sample of 6,798 industrial companies (2019–2020) and 9,304 companies in the service sector (2017–2019) that are part of the directory of the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) in its Technological Innovation and Development Survey (EDIT and EDITS), it can be suggested that the interaction of these two variables (OI and NDAs) generate positive effects for the manufacturing industry but negative ones for the service sector. It could be deduced that the positive effect is due to the greater tradition of OI in the manufacturing industry and the negative effect to the caution that the service sector presents when collaborating with external actors.","author":"Fernando Barrios Aguirre","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"664e7de3dcc4fc8ce504ba548443eae71da99325d0a85957dd4aa54704125bab","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
