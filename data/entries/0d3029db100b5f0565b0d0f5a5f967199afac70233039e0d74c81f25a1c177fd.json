{"title":"Pharmacogenetics and the Blood-Brain Barrier: A Whirlwind Tour of Potential Clinical Utility","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1682/v1","date":1721634855000,"content":"Genetic factors influence medication response (pharmacogenetics), affecting the pharmacody-namics and pharmacokinetics of many medicaments used in clinical care. The ability of medica-tions to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents a critical putative factor in the effectiveness and tolerability of various central nervous system (CNS) medications at a pharmacokinetic (dosing) level. Pharmacogenetics has the potential to personalise medicine to a greater extent than has been possible, with the potential to help reduce heuristic delays to effective tolerable pharmacotherapy. Here, we critically examine and summarise the evidence, particularly for ABCB1 polymorphisms associated with various CNS medications. These transporters appear to have a role in BBB pharmacogenetics. We identify some of the most promising variants for clinical translation while spotlighting the complexities of the involved systems and limitations of the current empirical literature","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0d3029db100b5f0565b0d0f5a5f967199afac70233039e0d74c81f25a1c177fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
