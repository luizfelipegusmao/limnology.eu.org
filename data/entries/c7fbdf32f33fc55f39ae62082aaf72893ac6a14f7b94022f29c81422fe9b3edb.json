However, the interactions and cascading effects of warming and precipitation changes on the key “extracellular” and “intracellular” P cycling genes (PCGs) of bacteria are largely unknown for these P-limited ecosystems. We used metagenomics to analyze the individual and combined effects of warming and altered precipitation on soil PCGs and P transformation in a manipulation experiment. Warming and increased precipitation raised Olsen-P (bioavailable P, AP) by 13% and 20%, respectively, mainly caused by augmented hydrolysis of organic P compounds (NaOH-Po). The decreased precipitation reduced soil AP by 5.3%. The richness and abundance of the PCGs' community in soils on the cold Tibetan plateau were more sensitive to warming than altered precipitation. The abundance of PCGs and P cycling processes decreased under the influence of individual climate change factors (i.e., warming and altered precipitation alone), except for the warming combined with increased precipitation. Pyruvate metabolism, phosphotransferase system, oxidative phosphorylation, and purine metabolism (all “intracellular” PCG) were closely correlated with P pools under climate change conditions. Specifically, warming recruited bacteria with the <i>phoD</i> and <i>phoX</i> genes, which encode enzymes responsible for phosphoester hydrolysis (extracellular P cycling), strongly accelerated organic P mineralization and so, directly impacted P bioavailability in alpine soil. The interactions between warming and altered precipitation profoundly influenced the PCGs' community and facilitated microbial adaptation to these environmental changes. Warming combined with increased precipitation compensated for the detrimental impacts of the individual climate change factors on PCGs. In conclusion, warming combined with rising precipitation has boosting effect on most P-related functions, leading to the acceleration of P cycling within microbial cells and extracellularly, including mineralization and more available P release for microorganisms and plants in alpine soils.</p>","author":"Xuewei Wang, \nHui Guo, \nJianing Wang, \nPeng He, \nYakov Kuzyakov, \nMiaojun Ma, \nNing Ling","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Change Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"56ef18e1189a664bbaadbb00b32211653cb373b47aecc10bc04695f501416119","entryHash":"c7fbdf32f33fc55f39ae62082aaf72893ac6a14f7b94022f29c81422fe9b3edb","category":"Environment"}
