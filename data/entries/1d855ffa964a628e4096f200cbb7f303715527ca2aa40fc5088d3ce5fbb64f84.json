{"title":"177 Modulation of fecal microbiome by phytogenics, a postbiotic, and mix of organic acids with essential oils in weaned pigs subjected to F18 Escherichia coli challenge","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/129/7664723?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>This study evaluated the effects of bioactive feed ingredients on fecal microbiome of weaned pigs subjected to F18 enterotoxigenic <span>Escherichia coli</span> (ETEC) challenge. Two blocks of weaned pigs [n = 72; Yorkshire/Landrace/Duroc; initial body weight (BW) = 6.62 Â± 1.37 kg] were balanced by gender and litter and randomly allocated to one of the six treatments with 12 pens/block and 6 pigs/pen. Treatments included: 1) basal diet (NC), 2) NC + 0.1% phytogenic (Fresta Protect, Delacon, Austria; PFP), 3) NC + 0.2% postbiotic (Dia-V Nursery, Diamond V, IA; PB), 4) NC + 0.2% new phytogenic prototype (Delacon, Austria; NPP), 5) NC + 0.2% organic acid and essential oil blend (OA+EO), and 6) NC + 0.1% phytogenic (Fresta Protect) + 0.2% postbiotic (Dia-V Nursery; PFP+PB). The trial lasted 15 d, with a 7-d pre-challenge and 8-d post-challenge periods. Pigs were orally inoculated with 5 x 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/mL of F18 ETEC (O147:H2, LT:STb:STa:Stx2:F18) on d 8 and 9 of study after 5-h fasting. Fecal swabs were collected before challenge (d 8) and 3- and 8-d post-challenge (d 10 and 15 of study) and subjected to shotgun metagenomics. Diarrhea score and <span>E. coli</span> shedding (CFU/mL) were monitored daily and analyzed using a multi-level mixed effect ordinal logistic regression with block and pen as random effects. Microbiome data were center-log-ratio transformed and analyzed for diversity, abundance, and interaction networks. At 3-d post-challenge, the OA+EO, PFP+PB and NPP supplemented pigs had reduced (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.001) <span>E. coli</span> shedding compared with NC. Diarrhea score tended to be less (<span>P</span> = 0.054) in PFP+PB fed pigs 5-d post-challenge and was less (<span>P</span> = 0.02) in PFP+PB, OA+EO, and NPP 6-d post-challenge than NC. Alpha-diversity declined (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) 3-d post-challenge with most reduction in PFP and OA+EO but recovered 8-d post-challenge except for PFP and OA+EO (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01). At the baseline and 8-d post-challenge, the largest number of differentially abundant taxa (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) were observed in PFP+PB compared with NC. The PFP+PB reduced the abundances of <span>Escherichia</span>.sp000208585 <span>and Campylobacter</span>.P585 which were negatively correlated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) with average daily gain (ADG) and BW, and positively correlated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) with diarrhea score and <span>E. coli</span> shedding. The PFP+PB increased beneficial species including <span>Prevotella</span>.sp900543585, <span>Mitsuokella jalaludinii</span>, and <span>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</span> with the first two positively correlated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) with ADG and BW, and negatively correlated (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) with diarrhea score and <span>E. coli</span> shedding. By d-8 post-challenge, PFP+PB microbial network had the highest degree of negative connections suggestive of a more competitive microbial ecosystem against opportunistic microorganisms compared with NC. In conclusion, co-supplementation of Fresta Protect phytogenic and postbiotic promoted a microbiome with greater beneficial and reduced detrimental bacteria resulting in low diarrhea score post-challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1d855ffa964a628e4096f200cbb7f303715527ca2aa40fc5088d3ce5fbb64f84","category":"Environment"}
