Olbricht, Akim Adekpedjou</p>\r\n\r\nA differentially methylated region (DMR) is a genomic region that has significantly different methylation patterns between biological conditions. Identifying DMRs between different biological conditions is critical for developing disease biomarkers. Although methods for detecting DMRs in microarray data have been introduced, developing methods with high precision, recall, and accuracy in determining the true length of DMRs remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a normalized kernel-weighted model to account for similar methylation profiles using the relative probe distance from “nearby” CpG sites. We also extend this model by proposing an array-adaptive version in attempt to account for the differences in probe spacing between Illumina’s Infinium 450K and EPIC bead array respectively. We also study the asymptotic results of our proposed statistic. We compare our approach with a popular DMR detection method via simulation studies under large and small treatment effect settings. We also discuss the susceptibility of our method in detecting the true length of the DMRs under these two settings. Lastly, we demonstrate the biological usefulness of our method when combined with pathway analysis methods on oral cancer data. We have created an R package called <i>idDMR</i>, downloadable from GitHub repository with link: https://github.com/DanielAlhassan/idDMR, that allows for the convenient implementation of our array-adaptive DMR method.","author":"Daniel Alhassan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b91f2535386a88302ed068de4087abf46d85aa0685fb8b055cc6b2affcc9cb36","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
