{"title":"Qualitative Analysis of Supplier Relationship Management Practices in E-Commerce Fashion Industry","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1234/v1","date":1721182232000,"content":"This qualitative research explores Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) practices within the e-commerce fashion industry, aiming to uncover key strategies and their impacts. Through semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers, procurement officers, and supplier representatives, critical themes emerged: communication, trust, risk management, sustainability, and digital technologies. Effective communication, characterized by transparency and regular updates, emerged as pivotal for aligning expectations and resolving issues promptly. Trust-building practices, including fair dealings and formal agreements, were essential in fostering long-term partnerships, reducing transaction costs, and enhancing collaboration. Robust risk management strategies, such as supplier diversification and contingency planning, were identified as crucial for mitigating disruptions and ensuring supply chain resilience. Sustainability was highlighted as a strategic imperative, driven by ethical sourcing and environmental standards, supported by technologies like blockchain for transparency. The transformative role of digital technologies—supply chain management software, blockchain, IoT, and data analytics—was evident in enhancing visibility and decision-making across global supply chains. Viewing suppliers as strategic partners, rather than mere vendors, promoted collaborative innovation and mutual growth. Despite challenges like cultural differences and regulatory complexities, opportunities exist to enhance SRM through integrated best practices. By prioritizing effective communication, trust-building, risk management, sustainability, and digital innovation, companies can strengthen supplier relationships, optimize supply chain performance, and achieve competitive advantage in the e-commerce fashion sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be7d09238e1622c5bf54d2b9ab97fc6124bc14705f6cf454844a7a5a8a7087ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
