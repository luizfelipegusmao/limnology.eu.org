{"title":"On a Generic Fractional Derivative Associated with the Riemann-Liouville Fractional Integral","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2116/v1","date":1721982492000,"content":"In this paper, a generic fractional derivative is defined as a set of the linear operators left-inverse to the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. Then the theory of the left-invertible operators developed by Przeworska-Rolewicz is applied for derivation of its properties. In particular, we characterize its domain, null-space, and projector operator, establish the interrelations between its different realisations, and present a generalized fractional Taylor formula involving the generic fractional derivative. Then we consider the fractional relaxation equation containing the generic fractional derivative, derive a closed form formula for its unique solution, and study its complete monotonicity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ecc78b68ec9e24d4cc6c05fbbda3c3aea3388d108812312e65605e701dac38b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
