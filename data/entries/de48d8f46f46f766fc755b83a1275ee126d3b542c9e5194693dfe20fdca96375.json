However, due to the limited tech-nical-scientific data regarding these properties in the halophyte Salicornia neei, this research aimed to analyze micronutrients, chlorophyll, carotenoids, and activities of S. neei extracts using solvents of different polarities and plant organs (leaf, stem, and root) as free radical scavengers and antimicrobial agents. The fresh plant was collected and subsequently, pigments and micro-nutrients were determined by spectrophotometry and ICP, respectively. From the prepared extracts, antioxidant activity was de-termined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method and antimicrobial activity by the disc diffusion method for fungi and bacteria. The results obtained demonstrated that the native Brazilian halophyte S. neei can be considered a food rich in minerals and pigments with excellent antioxidant properties, showing inhibition 96.72% and IC50 (4.15 mg/mL). For free radical scavenging capacity, the most effective solvent was ethanol: acetone (1:1) and there was no significant difference (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de48d8f46f46f766fc755b83a1275ee126d3b542c9e5194693dfe20fdca96375","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
