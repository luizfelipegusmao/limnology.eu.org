{"title":"The Potential of Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT as a Main Diagnostic Tool in Prostate Cancer Staging","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0967/v1","date":1728724847000,"content":"Gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT) is a diagnostic tool used in urology to detect oligometastatic disease in patients with prostate cancer (PC). Although increasingly popular and extensively studied, it is not considered a standard diagnostic tool for primary PC staging, because it lacks validation when compared to mpMRI.Numerous studies have suggested its promising role in PC diagnostics. Our objective was to comprehensively review and summarize the existing literature on the potential and feasibility of utilizing Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT as the sole method for primary PC staging and to compare it with currently employed diagnostic tools (mainly mpMRI). The main goal of the study was to consolidate the data on the sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET for PCa staging when compared with other diagnostic tools. The use of PSMA-PET/CT as the only diagnostic tool of primary PC in the future might potentially reduce diagnostic time and costs. In addition, we examined the limitations of its use. Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT demonstrates encouraging outcomes during the initial assessment of PC, potentially leading to a transformative leap in PC diagnosis and treatment, due to the utilization of Ga-68 PSMA, with high affinity to prostate cells.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab4a6957733206c769d7b4ea659c7d0d6b9e43d8a0e902fdea68907b21226bf5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
