{"title":"Synthesis of green nanoparticles for energy, biomedical, environmental, agricultural, and food applications: A review","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-023-01682-3","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Nanomaterials have been rapidly developed during the last decades, yet many nanoparticles synthesized by classical methods are toxic and their synthesis procedure is not sustainable. Here we review the green synthesis of nanoparticles from biomass and waste with a focus on synthetic mechanisms and applications in energy production and storage, medicine, environmental remediation, and agriculture and food. Biomass use for synthesis include microorganisms, fungi, plants, and agro-industrial bio-waste. Compared to conventional synthesis, green synthesis allows a 30% reduction in energy consumption, cost savings of up to 40%, and a 50% increase in production output. Biomedical applications comprise antibacterials, anticancers, antioxidants, and drug delivery mechanisms. Carbon quantum dots and photovoltaics are discussed in the energy section. Agricultural and food applications focus on nanofertilization, pest control, and food quality. Environmental remediation includes water and soil purification.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"13219137879bfb861f1f45f39e6a86b4cb98a7479f172759eb05cd6427075fdc","category":"Environment"}
