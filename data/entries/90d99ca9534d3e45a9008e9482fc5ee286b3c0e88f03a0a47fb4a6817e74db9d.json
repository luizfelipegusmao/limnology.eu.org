According to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2023 was an average 1.48°C warmer than the pre-industrial temperature of 1850 to 1900 (<a href=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu\">https://climate.copernicus.eu</a>). Extremely high temperatures and excessive greenhouse gases adversely affect both human and plant health. This situation is causing global concern as it interferes with crop productivity and poses a challenge to food security. It becomes necessary to find solutions to address high temperatures and greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> while boosting crop yield and productivity. The genetic engineering and synthetic biology approaches could be helpful in “reprogramming” biological systems to help plants sustain adverse environmental conditions, such as high heat and excess greenhouse gases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"90d99ca9534d3e45a9008e9482fc5ee286b3c0e88f03a0a47fb4a6817e74db9d","category":"Environment"}
