{"title":"Head circumferences measured during developmental monitoring visits before diagnosis of childhood-onset craniopharyngioma","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307395","date":1721743200000,"content":"<p>by Julia Beckhaus, Junxiang Peng, Svenja Boekhoff, Brigitte Bison, Carsten Friedrich, Hermann L. Müller</p>\r\nBackground <p>Craniopharyngiomas (CP) are histologically benign (WHO grade 1), embryonal malformations which are related to remnants of the Rathke’s pouch and are located in the (peri)sellar region. Already before CP diagnosis, many patients show a reduced growth velocity and tend to present with weight gain. However, it is unknown whether patients with CP develop an increased head circumference (HC) before CP diagnosis, which could be a useful early diagnostic indicator.</p> Patients and methods <p>For a cohort of 83 patients recruited in the multicenter studies KRANIOPHARYNGEOM 2000 and HIT-ENDO data on HC could be analyzed, based on medical records assessed in developmental monitoring visits performed at defined time points before CP diagnosis.</p> Results <p>When comparing HC standard deviation scores (SDS) before CP diagnosis in 83 patients at defined time points between birth and 4 years of age, all HC were in the upper normal range. However, CP patients diagnosed at an age ≤4 years with initial hypothalamic involvement presented with a tendency towards an increased HC SDS early before CP diagnosis at routine medical examinations during the first 7 months of life.</p> Conclusions <p>We conclude that monitoring of growth and weight development including HC can lead to early CP diagnosis and treatment. This might prevent higher grades of hypothalamic involvement and lead to an improvement of quality of life after CP. Further studies on the specific value of HC as a diagnostic marker are warranted.</p>","author":"Julia Beckhaus","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"692af3f9796b317f593c0b1117618902a444428a8a03ca7da94c6ea397364116","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
