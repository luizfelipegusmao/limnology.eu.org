{"title":"Decoupling Interaction for CFD-DEM Simulations of Bubbling Fluidized Bed","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0771/v1","date":1712820412000,"content":"The discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational dynamics (CFD) has been considered one of the most sensitive ways of studying fluidized beds. This paper presents gas-solid fluidized bed simulations by use of CFD-DEM. The two-phase interaction is calculated in a way of decoupling. Within the effective neighborhood of the particles, the kernel approximation method is used to calculate the local porosity, thereby calculating the drag force on the particles. At the grid scale, the momentum exchange coefficient is calculated using a two fluid model based method, thereby calculating the source term of the phase interaction in the fluid control equation. The simulated form, size and motion process of the big bubble are all consistent with experimental observations. The simulated solid volume fraction and relative pressure averaged in a horizontal plane at 45 mm above the bottom are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. The fluctuation of the simulated bed height over time is similar to the experimental measurement results. The reproduction of these qualitative and quantitative results indicates that the proposed method effectively improves simulation performance and accuracy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6a5977a8b8006834310c98bcd3f1a593cda5834ebfa7b663c1d1f029b62a8ff7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
