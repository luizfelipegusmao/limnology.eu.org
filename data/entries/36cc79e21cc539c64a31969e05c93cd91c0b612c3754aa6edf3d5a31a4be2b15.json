{"title":"Harnessing Agricultural Waste: From Disposal Dilemma to Wealth Creation and Sustainable Solutions towards UAVsAirframe Manufacturing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0586/v1","date":1718088590000,"content":"The escalating global population and subsequent demand for agricultural products have led to a surge in agricultural waste generation, posing significant disposal challenges. Conventional disposal methods such as burning and dumping not only harm the environment but also jeopardize human health and safety. Recognizing the urgent need for sustainable waste management, researchers have increasingly focused on repurposing agricultural plant waste as a valuable resource. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the potential of agricultural plant waste in wealth creation and sustainable development. It highlights the detrimental impacts of current disposal methods and emphasizes the necessity for alternative approaches. By analyzing the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of plant fibers, particularly cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, this review underscores their suitability for diverse applications. Moreover, it explores the emerging trend of utilizing pineapple leaf fiber, a sustainable and lightweight material, in structural applications such as UAV construction. With its exceptional mechanical properties and biodegradability, pineapple leaf fiber holds promise as a viable alternative to traditional materials, contributing to a more sustainable future. In conclusion, this review advocates for a paradigm shift towards embracing agricultural plant waste as a valuable asset for economic prosperity and environmental sustainability. It underscores the importance of continued research and technological advancements to unlock the full potential of agricultural waste in fostering a circular economy and driving sustainable development globally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"36cc79e21cc539c64a31969e05c93cd91c0b612c3754aa6edf3d5a31a4be2b15","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
