{"title":"Genetic Diversity Losses in Mantis Shrimp Oratosquilla oratoria Offspring Created for Supportive Releases Using an Ecological Breeding in Earthen Pond Method","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maec.12842?af=R","date":1728805166000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Artificial breeding of mantis shrimp <i>Oratosquilla oratoria</i>, using the ecological breeding in earthen pond (EBEP) method, has been carrying out from 2019, and the produced larvae have always been used for supportive breeding programs in Bohai Bay. To assess the degree of fidelity of enhancement programs used an EBEP method to native genetic pools, genetic diversity at 10 microsatellite loci was analyzed in three hatchery offspring populations, their wild parent stocks, and their wild contemporaneous offspring. Significant decrease in the almost genetic diversity parameters and highly significant differences in shannon's information index (decreasing by 22.54%–40.97%) and allelic richness (33.80%–46.87%) were observed between in hatchery populations. This further created relatively more genetic differentiation between the hatchery and wild population, as the pairwise Fst values and genetic distances showed. The mean pairwise relatedness coefficients showed higher values within hatchery populations and lower values within wild populations. Hatchery populations contained the fewest full-sib families and offspring were extremely distributed in 10–11 full-sib groups in each hatchery population. The relatively small number of actual spawning females and large variance in parental contribution to the next generation possibly causes allele reduction in the hatchery population, which in turn leads to a decrease in allelic diversity and an increase in genetic similarities among individuals. Promoting synchrony of ovarian development in females, providing good conditions for incubation and larvae culture and balancing the contributions of parents will be important in future breeding propagation.</p>","author":"Qi‐Kang Bo, \nYan‐Guang Yu, \nChun‐Xiu Chen, \nYa‐Nan Zhang, \nChao Ma, \nShuai Wang, \nJie Yu, \nYun‐Zhao Lu, \nJun Hao, \nJu‐Feng Jiang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Marine Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"9aeeb02fb4d0869ca2d9b47a9c219a8693576fd84433bf6b8b40db990539dbf7","entryHash":"efa3a27c0c1fb3d12d934a1f99ad63f83d5ba3da6524a7555ea7106432e3da30","category":"Environment"}
