{"title":"Effects of Fermented Herbal Extract as Phytobiotic on Growth Indices, Moulting Performance, and Feed Utilization of Juvenile Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus monodon Fabr.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0052/v1","date":1722570993000,"content":"The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of adding fermented herbal extracts (FHE) derived from mulberry leaf (Morus alba), Javanese turmeric (Curcuma xanthorrhiza), and fingerroot (Boesenbergia rotunda) to the diet of tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) on their growth, moulting performance, feed efficiency, and nutrient retention. The main feed used in this trial was a commercially manufactured pellet, then five different doses of FHE supplementation were used: 0 mg/kg feed (P0, control), 50 mg/kg feed (P1), 100 mg/kg feed (P2), 150 mg/kg feed (P3), and 200 mg/kg feed (P4). Weight gain, average daily gain, and length gain of shrimps fed P2 was significantly higher than that of those fed the control diet. Similar result was observed in moulting performance. The application of P2 showed superior results in enhancing the FE of cultured shrimp. Thus, the protein and energy retention of P. monodon was significantly better in P2 treatment groups. P0 had the lowest crude protein, while shrimp given P2 and P3 diets had the highest crude protein content of any treatment group. Based on the findings, it is recommended that the juvenile tiger shrimp diet contain 100 mg/kg of FHE for the best effects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bdc94f865f11096bc8a5016552ae783cd3b5ee850ed8df2f30ab1ba5042c8f68","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
