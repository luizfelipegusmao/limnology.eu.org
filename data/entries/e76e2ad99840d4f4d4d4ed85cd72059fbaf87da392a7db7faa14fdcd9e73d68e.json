{"title":"Phenotypic Variability of LGMD 2C/R5 in a Genetically Homogenous Group of Bulgarian Muslim Roma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0177/v1","date":1722590437000,"content":"Sarcoglycanopathies are among the most frequent and severe autosomal recessive forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies /LGMD/ with childhood onset. Mutations in , , and sarcoglycan genes lead to various kinds of LGMD. We present the clinical variability of LGMD 2C/R5 among a genetically homogeneous group of 56 patients, belonging to 35 pedigrees. Molecular genetic analysis showed th–∞t all 57 patients were homozygous for C283Y variant. The muscles of the pelvic girdle and the trunk were early and more severely affected, followed by the the shoulder girdle. Macroglossia, hypertrophy of the calves, scapular winging and lumbar hyperlordosis were common in the ambulatory phase. A great variability in the clinical presentation of LGMD 2C/R5 was observed both intra and interfamilial, despite the same underlying molecular defect. Females demonstrated a relatively milder clinical course, compared to males. Mean CK levels were 20 times above normal values. Muscle CT of MRI showed earlier and more severe involvement of the flexor proximal limb muscles in comparison to the extensor ones.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e76e2ad99840d4f4d4d4ed85cd72059fbaf87da392a7db7faa14fdcd9e73d68e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
