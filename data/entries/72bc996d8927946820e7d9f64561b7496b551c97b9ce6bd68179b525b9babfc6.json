Accumulating evidence implicates changes to gene expression as a major source of phenotypic novelty in eukaryotes, including acute phenotypes such as disease and cancer in mammals. Moreover, genetic and epigenetic variation affecting <span>cis-</span>regulatory sequences over longer evolutionary timescales has become a recurring theme in studies of morphological divergence and local adaptation. Here, we discuss the functions of and methods used to identify various classes of <span>cis-</span>regulatory elements, as well as their role in plant development and response to the environment. We highlight opportunities to exploit <span>cis-</span>regulatory variants underlying plant development and environmental responses for crop improvement efforts. Although a comprehensive understanding of <span>cis-</span>regulatory mechanisms in plants has lagged behind that in animals, we showcase several breakthrough findings that have profoundly influenced plant biology and shaped the overall understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes.</p></div>","author":"Alexandre P.
