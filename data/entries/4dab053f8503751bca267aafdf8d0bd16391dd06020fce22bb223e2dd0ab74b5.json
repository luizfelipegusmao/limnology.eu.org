{"title":"Nitric Oxide in the Mechanisms of Cell Death and Cytoprotection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1664/v1","date":1711530335000,"content":"The regulation of cell death is a fundamental issue in cell biology and continues to be intensely investigated worldwide. The significance of research in this field persists because understanding the determinants of cell lifespan directly impacts the maintenance of multicellular organism homeostasis and, consequently, is crucial for addressing biomedical challenges associated with various diseases. It is recognized that the initiation of cell death can be prompted by both specific signals (such as cytokines or hormones) and nonspecific stimuli, including radiation, temperature increase, or oxidants. When these factors affect a cell, numerous signaling pathways are triggered in the cell, leading to neutralization of the effects of their negative effects or, in case of irreparable damage, to cell elimination. This removal of damaged cells occurs through apoptosis or programmed cell death, a highly regulated process. Numerous signaling molecules participate in orchestrating the apoptotic process, many of which also govern other essential functions within the organism.\nPhysiological factors capable of triggering the apoptotic program in cells include nitric oxide (NO), which serves as one of the key signaling molecules regulating the functions of the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems of the organism. The unique chemical nature of NO, along with its numerous intracellular targets and physiologically active redox forms, raises questions about the specific mechanisms through which NO exerts its damaging effects on cells. Utilizing pharmacological preparations- such as sources (donors) of exogenous nitric oxide- represents an approach to investigating the initiation and execution of the apoptotic program in sensitive target cells. Furthermore, this approach holds promise as a direction for discovering new selective drugs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4dab053f8503751bca267aafdf8d0bd16391dd06020fce22bb223e2dd0ab74b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
