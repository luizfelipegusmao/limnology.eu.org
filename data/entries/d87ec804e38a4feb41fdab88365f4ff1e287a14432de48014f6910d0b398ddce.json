{"title":"Unique Features of Extremely Halophilic Microbiota Inhabiting Solar Saltwork Fields of Vietnam","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2086/v1","date":1724849096000,"content":"The artificial solar saltwork fields of Hon Khoi are important industrial and biodiversity resources in southern Vietnam. Most hypersaline environments in this area are characterized by saturated salinity, nearly neutral pH, intense ultraviolet radiation, elevated temperatures and fast desiccation processes. However, the extreme halophilic prokaryotic communities associated with these stressful environments remain uninvestigated. To fill this gap, a metabarcoding approach was conducted to characterize these communities by comparing them with solar salterns in northern Vietnam as well as with Italian salterns. Sequencing analyses revealed that the multiple reuses of crystallization ponds apparently create significant perturbations and structural instability in prokaryotic consortia. However, some interesting features were noticed when we examined the diversity of ultra-small prokaryotes belonging to Patescibacteria and DPANN Archaea. Surprisingly, we found at least five deeply branched clades, two from Patescibacteria and three from DPANN Archaea, which seem to be quite specific to Hon Khoi saltwork fields ecosystem and can be considered as a part of biogeographical connotation. Further studies are needed to characterize these uncultivated taxa, to isolate and cultivate them, which will allow us to elucidate their ecological role in these hypersaline habitats and to explore their biotechnological and biomedical potential.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d87ec804e38a4feb41fdab88365f4ff1e287a14432de48014f6910d0b398ddce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
