{"title":"Optimizing Electric Racing Car Performance Through Telemetry-Integrated Battery Charging: A Response Surface Analysis Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0321/v1","date":1717645670000,"content":"The link between the world of communication and the world of racing is provided by telemetry systems in electric racing cars. These systems send real-time data about the vehicle’s behavior and systems to enable informed decisions during the race. The aim of this research was to integrate telemetry into the battery bank of a racing electric vehicle to find the optimal values of current and voltage that optimize the charging process, thus improving the vehicle’s performance in competition using Response Surface Analysis. Particularly, the telemetry system consisted of an Arduino Mega, a digital wattmeter, and temperature sensors, all installed in the vehicle. Once the telemetry data was obtained, a response surface design was adapted with current, voltage, and temperature as factors, varying from low to high values, with the objective function being to minimize the battery’s charging time. Applying the response surface methodology and the steepest descent algorithm, it was found that all factors significantly affect the charging time, with the minimum charge time being 6961 seconds, obtained with a current of 2.4 amps and voltages of 50.5 volts and 43.6 volts.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf1008a6484093a01d17a6d5f162494158ba1285ac0a5e0c0db35c95fc62b5ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
