Through in-depth interviews with industry experts, practitioners, and scholars, the study investigates how SRM strategies integrate sustainability criteria into procurement processes, mitigate environmental and ethical risks, and enhance operational efficiencies. Key findings highlight the strategic importance of collaborative relationships with suppliers, technological innovations such as blockchain and data analytics in promoting transparency and accountability, and the influence of consumer preferences for sustainable products on market dynamics. Despite challenges such as regulatory complexities and global supply chain dynamics, businesses are increasingly adopting sustainable SRM practices to strengthen brand reputation, achieve cost savings, and align with evolving sustainability standards. The study underscores the interconnected nature of sustainability within e-commerce operations and calls for continued research to advance technological solutions, refine regulatory frameworks, and foster industry-wide collaboration. By embracing sustainability as a strategic imperative, businesses can navigate complexities, drive innovation, and contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future for the e-commerce industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4a3064b79ddcfbfad726e9df0014302f8cacf20780f8d3722bdb9bb824c7999","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
