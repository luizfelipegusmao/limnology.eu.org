{"title":"The Presence of Some Minor Aspergillus and Penicillium Mycotoxins: Mycophenolic Acid, Cyclopiazonic Acid, Penicillic Acid, Roquefortine C, and Gliotoxin in Main Cereals Cultivated in Albania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0387/v1","date":1728293019000,"content":"(1) Background: Food and Feed Safety Legislation does not concern all the mycotoxins generated by Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. Certain mycotoxins, including cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), penicillic acid (PA), roquefortine C (ROQ C), mycophenolic acid (MPA), and gliotoxin regarded as having lower toxicity levels, hence not included in food and feed legislation; (2) Methods: Presence of these substances in maize and wheat grown in Albania across two consecutive harvesting seasons was investigated by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); (3) Results: The findings indicated the presence of these mycotoxins in maize grain but not in wheat grain. In the 2014 season, they exhibited a higher contamination incidence than the 2015 season. The most commonly detected Mycotoxin was MPA, followed by CPA and ROC toxin, while Penicillium acid and gliotoxin were detected. The MPA revealed a concentration range of 72.92–3447.25 μg/kg, with a mean value of 1063.89 μg/kg. Mycophenolic acid was detected in the maize samples collected during the 2015 season. (4) Conclusions: These findings suggest that focusing the investigation only on 'controlled' mycotoxins will not produce a proper risk assessment and may not adequately address the possible harmful impacts of mycotoxins on human and animal health due to mycotoxins co-occurrence.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f06f2b4e5c33c89bb44223c9f9cfceecfa9a34c1b0e41c11b8523e9833f6baeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
