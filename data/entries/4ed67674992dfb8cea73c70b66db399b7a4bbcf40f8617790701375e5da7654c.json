{"title":"Global Estimates of Particulate Organic Carbon Concentration From the Surface Ocean to the Base of the Mesopelagic","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GB008149?af=R","date":1727932493000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The gravitational settling of organic particles from the surface to the deep ocean is an important export pathway and one of the largest components of the ocean carbon pump. The strength and efficiency of the gravitational pump are often measured using metrics reliant on reference depths and empirical formulations that parameterize the relationship between depth and the flux or concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC). Here, BGC-Argo profiles were used to identify the isolume where POC concentration, [POC], starts to decline, revealing attenuation trends below this isolume that are remarkably consistent across the global ocean. We developed a simple empirical approach that uses observations from the first optical depth to predict [POC] from the surface ocean to the base of the mesopelagic (1,000 m), allowing assessments of spatial and temporal variability in gravitational pump efficiencies. We find that rates of [POC] attenuation are high in areas of high biomass and low in areas of low biomass, supporting the view that bloom events sometimes result in a relatively weak deep biological pump that is characterized by low transfer efficiency to the base of the mesopelagic. Our isolume-based attenuation model was applied to satellite data to yield the first remote sensing-based estimate of integrated global POC stock of 3.02 Pg C over the top 1,000 m, with an uncertainty of 0.69 Pg C. Of this total stock, approximately 1.02 Pg was located above the reference isolume where [POC] begins to attenuate.</p>","author":"James Fox, \nMichael J. Behrenfeld, \nKimberly H. Halsey, \nJason R.
