{"title":"Subclinical Hypothyroidism, BDNF, and Telomere Dynamics in T1DM Pregnancy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1880/v1","date":1714360272000,"content":"This study investigates the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism and BDNF on telomere length in T1DM mothers and their neonates. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 70 pregnant women with T1DM were enrolled. Subclinical hypothyroidism during the first trimester was characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels ranging from 2.5 to 5.0mIU/L alongside normal free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations. Participants were stratified into two groups based on TSH levels: a maternal subclinical hypothyroid group (SHG, n=35) and a maternal euthyroid group (ETG, n=35). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) measurements were conducted using whole blood samples from the mothers and umbilical veins. Results: The maternal LTL mean was 1.7 (SD=1.1), which was significantly shorter than the neonatal telomeres, with a mean of 2.3 SD (1.2). A significant correlation was observed between maternal and neonatal LTL (r=0.750, p&amp;lt;0.001). A positive association was found between neonatal LTL and BDNF levels in maternal circulation [β=0.421 (95% CI 0.536; 1.873; p=0.001)]. Neonatal LTL was negatively associated with gestational weight gain [β=-0.266 (95% CI-0.138; -0.009)], and with TSH in the first trimester [β=-0.237; (95% CI -0.493; - 0.010)]. Notably, neonates in the SHG exhibited shorter LTL, with a mean of 2.1 (1.0), compared to those in the ETG, who had a mean LTL of 2.7 (1.4). A positive association was found between maternal LTL and BDNF levels in maternal circulation [β=0.523 (95% CI 0.790; 1.950; P&amp;lt;0.001)]. Maternal LTL was negatively associated with gestational weight gain [β=-0.259 (95% CI -0.122; -0.010)], and with TSH in the first trimester [β=-0.231; (95% CI -0.422; - 0.015)]. Conclusions: Genetic factors affect neonatal LTL. Maternal subclinical hypothyroidism reduces neonatal LTL. The link between maternal and neonatal LTL and BDNF reveals the complex endocrine-neurotrophic interaction in T1DM telomere dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"85f57f8b29df60a44146be8d8efedba369943b027d2e04172ad74636cfbe7c69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
