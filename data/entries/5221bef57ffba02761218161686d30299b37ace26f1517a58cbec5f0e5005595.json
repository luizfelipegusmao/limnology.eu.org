{"title":"Innovative behavior and organizational innovation climate among the Chinese clinical first-line nurses during the Omicron pandemic: The mediating roles of self-transcendence","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306109","date":1719583200000,"content":"<p>by Zhangyi Wang, Yue Zhu, Tingrui Wang, Tao Su, Huifang Zhou, Siai Zhang, Mengru Liu, Lamei Chen, Manli Wu, Liping Li, Xuechun Li, Xiaoli Pang, Jiaofeng Peng, Xiaochun Tang, Li Liu</p>\r\nBackground <p>During the Omicron pandemic, clinical first-line nurses played a crucial role in healthcare. Their innovative behavior enhanced the quality of nursing and served as a vital factor in driving the sustainable development of the nursing discipline and healthcare industry. Many previous studies have confirmed the significance of nurses’ innovative behavior worldwide. However, the correlations among innovative behaviors, organizational innovation climate, self-transcendence, and their mediating roles in Chinese clinical first-line nurses need further research.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted, and the quality reporting conformed to the STROBE Checklist. From March 2022 to February 2023, a convenience sample of 1,058 Chinese clinical first-line nurses was recruited from seven tertiary grade-A hospitals of Tianjin city in Northern China. The Demographic Characteristics Questionnaire, Nurse Innovative Behavior Scale (NIBS), Nurse Organizational Innovation Climate Scale, and the Self-Transcendence Scale were used. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, and process plug-in mediation effect analyses.</p> Results <p>The total scores of innovative behavior, organizational innovation climate, and self-transcendence were 33.19 ± 6.71, 68.88 ± 12.76, and 41.25 ± 7.83, respectively. Innovative behavior was positively correlated with the organizational innovation climate (<i>r</i> = 0.583, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and self-transcendence (<i>r</i> = 0.635, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Self-transcendence partially mediated mediating role between innovative behavior and organizational innovation climate, accounting for 41.7%.</p> Conclusion <p>The innovative behavior, organizational innovation climate, and self-transcendence among the first-line nurses during the Omicron pandemic were relatively moderate, which needs improving. Organizational innovation climate can directly affect the innovative behavior among Chinese clinical first-line nurses and indirectly through the mediating role of self-transcendence. It is recommended that nursing managers adjust their management strategies and techniques based on the unique characteristics of nurses during the pandemic. This includes fostering a positive and inclusive environment for organizational innovation, nurturing nurses’ motivation and awareness for innovation, enhancing their ability to gather information effectively, overcoming negative emotions resulting from the pandemic, and promoting personal growth. These efforts will ultimately enhance nursing quality and satisfaction during the Omicron pandemic.</p>","author":"Zhangyi Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5221bef57ffba02761218161686d30299b37ace26f1517a58cbec5f0e5005595","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
