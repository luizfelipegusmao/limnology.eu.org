{"title":"Effects of Bioactive Compounds in the Foods for Prevention of Metabolic syndrome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1369/v1","date":1724117906000,"content":"It seems that natural compounds with bioactivity are the food constituents, present in the diets, that may provide protective effects on health due to their biochemical effects. The main benefits appear to be decline in oxidative stress and inflammation that are crucial in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Apart from anti-inflammatory activity, these molecules also possess antifungal, and anti-infective preventative effects. Further evidence indicate that these bioactive molecules are the constituents, which are known to increase function of the foods. This review aims to emphasize that plant based diet is rich in phytochemicals such as antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, polyphenolics and flavonoids, amino acids and fatty acids, that are able to cause benefits via these compounds. These bioactive molecules can target mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation that are crucial in the management of metabolic syndrome. These antioxidant compounds appear to be essential component of plant based diets and are crucial for healthiness. Most investigators have proposed that bioactive compounds act as nutraceuticals which are able to regulate certain patho-physiological mechanisms responsible for metabolic diseases. The bioactive compoundspresent in the plant based diets are primary and secondary metabolites of nutritive and non-nutritive natural components generating health benefits by preventing or managing chronic disease or its symptoms. The bioactive compounds are known for their beneficial effects to health. Despite their small quantity in the diets, these bioactive compounds may trigger certain mechanisms that may cause alteration with improvement in health. It seems that most of the bioactive compounds co-existing in the plant-based diets, may be extremely healthful. However, if they are taken in excess, they can cause toxic effects. There is an urgent need to evaluate each bioactive compound to establish a beneficial quantity and a threshold of toxicity, while treating metabolic syndrome.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a33226192757f75d7249dfef2da861402dd91658b75767c4df14bce0d05e4b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
