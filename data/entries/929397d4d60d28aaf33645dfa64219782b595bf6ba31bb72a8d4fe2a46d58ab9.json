{"title":"The Algorithms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1259/v1","date":1724050744000,"content":"The cultural transmissions of a society like famous paintings, popular music, good poetry, and enduring religious rituals/doctrines/texts serve as mediums for the embodiment of algorithms that interact with the mind and body in looping, mostly unconscious interactions that are mutually beneficial to the participants of the society and the algorithms themselves. Useful algorithms are also found in the mind and bodies of other people, and individuals in a group can be used to outsource specialized tasks to benefit the society as a whole. Since useful algorithms must be embodied in a medium to work, there are physical limitations to the computations that can be performed in our universe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"929397d4d60d28aaf33645dfa64219782b595bf6ba31bb72a8d4fe2a46d58ab9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
