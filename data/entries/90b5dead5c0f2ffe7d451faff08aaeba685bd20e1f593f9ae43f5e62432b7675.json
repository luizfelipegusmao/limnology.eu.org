This outdoor experimental study aimed to enhance the energy performance of the photovoltaic module by integrating two fans at the outlet of the thermal/photovoltaic hybrid system to ensure forced ventilation. The work novelty depending on achieving low energy consumption by DC fans, so that there is a proportional relationship between the intensity of solar radiation and the energy produced and consumed. The influence of the reduced temperature, operating temperature, and solar radiation intensity on the energy performance of the photovoltaic/thermal hybrid system was analyzed experimentally. The obtained results showed an improvement in electrical and overall efficiency of the new hybrid system by about 4% and 60%, respectively, compared to the conventional photovoltaic module. On the contrary, a decrease in the temperature of the PV module installed in the hybrid system was measured by about 9Â°C, compared to the conventional photovoltaic module. In addition to the effectiveness of the new technology air cooling proposed at the lowest consumption cost, the thermal energy generated from the proposed system can be invested in solar drying and building applications.</p>","author":"Lyes Boutina, \nAbdelkrim Khelifa, \nMohamed Lebbi, \nFatah Bedaouche, \nKhaled Touafek, \nSofiane Kherrour, \nAbdelhalim Borni","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"90b5dead5c0f2ffe7d451faff08aaeba685bd20e1f593f9ae43f5e62432b7675","category":"Environment"}
