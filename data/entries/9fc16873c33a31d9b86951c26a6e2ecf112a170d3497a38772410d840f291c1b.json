Four diets were compared: control without β-glucans (CON), 0.15 mg/kg BW/day of β-1,3/1,6-glucans (Β-Y15), 0.15 mg/kg BW/day of β-1,3-glucans (Β-S15), and 0.30 mg/kg BW/day of β-1,3-glucans (Β-S30). Thirty-two healthy dogs (eight per diet) were organized in a block design. All animals were fed CON for a 42-day washout period and then sorted into one of four diets for 42 days. Blood and faeces were collected at the beginning and end of the food intake period and analysed for serum and faecal cytokines, <i>ex vivo</i> production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO), phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), <i>ex vivo</i> production of IgG, and faecal concentrations of IgA and calprotectin. Data were evaluated using analysis of covariance and compared using Tukey’s test (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Dogs fed Β-Y15 showed higher serum IL-2 than dogs fed Β-S30 (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). A higher phagocytic index of monocytes was observed in dogs fed the B-S15 diet than in those fed the other diets, and a higher neutrophil phagocytic index was observed for B-S15 and B-Y15 than in dogs fed the CON diet (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Monocytes from dogs fed B-S15 and B-S30 produced more NO and less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than those from the CON and B-Y15 groups (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Despite in the reference value, CRP levels were higher in dogs fed B-S15 and B-S30 diets (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). β-1,3/1,6-glucan showed cell-mediated activation of the immune system, with increased serum IL-2 and neutrophil phagocytic index, whereas β-1,3-glucan acted on the immune system by increasing the <i>ex vivo</i> production of NO by monocytes, neutrophil phagocytic index, and serum CRP. Calprotectin and CRP levels did not support inflammation or other health issues related to β-glucan intake. In conclusion, both β-glucan sources modulated some immune and inflammatory parameters in dogs, however, different pathways have been suggested for the recognition and action of these molecules, reinforcing the necessity for further mechanistic studies, especially for <i>E</i>. <i>gracilis</i> β-1,3-glucan.","author":"Stephanie de Souza Theodoro","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"9fc16873c33a31d9b86951c26a6e2ecf112a170d3497a38772410d840f291c1b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
