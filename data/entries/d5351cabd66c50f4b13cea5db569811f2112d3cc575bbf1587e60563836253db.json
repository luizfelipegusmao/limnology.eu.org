{"title":"Factors Affecting Experiential Learning Experiences of University Students with Disabilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2060/v1","date":1721912279000,"content":"Background: Experiential learning (EL) experiences are an important component of a university education, positively impacting career-related attitudes, knowledge, and skills. Students also require EL opportunities to gain experiences required for admission to competitive graduate and professional programs. Students with disabilities face barriers accessing and benefiting from such opportunities. Purpose: This study examined the degree to which demographic factors, type and severity of disability, dispositional factors, and overall adjustment and wellbeing are predictive of the quality of EL experiences among university students with disabilities. Methodology/approach: A survey was distributed to undergraduate students with disabilities who have participated in EL courses. Results were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Findings/conclusions: Dispositional and adjustment and wellbeing variables, including the environmental mastery dimension of their psychological wellbeing rather than demographic factors, such as gender or type and severity of disability, are significant predictors of the quality of EL experiences among students with disabilities. Implications: For students with disabilities to have academically and professionally successful EL experiences, post-secondary institutions must continue to provide appropriate accommodations and educate instructors about the diverse and complex needs of this student group. This must include an understanding of the uniqueness of each individual studentâ€™s needs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5351cabd66c50f4b13cea5db569811f2112d3cc575bbf1587e60563836253db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
