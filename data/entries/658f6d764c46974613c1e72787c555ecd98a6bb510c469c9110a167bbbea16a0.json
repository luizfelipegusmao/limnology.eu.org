{"title":"Genetic variability of New Caledonian Boeckella De Guerne &amp; Richard, 1889 (Copepoda: Calanoida), with the description of a new species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/doi/10.1093/jcbiol/ruae001/7585773?rss=1","date":1705968000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Thirteen new freshwater populations of the copepod genus <span>Boeckella</span><a href=\"#CIT0016\">De Guerne &amp; Richard, 1889</a> were found during three expeditions to New Caledonia (‘La Planète Revisitée,’ 2016-2018). The 12 populations from the Plaine des Lacs, which show remarkable genetic diversity among themselves, were identified as <span>B. spinogibba</span><a href=\"#CIT0015\">Defaye, 1998</a>, the only species of its genus known from New Caledonia until now. The sole exception, the population from Mont-Dore 22 km further east, appeared genetically and morphologically distinct from the others and is described herein as a new species. The two species are distinguished from each other by the shapes of the male and female P5, female Th5, and body colour. A previously published key is amended to separate the species. Our concatenated COI+28S phylogeny places the two New Caledonia species as a new branch within <span>Boeckella</span>, distinct from the branches consisting of South American, Antarctic and Australasian species. All 13 <span>Boeckella</span> populations inhabit the extreme south of New Caledonia, an area known for endemism and high heavy metal concentrations in the soil. Extensive mining activity in this metal-rich area, begun in 1873, is now leading to conflict with conservation goals. By using aerial photographs to trace the fate of the pond that is the type locality of <span>B. spinogibba</span>, we confirmed that it disappeared between 2007 and 2014 as a result of the expansion of the Goro nickel mine.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Crustacean Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"8ca07ea220dbc7082c62912ab6b47a7a5a309f6e19a7257844b27bf0267b5f04","entryHash":"658f6d764c46974613c1e72787c555ecd98a6bb510c469c9110a167bbbea16a0","category":"Environment"}
