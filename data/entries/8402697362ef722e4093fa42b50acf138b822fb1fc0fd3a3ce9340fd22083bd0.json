{"title":"Environment found to explain the largest variance in physical and compositional traits in malting barley grain","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13704?af=R","date":1720092875000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Starch is the most abundant constituent (dry weight) in the barley endosperm, followed by protein. Variability of compositional and potentially related physical traits due to genotype and environment can have important implications for the malting and brewing industry. This was the first study to assess the effects of genotype, environment, and their interaction (G × E) on endosperm texture, protein content, and starch traits corresponding to granule size, gelatinization, content, and composition, using a multi-environment variety trial in California, USA.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Overall, environment explained the largest variance for all traits (ranging from 23.2% to 76.5%), except the endosperm texture traits wherein the G × E term explained the largest variance (45.0–86.5%). Our unique method to quantify the proportion of fine and coarse milled barley particles using laser diffraction showed a binomial distribution of endosperm texture. The number of small starch granules varied significantly (<i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.05) across genotypes and environments. We observed negative correlations between total protein content and each of enthalpy (−0.70), total starch content (−0.54), and difference between offset and onset gelatinization temperature (−0.52). Furthermore, amylose to amylopectin ratio was positively correlated to volume of small starch granules (0.36).</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Our findings indicate that environment played a larger role in influencing the majority of starch-related physical and compositional traits. In contrast, variance in endosperm texture was largely explained by G × E. Maltsters would benefit from accounting for environmental contributions in addition to solely genotype when making sourcing decisions, especially with regards to total protein, total starch, enthalpy, and difference between offset and onset gelatinization temperature. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Maany Ramanan, \nDaan R.
