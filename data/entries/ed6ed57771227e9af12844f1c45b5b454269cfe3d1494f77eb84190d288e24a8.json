{"title":"Efficient Recovery of Silver and Aluminum from End-of-Life Photovoltaics: A Two-Step Leaching Approach","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1825/v1","date":1727162587000,"content":"Recycling solar panels is crucial to mitigating the environmental impact of the growing volume of end-of-life photovoltaic waste and conserving valuable resources, while achieving high purity in recovered materials ensures their effective reuse in the manufacturing of new solar panels, con-tributing to a sustainable and circular economy. This study proposes a two-step leaching process to recover Ag and Al from the silicon fraction of EoL photovoltaics (PVs). In the first stage laboratory scale tests, 99% Al was extracted using 5% HCl at room temperature for 3 hrs. The Al was precip-itated as oxide from the solution. The silicon residue was then leached with 0.5 M HNO3 at 80Â°C for 2 hrs extracting 99% Ag and producing Si with 99.83% purity. The silver was precipitated to produce metallic Ag with &gt;99.9% purity. Methods to mitigate the effluent solutions were recom-mended and the entire process was presented in a flowsheet.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ed6ed57771227e9af12844f1c45b5b454269cfe3d1494f77eb84190d288e24a8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
