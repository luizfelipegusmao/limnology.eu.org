{"title":"Origins of Lunar Water Ice: Analyzing Isotope Signatures and Evidence from Satellite Observations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1651/v1","date":1716785196000,"content":"The discovery of water ice on the moon has revolutionized our understanding of lunar science and has profound implications for future space exploration and habitation. Through a comprehensive analysis of remote sensing data, isotopic studies, and neutron detection experiments, this research elucidates the presence, distribution, and origins of lunar water ice. Radar observations from missions like Clementine and Chandrayaan-1 reveal distinct polar regions with elevated circular polarization ratios, indicative of volatile ice deposits. Spectral detections by instruments such as M3 and Diviner further confirm the presence of water ice in lunar-shadowed regions, with estimates suggesting reserves of up to 300 million tons at the poles. Neutron detection experiments on lunar orbiters like LRO provide additional evidence, detecting hydrogen signals consistent with water ice below the lunar surface. Isotopic analyses offer insights into the origin and evolution of lunar water ice, with comparisons to cometary and asteroidal sources. Proposed missions, such as Artemis-3 and Artemis-4, aim to collect samples from the lunar South Pole for detailed isotopic analysis, furthering our understanding of lunar water ice's composition and history. Scientific data, including the lunar bulk water content and estimated water ice reserves, underscore the significance of lunar water ice as a critical resource for future space exploration endeavors. Calculations estimating the total water-ice area and water abundance near specific lunar features provide valuable insights into the potential utilization of lunar water ice for sustained human presence on the Moon and beyond.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3fb9b9d8ce5701f22e602d6c58fd8b219f8be59e7f45a6147b7a0fbf0e1f47f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
