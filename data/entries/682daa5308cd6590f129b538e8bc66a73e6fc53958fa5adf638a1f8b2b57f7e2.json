{"title":"Biodegradable Stents: A Breakthrough in the Management of Complex Biliary Tract Injuries: A Case Report","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0231/v1","date":1728264674000,"content":"Background and Clinical Significance: Biliary tract injuries are a recognized complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Early diagnosis and prompt management are crucial to minimize complications such as bile leaks, strictures, and fistula formation. This case report highlights the use of a biodegradable biliary stent in managing a complex biliary injury and discusses the impact of delayed diagnosis on treatment outcomes. Case Presentation: We present the case of a 30-year-old male who sustained a Strasberg E2 biliary tract injury during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Initially misdiagnosed, the injury was only recognized on the fourth postoperative day. The patient underwent a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and subsequently developed a postoperative biliary fistula, which was managed with percutaneous drainage. A biodegradable biliary stent was later placed to address a stricture and minimize the need for future interventions. One year later, the patient presented with symptoms of cholangitis, and radiological findings revealed a narrowing of the biliary lumen. The stricture was resolved and an endoscopic gastrojejunal shunt was placed to prevent further complications. The patient is currently in good condition with no signs of further complications. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis in managing biliary tract injuries and highlights the potential of biodegradable stents to reduce the need for repeat interventions. Despite a delayed diagnosis necessitating complex surgical procedures, the use of a biodegradable stent proved effective in managing postoperative complications. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of biodegradable stents in similar clinical scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"682daa5308cd6590f129b538e8bc66a73e6fc53958fa5adf638a1f8b2b57f7e2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
