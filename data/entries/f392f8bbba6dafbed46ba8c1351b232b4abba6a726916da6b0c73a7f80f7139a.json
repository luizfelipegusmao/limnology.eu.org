{"title":"Spectral- and Image-Based Metrics for Evaluating Cleaning Tests on Unvarnished Painted Surfaces","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0896/v1","date":1720693199000,"content":"Despite advances in conservation-restoration treatments, most surface cleaning tests are subjectively evaluated. Scores according to qualitative criteria are employed to assess results, but these can vary by user and context. This paper presents a range of cleaning efficacy and homogeneity evaluation metrics for appraising cleaning trials, which minimise user bias by measuring quantifiable changes in the appearance and characteristic spectral properties of surfaces. The metrics are based on various imaging techniques (optical imaging by photography using visible light (VIS); spectral imaging in the visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) ranges; chemical imaging by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral mapping in the mid-infrared (MIR) range; and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) element mapping). They are complemented by appearance measurements (glossimetry and colorimetry). As a case study showcasing the low-cost to high-end metrics, agar gel spray cleaning tests on exposed ground and unvarnished oil paint mock-ups are reported. The evaluation metrics indicated that spraying agar (prepared with citric acid in ammonium hydroxide) at a surface-tailored pH was as a safe candidate for efficacious and homogenous soiling removal on water-sensitive oil paint and protein-bound ground. Further research is required to identify a gel-based cleaning system for oil-bound grounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f392f8bbba6dafbed46ba8c1351b232b4abba6a726916da6b0c73a7f80f7139a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
