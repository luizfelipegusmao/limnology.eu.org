{"title":"A Rare Case of Cholecystoduodenal Fistula with Gastric Outlet Obstruction&mdash;Bouveret's Syndrome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1566/v1","date":1716475101000,"content":"The migration of gallstones from the gallbladder into the gastrointestinal tract has been recognized for over 100 years. The most common way gallstone reaches the digestive tract is through a fistula between the gallbladder and the duodenum. Large stones become impacted in the duodenum and result in gastric outlet obstruction (Bouveret's syndrome). In this report, we present a 81-years old patient with the cholecystoduodenal fistula, which was diagnosed by ultrasound and computed tomography and effectively surgically managed. Even Bouveret syndrome is rare, with a timely diagnosis followed with an appropriate treatment maybe we could decrease morbidity and mortality rates of this complication.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"802b1d8a86be164955f43b58472a3c8d201389af34e53ad07eb6da5c368b616a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
