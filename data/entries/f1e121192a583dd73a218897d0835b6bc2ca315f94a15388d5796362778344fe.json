{"title":"Revolutionizing Cancer Treatment - The Emergence and Impact of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs): A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0658/v1","date":1712711084000,"content":"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a groundbreaking advancement in cancer therapy, synergistically combine the precision of monoclonal antibodies with the potent destruction capabilities of cytotoxic drugs, signifying a new era in the targeted oncological treatments. This comprehensive paper delves into the evolving field of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and their pivotal role in cancer therapy. We have conducted an in-depth exploration of the structural components of ADCs, including target antigens, monoclonal antibodies, chemical linkers, and cytotoxic payloads, each playing a crucial role in determining the efficacy and safety profile of these novel therapies. A detailed market analysis reveals the leading pharmaceutical companies shaping the ADC landscape, reflecting the growing interest and potential in this therapeutic approach. We further dissect the engineering intricacies of ADCs, focusing on their ability to target specific cancer cell antigens while minimizing off-target effects, thus offering a more focused treatment with reduced systemic side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. This approach holds promise in a heightened therapeutic index and decreased toxicity. The mechanisms and effector functions of ADCs are explored, highlight- ing their multifaceted strategy in combating cancer. We include a comprehensive look at how ADCs operate from initial blood circulation to the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. We also review several key ADCs currently in use or under investigation, offering insights into their unique mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and clinical implications. The discussion extends to drug creation modalities, focusing on innovative conjugation techniques that enhance ADC homogeneity and therapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, the paper underscores the transformative potential of ADCs in the realm of cancer treatment, marking a shift towards more precise and targeted therapeutic approaches. By offering a thorough analysis of ADC technology, this paper sheds light on the prospects of these groundbreaking therapies in the ongoing fight against cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f1e121192a583dd73a218897d0835b6bc2ca315f94a15388d5796362778344fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
