{"title":"Differential Responses of Soil Phosphorus Fractions to Nitrogen and Phosphorus Fertilization: A Global Meta‐Analysis","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GB008064?af=R","date":1722224943000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to terrestrial ecosystems alter soil nutrient cycling. However, the global-scale responses of soil P fractions to N and P inputs and their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We conducted a global meta-analysis based on 818 observations of soil P fractions from 99 field N and P addition experiments in forest, grassland, and cropland ecosystems ranging from temperate to tropical zones. Our global meta-analysis revealed distinct responses of soil P fractions to N and P enrichment. For studies using the Chang and Jackson inorganic (Pi) method, we found that high N addition promoted the transformation of immobile Pi fractions into Ferrum/Aluminum-bound Pi and available Pi in surface soils through soil acidification. However, this acid-induced transformation of Pi fractions by N addition was observed only in Calcium-rich soils, while in acidic soils, further acidification led to increase P binding. In contrast, additions of P alone or combined with N significantly increased all soil Pi fractions. Regarding the Hedley P fractions, N addition generally decreased labile organic P by enhancing soil acid phosphatase activity. The responses of other P fractions were influenced by soil pH, fertilization rates, ecosystem type, and other factors. P addition increased most soil P fractions. Overall, both P fractionation methods consistently demonstrate that N inputs deplete soil P and accelerate P cycling, while P inputs increase most soil P fractions, alleviating P limitation. These findings are crucial for predicting the effects of future atmospheric N and P deposition on P cycling processes.</p>","author":"Qingshui Yu, \nFrank Hagedorn, \nJosep Penuelas, \nJordi Sardans, \nXiangping Tan, \nZhengbing Yan, \nChenqi He, \nXiaofeng Ni, \nYuhao Feng, \nJiangling Zhu, \nChengjun Ji, \nZhiyao Tang, \nMai‐He Li, \nJingyun Fang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Biogeochemical Cycles: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2d4e750daa5e386ca7dda0c54cc50454a723cbd123b964bfed1d56a4712b632","entryHash":"459dacccccbea377d1c398e8f1c65663a8ef6e4d4cfcd98fd991318711ce8433","category":"Environment"}
