{"title":"ESG Reporting of Commercial Banks in Poland the Aspect of the New Requirements of the Directive on Corporate Reporting in the Field of Sustainable Development (CSRD)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0486/v1","date":1725602986000,"content":"For several years, commercial banks in Poland have been reporting activities related to the impact on the environment, society, and corporate governance (ESG). However, only new guidelines, mandatory for many entities, including banks, will allow for comparing these reports, which will be of great importance mainly for investors. The forms of these reports were and still are different, difficult to compare in individual years, and difficult to compare between banks.\nThe article aims to present the banks' preparation for the new reporting rules based on the latest ESG reports. The research was conducted in 4 groups of commercial banks operating in Poland, which are the largest companies listed in the WIG Banks sub-index of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Gaps in the preparation of these banks for non-financial reporting were identified.\nThe non-financial reports of the banks studied have significant information potential that can be used by various stakeholder groups, including investors, customers, employees, regulators, and local communities. However, the comparability of ESG reports is one of the key challenges faced by both reporting banks and users of these reports.\nThe research results can be used both in scientific works and by bank representatives to improve non-financial reports.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b89c1988f49a8376104a78b39b34a41532d249493aaf70dfd6d13973f0cb9bec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
