{"title":"Three-Dimensional Imaging of 2D Materials with Tilted Multislice Electron Ptychography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.919/7719838?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Because of its exceptionally high spatial resolution perpendicular (10s of pm) and parallel (2-3 nm) to the electron beam direction, multislice electron ptychography offers a new potential route for 3D atomic resolution characterization [<a href=\"#ozae044.919-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.919-B2\">2</a>]. Compared to existing atomic-scale imaging methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), multislice ptychography obtains improved depth information at each tilt. For example, in optical depth sectioning using annular dark field (ADF)-STEM, the depth resolution is limited by diffraction and residual aberrations to several nanometers [<a href=\"#ozae044.919-B3\">3</a>]. Electron tomography overcomes this limitation by acquiring and combining data from multiple tilts to solve 3D structures [<a href=\"#ozae044.919-B4\">4</a>], but requires careful image alignment and reconstruction, and its depth resolution is closely tied to the tilt range acquired. In contrast, multislice electron ptychography reconstructs the sample in 3D from a single 4D-STEM dataset. The sample is modeled as a stack of slices through which a probe propagates; the probe and the sample are solved for in an iterative process. However, this is still not enough to easily separate atoms that are overlapping in projection. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to extract 3D atomic coordinates in twisted bilayer 2D materials. By collecting 4D-STEM data from a tilted sample, we minimize overlap between atoms in projection, allowing us to locate most of the atoms within the field of view. Through simulations, we show that this approach can produce atomic coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy and precision in all three dimensions, though with persistent systematic errors in the z-coordinates. Our results show the potential of multislice electron ptychography for studying 3D atomic structure, whether from a single view angle or as part of a tomographic tilt series.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"b0b8bb9797e105bb05ab7a5b67f968c5485c6c98a8dc1500548d7540d2f0fd13","category":"Environment"}
