{"title":"High-latitude ocean habitats are a crucible of fish body shape diversification","link":"https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/8/5/669/7666910?rss=1","date":1715126400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A decline in diversity from the equator to the poles is a common feature of Earth’s biodiversity. Here, we examine body shape diversity in marine fishes across latitudes and explore the role of time and evolutionary rate in explaining the diversity gradient. Marine fishes’ occupation of upper latitude environments has increased substantially over the last 80 million years. Fishes in the highest latitudes exhibit twice the rate of body shape evolution and one and a third times the disparity compared to equatorial latitudes. The faster evolution of body shape may be a response to increased ecological opportunity in polar and subpolar oceans due to (1) the evolution of antifreeze proteins allowing certain lineages to invade regions of cold water, (2) environmental disturbances driven by cyclical warming and cooling in high latitudes, and (3) rapid transitions across depth gradients. Our results add to growing evidence that evolutionary rates are often faster at temperate, not tropical, latitudes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Letters Current Issue","siteHash":"ccc44437a8276654c44dddd156a8ce3b5dae5730f1c2406ed04aa90599bdf071","entryHash":"caff15fde7be2a43946edbb0628cc85197974ef798a85cc80d63d522df08a2c7","category":"Environment"}
