{"title":"Ectopic thyroid adenoma diagnosed in a Senegal seabream (Diplodus bellottii, Steindachner 1882): Towards an accurate diagnosis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14015?af=R","date":1725886867000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Thyroid tissue in teleosts is located mainly in the pharyngeal region, usually reaching other adjacent anatomical locations. Herein, a nodular lesion located in the left operculum of a Senegal seabream (<i>Diplodus bellottii</i>) was surgically excised and sent for microscopical evaluation. Microscopically, the lesion presented irregular borders and consisted in columnar epithelial cells arranged in a tubulopapillary pattern, surrounding a central lumen filled with acellular, acidophilic and homogeneous, material (‘colloid’). To determine the lesion's histogenesis, immunohistochemistry was performed employing antibodies for AE1/AE3, CK7, thyroglobulin and vimentin. The neoplastic cells presented low mitotic index and positive immunolabelling for CK7 and thyroglobulin. Therefore, a diagnosis of ectopic thyroid adenoma was made. Herein, the successful employment of antibodies classically used in mammals for accurate diagnosis of thyroid disorders is described. Proliferation of thyroid tissue in fish may reflect environmental and physiological imbalances, making the study and correct diagnosis of these tumours in this species important.</p>","author":"Gabriela Fernandes da Silva, \nFátima Faria, \nFátima Gil, \nNuno Leitão, \nPaulo Ribeiro, \nKatia Pinello, \nJoão Niza‐Ribeiro, \nIrina Amorim","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"d6d8258dc1eea0c93d896025bc5e2b4c1986bc3944a2c66378dfb9e73152e1aa","category":"Environment"}
