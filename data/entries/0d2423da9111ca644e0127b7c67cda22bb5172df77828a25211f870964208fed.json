Persistent organic pollutants were determined in sponge mesohyl tissues, along with the estimation of the microbial enzymatic activity rates, prokaryotic abundance and morphometric traits, and the analysis of the taxonomic bacterial diversity by next-generation sequencing techniques. The main bacterial groups associated with <i>S. lacustris</i> were <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> and <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i>, followed by <i>Chloroflexi</i> and <i>Acidobacteria</i>. The structure of the <i>S. lacustris-</i>associated bacterial communities was in sharp contrast to those of the bacterioplankton, being statistically close to those found in sediments. Dieldrin was measured at higher concentrations in the sponge tissues (3.1 ± 0.4 ng/g) compared to sediment of the same site (0.04 ± 0.03 ng/g). Some taxonomic groups were possibly related to the occurrence of certain contaminants, as was the case of <i>Patescibacteria</i> and dieldrin. Obtained results substantially contribute to the still scarce knowledge of bacterial community diversity, activities, and ecology in freshwater sponges.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner Points</h2>\n<p>\nMicrobial community associated with <i>Spongilla lacustris</i> is probably shaped by the occurrence of certain contaminants, mainly dieldrin and heavy metals.\nA higher accumulation of dieldrin in the sponge mesohyl tissues than in sediment was determined.\n<i>S. lacustris</i> is suggested as sponge species to be used as a sentinel of pesticide pollution in the Pasvik River.\n<i>S. lacustris</i>, living in tight contact with soft substrates, harbored communities more similar to sediment than water communities.\n</p>","author":"Angelina Lo Giudice, \nMaria Papale, \nCarmen Rizzo, \nStefania Giannarelli, \nGabriella Caruso, \nPaul Eric Aspholm, \nGiovanna Maimone, \nMaurizio Azzaro","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"0d2423da9111ca644e0127b7c67cda22bb5172df77828a25211f870964208fed","category":"Environment"}
