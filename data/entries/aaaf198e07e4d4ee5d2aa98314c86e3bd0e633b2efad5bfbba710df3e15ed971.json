{"title":"Tracing the EoL-Tyre Management Chain in Togo with Focus of Implementing a Tyre Recycling Plant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0571/v1","date":1725631586000,"content":"To evaluate the used and End-of-Life tyre management chains, both direct observation and interviews with approximately 200 used-tyre dealers were conducted. The study revealed that while the used tyre business is well-organized, End-of-Life tyre treatment is nearly non-existent, often involving dumping, open burning for metal recovery, or use in meat processing, causing environmental and health risks. To address these challenges, an 8 t/hr capacity tyre recycling plant is planned, based on estimated tyre availability and development opportunities for sustainable recycling in Togo.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aaaf198e07e4d4ee5d2aa98314c86e3bd0e633b2efad5bfbba710df3e15ed971","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
