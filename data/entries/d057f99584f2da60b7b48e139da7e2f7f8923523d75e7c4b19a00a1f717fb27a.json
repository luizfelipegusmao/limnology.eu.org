{"title":"Assessing the Impact of BEAM Inoculant on Plant Growth Enhancement: A Comparative Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0270/v1","date":1714981399000,"content":"This study investigates the efficiency of BEAM (Biologically Enhanced Agriculture Management) inoculant, derived from compost produced under Dr. David Johnson-Su's composting technique, in promoting plant growth. A winter mix of pasture comprising Oats, Tetila, unhulled Couch, and Haifa was used as the test crop. Seeds were soaked in BEAM inoculant, water (control), and a competitor product 'Companion.' Results revealed significant enhancements in germination rates, foliage growth, and root development in the BEAM-treated group compared to controls. Further research aims to identify the microbial components of BEAM and explore its potential as a suppressant for fusarium species in orchards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d057f99584f2da60b7b48e139da7e2f7f8923523d75e7c4b19a00a1f717fb27a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
