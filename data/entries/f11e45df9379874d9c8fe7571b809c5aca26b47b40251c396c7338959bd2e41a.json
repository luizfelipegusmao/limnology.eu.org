{"title":"Impact of the Use of Treated Wastewater with Constructed Wetlands in the Irrigation of Phaseolus vulgaris: Safety Evaluation and Detection of Microplastics using FT-IR","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1600/v1","date":1716538447000,"content":"The impact of the presence of Microplastics (Mp's) has become popular due to its presence in all environments, however, its transportation, accommodation and destination is still unknown. This study developed a laboratory-scale experiment, using eco-technologies for the treatment of domestic wastewater and reused for agriculture. A Constructed Wetland System of horizontal subsurface flow conditioned with substrate gravel and with two types of ornamental plants Hippeastrum Hybridum Hort and Heliconia Bihai Marginata, obtained an average 90% efficiency in the removal of pollutants COD, TDS, NH4, NT, PO4 , NO2 and PT; directing water through a drip irrigation system for irrigation of the Phaseolus vulgaris crop, selected for its nutritional importance (36% of daily protein intake), grown in two Growth Beds; The crop irrigated with treated water presented a greater relationship between growth and number of pods; finally identify the presence of Mp's through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis in the different types of water (domestic waste, treated waste and well) and determine the quality of the fruit for consumption with safety tests.
