{"title":"Development and characterization of a <i>Gucy2d-cre </i>mouse to selectively manipulate a subset of inhibitory spinal dorsal horn interneurons","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300282","date":1710424800000,"content":"<p>by Elizabeth K.

Baccei</p>\r\n\r\nRecent transcriptomic studies identified <i>Gucy2d</i> (encoding guanylate cyclase D) as a highly enriched gene within inhibitory dynorphin interneurons in the mouse spinal dorsal horn. To facilitate investigations into the role of the <i>Gucy2d+</i> population in somatosensation, <i>Gucy2d-cre</i> transgenic mice were created to permit chemogenetic or optogenetic manipulation of this subset of spinal neurons. <i>Gucy2d-cre</i> mice created via CRISPR/Cas9 genomic knock-in were bred to mice expressing a cre-dependent reporter (either tdTomato or Sun1.GFP fusion protein), and the resulting offspring were characterized. Surprisingly, a much wider population of spinal neurons was labeled by cre-dependent reporter expression than previous mRNA-based studies would suggest. Although the cre-dependent reporter expression faithfully labeled ~75% of cells expressing <i>Gucy2d</i> mRNA in the adult dorsal horn, it also labeled a substantial number of additional inhibitory neurons in which no <i>Gucy2d</i> or <i>Pdyn</i> mRNA was detected. Moreover, cre-dependent reporter was also expressed in various regions of the brain, including the spinal trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, thalamus, somatosensory cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Injection of AAV-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato viral vector into adult <i>Gucy2d-cre</i> mice produced a similar pattern of cre-dependent reporter expression in the spinal cord and brain, which excludes the possibility that the unexpected reporter-labeling of cells in the deep dorsal horn and brain was due to transient <i>Gucy2d</i> expression during early stages of development. Collectively, these results suggest that <i>Gucy2d</i> is expressed in a wider population of cells than previously thought, albeit at levels low enough to avoid detection with commonly used mRNA-based assays. Therefore, it is unlikely that these <i>Gucy2d-cre</i> mice will permit selective manipulation of inhibitory signaling mediated by spinal dynorphin interneurons, but this novel cre driver line may nevertheless be useful to target a broader population of inhibitory spinal dorsal horn neurons.","author":"Elizabeth K.
