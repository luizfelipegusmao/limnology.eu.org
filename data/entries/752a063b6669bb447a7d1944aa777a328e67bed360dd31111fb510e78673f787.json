Through in-depth interviews with procurement managers, supply chain experts, and supplier representatives, the research identifies four critical themes: trust, technology integration, ethical practices, and performance measurement. Trust is found to be the foundation of effective supplier relationships, fostering open communication and collaboration, which are essential for addressing challenges and co-creating solutions. The integration of digital technologies such as supply chain management software, blockchain, and the Internet of Things significantly enhances transparency, decision-making, and operational efficiency, providing a competitive edge. Ethical practices, including adherence to fair labor standards and environmental sustainability, are increasingly crucial as consumer and regulatory expectations evolve, necessitating alignment between e-commerce companies and their suppliers. Performance measurement and continuous improvement are vital for maintaining quality and efficiency, with clear metrics and regular evaluations driving constructive feedback and optimization of supply chain processes. The study underscores the interdependence of these elements in fostering resilient and adaptable supplier relationships. The findings offer practical guidance for e-commerce businesses and suppliers, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to supplier management that balances trust, technology, ethics, and performance. This approach not only enhances operational effectiveness but also ensures the long-term sustainability of supplier relationships in the dynamic e-commerce landscape. The research contributes to the theoretical understanding of supplier relationship management, providing a comprehensive framework for future studies and practical applications in the e-commerce industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"752a063b6669bb447a7d1944aa777a328e67bed360dd31111fb510e78673f787","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
