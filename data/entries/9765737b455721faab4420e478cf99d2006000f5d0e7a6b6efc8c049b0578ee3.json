Results: Nanoparticles are currently present in several consumer products, including medications, food, textiles, sports equipment, and electrical components. Despite the advantages of Nanoparticles, their potential toxicity has negative impact on human health, particularly on reproductive health. Conclusions: The impact of various NPs on reproductive system function is yet to be determined. Additional research is required to study the potential toxicity of various Nanoparticles on reproductive health. The primary objective of this review is to unravel the toxic effects of different Nanoparticles on the human reproductive functions and recent investigations on the reproductive toxicity of Nanoparticles both in vitro and in vivo.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"9765737b455721faab4420e478cf99d2006000f5d0e7a6b6efc8c049b0578ee3","category":"Environment"}
