{"title":"Sensitivity Analysis of Bogie Wheelbase and Axle Load for Low-Floor Freight Wagons, basing on Wheel Wear","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1420/v1","date":1718887477000,"content":"This paper shows the usage of a numerical analysis model which enables the calculation of the life of a railway wheels used for low-floor freight wagons as a function of its primary operating factors, which allows carrying out sensitivity analyses. Low-floor wagons are being increasingly used for combined transport applications and many types of bogies have been proposed in order to constitute the wagons. Due to the uniqueness of this type of wagons, the bogie configurations in terms of wheelbase and axle load have hardly been analyzed so far. The numerical analysis model used addresses the primary challenges that arise in the vehicle â€“ track interaction and establish the relations among them. The main aspects of this model have been described in the paper, which has been later used to calculate the life of an ordinary-diameter wheel for several wheelbase and axle load values. This study has been replicated with reduced-diameter wheels, which are commonly used for low-floor wagons. In this way, it is possible to know the evolution of the life depending on the wheelbase and the axle load. The root causes underlying the observed behaviors can be explained by the entire understanding of the rolling phenomenon provided by the full analytical work.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bfcf550897ffff55e12fd3fcd4a553a98c8f2e41e8291f2afb47be8bd21ddb58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
