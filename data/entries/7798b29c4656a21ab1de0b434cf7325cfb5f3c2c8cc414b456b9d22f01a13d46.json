{"title":"Exploring the Impact of Microstructure on the Mechanical Properties of High-Strength Zn Coating For Biomedical Application","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.633/7719650?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Zinc (Zn) is emerging as a promising candidate for biomedical applications due to its unique biodegradability and biocompatibility properties. This study explores the application of Zn as an antibacterial coating for implants, coupled with a tunable micro 3D-printed architected structure fabricated via template-assisted electrodeposition to enhance cell adhesion. This study focuses on the comprehensive characterization of a Zn coating synthesized through electrodeposition, a versatile and cost-efficient technique for producing diverse 2D and 3D coatings.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7798b29c4656a21ab1de0b434cf7325cfb5f3c2c8cc414b456b9d22f01a13d46","category":"Environment"}
