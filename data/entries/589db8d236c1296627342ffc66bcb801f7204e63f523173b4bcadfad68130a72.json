{"title":"Energy, Exergetic and Thermoeconomic Analyses of Hydrogen-Fueled 1-kW Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1080/v1","date":1715849049000,"content":"Exergy analysis evaluates the efficiency of system components by quantifying the rate of entropy generation. In general, the exergy destruction rate or irreversibility rate was directly obtained through the exergy-balance equation. However, this method cannot determine the origin of the component's entropy generation rate, which is a very important factor in system design and improvement. In this study, a thorough energy, exergy thermoeconomic analysis of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was performed, providing the heat transfer rate, entropy generation rate and cost loss rate of each component. The irreversibility rate of each component is obtained by the Gouy-Stodolar theorem. Detailed and extensive exergy and thermoeconomic analyses of PEMFC system have determined that water cooling units experience the greatest heat transfer among the components in the studied PEMFC system, resulting in the greatest irreversibility and thus the greatest monetary flow loss.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"589db8d236c1296627342ffc66bcb801f7204e63f523173b4bcadfad68130a72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
