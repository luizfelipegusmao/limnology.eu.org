FHA is characterized by acquired suppression of physiological pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus in the absence of an identifiable structural cause, resulting in a functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. FHA results from either decreased energy intake and/or excessive exercise, leading to low energy availability and weight lossâ€”often in combination with psychological stress on top of a background of genetic susceptibility. The hypothalamic neuropeptide kisspeptin is a key component of the GnRH pulse generator, tightly regulating pulsatile GnRH secretion and the downstream reproductive axis. Here, we review the physiological regulation of pulsatile GnRH secretion by hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons and how their activity is modulated by signals of energy status to affect reproductive function. We explore endocrine factors contributing to the suppression of GnRH pulsatility in the pathophysiology of FHA and how hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons likely represent a final common pathway through which these factors affect GnRH pulse generation. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of kisspeptin as a novel treatment for women with FHA.</p>","author":"Aaran H.
