{"title":"Effect of Laser Remelting of NiCrAlY-APS Coating on High-Temperature Oxidation Resistance","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1751/v1","date":1714136094000,"content":"In this study, the NiCrAlY coating was prepared using the atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The sample was then exposed to a continuous fiber laser beam. Laser surface melting (LSM) can effectively homogenize the composition of the coating. It also reduced the defects and roughness. The coating was examined using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The process parameters of the LSM consist of laser power and scan rate. The high-temperature oxidation test was conducted for 200 hours at a temperature of 1100 °C. After a period of 200 hours, the primary coating demonstrated the emergence of an aluminum oxide layer, along with the presence of harmful spinel oxides. The laser remelting technique was used to modify the surface, which led to the uniform growth and development of an aluminum oxide layer (α-Al₂O₃) during the oxidation examination. Therefore, it appears that the reduction in grain size caused by laser remelting prevents the wrinkling of Al2O3 oxide. This process represents a novel and alternative approach to modifying MCrAlY coatings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0488a3da28aa21a61a5ff298915f0867a869c9155a6715c4d013b309b3af7ee9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
