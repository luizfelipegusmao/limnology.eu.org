{"title":"Combined Epiretinal Proliferation and Internal Limiting Membrane Inverted Flap for the Treatment of Large Macular Holes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0497/v1","date":1725608190000,"content":"We are presenting a new method for the treatment of large macular holes (MH) with the use of an inverted flap consisting of both internal limiting membrane (ILM) and epiretinal proliferation (EP). A prospective interventional case series was conducted from September 2021 to January 2023. MH patients with coexistent EP visualized preoperatively in macula optical coherence tomography and MH minimum linear diameter larger than 400 microns underwent standard pars plana vitrectomy with the creation of an inverted petaloid flap (consisting of both ILM and EP) and gas tamponade. 16 eyes were included in our study. MH closure was successful in all the eyes with a single procedure. Preoperative minimum linear diameter was 707.63(±164.02μm) and preoperative best corrected visual acuity was 1.11±0.52. Postoperative BCVA was 0.51±0.20 (p=0.01) at 6weeks postoperatively and final BCVA was 0.45±0.20 (p=0.008). EP can be safely combined with ILM for the creation of an inverted, petaloid flap to cover and facilitate the closure of large MH.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"17302368e46374a9d85fe30e91ec2ca71da062bc9d65ffd783c69a0ed9048f97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
