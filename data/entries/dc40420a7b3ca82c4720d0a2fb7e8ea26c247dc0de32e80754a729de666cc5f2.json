{"title":"Eicosapentaenoic Acid Rescues L-Type Ca2+ Channel Remodeling Caused by Saturated Fatty Acids via Both Free Fatty Acid Receptor 4-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Cardiomyocytes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1965/v1","date":1714457869000,"content":"Dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) exerts antiarrhythmic effects, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we investigated the possible beneficial actions of EPA on saturated fatty acid-induced changes of the L-type Ca2+ channel in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes were cultured with oleic acid/palmitic acid mixture (OAPA) in the presence or absence of EPA. Beating rate reduction of cardiomyocytes caused by OAPA were reversed by EPA. EPA also retrieved a reduction of Cav1.2-L-type Ca2+ current, mRNA and protein caused by OAPA. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a distinct downregulation of the Cav1.2 channel caused by OAPA with a concomitant decrease in the phosphorylated component of a transcription factor adenosine-3’, 5’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus, which were rescued by EPA. A free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) agonist TUG-891 reversed expression of Cav1.2- and CREB-mRNA caused by OAPA, whereas an FFAR4 antagonist AH-7614 abolished the effects of EPA. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation caused by OAPA decreased Cav1.2- and CREB-mRNA expressions, which were reversed by an ROS scavenger. Our data suggest that EPA rescues cellular remodeling caused by OAPA lipotoxicity and oxidative stresses via both free fatty acid receptor 4-dependent and -independent pathways.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc40420a7b3ca82c4720d0a2fb7e8ea26c247dc0de32e80754a729de666cc5f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
