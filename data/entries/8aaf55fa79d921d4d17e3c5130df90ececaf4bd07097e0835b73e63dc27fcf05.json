{"title":"Effect of Current on the Morphology and Microstructure of 312 Stainless Steel Cords using High Precision Tig Welding","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.281/7720438?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>The plastic injection mold industry ranks second in demand for tooling in Mexico, importing close to 1800 million dollars a year, of which national suppliers cover only 5%. The processes of repairing, remanufacturing, and engineering changes are decisive in the plastic injection mold industry due to the constant need to preserve the quality of the injected products and extend the mold's useful life. The most common failures present in the operation of injection molds are thermo-mechanical fatigue, wear, plastic deformation, corrosion, and particle adhesion. Among the advanced manufacturing technologies used for mold repair are plasma arc welding, laser cladding, MIG, TIG, and laser welding, in which the benefits of high deposition rate, geometry control, energy supply to the component, and a wide variety of precursor materials provide a competitive advantage for superficial applications. Repairs of internal cracks and small sections require technologies that manufacture small-sized beads and generate relatively low heat inputs, such as laser welding and high-precision Tig welding, also known as µTig [<a href=\"#ozae044.281-B1\">1</a>]. However, the control of the energy supplied to avoid solidification fractures, geometric distortions, or excess mold melting during repair is still a challenge due to the complexity of the kinetic and thermodynamic phenomena present in the welding process [<a href=\"#ozae044.281-B2\">2</a>]. In this work, we studied the effect of effective current Ie of the µTIG welding process on the morphology and microstructure of 312 stainless steel cords fabricated from wire feedstock using a SANWA SW-V01 equipment. The applied parameters were peak current <span>Ip</span> ranging from 50 to 100 A with a 1 Hz pulsed signal, 50% of cycle, voltage <span>U</span> of 15 V and velocity of the torch v of 100 mm/min. The cords were subjected to transverse impact tests to evaluate the integrity of the welds and then were characterized by optical microscopy, and geometric inspection.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8aaf55fa79d921d4d17e3c5130df90ececaf4bd07097e0835b73e63dc27fcf05","category":"Environment"}
