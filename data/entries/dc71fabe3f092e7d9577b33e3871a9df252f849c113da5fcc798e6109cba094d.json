This relationship can be studied using selections of microbes termed synthetic communities, or SynComs. SynComs are used in many different animal hosts, including agricultural animals, to investigate microbial interactions with nutrients and how these affect animal health. The most common host focuses for SynComs are currently mouse and human, from basic mechanistic research through to translational disease models and live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) as treatments. We discuss SynComs used in basic research models and findings that relate to human and animal health and nutrition. Translational use cases of SynComs are discussed, followed by LBPs, especially within the context of agriculture. SynComs still face challenges, such as standardization for reproducibility and contamination risks. However, the future of SynComs is hopeful, especially in the areas of genome-guided SynCom design and custom SynCom-based treatments.</p></div>","author":"Susan A.V.
