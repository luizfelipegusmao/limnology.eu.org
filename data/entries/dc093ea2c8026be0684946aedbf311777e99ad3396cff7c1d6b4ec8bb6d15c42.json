Cadiovascular complications, mainly in s form of HCM contribute substantially for AFD-patientâ€™s mortality. Here we report three new cases of obstructive HCM (HOCM) due to unclassical presentation of AFD and isolated cardiac involvement. In all three cases the diagnosis of AFD was made postoperative by routine genetic and morphological testing. Together with previously published cases this report illustrates the potential safely and beneficial effect of septal surgical myectomy in patients with AFD-HOCM, as well as underlines the need for more thorough screening for clinical signs of AFD-associated cardiomyopathy and GLA variants among patients with HOCM.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc093ea2c8026be0684946aedbf311777e99ad3396cff7c1d6b4ec8bb6d15c42","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
