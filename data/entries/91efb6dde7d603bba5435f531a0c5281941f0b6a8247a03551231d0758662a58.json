{"title":"Pension Risk and the Sustainable Cost of Capital","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2326/v1","date":1727659718000,"content":"The consistent recognition of both explicit short term and implicit long term elements of post-retirement contracts between employees and the firm can have a significant implication for estimating a firms long term sustainable cost of capital. In this paper, we show that the significant levels of investment in company own stock by pension and post-retirement plans can effectively dilute the interest of pre-existing shareholders in the enterprise value of corporations in ways which are not revealed by a classic entity theory perspective on equity. We test the empirical implications of adopting a pre-existing shareholder model of the reporting entity to re-examine the relationship between a firmâ€™s sustainable cost of capital and various sources of idiosyncratic risk. We find that the estimated cost of capital is sensitive to: (a) alternative explicit versus implicit definitions of pension liability; (b) the nature and scope of long-term deferred compensation arrangements; and (c) the scope and nature of investment-related risks through investment in sponsoring company stock that are associated with these pension arrangements.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91efb6dde7d603bba5435f531a0c5281941f0b6a8247a03551231d0758662a58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
