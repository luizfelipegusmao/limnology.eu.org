The transition involves a range of physical and psychological symptoms manifesting before, during, and after menopause.  Method: This cross-sectional analytical study assessed the level of awareness regarding menopausal symptoms among women in Bharatpur-9, Chitwan. A non-probability sampling technique was used to select 257 respondents. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule and analyzed with SPSS version 20.0.  Results: Among the respondents, 53.3% were aged 40-49 years (Mean ± S.D.; 48.84 ± 6.27), and 69.3% experienced menarche between ages 13- 15. A majority (59.9%) had not yet reached menopause. Knowledge of menopausal symptoms was as follows: joint pain (90.7%), sleep problems (90.7%), irritability (90.7%), hot flushes (22.2%), anxiety (22.2%), sadness (22.2%), vaginal dryness (22.6%), loss of interest in sex (25.7%), palpitations (18.7%), and decreased visual acuity (9.3%). Statistical significance was found between awareness levels and factors such as religion (p=0.00), ethnicity (p=0.00), educational status (p=0.006), family type (p=0.043), cessation of menstruation (p=0.013), and cause of menopause (p=0.00). Overall, 53.7% of respondents had average knowledge about menopausal symptoms.  Conclusion: The study concluded that over half of the respondents possessed average awareness of menopausal symptoms. Hence, there is a need for women to receive correct and comprehensive information regarding menopausal symptoms and their management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"49aaa4fe84ea0647fd796dfb7ef62912b345c7aeec6905bda39dc6267f61087d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
