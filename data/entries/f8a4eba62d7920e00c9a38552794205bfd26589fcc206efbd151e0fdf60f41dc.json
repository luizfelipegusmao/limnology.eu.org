{"title":"EV Battery Recycling: Opportunities to Foster Circular Economy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0649/v1","date":1712651102000,"content":"India has pledged ambitious initiatives to mitigate its growing economiesâ€™ impact on the climate, including a goal of net zero emissions by 2070. The transportation sector is one of the key sources of emissions. Therefore, fostering e-mobility within this sector is a key priority for the Indian government. The lifecycle of LiBs raises numerous concerns regarding its sustainability in production, use of rare materials, and most importantly waste management. Furthermore, this paper will highlight the case for EV battery recycling as a growing sector that also has the potential to foster circularity in the EV sector.  Through the introductory section, this paper lays out rationale for battery recycling in a circular EV economy. The subsequent sections discuss the current and emerging battery technologies and their link to recycling methods whilst overviewing domestic and foreign battery recycling companies. Finally, the paper concludes with a gap assessment of the battery recycling ecosystem in India and makes recommendations to further integrate this industry into the EV supply chain.  As India steers towards a sustainable future, it is imperative that the country integrates battery recycling to enhance circularity in the EV ecosystem, closing the gap between a growing number of EVs and waste management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f8a4eba62d7920e00c9a38552794205bfd26589fcc206efbd151e0fdf60f41dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
