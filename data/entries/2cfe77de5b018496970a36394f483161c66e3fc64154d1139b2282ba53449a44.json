{"title":"Bioisosteric Replacement in the Search for Biologically Active Compounds: Design, Synthesis and Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Novel [1,2, 4]triazino[2,3-C]quinazolines","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0540/v1","date":1728378855000,"content":"Designing novel biologically active compounds with anti-inflammatory properties based on condensed quinazolines is a significant area of interest in modern medicinal chemistry. In the present study, we describe the development of promising new bioactive molecules through the bioisosteric replacement of a carbon atom with a sulfur atom in anti-inflammatory agents, specifically 3-methyl-2-oxo-2H-[1,2,4]triazino[2,3-c]quinazolin-6-yl)butanoate. Design and synthetic studies have led to the series of previously unknown substituted 2-[((3-R-2-oxo-2H-[1,2,4]triazino[2,3-c]quinazolin-6-yl)methyl)thio]carboxylic acids and their esters. These compounds were synthesized by reacting 6-chloroalkyl-3-R-2H-[1,2,4]triazino[2,3-c]quinazolin-2-ones with mercaptoalkyl carboxylic acids and their functional derivatives. The purity and structure of the obtained compounds were confirmed using a set of physicochemical methods, including elemental analysis, HPLC-MS, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Molecular modeling, predicted toxicity, drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics data were used to select compounds for evaluation of their effects on acute aseptic inflammation (carrageenan-induced paw edema test) and on markers of the inflammatory process. The compound 2-((1-(3-methyl-2-oxo-2H-[1,2,4]triazino[2,3-c]quinazolin-6-yl)ethyl)thio)acetic acid (compound 2.5) was identified as the most active anti-inflammatory agent, demonstrating significant inhibition of both paw edema development and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators. Results from docking studies and analysis of \"structure-affinity\" correlations revealed that these compounds are promising candidates for further modification and detailed investigation of their anti-inflammatory activity","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2cfe77de5b018496970a36394f483161c66e3fc64154d1139b2282ba53449a44","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
