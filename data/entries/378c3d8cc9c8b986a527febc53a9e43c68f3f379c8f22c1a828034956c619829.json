{"title":"23 Physiological and health implications of trace mineral nutrition","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/76/7757270?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Trace minerals are often recommended to avoid possible implications for beef cattle productivity. Trace minerals have several roles in livestock species, such as protein synthesis, enzyme activation, and immune functions. The primary trace minerals for cattle include zinc, copper, selenium, iron, manganese, cobalt, and iodine. These minerals serve as cofactors for numerous enzymes involved in metabolic pathways crucial for growth, reproduction, and immune function. Trace minerals such as zinc, copper, and manganese serve as cofactors for enzymes involved in metabolism. They have crucial roles in carbohydrates, protein, and lipid metabolism, facilitating energy production and nutrient utilization. Additionally, zinc, selenium and copper, are essential for maintaining a robust immune system. They are involved in the production and function of immune cells, antibody response, and the regulation of inflammation, thus aiding in the bodyâ€™s defense against pathogens and diseases. Selenium, copper, and manganese act as cofactors for antioxidant enzymes that help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. By scavenging free radicals, these trace minerals protect cells from oxidative damage and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and aging-related disorders. Cattle obtain trace minerals from various sources, including forages, grains, supplements, and water. However, the bioavailability of these minerals can be influenced by factors such as soil composition, forage type, and dietary interactions. Therefore, careful attention to mineral supplementation and management practices is necessary to meet the specific requirements of cattle at different stages of life and production. Furthermore, research continues to elucidate the complex interactions among trace minerals and their effects on cattle health and performance. Strategies such as targeted supplementation, mineral source selection, and dietary manipulation are being explored to optimize trace mineral nutrition in cattle production systems while minimizing environmental impact and economic costs. However, trace mineral sources might vary in water solubility and bioavailability, affecting their reactivity with antagonists and microorganisms in the rumen. Hence, understanding the importance of these micronutrients and implementing appropriate management practices can help ensure optimal performance and well-being of cattle herds, ultimately contributing to the efficiency and profitability of livestock operations.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"378c3d8cc9c8b986a527febc53a9e43c68f3f379c8f22c1a828034956c619829","category":"Environment"}
