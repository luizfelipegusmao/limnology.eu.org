{"title":"Heavy Metal Detection and Removal by Composite Carbon Quantum Dots/Ionomer Membranes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0811/v1","date":1715579361000,"content":"Composite membranes formed by sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) with embedded carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were used for detection and removal of heavy metal ions, such as lead and cadmium, from water. SPEEK is responsible for the capture of heavy metals based on the cation exchange mechanism, while CQDs detect their contamination by exhibiting changes in fluorescence. Water-insoluble “red” carbon quantum dots (rCQDs) were synthesized from p-phenylenediamine so that their photoluminescence was shifted from that of the polymer matrix. CQDs and the composites were characterized by several techniques: FTIR, Raman, UV/VIS, photoluminescence, XPS spectroscopies and AFM microscopy. The heavy metal ion concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The concentration ranges were 10.8 - 0.1 mM for Pb2+ and 10.0 - 0.27 mM for Cd2+. The composite achieved 100% removal efficiency for lead and cadmium if the concentration was below a half of the ion exchange capacity of SPEEK. The regeneration of membranes in 1 M NaCl was also studied. SPEEK/rCQDs showed a turn-off effect more pronounced for lead. A second order law was effective to describe the kinetics of the process.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e253855461761697011c2640de0926d131e59e0ca40e6b54b1971f90fdffe7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
