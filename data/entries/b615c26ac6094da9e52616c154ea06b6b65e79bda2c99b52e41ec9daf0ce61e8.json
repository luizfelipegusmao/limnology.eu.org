This study aimed to assess the implementation of the 7-Item Japan Urgent Stroke Triage (JUST-7) score by emergency medical services (EMS) in our region and its effect on emergency transportation for suspected stroke patients. Data were collected from patients suspected of having an acute stroke with a Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) score of 1 or more who were transferred by ambulance within 24 h of symptom onset. Two prehospital stroke scales were employed during different periods: period 1 with CPSS alone (January to December 2020) and period 2 with both CPSS and JUST-7 (January 2021 to March 2023). On-scene time data were obtained from the EMS crews, and data regarding the final diagnosis of patients and their outcomes were obtained from the respective hospitals to which the patients were transferred. These data were compared between periods 1 and 2 and between the CPSS and JUST-7. The results revealed that additional evaluation with JUST-7 did not affect ambulance transport time. The CPSS+JUST-7 approach demonstrated higher specificity in identifying stroke and major artery occlusion than with the CPSS alone; however, an appropriate cut-off value needs to be considered. The JUST-7 achieved a diagnostic concordance rate of 35.9% for the most likely stroke type and 64.0% for the first two most likely types. This research emphasizes the potential of JUST-7 as a valuable addition to prehospital stroke diagnosis protocols. Its flexibility in adapting cut-off values based on regional factors and available medical resources optimizes its utility in diverse healthcare settings. The JUST-7 score is a promising tool for improving patient outcomes through prompt and accurate prehospital assessments.","author":"Takayuki Nishiwaki","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b615c26ac6094da9e52616c154ea06b6b65e79bda2c99b52e41ec9daf0ce61e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
