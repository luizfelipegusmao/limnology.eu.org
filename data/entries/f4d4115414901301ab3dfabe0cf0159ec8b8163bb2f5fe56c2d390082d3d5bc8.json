{"title":"Adverse Effects of Aβ1-42 Oligomers: Impaired Contextual Memory and Altered Intrinsic Properties of CA1 Pyramidal Neurons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2151/v1","date":1727361628000,"content":"Aβ1-42 (amyloid beta) oligomers, the major neurotoxic culprits in Alzheimer's disease, initiate early pathophysiological events, including neuronal hyperactivity, that underlie aberrant network activity and cognitive impairment. Although several synaptotoxic effects have been extensively studied, neuronal hyperexcitability which may also contribute to cognitive deficits is not fully understood. Here, we found several adverse effects of in vivo injection of Aβ1-42 oligomers on contextual memory and intrinsic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Male rats underwent behavioral and electrophysiological studies 1 week after microinjections into the dorsal CA1 region, followed by histological analysis. After 1 week, Aβ1-42 oligomers impaired contextual learning without affecting basic physiological functions and triggered training-induced neuronal excitability. Furthermore, riluzole, a persistent sodium current (INaP) blocker, dose-dependently reduced Aβ1-42 oligomer-induced hyperexcitability. Congo red staining, which detects insoluble amyloid deposits, further identified labeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons while immunohistochemistry with lecanemab, which detects soluble Aβ oligomers, revealed immunoreactivity of both pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells in the target area. Therefore, our study suggests that a single injection of Aβ1-42 oligomers resulted in contextual memory deficits along with concomitant neuronal hyperexcitability and amyloid deposition in the CA1 region after 1 week.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4d4115414901301ab3dfabe0cf0159ec8b8163bb2f5fe56c2d390082d3d5bc8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
