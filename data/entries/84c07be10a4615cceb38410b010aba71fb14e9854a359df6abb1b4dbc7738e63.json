Through in-depth interviews and documentary analysis of three case study firms known for their innovative practices, the study examines how collaborative SRM practices influence innovation outcomes, organizational resilience, and competitive advantage in dynamic market environments. Key themes include the pivotal role of trust, transparency, and joint problem-solving in fostering effective SRM relationships, enabling knowledge sharing and co-development of innovative products and services. Innovation outcomes observed encompass product innovation, process improvements, and technological advancements facilitated by close collaboration between e-commerce firms and their suppliers. Challenges such as managing supplier diversity, navigating regulatory complexities, and mitigating geopolitical risks highlight the complexities and strategic imperatives of SRM implementation in global supply chains. The study also emphasizes the transformative role of digital technologies, including real-time data exchange, predictive analytics, and agile supply chain management, in enhancing SRM effectiveness and innovation capabilities. Strategic alignment with organizational goals and market strategies further enhances the impact of SRM, enabling firms to prioritize innovation initiatives, allocate resources effectively, and sustain growth amidst economic uncertainties. The findings contribute to theoretical understanding and practical insights into SRM strategies that promote innovation excellence and competitive positioning within e-commerce. The implications for practice underscore the importance of fostering collaborative supplier relationships, investing in digital transformation, and adopting proactive strategies to manage risks and regulatory compliance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84c07be10a4615cceb38410b010aba71fb14e9854a359df6abb1b4dbc7738e63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
