{"title":"Autism Spectrum Disorder and BRIEF-P: A review and meta-analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1216/v1","date":1721056177000,"content":"Introduction. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) includes different manifestations of an individual’s level of functioning. It is characterised by qualitative alterations in reciprocal social interaction and social communication, and the presence of repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. Based on two dimensions, three levels are differentiated: social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviour. Aim. To gain knowledge of the application and usefulness of BRIEF‐P in the evaluation of Executive Functions (EFs) in people with ASD. Method. Out of a total of 161,773 potentially eligible published articles from different databases. 13 appropriate articles were revised and 4 articles were selected. Studies that were included evaluated samples involving individuals with ASD aged 2 to 8 years, and were published in English or Spanish during the period of 2012‐2022. Results. The executive profile obtained from the application of BRIEF‐P in individuals with ASD was analysed. Conclusion. Results confirm deficits in flexibility, although they are not conclusive. This may be due to aspects related to methodology, whereby the studies (i) include very large and heterogeneous age groups, (ii) do not discriminate based on the level of competence, and (iii) use instruments for evaluating Executive Functions that are not validated or adapted to people with ASD. Another reason is due to the lack of consensus in the very operational definition of the Executive Functions construct, with the studies focusing mainly on the cold dimension while ignoring the hot dimension","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2263626c8b315097e85d4db490937cef9ab7340d9730fc7be20e9cb23d1494fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
