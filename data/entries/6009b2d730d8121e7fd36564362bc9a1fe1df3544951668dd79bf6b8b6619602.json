{"title":"Cuba: biodiversity, conservation and evolution","link":"https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/140/3/319/7324806?rss=1","date":1697673600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The West Indies can be considered as a laboratory of biogeography and evolution, and the Caribbean Islands constitute one of the planet’s biodiversity hotspots. Within the region, Cuba is the largest island and is crucial to gaining an understanding of the origin and evolutionary history of Caribbean flora and fauna. This paper provides an introduction to a Special Issue of the <span>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</span> on current Cuban plant and animal biodiversity, with an emphasis on evolutionary biology and biogeography. The present issue includes 10 contributions and addresses a wide diversity of species and taxonomic groups, study levels, and research tools. This collection of articles not only provides an integrative vision of Cuba’s biodiversity and the potential patterns and processes involved in its evolutionary history, but could also provide food for future research on its biodiversity from an evolutionary perspective.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"6009b2d730d8121e7fd36564362bc9a1fe1df3544951668dd79bf6b8b6619602","category":"Environment"}
