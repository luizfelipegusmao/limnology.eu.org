{"title":"An evaluation of the cetacean bycatch monitoring programme on board the Spanish set gillnet and bottom pair trawl fleets in the Bay of Biscay","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/81/2/307/7471698?rss=1","date":1702425600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Bycatch of cetaceans by European Union (EU) fleets is mostly monitored by onboard observers under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) programme. There is concern that the resulting estimates of cetacean bycatch mortality are biased and imprecise, because bycatch events are rare, sampling coverage is limited, and DCF observers prioritize the sampling of the discard of commercial species. Here, we explore the utility of the recently established Spanish cetacean bycatch monitoring programme to estimate cetacean bycatch mortality and compare it to the EU DCF programme. Data from October 2020 to September 2021 from this new Spanish programme were analysed to explore the following issues: (i) representativeness of the sampling frame; (ii) estimation of bycatch per unit of effort (BPUE); and (iii) sampling coverage. The probabilistic sampling design of the programme, with a record of refusals, has allowed identification and correction of biases in BPUE estimation. BPUE estimates for the bottom pair trawl fleet were recalculated to account for the fact that although boats work in pairs, each pair is monitored by a single observer located in a single boat. In relation to the sampling coverage, our results point to a need for levels up to 31% to achieve statistically robust bycatch rates. The current Spanish EU DCF at-sea sampling programme (which includes the sampling of bycatch of non-target protected species) and the Spanish (dedicated) cetacean bycatch monitoring programme provided similar results on cetacean bycatch for some of the ICES Divisions and Metiers monitored but sampling coverage of both is insufficient to obtain robust estimates.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"ICES Journal of Marine Science Current Issue","siteHash":"54f8cca1acc450a23f886e7003c55f387c2b0793320a665b1e27fbbf191461e5","entryHash":"8f221012068cf66a08220bb3865bfe1319420a8ccc94e81198785e69b628eaa9","category":"Environment"}
