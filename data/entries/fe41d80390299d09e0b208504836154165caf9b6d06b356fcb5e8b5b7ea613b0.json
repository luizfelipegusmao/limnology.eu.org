{"title":"The Metallothionein System in Tetrahymena Thermophila Is Iron Inducible","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1147/v1","date":1726482045000,"content":"Metallothioneins are multifunctional proteins implicated in various cellular processes. They have been used as biomarkers of heavy metal exposure and contamination due to their intrinsic ability to bind heavy metals and their transcriptional response to both physiological and noxious metal ions such as cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg). In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in the induction of the metallothionein system (Mtt) in the ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. We investigated the relative mRNA abundances of the metallothionein genes Mtt1, Mtt2/4, and Mtt5, revealing for the first time their responsiveness to iron exposure. Furthermore, by using inhibitors of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), alone or in combination with iron, we highlighted the roles of superoxide ion and endogenous hydrogen peroxide, as well as the complex interplay between the metal and ROSs. These results enhance our understanding of the metallothionein system in ciliates and suggest that ROSs may be a primary evolutionary driver for the selection of these proteins in nature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe41d80390299d09e0b208504836154165caf9b6d06b356fcb5e8b5b7ea613b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
