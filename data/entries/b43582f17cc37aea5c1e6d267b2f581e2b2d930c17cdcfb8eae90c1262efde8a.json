Many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) adopted global contact tracing and quarantine guidelines but were unable to contextualise the guidance into policies and practices that were relevant to their setting. Therefore, we examine contact tracing policies and practices in the Indo-Pacific region and the need to design context-specific policies. We conducted a mixed-methods study, including a cross-sectional online survey followed by key-informant interviews (KIIs). Using convenience snowball sampling, we invited public health professionals primarily involved in COVID-19 pandemic response from the Indo-Pacific region. We undertook descriptive analyses using counts and percentages for survey data and framework analysis for qualitative data. Seventy-seven public health professionals participated in the survey, of whom ten also participated in the KIIs. The study identified significant gaps between policies and the local contexts. Factors that broaden the gaps were limited knowledge of the changing dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, poor leadership, and coordination, little or no formal training on contact tracing, poor understanding of the guideline recommendations, limited resources, community resistance and mistrust, social stigmatisation and fear of being ostracised, and discrimination. This study revealed substantial disparities between policies and local contexts, significantly influencing policy implementation at national, provincial, and district levels across the studied countries. To bridge these gaps, we advocate for national contact tracing and quarantine guidelines explicitly addressing the quarantine needs of specific demographics, including children, pregnant women, prisoners, and individuals affected by social exclusion issues. Furthermore, we propose strengthening contact tracing training programs, urging revised guidelines to account for social, cultural, and infrastructural nuances influencing contact tracing and quarantine implementation. We also recommend engaging local NGOs, faith-based organisations, and local administrations to reinforce community connections and strengthen contact tracing.","author":"Md.
