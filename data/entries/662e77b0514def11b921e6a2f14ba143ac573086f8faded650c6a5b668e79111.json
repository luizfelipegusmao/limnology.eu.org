{"title":"Mycologists and Virologists Align: Proposing Botrytis cinerea for Global Mycovirus Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1370/v1","date":1724200134000,"content":"Mycoviruses are highly genetically diverse, can significantly change their fungal host’s phenotype, yet, they are generally under-described in genotypic and biological studies. We propose Botrytis cinerea as a model mycovirus system in which to develop a deeper understanding of mycovirus epidemiology including diversity, impact, and the associated cellular biology of the host and virus interaction. Over 100 mycoviruses have been described in this fungal host. B. cinerea is an ideal model fungus for mycovirology as it has highly tractable characteristics – it is easy to culture, has a worldwide distribution, infects a wide range of host plants, can be transformed and gene-edited, and has an existing depth of biological resources including annotated genomes, transcriptomes, and isolates with gene knockouts. Focus on a model system for mycoviruses will enable the research community to address deep research questions that cannot be answered in a non-systematic manner. Since B. cinerea is a major plant pathogen, new insights may have immediate utility as well as creating new knowledge that complements and extends the knowledge of mycovirus interactions in other fungi, alone or with their respective plant hosts. In this review we set out some of the critical steps required to develop B. cinerea as a model mycovirus system and how this may be used in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"662e77b0514def11b921e6a2f14ba143ac573086f8faded650c6a5b668e79111","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
