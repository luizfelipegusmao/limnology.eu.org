{"title":"Development and Evaluation of a Shrimp Virus (IHHNV)-Mediated System Used for Efficient Gene Transfer and Expression in Shrimps","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.2070/v1","date":1719613143000,"content":"Efficient gene transfer and expression tool is lacking for shrimps and shrimp cells. To solve this, this study has developed a shrimp DNA virus-mediated gene transfer and expression system, consisting of insect Sf9 cells for viral packaging, shrimp viral vector of pUC19-IHHNV-PH-GUS and baculoviral vector of Bacmid or Bacmid-VP28 encoding shrimp WSSV envelope protein VP28. The pUC19-IHHNV-PH-GUS vector was constructed by assembling the genomic DNA of shrimp infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), which had shortened inverted terminal repeats, into pUC19 backbone, and then an expression cassette of baculoviral polyhedron (PH) promoter-driven GUS reporter gene was inserted immediately downstream of IHHNV for proof-of-concept. It was found that the viral vector of pUC19-IHHNV-PH-GUS could be successfully packaged into IHHNV-like infective virions in the Sf9 cells, and gene transfer efficiency of this system had been evaluated and verified in three systems of Sf9 cells, shrimp hemolymph cells and tissues of infected shrimps, but GUS expression could be detected only in the cases when the viral vector was co-transfected or co-infected with a baculovirus of Bacmid or Bacmid-VP28 due to the Bacmid-dependence of PH promoter. Moreover, the packaging and infection efficiencies could be significantly improved when Bacmid-VP28 was used instead of Bacmid.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"803be4038638c64aad5905cd81aa880d68123a02506453f3aab49aa56b69063e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
