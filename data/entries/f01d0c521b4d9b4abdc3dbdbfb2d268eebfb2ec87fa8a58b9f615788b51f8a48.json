{"title":"Soil Mineral Nitrogen and Mobile Organic Carbon as Affected by Winter Wheat Strip Tillage and Forage Legume Intercropping","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0905/v1","date":1720693539000,"content":"Crop rotation diversification using legumes has been advocated as one of the solutions to improve the resilience of the crop system to various environmental stresses and the use of nitrogen resources. However, when forage legumes or grass-legumes are ploughed, there is a high risk of nitrate leaching, especially in sandy soils. The aim of the study was to determine the effect strip tillage intercropping management on soil mineral nitrogen (SMN), water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) content and winter wheat (WW, Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield compared to forage legume and WW monocropping with conventional tillage. In intercropping was used winter wheat - black medick (Medicago lupulina L.) WW+BM, winter wheat - white clover (Trifolium repens L.) WW+WC, and winter wheat - Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) WW+EC. Research was repeated in two experiments. The results showed that after strip tillage and WW sowing less or similar SMN content cud be detected, as in conventional tillage and WW + forage legumes intercropping. WW grain yield in intercrops decreased, compared to the grasses monocultures that were ploughed before WW sowing. The highest amount of WEOC was in intercropping soil growing WW+WC or in all fields (except WW+EC) after applying strip tillage. During the research period, the amounts of mobile humic substances (HSs) and mobile humic acids (HAs) changed analogously. Their content increased substantially in fields with WC and EC, regardless of whether the grasses were ploughed or grown with WW.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f01d0c521b4d9b4abdc3dbdbfb2d268eebfb2ec87fa8a58b9f615788b51f8a48","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
