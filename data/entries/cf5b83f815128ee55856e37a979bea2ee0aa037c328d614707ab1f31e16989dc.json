{"title":"Mach's Principle Versus Dark Matter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0449/v1","date":1722953210000,"content":"HIGHLIGHTS  Mach's principle is linked with inertia and the mass around. Nowadays, physicists believe its effect is infinitesimal, so Mach's principle is simply ignored. This paper looks at the consequence of applying Mach's principle. It could replace dark matter.   ABSTRACT  After seeing the history of Mach's principle, we will work out a new model of galaxies inspired by Machâ€™s principle, which is more satisfactory than current dark matter models. This new model is just maths and needs an explanation. One possible explanation is obviously that Mach's principle is at work in a galaxy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cf5b83f815128ee55856e37a979bea2ee0aa037c328d614707ab1f31e16989dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
