{"title":"Early Changes in Alpha-Fetoprotein and Des-&gamma;-Carboxy Prothrombin Are Useful Predictors of Antitumor Response to Durvalumab Plus Tremelimumab Therapy for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1981/v1","date":1719815858000,"content":"The relationship between antitumor response and tumor marker changes was evaluated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with durvalumab plus tremelimumab (Dur/Tre). Thirty-two patients were enrolled in this retrospective evaluation of treatment outcomes. According to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors at 8 weeks, the objective response rate (OR) was 25% and the disease control rate (DC) was 56.3%. Median alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ratio at 4 weeks was 0.310 in patients who achieved OR at 8 weeks (8W-OR group), significantly lower than the 1.105 in the non-8W-OR group (p=0.0020), but was 1.210 in patients who did not achieve DC at 8 weeks (non-8W-DC group), significantly higher than the 0.470 in the 8W-DC group (p=0.0006). Similarly, median des-Î³-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) ratio at 4 weeks was 0.125 in the 8W-OR group, significantly lower than the 1.225 in the non-8W-OR group (p=0.0001), but was 1.120 in the non-8W-DC group, significantly higher than the 0.480 in the 8W-DC group (p=0.0255). Early changes in tumor markers after Dur/Tre initiation were associated with antitumor response. In particular, changes in AFP and DCP at 4 weeks may offer useful biomarkers for early prediction of both response and progressive disease following Dur/Tre.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"be4b8e34e8631aed3dc8478df152199858ab49c660def9200abd39533fa090f0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
