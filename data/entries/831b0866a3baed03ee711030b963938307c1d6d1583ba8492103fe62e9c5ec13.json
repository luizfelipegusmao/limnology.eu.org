{"title":"Genetic factors of grain cadmium concentration in Polish wheat (Triticum polonicum L.)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/979/7698905?rss=1","date":1719273600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Wheat (<span>Triticum aestivum</span> L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide and a major source of human cadmium (Cd) intake. Limiting grain Cd concentration (Gr_Cd_Conc) in wheat is necessary to ensure food safety. However, the genetic factors associated with Cd uptake, translocation and distribution and Gr_Cd_Conc in wheat are poorly understood. Here, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Gr_Cd_Conc and its related transport pathway using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from 2 Polish wheat varieties (RIL_DT; dwarf Polish wheat [DPW] and tall Polish wheat [TPW]). We identified 29 novel major QTLs for grain and tissue Cd concentration; 14 novel major QTLs for Cd uptake, translocation, and distribution; and 27 major QTLs for agronomic traits. We also analyzed the pleiotropy of these QTLs. Six novel QTLs (<span>QGr_Cd_Conc-1A</span>, <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-3A</span>, <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-4B</span>, <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-5B</span>, <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-6A</span>, and <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-7A</span>) for Gr_Cd_Conc explained 8.16% to 17.02% of the phenotypic variation. <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-3A</span>, <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-6A</span>, and <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-7A</span> pleiotropically regulated Cd transport; 3 other QTLs were organ-specific for Gr_Cd_Conc. We fine-mapped the locus of <span>QGr_Cd_Conc-4B</span> and identified the candidate gene as <span>Cation/Ca exchanger 2</span> (<span>TpCCX2-4B</span>), which was differentially expressed in DPW and TPW. It encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane/plasma membrane–localized Cd efflux transporter in yeast. Overexpression of <span>TpCCX2-4B</span> reduced Gr_Cd_Conc in rice. The average Gr_Cd_Conc was significantly lower in <span>TpCCX2-4BDPW</span> genotypes than in <span>TpCCX2-4BTPW</span> genotypes of the RIL_DT population and 2 other natural populations, based on a Kompetitive allele-specific PCR marker derived from the different promoter sequences between <span>TpCCX2-4BDPW</span> and <span>TpCCX2-4BTPW</span>. Our study reveals the genetic mechanism of Cd accumulation in wheat and provides valuable resources for genetic improvement of low–Cd-accumulating wheat cultivars.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"831b0866a3baed03ee711030b963938307c1d6d1583ba8492103fe62e9c5ec13","category":"Environment"}
