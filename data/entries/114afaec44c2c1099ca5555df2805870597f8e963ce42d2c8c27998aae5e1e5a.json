{"title":"Public Perceptions on the Use of the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0306/v1","date":1715042857000,"content":"Self-administered pre-participation screening for physical activity (PA) requires an instrument that should be easily used and identify individuals at high risk. The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+) has been used for many years. Its ease of use and ability to identify those not fit to undergo PA has not been assessed. This study was to determine the rates of the PAR-Q+ in identifying adults who may not be fit for moderate or intense PA and obtain feedback on the use of this tool. A public on-line voluntary survey on the PAR-Q+ was carried out obtaining participantsâ€™ bio-characteristics, them completing the PAR-Q+ form and providing feedback. With 1019 participants, about 57.8% engaged in at least 150 minutes of PA weekly. This decreased with increasing number of co-morbidities. Increasing age was associated with more co-morbidities. About 33.1% of the participants using the PARQ+ would have required further medical evaluation. Only 3 of the 7 main PAR-Q+ questions were easily understood. Difficulties were encountered with 39 of the 44 follow-up questions, especially amongst those with co-morbidities. The large number of technical terms was also a source of concern. The PAR-Q+ would need extensive simplification before it may be recommended for use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"114afaec44c2c1099ca5555df2805870597f8e963ce42d2c8c27998aae5e1e5a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
