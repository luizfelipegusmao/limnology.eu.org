{"title":"Sydney Reporting System for Lymph Node Fine Needle Aspiration and Malignancy Risk Stratification, Is it of Clinical Value?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1878/v1","date":1722318156000,"content":"Lymphadenopathy is a common manifestation of both reactive and malignant diseases, and fine needle aspiration (FNA) is an effective and inexpensive screening method. It can prevent unnecessary invasive surgery and excisional biopsy, especially in benign cases. Unfortunately, the lack of universally accepted terminology for reporting results has hindered its widespread support. The Sydney system proposal for lymph node cytopathology categorization and reporting introduced five diagnostic categories to address the lack of universally accepted terminology for reporting results in lymphadenopathy.  Our study analyzed 188 lymph node FNC samples from King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Saudi Arabia, examining clinical follow-up data, pathology records, patient information, and final diagnosis from January 2019 to December 2022. Most specimens were from axillary LNs, with 99.5% tissue correlation. The Sydney System Category classification identified 56.9% of cases as malignant, while 26.1% were benign. The final surgical specimen diagnosis revealed a higher percentage of malignant diagnoses, with the highest ROM in malignant/Category V. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that LN-FNAC offers high diagnostic accuracy for LN aspirates, with the Sydney approach potentially aiding risk stratification and achieving consistency in cytologic diagnosis, but further multi-centric research is needed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"95343302f7a24fde1df3c8140082494125f4ab15a72c605cdb09fdf42457c5d9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
