This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology that presents a strategy to uncover viruses that are natural pathogens of laboratory zebrafish using meta-transcriptomics and co-housing experiments.","author":"Mollie Virgo","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"9ab68e29a0bb1061591392d93a4e23a4c33c754801bf4261be8f5108dd5963a5","category":"Environment"}
