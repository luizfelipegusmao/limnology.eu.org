{"title":"Extreme Tolerance of Extraocular Muscles to Diseases and Aging: Why and How?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1544/v1","date":1713888127000,"content":"The extraocular muscles (EOMs) possess unique characteristics that set them apart from other skeletal muscles. These muscles, responsible for eye movements, exhibit remarkable resistance to various muscular dystrophies and aging, presenting a significant contrast to the vulnerability of skeletal muscles to these conditions. In this review, we delve into the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the distinct properties of EOMs. We explore their structural complexity, highlighting differences in fiber types, innervation patterns, and developmental origins. Notably, EOM fibers express a diverse array of myosin heavy chain isoforms, retaining embryonic forms into adulthood. Moreover, their motor innervation is characterized by a high ratio of nerve fibers to muscle fibers and the presence of unique neuromuscular junctions. These features contribute to the specialized functions of EOMs, including rapid and precise eye movements. Understanding the mechanisms behind the resilience of EOMs to disease and aging may offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies for treating muscular dystrophies and myopathies affecting other skeletal muscles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"01fbf32b8f544eeb86a10b8c46980a4e13aafa73a1aae2ac166d9f0cfc8fba9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
