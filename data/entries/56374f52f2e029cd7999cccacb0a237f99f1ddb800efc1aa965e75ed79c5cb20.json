{"title":"Refermentation with yeast and lactic acid bacteria isolates: a strategy to improve the flavor of green coffee beans","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13735?af=R","date":1721038421000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Yeast and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important part in the post-harvest fermentation of coffee. This study applied lab-scale fermentation to commercial green coffee beans using dry coffee pulp as the substrate, with the aim of modifying coffee-bean flavor. In addition to spontaneous fermentation, yeast and LAB isolated from coffee beans and dried coffee pulp were added during fermentation.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Co-inoculation of yeast and LAB showed a significant effect on the chlorogenic acid content after between 24 and 72 h of fermentation. Acetic, citric, malic, lactic, and quinic acids were shown to be affected significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) by fermentation and inoculation. Gas chromatography detected that esters, alcohols, aldehydes, furans, and pyrazines were the primary compounds in the coffee beans. Certain volatile groups were present in greater concentrations and broader varieties within the inoculated beans. The highest cupping scores were given to beans that had been co-inoculated with yeast and LAB.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall, the use of yeasts and LAB starters showed potential to create coffee beverages with desirable characteristics by standardized fermentation. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Na Zhao, \nMito Kokawa, \nTaroh Suzuki, \nAmini Rasool Khan, \nWeixue Dong, \nMinh‐Quan Nguyen, \nYutaka Kitamura","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"56374f52f2e029cd7999cccacb0a237f99f1ddb800efc1aa965e75ed79c5cb20","category":"Environment"}
