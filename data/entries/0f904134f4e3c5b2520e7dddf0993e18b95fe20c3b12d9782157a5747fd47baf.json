{"title":"A Robust Controller Based on Extension Sliding Mode Theory for BLDC Motor Drives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0661/v1","date":1718087580000,"content":"This paper presents the design of a robust speed controller for brushless DC motors (BLDCM) under field-oriented control (FOC). The proposed robust controller integrates extension theory (ET) and sliding mode theory (SMT) to achieve robustness. First, the speed difference between the speed command and the actual speed of the BLDCM, along with the rate of change of the speed difference, are divided into 20 interval categories. Then, the feedback speed difference and the rate of change of the speed difference are calculated for their extension correlation with each of the 20 interval categories. The interval category with the highest correlation is used to determine the appropriate control gain for the sliding mode speed controller. This gain adjustment tunes the parameters of the sliding surface in the SMT, thereby suppressing the overshoot of the motor speed. Because the sliding surface reaching law of the sliding mode controller (SMC) adopts the exponential approach law, the system's speed response can quickly follow the speed command in any state and exhibit excellent load regulation response. The simplicity of this robust control method, which requires minimal training data, facilitates easy implementation. Finally, the speed control of the BLDCM is simulated using Matlab/Simulink software, and the results are compared with those of the SMC using the constant speed approach law. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust controller exhibits superior speed command tracking and load regulation response compared to the traditional SMC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0f904134f4e3c5b2520e7dddf0993e18b95fe20c3b12d9782157a5747fd47baf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
