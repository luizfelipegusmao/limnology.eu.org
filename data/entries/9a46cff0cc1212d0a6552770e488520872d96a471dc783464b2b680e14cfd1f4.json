{"title":"Implication of Exclusive Breastfeeding in Early Childhood Dental Disorders: Large Cohort Evidence, US National Survey of Children Health","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2263/v1","date":1727762241000,"content":"Purpose/Objective: Frequent consumption of fermented carbohydrates and bottle feeding contribute to the development of early childhood caries (ECC). There are no substantial findings on  the effects of breastfeeding patterns on oral health conditions in children in the United States.  We aimed to assess the nexus between exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months and  oral health disorders, namely toothache, decayed teeth, or unfilled cavities in early childhood. \nMaterials and Methods: Design: Cross-sectional epidemiologic design of nationally representative data collected via telephone surveys in the United States was utilized. Setting: National Survey of Childrenâ€™s Health, 2012 Participants: Population-based random sample of parents/guardians of 24,655 children aged 6 months to 5 years. Main Outcome and Measure: Parent-reported oral health condition including toothache, decayed teeth or unfilled cavity in the past 12 months.\nResults: A total of 2,392 (9.7%) children aged 6 months to 5 years experienced an oral health disorder, mainly toothache, decayed teeth, or unfilled cavity in the previous 12 months. Relative to non-Hispanic White children (7.7%), a greater proportion of non-Hispanic Black (12.9%) and multi-racial children (12.6%) experienced oral health disorders (OHD). In the univariable model, relative to children who  never breastfed, those who were breastfed exclusively for 6 months were 28% less likely to present with OHD, Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.52-0.98. After adjustment, the protective nature of exclusive breastfeeding against OHD did not remain, adjusted OR (aOR) =1.11, 99% CI 0.79-1.57. Children of mothers with fair/poor health were almost twice as  likely to have poor OHD compared with children of mothers with excellent/very good health (aOR = 1.79, 99% CI 1.08-2.69). \nConclusions and Relevance: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life improved pediatric OHD and remains mutually beneficial for mothers and children. These findings suggest the importance of exclusive breastfeeding and  maternal health in relation to dental hygiene in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a46cff0cc1212d0a6552770e488520872d96a471dc783464b2b680e14cfd1f4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
