{"title":"Data Privacy Challenges in Health Informatics: A Comparative Study of Database Management Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1792/v1","date":1729732349000,"content":"Data privacy is a critical concern in health informatics, where the management of sensitive patient information requires robust and secure database systems. This study aims to explore the data privacy challenges faced in health informatics and conduct a comparative analysis of popular Database Management Systems (DBMS), including MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, with a focus on their effectiveness in safeguarding patient data. Through a review of existing literature, case studies, and interviews with database administrators, the research identifies common privacy threats such as data breaches and unauthorized access. It examines the security features of each DBMS, such as encryption methods, access controls, and user authentication mechanisms. The findings reveal variations in the privacy protection capabilities of different DBMS, highlighting the trade-offs between security, performance, and usability. The study provides recommendations for healthcare organizations in selecting a DBMS that balances privacy with operational needs and offers insights for policymakers to improve regulatory frameworks in health data security. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on enhancing data privacy in health informatics and suggests directions for future studies to integrate emerging technologies for more secure health data management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0d1988e541978cc65ea38b4340b0fad9576df578f921f9a82d3e7ee1a872a11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
