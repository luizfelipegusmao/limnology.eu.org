{"title":"ALKBH8 contributes to neurological function through oxidative stress regulation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae115/7633534?rss=1","date":1711584000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Transfer RNA (tRNA) modification is essential for proper protein translation, as these modifications play important roles in several biological functions and disease pathophysiologies. AlkB homolog 8 (ALKBH8) is one of the nine mammalian ALKBH family molecules known to regulate selenoprotein translation through the modification of the wobble uridine (U34) in tRNA; however, its specific biological roles remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of ALKBH8 using <span>Alkbh8</span>-knockout (<span>Albkh8</span><sup>−/−</sup>) mice, which were observed to have reduced 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) and (S)-5-methoxycarbonylhydroxymethyluridine levels; notably, the mcm5U level was partially compensated only in the brain. The results of the novel object recognition test showed reduction in time to explore a novel object in <span>Albkh8</span><sup>−/−</sup> mice; increased latency to fall in the rotarod performance test and latency to the immobility period in the forced swim test were also observed. These abnormal behaviors indicate dysfunction of the central nervous system. Furthermore, we observed reduced brain weight and ischemic pathological changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in the form of weak eosin staining in the fiber tracts adjacent to the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 region and an increase in pyramidal cells in the temporal lobe. Concordantly, we identified the differential expression of oxidative stress-related proteins and metabolites in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus using omics analyses. Finally, neurons and glial cells derived from <span>Albkh8</span><sup>−/−</sup> mice show reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Collectively, these findings indicate that ALKBH8 maintains neural function through an oxidative stress-regulatory mechanism.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"0bdfb555c8feda138ed50f82159d01e9999ee554e8313a1eaba3df8c602a2ae9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
