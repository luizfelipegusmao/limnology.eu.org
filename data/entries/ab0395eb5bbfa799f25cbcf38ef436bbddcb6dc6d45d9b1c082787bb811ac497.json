{"title":"Deep Learning for Early Disease Detection: A CNN Approach to Classify Potato, Tomato, and Pepper Leaf Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0986/v1","date":1718346172000,"content":"Early disease detection is crucial for maximizingcrop yields and minimizing financial losses in agriculture. Inorder to categorise leaf diseases in pepper, tomato, and potato plants, this study suggests a revolutionary CNN design. The algorithm collects disease-specific features from input photos by using data augmentation techniques to artificially enlarge the training dataset. ReLU-activated convolutional layers gradually capture features at different levels, from low to high, while max pooling layers minimise spatial dimensionality. After thecharacteristics are extracted, a fully-connected layers with a softmax activation function classify them into illness groups. A well chosen dataset containing labelled healthy and sick leaves is used to train and validate the model. Generalizability to untesteddata is ensured via performance evaluation on an independent testing set. The field of deep learning for agricultural applications benefits from this research. This strategy has the ability to rev- olutionise agricultural practices by enabling automated disease identification. This might result in early interventions, better crop health, and eventually sustainable agricultural production.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab0395eb5bbfa799f25cbcf38ef436bbddcb6dc6d45d9b1c082787bb811ac497","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
