{"title":"Exploring Boscia senegalensis-Derived Boscisucrophage: A Novel Dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 Inhibitor Enhancing Glycemic Control in Oral Drug-Resistant Type 2 Diabetes Patients: Insights from a Preliminary Observational Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1121/v1","date":1723696086000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Boscia senegalensis (BS) Pers.) Lam. Ex Poir (Capparaceae), is an important local famine food plant in Africa and widely exploited by healers for its seeds in Sahelian region to reduce hyperglycaemia. Purpose: We studied the efficacy of commercial dosage form of BS namely Boscisucrophage (BSP) on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients with Oral antihyperglycemic drugs resistant. Study Design: Clinical benefits of BSP, were evaluated in multicentre cohort observational study on na√Øve patients (43) or diabetic patients resistant of oral antidiabetic drugs (289). All patients received capsules of the fixed dose containing 350 mg of BSP twice daily for 12 weeks and overactive control on vein blood sugar, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), urine glucose excretion (UGE), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and clinical examination of functional symptoms. Results: In clinical study, BSP induced the reduction of glycaemia, HbA1c, and increase UGE, with removal of side effects functional symptoms of T2DM. Conclusions: In clinical studies, our findings lend support to use of BSP to reduce glycaemia, and HbA1c in T2DM patients with Oral antihyperglycemic drugs resistant without over adverse effects. BSP supressed clinical examination of functional symptoms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5944c3256cf7685bb156db5a78da363283f9dd38d644323091b4f44274e82d24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
