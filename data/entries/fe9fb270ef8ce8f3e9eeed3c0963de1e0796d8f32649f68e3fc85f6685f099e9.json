{"title":"Assessment of the Biogenic Souring in Oil Reservoirs Under Secondary and Tertiary Oil Recovery","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1869/v1","date":1714379662000,"content":"The formation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in petroleum reservoirs by anaerobic microbial activity is called biogenic souring of reservoirs and is a risk in the oil and gas industry as the compound is extremely toxic, flammable and corrosive. In this paper, we present a workflow and the tools to assess biogenic souring from a pragmatic engineering perspective. The retention of H2S in the reservoir due to the reactions with iron-bearing rock minerals (e.g. siderite) is shown in a theoretical approach here and supported with literature data. Cases are given for two fields under secondary (waterflooding) and tertiary flooding with microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR). The use of the Monte Carlo method as a numerical modelling tool to incorporate uncertainties in the measured physical/chemical/ biochemical data is demonstrated as well. A list of studies conducted with different chemicals alone or in combination with various biocides to mitigate biogenic souring provides an overview of potential inhibitors as well as possible applications. Furthermore, the results of static and dynamic inhibition tests using molybdate are presented in more detail due to its promising mitigation ability. Finally, a three-step workflow for the risk assessment of biogenic souring and its possible mitigation is presented and discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe9fb270ef8ce8f3e9eeed3c0963de1e0796d8f32649f68e3fc85f6685f099e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
