{"title":"Robust Optimality and Duality for Nonsmooth Multiobjective Programming Problems with Vanishing Constraints under Data Uncertainty","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0582/v1","date":1725865413000,"content":"This article investigates robust optimality and duality for a class of nonsmooth multiobjective programming problems with vanishing constraints under data uncertainty (in short, UNMPVC) via convexificators. Using the properties of convexificators, we introduce generalized standard Abadie constraint qualification (in short, GS-ACQ) for the considered problem UNMPVC. Moreover, we introduce generalized robust version of nonsmooth stationary conditions, namely, weakly stationary point (in short, RW-Stationary), T-stationary point (in short, RT-Stationary), M-stationary point (in short, RM-Stationary) and S-stationary point (in short, RS-Stationary) for UNMPVC. By employing GS-ACQ, we establish that the RS-Stationary is the necessary first-order optimality condition for a local Pareto solution of UNMPVC. Moreover, under generalized convexity assumptions, we establish sufficient optimality criteria for UNMPVC. Furthermore, we formulate the Wolfe-type (in short, WRD) and Mond-Weir-type (in short, MWRD) robust dual models corresponding to the primal problem UNMPVC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"90560d89402351573fe81299491b8b7395e1893dc9852938f38f4acc25bae97d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
