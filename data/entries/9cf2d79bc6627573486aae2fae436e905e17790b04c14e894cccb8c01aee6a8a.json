{"title":"Optical Calibration of the Multi-Color Ellipsometric Mapping Tool from Cheap Parts","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0161/v1","date":1727864352000,"content":"We developed and applied a new calibration method to make the measurement more accurate with our multi-color ellipsometric mapping tool from cheap parts. Ellipsometry is an optical technique that measures the relative change in polarization state of the measurement beam induced by reflection from or transmission though a sample. During the conventional ellipsometric measurement, the data collection is relatively slower and measures one spot at a time, so mapping needs long time compared with our new optical mapping equipment made by an ordinary color LED monitor and a polarization sensitive camera. The angle-of-incidence and the incident polarization state is varied point-by-point so a special optical calibration method is needed. Three SiO2 samples with different thicknesses were used to determine point-by-point the angle-of-incidence and rho corrections. After the calibration, another SiO2 sample was measured and analyzed using the calibrated corrections and this sample further was independently measured using a conventional spectroscopic ellipsometer. The difference between the two measured thickness maps is less than 1 nm. Our optical mapping tool from cheap parts is faster and covers wider area samples in relative to the conventional ellipsometers and these correction enhancements further signify its performance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9cf2d79bc6627573486aae2fae436e905e17790b04c14e894cccb8c01aee6a8a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
