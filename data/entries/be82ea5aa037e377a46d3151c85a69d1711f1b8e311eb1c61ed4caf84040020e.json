Encouraging optical parameters were obtained with <i>α</i>\n<sub>s</sub> &gt; 80% and <i>ε</i>\n<sub>th</sub> (600 <i>°</i>C) below 20%, stable after more than 2000 h in air at <i>T</i> = 600°C.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>An attractive candidate to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and replace them by renewable sources is represented by concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, whose wide deployment is still hindered by its high investment costs. In CSP linear collector plants, a key component with high technological content may be identified in receiver tubes, that are traversed by heat transfer fluid and located on focal line on which solar radiation is concentrated by mirrors. The proposed work aims at developing spectrally selective coatings for receiver tubes able to overcome state-of-the-art technological limitation in terms of both vacuum encapsulation and maximum operative temperature, currently limited at 550°C for molten salts CSP plants. To this aim, a multilayer structure was designed and developed for coating a receiver tube to be employed in open-air environment at temperature of 600°C. The multilayer coating is based on tungsten chromium titanium infrared reflector and includes a solar absorber layer developed with two alternative methods of reactive sputtering and thermal oxidation respectively, finally covered by antireflective and barrier bi-layer of aluminum oxide and silica. Thermal stability was demonstrated of the new developed coatings, since only small variations were measured of the optical parameters after more than 2000 h of aging in open air conditions at temperature of 600°C (on average less than 5%), with final measured solar absorptance <i>α</i>\n<sub>s</sub> of 73% and 87% and thermal emissivity <i>ε</i>\n<sub>th</sub> at 600°C of 18% and 27% for aged multilayer structures including the absorber layer obtained through thermal oxidation and sputtering process, respectively. These results pave the way for further improvement in terms of both optical performance and operative temperature increase, allowing to enhance efficiency and lower costs, thus contributing to ease to deployment of CSP technology.</p>","author":"Gabriella Rossi, \nAntonio D'Angelo, \nClaudia Diletto, \nSalvatore Esposito, \nAntonio Guglielmo, \nMichela Lanchi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"be82ea5aa037e377a46d3151c85a69d1711f1b8e311eb1c61ed4caf84040020e","category":"Environment"}
