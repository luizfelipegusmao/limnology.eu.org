A cross-sectional style was employed where 331 medical students were evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) supplemented with demographic and lifestyle questions. Data analysis allowed identification of LBP-risk factor relationships. The study revealed a 73.4% prevalence of LBP among Alfaisal University medical students with a 4.61 average severity. Female students, those who spent long hours on computers, and those who did not exercise were more likely to experience LBP. Higher disability degree was associated with participants aged &amp;gt;21, used their devices for extended periods, and insufficient sleep. LBP is highly prevalent with several risk factors existing. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions such as ergonomic/lifestyle improvements and reduced device use.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67f6fd344f94be86309b6e2714c71ea9ea62081d9795160d06b4cb53c2453ef2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
