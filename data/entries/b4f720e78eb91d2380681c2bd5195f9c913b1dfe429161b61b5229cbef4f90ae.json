{"title":"Regulating neuronal excitability: The role of S-palmitoylation in NaV1.7 activity and voltage sensitivity","link":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae222/7687560?rss=1","date":1717459200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>S</span>-palmitoylation, a reversible lipid post-translational modification, regulates the functions of numerous proteins. Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>s), pivotal in action potential generation and propagation within cardiac cells and sensory neurons, can be directly or indirectly modulated by <span>S</span>-palmitoylation, impacting channel trafficking and function. However, the role of <span>S</span>-palmitoylation in modulating Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, a significant contributor to pain pathophysiology, has remained unexplored. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by investigating if <span>S</span>-palmitoylation influences Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channel function. Acyl-biotin exchange assays demonstrated that heterologously expressed Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels are modified by <span>S</span>-palmitoylation. Blocking <span>S</span>-palmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitate resulted in reduced Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current density and hyperpolarized steady-state inactivation. We identified two <span>S</span>-palmitoylation sites within Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, both located in the second intracellular loop, which regulated different properties of the channel. Specifically, <span>S</span>-palmitoylation of cysteine 1126 enhanced Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 current density, while <span>S</span>-palmitoylation of cysteine 1152 modulated voltage-dependent inactivation. Blocking <span>S</span>-palmitoylation altered excitability of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. Lastly, in human sensory neurons, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 undergoes <span>S</span>-palmitoylation, and the attenuation of this post-translational modification results in alterations in the voltage-dependence of activation, leading to decreased neuronal excitability. Our data show, for the first time, that <span>S</span>-palmitoylation affects Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels, exerting regulatory control over their activity and, consequently, impacting rodent and human sensory neuron excitability. These findings provide a foundation for future pharmacological studies, potentially uncovering novel therapeutic avenues in the modulation of <span>S</span>-palmitoylation for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"b4f720e78eb91d2380681c2bd5195f9c913b1dfe429161b61b5229cbef4f90ae","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
