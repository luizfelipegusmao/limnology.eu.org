{"title":"Pre and Postmenopausal Females Have Different Inflammatory Cytokine and BDNF Responses to High-Intensity Interval Training Exercise","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1997/v1","date":1714469013000,"content":"The responses of inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session were compared between 7 postmenopausal (57±2 y) and 8 premenopausal females (44±3 y) during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone are highest, and. HIIT consisted of 10 x 1 min running intervals (90% maximum heart rate) separated by 1 min recovery intervals. Blood samples were collected at baseline (fasted), pre-exercise (postprandial), and 0, 30 and 90 min post-HIIT and analyzed for interleukin (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and BDNF. IL-6 significantly increased from pre-exercise to 0 min post-HIIT in postmenopausal (+40%, p=0.01) but 30 min post-HIIT in premenopausal females (+60%, p=0.02). IL-6 remained elevated at 90 min post-HIIT in premenopausal (+104%, p=0.05) and to a higher degree in postmenopausal (+385%, p&amp;lt;0.001). IL-10 showed no response. TNF-α increased from pre- to 0 min post-HIIT (+10%, p=0.05), then decreased to below pre-exercise at 30 min (-10%, p=0.02) and 90 min (-5%, p=0.04) in both groups. BDNF increased immediate post-HIIT in premenopausal (+60%, p&amp;lt;0.001) but not postmenopausal females. The differences in IL-6 and BDNF response to HIIT between pre and postmenopausal females provide evidence of the role of female reproductive hormones in the regulation of these exercise-induced responses.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"46496ea0ec3af414e37ce37bb9803b410ace155eac5d70d41415c4d4a7224277","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
