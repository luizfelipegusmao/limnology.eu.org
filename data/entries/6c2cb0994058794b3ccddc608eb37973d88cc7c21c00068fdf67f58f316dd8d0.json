{"title":"Determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among adolescents and youths aged 10-35 years in sub-Saharan African countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310827","date":1728309600000,"content":"<p>by Allan Mayaba Mwiinde, Patrick Kaonga, Choolwe Jacobs, Joseph Mumba Zulu, Isaac Fwemba</p>\r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health systems, especially in sub-Saharan African countries. Vaccination is one of the easily accessible interventions that can help reduce the burden on the health system. However, vaccination coverage remains low in sub-Saharan African countries. The determinants of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among adolescents and youths remain unknown. Therefore, this study explored the pooled prevalence and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among adolescents and youths in sub-Saharan African Countries. A systematic literature search of Scopus, PubMed Central, PubMed, Embase, African Journal Online, Research 4 Life, Embase, and Google Scholar was performed from 6<sup>th</sup> May to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2023, using developed keywords with a focus on sub-Saharan African countries. Twenty-three (N = 23) studies were finally selected for analysis. The pooled prevalence of vaccine acceptance among adolescents and youths was 38.7% (n = 23). The subgroup analysis of the pooled prevalence of acceptance among adolescents was 36.1% (n = 36.1) while youths were 42% (n = 10). At the region level, West Africa had 42.2% (n = 13), East Africa had 39.8% (n = 6), Central Africa had 33% (n = 1), and Southern Africa had 24.2% (n = 3). The determinants of vaccine acceptance were the desire for self-immunity (AOR = 1.97, 95%, CI, 1.083.47, I<sup>2</sup> = 94.15%, p &lt; 0.05), receiving Health Officersâ€™ information (AOR = 4.36, 95%, CI, 2.28-8.32, I<sup>2</sup> = 97.74, p &lt; 0.001), the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 2.14, 95%, CI, 1.14-4.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 97.4%, p &lt; 0.05). The odds of having an unconfirmed source of information (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI, 0.10-0.45, I<sup>2</sup> = 94.09%, p&lt; 0.001) was responsible for vaccine hesitancy. The findings indicate the low pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and high levels of hesitancy among adolescents and youths in sub-Saharan African countries. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that extensive research is undertaken into age-appropriate health promotion messages and strategies to encourage the uptake of vaccines.
