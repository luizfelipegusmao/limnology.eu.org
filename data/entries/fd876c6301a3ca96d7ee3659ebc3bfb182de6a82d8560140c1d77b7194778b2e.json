These technologies include high-resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC) via scanning electron microscopy, automated nano-indentation, high-throughput mechanical testing of small specimens, and high-speed atomic force microscopy. They provide a detailed observation of deformation processes and can capture the complex microstructural effects of metallic materials by examining large surface or volume areas. These tools are crucial for understanding the variability in microstructure at different scales and how it influences deformation and the overall mechanical properties of materials.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"fd876c6301a3ca96d7ee3659ebc3bfb182de6a82d8560140c1d77b7194778b2e","category":"Environment"}
