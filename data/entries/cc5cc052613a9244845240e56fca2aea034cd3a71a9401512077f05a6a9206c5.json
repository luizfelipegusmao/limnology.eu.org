{"title":"Translational Proofs on Bee Pollen as a Source of Biopharmaceuticals for Neurodegeneration and Cancer Research: A Scoping Review and Prospective Reflections","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2096/v1","date":1727337397000,"content":"Bee Pollen (BP) has many advantageous properties relying on its multitargeting potential, a new tendency in handling many challenging illnesses. In cancer and neurodegeneration, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antimutagenic effects of BP could be of unequaled importance and need further pharmacological and clinical investigation. Although being still limited, available data interestingly spotlights some floral sources with new and promising activities in-line with this investigation. In addition, we have identified many crucial bioactivities that are widely recognized to individual BP compounds but remain completely untapped in this valuable bee cocktail. A wide range of these compounds have been recently found to be endowed with great potential in modulating pivotal process in neurodegeneration and cancer pathophysiology, such as epigenetic regulation, microbiota composition and function, autophagy, cell death mechanisms, protein misfolding and aggregation and many other effects that we will detail in our current work. In addition, some widely present compounds in BP have only recently been isolated, while the number of studied BPs remain extremely limited compared to the endless pool of plant species that are distributed worldwide. Nevertheless, we have concomitantly elucidated that clinical profits from these promising perspectives are still impeded by some challenging hurdles such as limited bioavailability of the studied phytocompounds, diversity and lack of phytochemical standardization of BP, and the difficulty of selective targeting in some pathophysiological mechanisms. We finally present some interesting insights to guide future research and pave the way for urgent and simplified clinical investigations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cc5cc052613a9244845240e56fca2aea034cd3a71a9401512077f05a6a9206c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
