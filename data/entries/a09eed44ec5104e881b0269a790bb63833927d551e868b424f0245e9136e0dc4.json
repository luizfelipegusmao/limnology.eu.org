{"title":"Additive Manufacturing in Medical Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2588/v1","date":1722591869000,"content":"Additive Manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, has revolutionized various industries, including the medical field. This technology enables the creation of complex structures layer by layer, offering unprecedented customization and precision. In medical applications, AM has proven transformative in producing patient-specific implants, prosthetics, and anatomical models, facilitating better surgical planning and outcomes. Additionally, it has shown promise in bioprinting, where cells and biomaterials are used to create tissue-like structures for regenerative medicine. The ability to rapidly prototype and manufacture medical devices reduces time and costs, and enhances personalized patient care. This abstract explores the diverse applications, benefits, and challenges of AM in the medical sector, highlighting its potential to revolutionize healthcare and improve patient outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a09eed44ec5104e881b0269a790bb63833927d551e868b424f0245e9136e0dc4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
