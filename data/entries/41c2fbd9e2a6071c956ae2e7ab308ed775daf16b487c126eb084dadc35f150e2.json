{"title":"Sampling design methods for making improved lake management decisions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2842?af=R","date":1707459307000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The ecological status of lakes is important for understanding an ecosystem's biodiversity as well as for service water quality and policies related to land use and agricultural run-off. If the status is weak, then decisions about management alternatives need to be made. We assess the value of information of lake monitoring in Finland, where lakes are abundant. With reasonable ecological values and restoration costs, the value of information analysis can be compared with the survey's costs. Data are worth gathering if the expected value from the data exceeds the costs. From existing data, we specify a hierarchical Bayesian spatial logistic regression model for the ecological status of lakes. We then rely on functional approximations and Laplace approximations to get closed-form expressions for the value of information of a sampling design. The case study contains thousands of lakes. The combinatorially difficult design problem is to wisely pick the right subset of lakes for data gathering. To solve this optimization problem, we study the performance of various heuristics: greedy forward algorithms, exchange algorithms and Bayesian optimization approaches. The value of information increases quickly when adding lakes to a small design but then flattens out. Good designs are usually composed of lakes that are difficult to manage, while also balancing a variety of covariates and geographic coverage. The designs achieved by forward selection are reasonably good, but we can outperform them with the more nuanced search algorithms. Statistical designs clearly outperform other designs selected according to simpler criteria.</p>","author":"Vilja Koski, \nJo Eidsvik","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmetrics: Table of Contents","siteHash":"4718a208dff669d8713b9a4772fb9e30bd4e6b10bc59ba738841df9ffc8f1e42","entryHash":"41c2fbd9e2a6071c956ae2e7ab308ed775daf16b487c126eb084dadc35f150e2","category":"Environment"}
