{"title":"Recycled Carbon Black/Hdpe Composite from Waste Tires: Manufacturing, Testing and Aging Characterization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1560/v1","date":1724243189000,"content":"This study addresses the global issue of recycling used vehicle rubbish tires, typically burned out or trimmed to be reused in playground floors or road banks. In this study we explore a novel environmentally responsive approach or decomposing and recovering the carbon black particles contained in tires (25-30 wt.%) by vacuum pyrolysis. Given that carbon black is well known for its UV protection in plastics, the objective of this research is to provide an ecological alternative to commercial carbon black of fossil origin by recycling the carbon black (rCB) from used tires. In our research, we create a composite material using rCB and high density polyethylene (HDPE). In this article we present the environmental aging studies carried out to this composite material. The topographic evolution of the samples with aging and the oxidation kinetic of the surface and through the thickness were studied. A Beer-Lambert law is used to relate the oxidative index to the characteristic depth of the samples. This work helps to demonstrate the feasibility of using recycled carbon black particles from waste tires as a filler for UV protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"072753bc2444fe1db24ffd82276d2dd2e33c80a75d80e8f8246ba49b3085b6a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
