{"title":"Advances in Brain Stimulation and Nanomedicine: Dopaminergic Alterations and Its Role in Neurodegeneration and Drug Addiction","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0196/v1","date":1719911246000,"content":"Recent advancements in brain stimulation and nanomedicine have ushered in a new era of therapeutic interventions for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. This review explores the cutting-edge innovations in brain stimulation techniques, including their applications in alleviating symptoms of main neurodegenerative disorders and addiction. Emphasis is placed on the underlying main neurotransmitter modifications and their specific brain area location, particularly focusing on the dopaminergic system, which plays a critical role in these conditions. Furthermore, the review delves into the groundbreaking developments in nanomedicine, highlighting how nanotechnology can be utilized to target aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, with a specific focus on the dopaminergic system. The discussion extends to emerging technologies such as magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs), which represent a novel intersection between nanoformulation and brain stimulation approaches. These innovative technologies offer promising avenues for enhancing the precision and effectiveness of treatments by enabling non-invasive, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents as well as on site, on-demand stimulation. By integrating insights from recent research and technological advances, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how brain stimulation and nanomedicine can be synergistically applied to address complex neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, paving the way for future therapeutic strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f14cc7eaf24a23e2e2ee6af0518693807aa61c5702fa012f12ca927bf3b17ce8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
