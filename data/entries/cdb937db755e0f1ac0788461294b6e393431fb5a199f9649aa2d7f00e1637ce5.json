An ACT &gt;400 s was observed in 3.7% (124/3364) of patients. The pre-ablation ACT measured by the EM method was 143 ± 28 s. Cardiac tamponade was observed in 4/2085 ablations (0.19%) over 5 years. The ACT associated with cardiac tamponade ranged from 330 to 391 in the EM system. The regression equation was ACT-EM system = 1.19 × ACT-PO system + 9.03 (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cdb937db755e0f1ac0788461294b6e393431fb5a199f9649aa2d7f00e1637ce5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
