A total of 153 unsexed broiler birds containing 51 of Marshall, Arbor Acre and Cobb strains each were used for the experiment. The birds were reared under the same condition for 8 wk. Blood samples, collected from the jugular veins, were used to determine hematological parameters including Hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), neutrophils (NEUT), lymphocyte (LYMP) monocytes (MON) and eosinophils (EOS). However, the serum biochemical indices include the total protein (PRO), serum glucose (GLU), serum albumin (ALB), uric acid (URIC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Serum Cholesterol (CHOL) and creatinine. Statistical analysis revealed that Hb, WBC, EOS, MCHC and Serum cholesterol were significantly influenced by strains and sex while PCV, RBC, NEUT, LYMP, PRO, GLU, ALP and uric were significantly affected by sex of broiler chicken (Table 1-4).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"3e3548f664344bbef65f977243de2851505df8f959cb58cd4553e14b0d8d697d","category":"Environment"}
