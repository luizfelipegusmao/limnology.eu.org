{"title":"The Effects of Working Capital Management on the Financial Performance of Commercial and Services Firms Listed at Nairobi Securities Exchange in Kenya","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0959/v1","date":1718285804000,"content":"Working capital management (WCM) is critical because it affects a company's profitability, liquidity, and investment decisions, all of which have an impact on financial performance. As a result, effective and efficient working capital management is an essential component for commercial and service businesses. Given the importance of the commercial and services industries to the Kenyan economy, the goal of this research was to look into the impact of working capital management on the financial performance of these firms, particularly those listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), from 2003 to 2022. Working capital management was measured using the average age of inventory, average collection period, average payment period, and cash conversion cycle, whereas financial performance was measured using return on asset, return on equity, and net operating profit margin. Using panel regression analysis, the results showed that the average inventory age, average collection period, average payment period, and cash conversion cycle were all negatively related to financial performance for NSE-listed commercial and services firms. Based on the findings, it is recommended that Kenyan commercial and services firms adopt prudent optimal working capital management practices in order to improve firm financial performance and maximize shareholder wealth.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f2e2494fc199563838180c5c2f89bd15aef953ebe27509f4a1bbbaca0095d9f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
