{"title":"Study and Structural and Tribological Analysis of the Brake Disc-Pads Pair Material","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0674/v1","date":1710226905000,"content":"The study of the tribological behavior of the braking system in auto vehicles requires knowing the characteristics of the material in contact and, in the work process, for the friction pair, brake disc-pads. Materials structural analysis is necessary because the wear process depends on the friction pair chemical composition, and brake disk-pads, respectively on the work process parameters (pressing force, rotational speed, traffic conditions, etc.). The material of the brake discs is generally the same gray cast iron, but the brake pads can be semi-metallic (particles of steel, copper, brass, and graphite, all united with a special resin), organic materials (particles of rubber, glass, and kevlar all joined with the help of a resin), composite materials that contain different constituents and ceramic materials (rarely have small copper particles). Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to know the crystalline structure and the mechanical properties of the brake pad materials, through specific studies and analyses, with important implications on the friction and wear behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5910a0eb971f8a2cf5b72fdb9c887134463d9185ec878dbf07b2dbf4cdbdde11","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
