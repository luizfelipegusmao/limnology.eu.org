{"title":"Safety and Attractiveness of Whole-Body Electromyostimulation in Non-athletic Cohorts. A Scoping Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1540/v1","date":1718973911000,"content":"Whole body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) is frequently presented as a safe and attractive training technology, however evidence for this description is vague. Thus, the present study aimed to provide an overview of different aspects related to safety and attractiveness of WB-EMS in non-athletic cohorts. A systematic review of the literature according to PRISMA searched five electronic databases, two study registers and google scholar without language restrictions. Briefly, WB-EMS studies that reported adverse effects, loss to follow, withdrawal or attendance rates in non-athletic cohorts were included. Finally, 58 eligible studies were eligible. All studies applied low-frequency WB-EMS predominately 1-2x 20-25 min/week. Seventeen studies provided a superimposed protocol. While no study (n=56) reported serious adverse effects, four studies observed abnormal laboratory findings, albeit without clinical relevance. Loss to follow-up (10±11%) and withdrawal rate (5±6%) of WB-EMS trials were low, but did not differ from data for the non-training (10±12% and 4±6%) or exercise control groups (12±11% and 7±8%). In parallel, we observed high attendance rates (94±7%) in the WB-EMS groups that again did not relevantly vary from findings for the exercising control groups (n=20; 91±7%). WB-EMS can indeed be considered as a safe and attractive training technology for non-athletic cohorts, be it with or without health problems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8cab4c6212cfd51669eaa18988322881fe14606d9f5b040bb43b12cbaa72c1a5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
