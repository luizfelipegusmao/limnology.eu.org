{"title":"The Molecular Mechanism of Embryonic Development in Decapod Crustaceans","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/raq.12981?af=R","date":1729502137000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>In recent decades, the decapod aquaculture industry has grown significantly in many parts of the world. Despite this progress, production levels still fall short of market demands, indicating a need for further efforts to increase the production. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying embryonic development in decapods provide valuable insights into the complex embryonic development processes of this economically and ecologically important animal group. In this review, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying decapod embryonic development, focusing on key genes, signaling pathways, and microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the embryogenesis. Numerous genes have been identified that regulate various aspects of embryogenesis including egg activation, maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), mesoderm development, segmentation, nervous system development, sex determination, germline development, and exoskeleton formation. We also discuss the pivotal role of signaling pathways such as Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, MAPK, TGF-Î², Jak-STAT, VEGF, and Ecdysteroid in the regulation of embryogenesis. Additionally, this review identifies current research gaps in decapod embryogenesis and proposes directions for future investigation. This review is anticipated to be especially beneficial for researchers delving into the molecular mechanisms driving embryonic development in decapods.</p>","author":"Ardavan Farhadi, \nQun Zhao, \nKarsoon Tan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Reviews in Aquaculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"e603512385355dc11b8c11c7000aba80fad3ae9faea7a2537d8e3609c19b97a1","entryHash":"16cc1642c8bc6747f643e377a33943feb5c39ab8e51c3bfa78fc989e79bdd995","category":"Environment"}
