{"title":"30 Ethnobotany applied to ruminant feeding inserted in countryside property redesign","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/11/7617923?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Adoption of multi-species herbal leys, planting trees and integrating livestock can increase agricultural productivity and carbon storage on ruminant livestock farms. Most of the forage produced in pastures during the year is available in hot and rainy seasons, so the cold and dry season becomes a critical point, where forage production is insufficient. Thus, there is a need to use other complementary feed sources. This study aims to characterize bibliographically the plants that are part of ethnobotanical science, according to their bio compounds, based on the perception of the livestock farmers interviewed, aimed at increasing productivity, and that are used in the feeding of ruminant animals by livestock farmers in the regions between the cities of Araras and Ribeirao Preto in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The research took place in a qualitative way adopting the use of questionnaires and interviews with rural producers, and the answers used by them were characterized in an empirical way, according to occurrences based on the experience and experience of errors and successes in animal nutrition and health, in which it was later possible to perform a textual analysis of what was described by the producers, aligned with the literature. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with farmers, involving questions about: i) which plant species exist on the property; - ii) what is the importance, value or function associated with these species. The species to be surveyed will be those: plant species that are in some way related to the production system (present on and/or off pasture), and have been planted or maintained by farmers to: i) provide animal welfare; ii) positively influence forage or soil quality; iii) complement animal nutrition; iv) provide ecosystem services (related to ecological/environmental factors; v) generate complementary income; vi) bring scenic, ornamental or landscape benefit on the pastures. The wisdom of the farmers is in line with the information in the literature, since the purpose of the food has characteristics such as being drought-tolerant, having increased dry matter, a wealth of minerals and vitamins, flavonoids, tannins, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances, energy and protein, as well as good digestibility by ruminant animals. Therefore, the productive potential of rural properties in Brazil goes beyond grass and crop treatments. It is necessary to explore the species present on rural properties and show farmers the importance of identifying plants and for what purpose they can be used, such as animal feed subsidized by the farm's own ruminants. Especially when there is grazing of the animals and the presence of these foods in the paddock.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"2b3503910008f2701abdae5fc171c4edb9735b0a224d27333e1db27f9c88aa4a","category":"Environment"}
