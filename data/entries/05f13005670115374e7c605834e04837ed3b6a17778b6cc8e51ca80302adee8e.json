{"title":"Michelangelo Effect in Cognitive Rehabilitation: Using Art in a Digital Visuospatial Memory Task","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1080/v1","date":1713270775000,"content":"Previous studies reported a reduction of the perceived effort and an improvement of the perfor-mances of healthy subjects and patients when a motor task was combined with artistic images with respect to non-artistic images. This phenomenon, called Michelangelo effect, could contribute to the efficacy of art therapy in neurorehabilitation. In this study, the possible occurrence of this effect was tested in a cognitive task by asking to 15 healthy subjects and 17 patients with stroke to solve a digital version of the classical memory card game. Three different types of images were used in a randomized order: French cards, artistic portraits, and photos of famous people (to compensate the possible effects of face recognition). Healthy subjects were involved to test the usability and the load demanding of the developed system, reporting no statistically significant differences among the three sessions (p &gt; 0.05). Conversely, patients had a better performance in terms of time (p = 0.014) and number of trials (p = 0.007) needed to complete the task in presence of artistic stimuli, accompanied by a reduction of the perceived effort (p = 0.033). Furthermore, artistic stimuli, with respect to the other two types of images, seemed more associated to visuo-spatial control than to linguistic functions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05f13005670115374e7c605834e04837ed3b6a17778b6cc8e51ca80302adee8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
