Coastal habitat restoration is a powerful tool to help mitigate the loss of habitat-forming species, however, many efforts focus on reintroducing a single, imperilled species instead of incorporating alternatives that are more conducive to current and future conditions. Seagrass restoration has seen mixed success in halting local meadow declines but could begin to specifically utilize generalist seagrasses with climate change-tolerant and opportunistic life history traits including high reproduction rates and rapid growth.\n\nHere, we built on decades of successful eelgrass (<i>Zostera marina</i>) restoration in the Chesapeake Bay by experimentally testing seed-based restoration potential of widgeongrass (<i>Ruppia maritima</i>)—a globally distributed seagrass that can withstand wide ranges of salinities and temperatures. Using field experiments, we evaluated which seeding methods yielded highest widgeongrass survival and growth, tested if seeding widgeongrass adjacent to eelgrass can increase restoration success, and quantified how either seagrass species changes restored bed structure, invertebrate communities, and nitrogen cycling.\n\nWe found that widgeongrass can be restored via direct seeding in the fall, and that seeding both species maximized total viable restored area. Our pilot restoration area increased by 98% because we seeded widgeongrass in shallow, high temperature waters that are currently unsuitable for eelgrass survival and thus, would remain unseeded via only eelgrass restoration efforts. Restored widgeongrass had higher faunal diversity and double animal abundance per plant biomass than restored eelgrass, whereas restored eelgrass produced three times greater plant biomass per unit area and higher nitrogen recycling in the sediment.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications.</i> Overall, we provide evidence that supplementing opportunistic, generalist species into habitat restoration is a proactive approach to combat climate change impacts. Specifically, these species can increase trait diversity which, for our study, increased total habitat area restored—a key factor to promote seagrass beds' facilitation cascades, stability, and grass persistence through changing environments. Now, we call for tests to determine if the benefits of restoration with generalist species alone or in conjunction with historically dominant taxa are broadly transferrable to restoration in other marine and terrestrial habitats.\n</p>","author":"Enie Hensel, \nChristopher J.
