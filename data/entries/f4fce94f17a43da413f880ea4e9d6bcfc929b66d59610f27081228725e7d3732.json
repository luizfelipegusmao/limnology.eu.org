{"title":"Reliable and Faithful Generative Explainers for Graph Neural Networks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1718/v1","date":1729590376000,"content":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been effectively implemented in a variety of real-world applications, while their underlying work mechanisms remain a mystery. To unveil this mystery and advocate trustworthy decision-making, many GNN explainers have been proposed. However, existing explainers often face significant challenges, such as: 1) explanations being tied to specific instances; 2) limited generalizability to unseen graphs; 3) potential generation of invalid graph structures; and 4) restrictions to particular tasks (e.g., node classification, graph classification). To address these challenges, we propose a novel explainer, GAN-GNNExplainer, which employs a generator to produce explanations and a discriminator to oversee the generation process, enhancing the reliability of the outputs. Despite its advantages, GAN-GNNExplainer still struggles with generating faithful explanations and underperforms on real-world datasets. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce ACGAN-GNNExplainer, an improved approach that improves upon GAN-GNNExplainer by using a more robust discriminator that consistently monitors the generation process, thereby producing explanations that are both reliable and faithful. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over existing GNN explainers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4fce94f17a43da413f880ea4e9d6bcfc929b66d59610f27081228725e7d3732","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
