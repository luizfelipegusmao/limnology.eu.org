{"title":"Feasibility of excitation‐emission fluorescence spectroscopy in tandem with chemometrics for quantitation of trans‐resveratrol in vine‐shoot ethanolic extracts","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13435?af=R","date":1710504636000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p><i>trans</i>-Resveratrol (TR) is a well-known phytochemical compound with important biological properties. It can be recovered from agri-food by-products or wastes, such as vine shoots. Once recovered, its concentration should be measured, possibly in a green, non-destructive, and efficient manner. With these premises, this work aimed to explore the feasibility of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy combined with chemometrics for the analysis of TR in raw extracts obtained from vine shoots. A total of 75 extracts were produced and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography method with diode array detection (UPLC-DAD) and spectrofluorimetry. Then, the feasibility of two calibration strategies for TR quantitation was assessed – a parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)-based calibration and the N-way partial least squares (NPLS) regression.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The extracts showed variable TR content, the excitation/emission maxima of which were at around 305/390 nm, respectively. The best PARAFAC-based calibration allowed a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 22.57 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, and a relative prediction deviation (RPD) of 2.91 to be obtained but a large number of PARAFAC components should be considered to improve the predictions. The results of the NPLS regression were slightly better, with a RMSEP of 19.47 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, and an RPD of 3.33 in the best case.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Fluorescence could be an alternative analytical technique to measure TR in complex samples. Chemometric tools allowed the identification of the TR signal in the fluorescence landscapes, which could be further used for its non-destructive quantitation. The need for a more accurate criterion for optimal PARAFAC complexity emerged. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Antonio F Caputi, \nGiacomo Squeo, \nEwa Sikorska, \nRoccangelo Silletti, \nMirella Noviello, \nAntonella Pasqualone, \nCarmine Summo, \nFrancesco Caponio","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"34cb2bff379b316e0c14199cf580694c5c26148d48d644725c396d9cdf0d83fd","category":"Environment"}
