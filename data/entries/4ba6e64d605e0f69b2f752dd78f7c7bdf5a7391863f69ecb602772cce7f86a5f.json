{"title":"Evaluating the potential white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) swim pattern manipulation capabilities of the novel and noninvasive Shark Exclusion Barrier","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4209?af=R","date":1717562958000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nEven though the risk of a negative encounter with a large and potentially dangerous shark species (e.g. white sharks—<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>) is exceedingly rare, some localities implement indiscriminate shark culls to minimize this risk.\nDue to the negative ecological impact that these lethal shark control measures can have, the present study aimed to test a novel and eco-friendly shark barrier system, known as the Shark Exclusion Barrier. The Shark Exclusion Barrier is a shark deterrent technology that is composed of a combination of interconnected and telescoping vertical barrier elements (i.e. the visual stimulus) and electromagnetic stimuli (e.g. electromagnets and Barium Ferrite (BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub>) permanent magnets). Using this system, two separate <i>C. carcharias</i> swim pattern manipulation studies were conducted over the course of two research seasons.\nIn the first season (i.e. 2021), 9, 1-h trials were conducted where 9–13 different <i>C. carcharias</i> interacted with the barrier.\nIn the second season (i.e. 2023), 35, 2-h trials were conducted where 6–10 <i>C. carcharias</i> interacted with the barrier.\nThroughout experimentation, <i>C. carcharias</i> exhibited a significantly greater entrance frequency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and a significantly reduced pass around frequency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) towards the control region when compared to the Shark Exclusion Barrier region.\nFurthermore, the barrier exhibited the ability to maintain its structural integrity during swells of ≥2.13 m, breaking waves of ≥1.52 m and a current of ≥1.12 m/s.\nDue to the promising results, this technology warrants further investigation to determine if it is a plausible alternative to lethal culling measures.\n</p>","author":"C.
