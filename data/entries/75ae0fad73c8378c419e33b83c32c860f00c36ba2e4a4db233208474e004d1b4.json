Multiple enteropathogens were detected using FilmArray, and the pathogen was subsequently isolated and cultured from anal swabs of the cases and stream water. The isolated strains were identified using VITEK MS, and antimicrobial susceptibility test, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) molecular typing, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were performed on the isolates of <i>Plesiomonas shigelloides</i>. Gene annotation and sequence alignment were used to analyze the virulence genes and drug resistance genes of the strains. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and homology analysis was conducted to trace the origin of <i>P</i>. <i>shigelloides</i>. A total of 7 strains of <i>P</i>.<i>shigelloides</i> were isolated, with 3 from stream water and 4 from anal swabs. All 7 strains exhibited the same PFGE pattern and showed resistance to amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cefazolin, streptomycin, and florfenicol. The isolated strains carried the same resistance genes and virulence factors. In the sequences of the isolated strains from this outbreak, 11 mutation sites were detected. The phylogenetic tree based on SNP sites showed that these strains were homologous. This foodborne disease outbreak caused by <i>P</i>.<i>shigelloides</i> was the first reported in Huzhou. WGS can be used as a complementary method to PFGE for epidemiological investigations of disease outbreaks.","author":"Peng Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"75ae0fad73c8378c419e33b83c32c860f00c36ba2e4a4db233208474e004d1b4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
