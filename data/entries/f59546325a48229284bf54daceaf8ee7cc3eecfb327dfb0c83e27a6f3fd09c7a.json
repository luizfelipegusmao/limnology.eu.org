{"title":"The Time Temperature Superposition in Polymeric Rubber Gels Treated by Means of the Mode-Coupling Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0441/v1","date":1712315678000,"content":"Viscoelastic relaxation measurements on Stirene-Butadiene rubbers (SBR) doped with Carbon Nanotube (CNT) at different concentration show the time-temperature superposition (TTS). This process is described in terms of the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) approaches to the viscoelasticity by considering the frequency behavior of the loss modulus E”(ω), and shown that the corresponding TTS is linked to a (ω)1/2 decay. From of the analysis of the obtained data we observe that the interaction between the SBR and CNT determine different decays different decays according to their concentration. The rubbers with the lowest CNT concentration are only characterized, in the studied T-range, by a fragile glass forming behavior. Whereas those at the highest ones instead show, at a specific temperature TL, a crossover towards a pure Arrhenius, that according to the MCT, indicates the presence of a kinetic glass transition (KGT); where the system response functions are characterized by scaling behaviors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f59546325a48229284bf54daceaf8ee7cc3eecfb327dfb0c83e27a6f3fd09c7a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
