{"title":"Perceptions of COVID-19 Vaccination among Organ Transplant Recipients","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1038/v1","date":1713260376000,"content":"Understanding vaccine hesitancy in organ transplant recipients (OTR) is critical, given clear, alt-hough attenuated, benefits from vaccination. Adult OTR were surveyed regarding vaccine-related values and a novel outcome variable called Vaccine Acceptance Composite Score (VACS) was built as the average Likert score of 7 domains of vaccination confidence. Of 46 OTR included (93.5% kidney transplant recipients), 32.6% were female, 13.3% Black, 6.77% Hispan-ic/Latino/a/x; median age was 58 years. Patients were most concerned about COVID-19 vac-cine-associated risks (46.3%), its potential effect on allograft (47.6%) and motives of government officials involved with vaccine policy (55.6%). Politically conservative patients were likely to have a significantly lower VACS, while those who lived with someone ≥65 had a higher VACS. The VACS was not significantly associated with race, income, religious beliefs, comorbidities, COVID-19 history, or influenza vaccination status. Higher VACS was significantly associated with ≥3 and ≥4 COVID-19 immunizations. This study highlighted political beliefs and elderly household members as correlates of vaccine acceptance among OTR. The VACS may be a useful tool to help standardize multifaceted analyses in vaccination-focused behavioral research, as well as identify individuals and groups at risk for vaccine hesitancy, who may benefit from tai-lored outreach and educational interventions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4b6a5d008c333c50101230fb28fa2b52bb39df0469cac635cc847f0dd037b1e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
