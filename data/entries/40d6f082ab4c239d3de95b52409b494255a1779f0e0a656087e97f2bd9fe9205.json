This research specifically focuses on identifying the relevant physical and chemical characteristics of avocados, creating a dataset containing categorized images of maturity levels, and creating machine learning models capable of accurately predicting fruit maturity. The studies reveal that the application of machine learning, in particular convolutional neural networks and multisensor models, has the potential to transform the prediction of avocado maturity and thus improve product quality and customer satisfaction. The findings indicate that the proposed techniques achieve an accuracy rate of over 90%, demonstrating their viability for integration into mobile applications that can benefit growers and suppliers in their decision-making processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"40d6f082ab4c239d3de95b52409b494255a1779f0e0a656087e97f2bd9fe9205","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
