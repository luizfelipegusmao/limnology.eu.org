Using state-of-the-art electron microscopes, scientists can now study novel pathogens that threaten human life or smart materials for next-generation microprocessors [<a href=\"#ozae044.971-B1\">1-3</a>]. Accordingly, the use of alternative substrates has skyrocketed in materials research, yet their application is surprisingly less prevalent in life sciences. In alignment with the new federal objectives of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Materials Genome Project, we are utilizing advanced materials for biological imaging experiments to improve technical knowledge [<a href=\"#ozae044.971-B4\">4-6</a>]. Figure 1A illustrates new specimen preparation techniques for the real-time study of biological entities in a liquid environment. Determining nanoscale features among flexible biological assemblies remains challenging in cryo-electron microscopy (EM), whereas liquid-EM may provide a natural complement to fulfill this long sought-after goal.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d52de994a7685cceae223ed7e194efce9a781c577ff627cb309f22fb22b9b9c9","category":"Environment"}
