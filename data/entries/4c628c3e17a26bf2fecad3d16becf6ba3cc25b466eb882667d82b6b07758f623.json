Nevertheless, the molecular and physiological responses that these bioactive substances induce remain underexplored. This present study investigated the toxicity of different concentrations of aqueous and methanol extracts of <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> against larvae of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (<i>sensu stricto</i>) and unraveled the possible underlying molecular pathways responsible for the observed physiological effects. FTIR and GCMS analyses of phytoactive compounds in aqueous and methanol crude extracts of <i>O</i>. <i>tenuiflorum</i> showed the presence of OH stretching vibration, C = C stretching modes of aromatics and methylene rocking vibration; ring deformation mode with high levels of trans-β-ocimene, 3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatriene in aqueous extract and 4-methoxy-benzaldehyde, 1,3,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane and o-cymene in methanol extract. The percentage mortality upon exposure to methanol and aqueous extracts of <i>O</i>. <i>tenuiflorum</i> were 21.1% and 26.1% at 24 h, 27.8% and 36.1% at 48 h and 36.1% and 45% at 72 h respectively. Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), down-regulation of <i>ABC transporter</i>, overexpression of <i>CYP6M2</i>, <i>Hsp70</i>, and <i>α-esterase</i>, coupled with significantly increased levels of SOD, CAT, and GSH, were observed in <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae</i> (<i>s</i>.<i>s</i>.) exposed to aqueous and methanol extracts of <i>O</i>. <i>tenuiflorum</i> as compared to the control. Findings from this study have significant implications for our understanding of how <i>An</i>. <i>gambiae</i> (<i>s</i>.<i>s</i>.) larvae detoxify phytoactive compounds.","author":"Harun K.
