{"title":"Marine biodiversity conservation: The cultural aspect of marine protected areas in Ghana","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4138?af=R","date":1711970368000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\nStudying fishers and fishing communities' social-cultural structures is vital in policy-making concerning local marine ecosystem sustainability. Previous studies on marine communities seldom neglected the role of culture in marine biodiversity conservation, especially a marine protected area (MPA) establishment.\nThis study first explores the cultural practices in coastal communities in Ghana that have the potential for the conservation of the marine ecosystem (MPA); second, it examines the willingness of coastal communities to welcome an MPA establishment.\nPrimary data were collected using focus group discussions with 9 fishermen, key informant interviews with 20 chief fishermen, and self-administered questionnaires to 491 fishermen across 9 semi-urban, 2 urban, and 16 villages along the coast of Ghana.\nAdopting the convergent parallel mixed-methods research design (quantitative method includes descriptive analysis using tables, charts, diagrams, and <i>χ</i>\n<sup>2</sup> bivariate analysis; and qualitative method involves a narrative format), the study underscored that the socioeconomic characteristics of fishermen are diverse and mixed. Most of the fishermen do not know what an MPA is but are willing to accept an MPA initiative. Certain cultural practices such as the prohibition of gathering certain species, traditional close season, and fishing holidays are found to be conducive to an MPA initiative.\nThese cultural practices should be integrated into an MPA policy. Fisheries practitioners should consider an ecosystem-based approach (including cultural values) to fisheries management and fishermen should endeavour to learn new skills outside the industry.\n</p>","author":"Alhassan Abdul‐Wakeel Karakara, \nJames A.
