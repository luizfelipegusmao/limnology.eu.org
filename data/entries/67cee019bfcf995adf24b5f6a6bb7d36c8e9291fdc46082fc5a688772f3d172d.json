{"title":"Sex disparities in the associations of overall versus abdominal obesity with the 10-year cardiovascular disease risk: Evidence from the Indonesian National Health Survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307944","date":1727100000000,"content":"<p>by Fathimah S.

Although obesity is a known risk factor for CVDs, the relative contributions of overall versus abdominal obesity are less clear. We aimed to estimate the 10-year CVD risks of the Indonesian population and investigate the separate and joint associations of overall and abdominal obesity with these risks.</p> Methods <p>Using nationally representative data from the Indonesian Health Survey (n = 33,786), the 10-year CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham Score. The score was calculated as %-risk, with &gt;20% indicating high risk. Overall obesity was measured by BMI, while abdominal obesity was measured by waist circumference. We performed sex-stratified multivariable linear regressions to examine the associations of standardized units of BMI and waist circumference with the 10-year CVD risk, mutually adjusted for waist circumference and BMI.</p> Results <p>Mean (SD) 10-year CVD risks were 14.3(8.9)% in men and 8.0(9.3)% in women, with 37.3% of men and 14.1% of women having high (&gt;20%) risks. After mutual adjustment, one SD in BMI and waist circumference were associated with 0.75(0.50–1.01) and 0.95(0.72–1.18) increase in the %-risk of CVD in men, whereas in women, the β(95% CIs) were 0.43(0.25–0.61) and 1.06(0.87–1.26).</p> Conclusion <p>Abdominal fat accumulation showed stronger associations with 10-year CVD risks than overall adiposity, particularly in women. Although men had higher overall CVD risks, women experienced more detrimental cardiovascular effects of obesity. Raising awareness of abdominal/visceral obesity and its more damaging cardiovascular effects in women is crucial in preventing CVD-related morbidity and mortality.</p>","author":"Fathimah S.
