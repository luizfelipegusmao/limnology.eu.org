The more negative <i>K</i>\n<sub>leaf</sub>\n<i>P</i>\n<sub>50</sub> was associated with a greater ratio of major to minor vein density (VLA<sub>maj</sub>/VLA<sub>min</sub>), the lower <i>K</i>\n<sub>leaf-max</sub> was associated with a lower minor vein density (VLA<sub>min</sub>) and greater increase in WUEi arose from the small decrease in the photosynthetic rate relative to the stomatal conductance. However, <i>C. jubata</i> was consistent with the ‘hydraulic safety strategy’ with a great decrease in <i>K</i>\n<sub>leaf</sub>\n<i>P</i>\n<sub>50</sub>, a small decrease in <i>K</i>\n<sub>leaf-max</sub> and a small increase in WUE<sub>i</sub> along with decreasing plant height and leaf area with increasing altitude. Whereas <i>S. gilashanica</i> was consistent with the ‘photosynthetic efficiency strategy’ with a small decrease in <i>K</i>\n<sub>leaf</sub>\n<i>P</i>\n<sub>50</sub>, a greater decrease in <i>K</i>\n<sub>leaf-max</sub> and a greater increase in WUE<sub>i</sub> along with an increasing plant height and unchanged leaf area with increasing altitude.\n\nOverall, these findings provide new insights to improve understanding how shift in leaf hydraulic traits and their associations with gas exchange and plant size allow plants to adapt to high-altitude habitats.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/09/11/the-combination-of-high-leaf-hydraulic-safety-and-water-use-efficiency-allows-alpine-shrubs-to-adapt-to-high-altitude-habitats/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Guang‐Qian Yao, \nShi‐Hua Qi, \nYan‐Ru Li, \nYu‐Na Duan, \nChao Jiang, \nZheng‐Fei Nie, \nXu‐Dong Liu, \nMd.
