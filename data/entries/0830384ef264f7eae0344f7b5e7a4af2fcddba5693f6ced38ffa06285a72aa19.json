{"title":"An OOSEM-Based Design Pattern for Developing AUV Controllers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0154/v1","date":1719881864000,"content":"The paper introduces a control hybrid model that is designed on the basis of OOSEM (Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method), MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) concepts, RealTime UML/SysML (Unified Modeling Language/Systems Modeling Language), and an algorithm based on UKF (Unscented Kalman Filter). This hybrid model enables the implementation of control elements for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and can be adapted to reuse for most standard AUV platforms. To obtain this goal, the dynamic model of AUV is integrated with the following specializations of OOSEM/MDA, in which the analysis model is clarified via the use-case model definition and then combines with HA (hybrid automata) to precisely define the requirements for control. Next, the designed model is specialized via real-time UML/SysML to get the core control blocks, which describe the behaviors and structures of control parts in detail. This design model is then transformed into the model of implementation with the assistance of round-trip engineering to conveniently realize the controller of AUVs. Based on this new model, an AUV controller for low-cost turtle-shaped AUVs is implemented that performs tracking for a planar trajectory with accepted feasibility.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0830384ef264f7eae0344f7b5e7a4af2fcddba5693f6ced38ffa06285a72aa19","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
