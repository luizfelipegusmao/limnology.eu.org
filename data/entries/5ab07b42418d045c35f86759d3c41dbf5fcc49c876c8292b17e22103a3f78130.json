{"title":"Carbon (&delta;13C) and Nitrogen (&delta;15N) Isotope Dynamics during Decomposition of Norway Spruce and Scots Pine Litter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1298/v1","date":1718793809000,"content":"We studied the dynamics of stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes in litters from Norway spruce (NSL) (Picea abies) and Scots pine (SPL) (Pinus silvestris) during in situ decomposition over a period of more than 4 years. Relative to initial values, δ13CNSL showed a weak enrichment (0.33‰), whereas δ13CSPL resulted in depletion (-0.74‰) at the end of decomposition. Both litter types experienced a depletion in δ15N during decomposition; δ15NNSL decreased by -1.74‰ and δ15NSPL decreased by -1.99‰. The effect of the selective preservation of or acid unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) in lowering δ13C of the residual litter was evident only in SPL. In the NSL, only in the initial stage C/N had a large effect on the δ13C values. In the later stages, there was a non-linear decrease in δ13CNSL with a simultaneous increase in AUR concentrations , but the effect size was large, suggesting the role of lignin in driving δ13C of residues in later stages. Depletion in 15N of the residual litters concomitant with the increase in N concentration suggests bacterial transformation of the litter over fungal components. A consistent decline in δ15N values further implies that bacterial dominance prompted this by immobilizing nitrate depleted in 15N in the residual litter.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5ab07b42418d045c35f86759d3c41dbf5fcc49c876c8292b17e22103a3f78130","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
