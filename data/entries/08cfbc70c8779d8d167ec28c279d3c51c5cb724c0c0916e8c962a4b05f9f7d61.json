{"title":"Elucidating the role of FOS in modulating the immune microenvironment through fibroblast and myeloid cell regulation in locoregional recurrent HNSCC","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24262?af=R","date":1726225515000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) presents a significant clinical challenge, particularly due to its high propensity for locoregional recurrence. Current research underscores the need to unravel the complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment. This study addresses the critical gap in understanding how FOS modulates the immune landscape in HNSCC, with a focus on its influence on fibroblast and myeloid cell dynamics.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Employing a comprehensive approach, we analyzed tissue samples from HNSCC patients and adjacent non-cancerous tissues using bulk RNA sequencing complemented by in-depth bioinformatics analyses, including gene ontology (GO), Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and immune infiltration assessment. A pivotal aspect of our research involved dissecting single-cell RNA-seq data from GSE234933 to elucidate the cell-type-specific expression of FOS.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>We found that FOS expression varies significantly in different cell populations in the HNSCC tumor microenvironment, especially in fibroblasts and myeloid cells. This expression difference may reflect the different roles of these cells in tumor progression and their impact on the tumor microenvironment.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our results uncover a significant correlation between FOS expression and key immune and hypoxia-related pathways, suggesting its integral role in the tumor microenvironment. These findings not only enhance our understanding of HNSCC pathogenesis but also highlight FOS as a potential therapeutic target. This study marks a significant step towards addressing the urgent need for targeted interventions in HNSCC, particularly in the context of locoregional recurrence.</p>","author":"Shaokun Liu, \nBoxuan Han, \nRu Wang, \nJugao Fang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"08cfbc70c8779d8d167ec28c279d3c51c5cb724c0c0916e8c962a4b05f9f7d61","category":"Environment"}
