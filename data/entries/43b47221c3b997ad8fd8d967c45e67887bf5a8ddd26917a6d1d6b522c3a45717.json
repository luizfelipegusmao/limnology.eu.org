We documented the association between fungal and bat diversities along a landscape gradient. Ten, eight, and seven bat species were captured in conserved, semi-conserved, and urban sites, respectively. <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, <i>Myotis ciliolabrum</i> and <i>Corynorhinus townsendii</i> were the most abundant in conserved and semi-conserved sites. <i>E</i>. <i>fuscus</i>, <i>Myotis velifer</i>, and <i>Lasiurus cinereus</i> were abundant in urban sites. <i>C</i>. <i>townsendii</i> was the least abundant bat. A total of 15 cultivated fungi genera included the fungal diversity in bats, of which nine fungi genera were shared along the landscape gradient. <i>Penicillium</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i> were the most abundant genera, and <i>Aureobasidium</i>, <i>Bispora</i>, <i>Stachybotrys</i>, and <i>Verticillium</i> were only documented in the conserved sites. We observed a higher fungal diversity associated with bat species along this landscape gradient. The individual site-based accumulation curves of fungal diversity showed significant decreasing values along the conserved, semi-conserved, and urban sites, respectively. In conserved and urban sites, <i>M</i>. <i>californicus</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>velifer</i> showed the highest fungal diversity, respectively. <i>E</i>. <i>fuscus</i> was associated to the fungi genera <i>Scopulariopsis</i>, <i>Alternaria</i>, <i>Penicillium</i> and <i>Beauveria</i>; <i>L</i>. <i>cinereus</i> to <i>Cladosporium</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i>, and <i>M</i>. <i>velifer</i> to <i>Alternaria sp1</i>, <i>Bispora</i> and <i>Trichoderma</i>. Conserved sites showed both high bat and fungal diversities [species richness and abundance] compared to semi-conserved and urban sites. More studies associating bat and fungal diversities in other ecosystems are needed to corroborate this pattern.","author":"Gabriel Gutiérrez-Granados","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"43b47221c3b997ad8fd8d967c45e67887bf5a8ddd26917a6d1d6b522c3a45717","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
