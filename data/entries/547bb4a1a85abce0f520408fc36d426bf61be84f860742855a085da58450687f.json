Nuclear energy is a clean and affordable energy source that contributes to greenhouse gas reduction goals as a key component of the nation’s energy portfolio. NSUF is managed by Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for USDOE, provides unparalleled research opportunities for nuclear energy researchers, and the PIE is a key step to reveal the relationship among material’s property, chemistry and performance in researches for future nuclear reactor’s materials design.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"547bb4a1a85abce0f520408fc36d426bf61be84f860742855a085da58450687f","category":"Environment"}
