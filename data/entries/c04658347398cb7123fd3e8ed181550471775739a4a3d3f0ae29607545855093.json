Exploring the myriad sizes and isomers of fullerene structures is imperative given their wide-ranging applications in electronics, drug delivery, and beyond [<a href=\"#ozae044.722-B2\">2</a>]. However, the bulk of research has been confined to commercially available C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub> fullerenes. This is primarily due to the scarcity of higher fullerenes—those with more than 70 carbon atoms—stemming from the formidable challenges associated with purification and the intricate structural complexities of their isomers. Consequently, there has been a keen interest in developing targeted synthesis methodologies for higher fullerenes and unraveling their structure-properties relationships. To address this limitation, we suggest electron beam-initiated synthesis explored through SMART-EM (Single Molecule Atomic-Resolution Real-Time Electron Microscopy) to fabricate novel higher fullerenes on graphene membranes [<a href=\"#ozae044.722-B3\">3-5</a>]. (Fig. 1) This integrated approach allows for the observation and identification of their structures at the sub-angstrom scale.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c04658347398cb7123fd3e8ed181550471775739a4a3d3f0ae29607545855093","category":"Environment"}
