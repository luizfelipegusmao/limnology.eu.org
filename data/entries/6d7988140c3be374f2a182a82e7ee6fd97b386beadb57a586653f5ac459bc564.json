{"title":"Exploring the Influence of Sociocultural Factors on Non Utilization of Family Planning amongst Women in Ethiopia&#039;s Pastoralist Regions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0662/v1","date":1718093236000,"content":"This study aimed to explore the sociocultural determinants of family planning (FP) utilization among women in pastoralist areas of Ethiopia. A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 682 re-productive aged women selected from three regions in pastoralist districts. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with women who did not use FP. This study revealed that 47% of women did not use FP. Women who did not use FP were more likely to shorter spaces between births, lack of partners’ support, when only a husband or someone else decides on large household purchases, and low use of household expenditure were some of the factors associated with not using FP. Overall, the prevalence of not using FP is significantly high in pastoralist communities of Ethiopia. The authors recommend that investment in women’s health and FP be targeted at educational campaigns to raise awareness about FP and its importance. Engaging men and community leaders, promoting their support for FP and contraceptive use, and providing financial assistance to address financial barriers such as transportation costs and healthcare fees, are important aspects that can increase the utilization of FP methods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6d7988140c3be374f2a182a82e7ee6fd97b386beadb57a586653f5ac459bc564","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
