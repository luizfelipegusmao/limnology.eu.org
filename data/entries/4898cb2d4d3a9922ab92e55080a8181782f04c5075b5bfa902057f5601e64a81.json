{"title":"Silver Nanoparticles Loaded With Oleuropein Alleviates LPS‐Induced Acute Lung Injury by Modulating the TLR4/P2X7 Receptor‐Mediated Inflammation and Apoptosis in Rats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24369?af=R","date":1720534379000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) ligands were initially shown to be the source of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a gram-negative bacterium's cell wall immunostimulatory component. Oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation are all potential effects of LPS treatment on the lungs. By triggering oxidative stress and inflammation, these negative effects could be avoided. Robust flavonoid oleuropein (OLE) exhibits anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antioxidative properties. A nanodelivery system could improve its low bioavailability, making it more effective and useful in treating chronic human ailments. This study evaluates the effects of AgNP-loaded OLE on LPS-induced lung injury in rats in terms of TLR4/P2X7 receptor-mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Forty-eight male albino rats were randomly divided into eight groups. Drugs were administered to the groups in the doses specified as follows: Control, LPS (8 mg/kg ip), OLE (50 mg/kg) AgNPs (100 mg/kg), OLE + AgNPs (50 mg/kg), LPS + OLE (oleuropein 50 mg/kg ig + LPS 8 mg/kg ip), LPS + AgNPs (AgNPs 100 mg/kg ig + LPS 8 mg/kg ip), and LPS + OLE + AgNPs (OLE + AgNPs 50 mg/kg + LPS 8 mg/kg ip). After the applications, the rats were decapitated under appropriate conditions, and lung tissues were obtained. Oxidative stress (SOD, MDA, and GSH), and inflammation (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, Nrf2, P2X7R, AKT, and TLR4) parameters were evaluated in the obtained lung tissues. Additionally, histopathology studies were performed on lung tissue samples. The data obtained were evaluated by comparison between groups. Both OLE and OLE + AgNPs showed potential in reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). These findings were supported by histopathological analysis, which revealed that tissue damage was reduced in OLE and OLE + AgNPs-treated groups. According to the results, LPS-induced lung injury can be reduced by using nanotechnology and producing OLE + AgNP.</p>","author":"Seda Yakut, \nVolkan Gelen, \nHülya Kara, \nSeçkin Özkanlar, \nAli Yeşildağ","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"4898cb2d4d3a9922ab92e55080a8181782f04c5075b5bfa902057f5601e64a81","category":"Environment"}
