{"title":"Combined Prokaryotic Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis of Clinical Trueperella pyogenes Isolates with Distinctive Cytotoxicity","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0675/v1","date":1728460280000,"content":"Trueperella pyogenes is a widely distributed opportunistic pathogenic bacterium which can infect livestock, wildlife, community animals, and humans, resulting in suppurative infection of tissue and organ mucosa, including pneumonia, liver abscessation, mastitis, metritis, endocarditis, and osteoarthritis. TP1804 and TP1808 were isolated from the uterine lavage fluid of cows with endometritis. Several virulence factors are significant contributors to the pathogenicity expressed by T. pyogenes, including purulent pyolysin (PLO), fimbriae (Fim), neuraminidase (NanH and NanP), and collagen-binding protein (CbpA). These virulence factors are contributed to promote adhesion, including fimbriae, extracellular matrix-binding proteins, and neuraminidases. This study analyzed the prokaryotic transcriptomics and proteomics of two strains of T. pyogenes with similar growth curves but different cytotoxicity. Studying the metabolic mechanisms of these differentially expressed genes and proteins can greatly promote the discovery of new biomarkers and improve the accuracy of biomarker identification, which is of great value for molecular mechanisms, biomarkers, early diagnosis of diseases, molecular typing, prognosis, and clinical diagnosis.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5e94e0d64163152c03c37bf76ca7ce4d44e95bb5da00306a2a97a44266613e1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
