Context is important in understanding how school inclusion of sexual and gender minorities shapes mental health and well-being, with rapidly changing social and political forces necessitating ongoing research. This coproduced UK secondary school-based study aimed to understand (a) key components of mentally, socially and emotionally healthy school environments for LGBTQ+ students considerate of intersecting minoritised identities; (b) staff information, skills and capacity needs and (c) factors influencing uptake and implementation. Online interviews and focus groups were conducted with 63 participants (22 staff, 32 students (aged 13–19 years), and 9 training providers), diverse in relation to gender and sexual identity, ethnicity, religious and social context. Data were analysed thematically. One overarching theme captured the need for an intersectionality-informed, contextually adaptable, whole school approach which ‘shifts the narrative’ away from deficit thinking, challenging prevailing cis/heteronormative and White norms. This underpinned four themes: (1) ‘Feeling safe, seen and celebrated: embedding intersectional signs, signals and symbols’, (2) ‘Everyone’s business: the need for collaboration’, (3) ‘Embedding a culture of change’, and (4) ‘Re-locating the problem: challenging deficit thinking’. Contextually diverse research is needed which critically addresses ways in which social power enacted interpersonally and structurally serves to hinder schools from enacting LGBTQ+ inclusivity. Evidence to inform and develop implementation strategies for institutional changes and to advocate for wider socio-political support is also key to mitigate the potential for widening inequities linked to inequitable school environments.","author":"Amy Morgan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e74447ffe15569eb34f054922bce3938df8f894844a35637cfa38a6d98df8aa2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
