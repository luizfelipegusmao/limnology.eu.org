{"title":"Review on Evaporative Cooling Systems for Application in Buildings in Hot and Dry Climates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1571/v1","date":1726794802000,"content":"Numerous studies on evaporative cooling systems have been conducted globally, but there is a scarcity of investigations in eastern Africa. The few studies undertaken in this region have primarily focused on their application in food storage and preservation, rather than for building purpose. The goal of this study is to review the most recent advancements in evaporative cooling technology, which would be relevant in eastern Ethiopia and could provide adequate cooling, give adequate thermal comfort, use less energy, and minimize environmental effect in hot and dry areas. There aren't many studies on evaporative cooling systems for building applications in Eastern Africa as a whole, thus this review has taken into account studies conducted in regions with climates similar to eastern Ethiopia. This study covers the classification, operation, and performance of evaporative cooling systems in hot and dry climate. Evaporative cooling systems work well in hot and dry climates, as revealed by this review study.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"511e4f44cee90aa6b788573d34c1a1bdfca540fa3cb4560cd52382664f919834","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
