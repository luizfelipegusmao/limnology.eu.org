Our previous studies have demonstrated that toxic puffers are attracted to 5,6,11-trideoxytetrodotoxin (TDT), a nontoxic TTX analog that is simultaneously accumulated with TTX in toxic puffers and their prey. In addition, activity labeling using immunohistochemistry targeting neuronal activity marker suggests that TDT activates crypt olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) of the green spotted puffer. However, it remains to be determined whether individual crypt OSNs can physiologically respond to TDT. By employing electroporation to express GCaMP6s in OSNs, we successfully identified a distinct group of oval OSNs that exhibited a specific calcium response when exposed to TDT in green spotted puffers. These oval OSNs showed no response to amino acids (AAs), which serve as food odor cues for teleosts. Furthermore, oval morphology and surface positioning of TDT-sensitive OSNs in the olfactory epithelium closely resemble that of crypt OSNs. These findings further substantiate that TDT is specifically detected by crypt OSNs in green spotted puffer. The TDT odor may act as a chemoattractant for finding conspecific toxic puffers and for feeding TTX-bearing organisms for effective toxification.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"e0c2fed6a8584292724d8f988a43bce37a8bd5d950cc6d3382212b076e674732","category":"Environment"}
