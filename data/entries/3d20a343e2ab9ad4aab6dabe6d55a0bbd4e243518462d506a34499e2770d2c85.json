{"title":"Risk Stratification for Future Cardiac Arrest after COVID-19 Vaccination","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0821/v1","date":1723464518000,"content":"Unheralded cardiac arrest among previously healthy young people without antecedent illness, months or years after COVID-19 vaccination, highlights the urgent need for risk stratification. The most likely underlying pathophysiology is subclinical myopericarditis and reentrant ventricular tachycardia or spontaneous ventricular fibrillation that is commonly precipitated after a surge in catecholamines during exercise or the waking hours of terminal sleep. Small patches of inflammation and/or edema can be missed on cardiac imaging and autopsy, and the heart can appear grossly normal. This paper reviews evidence linking COVID-19 vaccines to cardiac arrest where unfortunately the majority of victims have had no antecedent clinical evaluation. We propose a comprehensive strategy for evaluating cardiovascular risk post-vaccination, incorporating detailed patient history, antibody testing, and cardiac diagnostics in the best attempt to detect abnormalities before sudden cardiac death. This approach aims to identify individuals at higher risk of cardiac events after COVID-19 vaccination and guide appropriate clinical management. It is prudent for each primary care physician to have a pre-established plan when addressing this issue in their practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d20a343e2ab9ad4aab6dabe6d55a0bbd4e243518462d506a34499e2770d2c85","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
