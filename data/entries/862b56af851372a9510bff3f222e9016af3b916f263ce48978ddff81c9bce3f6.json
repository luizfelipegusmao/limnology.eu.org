{"title":"Multi-model Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the Streamflow Conditions in the Kasai River Basin, Central Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0655/v1","date":1718099198000,"content":"The Congo River Basin is the second-largest watershed globally, flowing through nine countries before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. The Kasai River Basin (KARB), containing about one-fourth of Congoâ€™s freshwater resources, plays a strategic role in sustaining navigation, food production, and hydroelectricity generation in Central Africa. A multi-model framework suited for data scarce regions is applied for climate change impacts on water availability in the KARB to propose effective development plans in the future. This includes consideration of two conceptual hydrological models calibrated using four reanalysis datasets and fed with bias-corrected outputs of 19 climate models under two future Representative Climate Pathways (RCPs). Changes in mean annual discharge in the KARB from -18% to +3% are projected depending on the considered modeling configuration. This shows the sensitivity of impact assessment to the choice of models as well as input data. Moreover, about 9%, 18%, and 13% decline in streamflow signatures (Q10, Q50 and Q90) are projected based on the ensemble of models under RCP 8.5. A decrease of 14% and 5% in annual hydropower potential of the mainstream is estimated under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. These changes in flows conditions should be considered in decision-making around constructing reservoirs and hydroelectricity generation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"862b56af851372a9510bff3f222e9016af3b916f263ce48978ddff81c9bce3f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
