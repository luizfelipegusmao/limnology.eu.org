{"title":"229 Awardee Talk: The quest for an ideal in-field embryo evaluation tool in cattle: Opportunities and challenges","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/287/7757243?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Accurately evaluating bovine embryos to select the most viable ones for transfer and successful pregnancy has been a challenge since embryo transfer began in cattle over six decades ago. Despite more than 3,100 peer-reviewed studies on bovine embryo evaluation published in PubMed from 1964 to 2023, there is still no consensus or gold standard method for assessing their developmental potential. The evaluation “problem” in assisted reproduction extends beyond embryos to gametes as well. Numerous microscopic techniques (e.g., differential interference contrast, electron, fluorescent, time-lapse, and artificial intelligence-based microscopy) and non-microscopic methodologies (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and nuclear magnetic resonance) have been tested to find an embryo evaluation technique superior to morphological evaluation. While many of these research tools can accurately determine embryo quality and viability, most are invasive, expensive, labor-intensive, technically complex, and time-consuming, making them impractical for in-field embryo evaluation. Employing complex methods like RNA sequencing, SNP chips, mass spectrometry, and multiphoton microscopy at thousands of embryo production and collection facilities is unrealistic, no matter how accurate they may be. Therefore, future research should focus on innovating field-friendly, simple benchtop tests using existing findings, particularly from omics-based research methodologies. Time-lapse monitoring and artificial intelligence-based automated image analysis also potentially provide accurate embryo evaluation. However, further research is necessary to develop economically feasible options for in-field applications. Our recent work has examined possible applications of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, label-free microscopy, particularly holographic microscopy techniques like gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM), spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM), and multiphoton holographic microscopy in IVF labs. The ideal embryo evaluation tool should be accurate, objective, non-invasive, affordable, and simple enough for widespread adoption by embryo production and collection facilities worldwide. Under current circumstances, it is doubtful that transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, GLIM, SLIM, NMR, multiphoton holographic microscopy, and similar techniques can be directly used for in-field embryo evaluation. However, biomarkers identified by these methodologies could be used for in-field embryo evaluation by devising simple, affordable benchtop techniques. Further investigation on time-lapse microscopy (TLM) and AI-based automated image processing may make these methods more affordable and potentially adoptable by the masses. There is great potential for these methodologies to become widely used, provided they can be made more economically viable. In conclusion, the next generation of microscopy capable of providing objective markers for gamete and embryo quality is on the horizon.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"82ecb84eaf3f899e07b11fcebc767560c5b4a958f50ae48aeae147967f5e2715","category":"Environment"}
