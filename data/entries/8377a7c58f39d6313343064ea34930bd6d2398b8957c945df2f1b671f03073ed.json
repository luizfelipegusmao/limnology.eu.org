The functional trait composition of the neighbourhood could provide mechanistic insights into the effects of neighbours on the resource strategies of focal trees.\n\nIn this study, we deployed an automated high-frequency measurement of the sap flow density (SFD) and the radial growth of 48 trees of 12 species at BEF-China, a large-scale forest biodiversity manipulation experiment, to investigate the consequences and underlying mechanisms of the functional trait composition of the neighbourhood on the sap flow and radial growth of focal trees.\n\nWe found a positive relationship between SFD and growth, reflecting the important supportive role of sap flow in tree growth. High functional diversity (FD) of the neighbourhood depressed SFD but promoted growth when considering all species, and thus promoted water-use efficiency. Acquisitiveness of neighbouring trees positively affected growth, suggesting interspecific facilitation. Furthermore, neighbourhood FD benefits evergreen focal trees by promoting growth. However, in deciduous focal trees, neighbourhood FD reduced SFD but had no significant effects on growth.\n\nOur findings suggest that considering the functional trait composition of neighbourhood communities will support effective afforestation and forest management.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/06/19/find-the-right-neighbors-to-grow-fast-but-spend-less-water/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Yongqiang Zhang, \nYun‐Hao Bai, \nXia Chen, \nYanpei Guo, \nHong‐Tu Zhang, \nXuejiao Zhang, \nShan Li, \nBernhard Schmid, \nHelge Bruelheide, \nKeping Ma, \nZhiyao Tang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Functional Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d6d44f91b8c3d0319e19739e0c9e63f664582eafb34301dcbb8f144284121b6c","entryHash":"8377a7c58f39d6313343064ea34930bd6d2398b8957c945df2f1b671f03073ed","category":"Environment"}
