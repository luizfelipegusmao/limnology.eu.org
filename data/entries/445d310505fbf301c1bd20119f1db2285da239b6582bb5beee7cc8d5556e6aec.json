Whether exposure to harmful occupational agents impacts the survival of people with SAO is unknown. Our aim was to estimate the mortality risk associated with occupational exposures among people with SAO.</p> Methods <p>We used data from UK Biobank participants with SAO, defined as a ratio of forced expiratory volume in three seconds to forced expiratory volume in six seconds (FEV<sub>3</sub>/FEV<sub>6</sub>) below the lower limit of normal. We assigned lifetime occupational exposures to participants with available occupational histories using the ALOHA+ Job Exposure Matrix. Mortality data were provided by the National Death Registries. We used Cox regression to assess the association of all-cause mortality with lifetime occupational exposures (vapours, gases, dusts, fumes—VGDF; solvents; pesticides; metals), adjusting for potential confounders.</p> Results <p>The 13,942 participants with SAO had a mean age of 56±7 years, 59% were females and 94.2% were of White ancestry. Overall, there were 457 deaths over a median follow-up of 12.8 years. A greater mortality risk was associated with exposure to VGDF, with hazard ratios of 1.32 (95%CI: 1.04–1.78) for low levels and 1.41 (95%CI: 1.11–1.78) for moderate levels of cumulative exposure. There was no evidence of association for the other occupational exposures.</p> Conclusion <p>Lifetime occupational exposure to VGDF in people with SAO may have a detrimental effect on their survival. Future respiratory health surveillance programmes of people exposed to VGDF should consider assessment for SAO and focus on primary prevention through adequate exposure control.</p>","author":"Valentina Quintero-Santofimio","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"445d310505fbf301c1bd20119f1db2285da239b6582bb5beee7cc8d5556e6aec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
