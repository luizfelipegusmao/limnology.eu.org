{"title":"Multiple climatic drivers increase pace and consequences of ecosystem change in the Arctic Coastal Ocean","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lol2.10431?af=R","date":1726140245000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The impacts of climate change on Arctic marine systems are noticeable within the scientific “lifetime” of most researchers and the iconic image of a polar bear struggling to stay on top of a melting ice floe captures many of the dominant themes of Arctic marine ecosystem change. But has our focus on open-ocean systems and parameters that are more easily modeled and sensed remotely neglected an element that is responding more dramatically and with broader implications for Arctic ecosystems? We argue that a complementary set of changes to the open ocean is occurring along Arctic coasts, amplified by the interaction with changes on land and in the sea. We observe an increased number of ecosystem drivers with larger implications for the ecological and human communities they touch than are quantifiable in the open Arctic Ocean. Substantial knowledge gaps exist that must be filled to support adaptation and sustainability of socioecological systems along Arctic coasts.</p>","author":"Mikael K. Sejr, \nAmanda E.
