{"title":"Determination of Pressure Jump Dependence and Time Constants of Hydraulic Pumps with Constant Pressure and Variable Flow","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0093/v1","date":1727791620000,"content":"Simulations of the pump response time refer to the determination of the time constant of the transient process when the flow and pressure change. The changes mentioned in the standards are precisely defined and prescribed by the \"MIL-P-19692E\" norms. The simulation showed that the time constants are within the permissible limits prescribed by these norms. The diagram shows the responses for the considered pump and for the case when the flow changes from Qn to Qmin and changes from Qmin to Qn. The time constants t1 and t2 are defined on the diagrams, with the parameters that the pump has. In addition, the standards define the pressure jump that occurs during the transient process as well as time constants. From the flow change diagram, it can be seen that the flow change is also very fast and takes place in time intervals shorter than 0.1 s. By evaluating the size of the time constants, t1 and t2, it can be concluded that they have a value below 0.05 s, which meets the regulations in that area. Also, the size of the jump pressure meets the regulations because it is only 1.2 M Pa above the nominal pressure.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d60a734036ed19047fa955e2bcf2245986432fee54f5c441cbf86981ea9fdf18","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
