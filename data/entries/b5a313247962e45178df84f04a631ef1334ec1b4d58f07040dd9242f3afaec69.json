{"title":"Iron Metabolism in Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anemia: The influence of Genetic Modifiers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0167/v1","date":1719906771000,"content":"Iron metabolism plays a crucial role in the management of hemoglobinopathies, particularly in conditions such as Î²-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (SCA). This paper describes the mechanisms of iron overload in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT), non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), and SCA, highlighting the distinct paths leading to iron accumulation in each condition. The primary focus of this review article is on the role of genetic modifiers influencing iron metabolism and the variability in iron overload presentation among patients. Genetic mutations in genes such as HFE, HAMP, TFR2, SLC40A1, and others significantly impact iron regulation. These modifiers can exacerbate or ameliorate iron overload, and understanding these genetic factors is important for explaining the diverse disease severity and differences in the mechanism and clinical presentation of iron overload in these patients. The ongoing INHERENT study aims to further elucidate the influence of these genetic modifiers through a comprehensive genome-wide association study, potentially leading to novel therapeutic interventions for managing iron homeostasis in hemoglobinopathy patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b5a313247962e45178df84f04a631ef1334ec1b4d58f07040dd9242f3afaec69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
