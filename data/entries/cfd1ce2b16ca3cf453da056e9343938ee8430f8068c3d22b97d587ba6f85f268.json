The highly transformative processes involved in energy storage require that the materials remain stable and functional over a substantial span of operating temperatures and chemical potentials. All of these factors combined make these materials very attractive yet very complex objects of study. Advanced microscopy with its varied arsenal of techniques is a great match for the complexity of the energy storage phenomena.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"cfd1ce2b16ca3cf453da056e9343938ee8430f8068c3d22b97d587ba6f85f268","category":"Environment"}
