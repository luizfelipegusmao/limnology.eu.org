{"title":"Evaluation of distiller's dried grains with solubles in diets for Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, reared under pond conditions","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jwas.13033?af=R","date":1707993399000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Most studies evaluating the use of distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) to partially replace the use of soybean meal (SBM) in diets of shrimp <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> have been carried out under laboratory conditions, which has significant differences in terms of environmental and culture conditions with the out-door commercial pond. This study aims to extrapolate the laboratory trials into the out-door pond condition in order to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating DDGS at various levels (D0 (0%), D5 (5%), D10 (10%), and D 15 (15%)) to replace the use of SBM for 90-day culture period on the growth, body composition, total hemocyte count, lysozyme activity, and organoleptic characteristics of the shrimp. Seven hundred twenty shrimp (mean initial weight 1.06 ± 0.01 g) were randomly distributed into each of 40 net pens (3 × 2 × 1 per net pen) with 10 replicates per dietary treatment. The results showed an enhancement in biomass, mean weight, and thermal growth coefficient of shrimp fed with 5 and 10% inclusion levels of DDGS. Significant reduction of FCR was also observed with the use of 5 and 10% DDGS to partially replace SBM. There were no severe changes in the total hemocyte count (THC), lysozyme activity, color, aroma, and flavor of the shrimp. However, the texture of shrimp was significantly better with the use of 10 and 15% DDGS in the diet. In summary, regarding all the factors, DDGS is a promising alternative ingredient to replace the use of SBM with 5 and 10% inclusion levels and could modulate better growth, quality, and maintain the health condition of shrimp cultured in out-door pond conditions.</p>","author":"Romi Novriadi, \nVivi Endar Herawati, \nSlamet Budi Prayitno, \nSeto Windarto, \nRonnie Tan","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the World Aquaculture Society: Table of Contents","siteHash":"37af84d1672a7a0aed631ea0e96fc35b51a97e6d1b0636559e85b358a16c98a6","entryHash":"723f2a2edf6c862933ba1087cf41a580331959a7ba5a567fc262e4d45ade377f","category":"Environment"}
