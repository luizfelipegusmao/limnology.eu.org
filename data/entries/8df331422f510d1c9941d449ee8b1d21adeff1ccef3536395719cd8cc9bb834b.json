RNA editing involves C-to-U deaminations, affecting about 500 editing sites in mitochondria and 40 editing sites in plastids (<a href=\"#kiae056-B8\">Takenaka et al. 2013</a>). RNA editing is essential for restoring functional proteins and can potentially influence protein activity, localization, or proteinâ€“protein interaction (<a href=\"#kiae056-B7\">Small et al. 2023</a>). Remarkably, the lack of detected proteins corresponding to non-edited or partially edited transcripts suggests that RNA editing acts primarily as a repair mechanism rather than providing a regulatory advantage in plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"8df331422f510d1c9941d449ee8b1d21adeff1ccef3536395719cd8cc9bb834b","category":"Environment"}
