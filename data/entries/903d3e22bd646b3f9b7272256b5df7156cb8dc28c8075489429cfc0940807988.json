{"title":"Secure IoT communication: Implementing a One-Time-Pad Protocol with True Random Numbers and Secure Multiparty Sums","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1167/v1","date":1710861198000,"content":"The process of establishing secure communication between devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) can be approached by using a One-time-Pad (OTP) protocol. We propose using a known secure multiparty sum protocol for generating a One-time-Pad key using true (physical) random numbers in each device (party). We implemented the proposal using ZeroC-Ice, a middleware for distributed computing. The protocol security properties were analyzed under the assumptions of the Dolev-Yao threat model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"903d3e22bd646b3f9b7272256b5df7156cb8dc28c8075489429cfc0940807988","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
