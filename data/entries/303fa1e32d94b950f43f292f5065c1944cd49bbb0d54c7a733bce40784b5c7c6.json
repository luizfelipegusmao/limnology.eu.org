{"title":"Understanding Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Persistence: Mechanisms, Consequences and Implications for Cure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1996/v1","date":1724830416000,"content":"Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection carries a significant health burden worldwide. It is a leading cause of acute and chronic liver disease resulting in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This virus affects millions globally, and despite several medical advancements, research, and efforts to develop curative treatment, the persistence of HBV in infected individuals by cccDNA and integration pose formidable challenges. This review aims to provide a broad-based overview of HBV persistence, integration and the implications for chronic infection and tumorigenesis. By considering these points, we bring forth insights into the advancement of therapies that aim to disrupt the chronicity of HBV infection and improve clinical outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"303fa1e32d94b950f43f292f5065c1944cd49bbb0d54c7a733bce40784b5c7c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
