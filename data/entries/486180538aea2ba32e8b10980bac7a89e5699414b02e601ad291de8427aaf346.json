{"title":"Cuticular hydrocarbons as host recognition cues in specialist and generalist endoparasitoids","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00049-024-00410-9","date":1733011200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The chemical composition of cuticular hydrocarbons differs qualitatively and quantitatively among insect species. These differences convey species-specific information about host suitability to foraging parasitoids, enabling them to discriminate between the host and non-host species. Specialist parasitoids that parasitize fewer host species are predicted to use host-specific cues compared to generalists that have evolved to use common cues present in multiple potential host species. Here, we tested the above hypothesis by evaluating two parasitoids with varying levels of host specificity, <em>Microplitis croceipe</em>s (specialist) and <em>Cotesia marginive</em>ntris (generalist), for their responses to cuticular extracts of three caterpillar species, <em>Chloridea virescens</em>, <em>Helicoverpa zea</em>, and <em>Spodoptera exigua</em>. First, we compared the cuticular profiles of the three caterpillar species and found that <em>C. virescens</em> and <em>H. zea</em> were qualitatively similar in cuticular composition, whereas <em>S. exigua</em> differed qualitatively and quantitatively from the other two. In contact bioassays, both parasitoid species were behaviorally arrested by the host cuticular extracts, with specialist <em>M. croceipes</em> able to discriminate between the cuticular extracts of its host and non-host caterpillar species. Assessment with the coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD) revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in parasitoidsâ€™ antennal responses to the components of cuticular extracts of host species, with <em>M. croceipes</em> showing greater antennal response than generalist <em>C. marginiventris</em>. The data implicated 13-methylhentriacontane as a probable host-specific kairomone used by specialist <em>M. croceipes</em>. These results suggest that specialist parasitoids like <em>M. croceipes</em> may exploit the differences in the composition of cuticular chemicals of caterpillars as cues for host recognition and discrimination.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"486180538aea2ba32e8b10980bac7a89e5699414b02e601ad291de8427aaf346","category":"Environment"}
