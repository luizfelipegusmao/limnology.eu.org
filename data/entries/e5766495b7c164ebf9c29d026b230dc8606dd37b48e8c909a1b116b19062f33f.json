{"title":"The Influence of Tourism Nostalgia on Rural Pro-environmental Behaviors: Chain Mediation of Environmental Responsibility and Awe","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1743/v1","date":1711617503000,"content":"This study grounded in the Affective Events Theory, explores how post-pandemic urban residents' nostalgic tourism influences environmental behaviors in rural areas. The article constructs a model of pro-environmental behavior in rural settings with nostalgic tourism as the antecedent variable, environmental responsibility and awe as mediators, ecological concern as a moderating variable, and pro-environmental behavior as the outcome variable. Analyzing 535 valid survey responses from urban residents and utilizing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test research hypotheses reveals that nostalgic tourism significantly impacts environmental responsibility and awe.\nEnvironmental responsibility mediates between nostalgic tourism and pro-environmental behavior, forming a serial mediation chain with awe psychology, and its mediating effect is significant. However, awe psychology forms a serial mediation chain between nostalgic tourism and pro-environmental behavior, and its mediating effect is insignificant. Notably, environmental concern does not moderate the relationship between environmental responsibility and pro-environmental behavior, indicating no support for this hypothesis. The positive role of nostalgic tourism in pro-environmental behavior at rural tourism destinations enriches theoretical research on the nexus between nostalgia and environmental behavior, providing insights into the sustainable development of rural environments and the operation of rural tourism.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e5766495b7c164ebf9c29d026b230dc8606dd37b48e8c909a1b116b19062f33f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
