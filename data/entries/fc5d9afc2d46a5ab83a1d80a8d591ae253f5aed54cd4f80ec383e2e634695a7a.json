A recent study published in <span>Cell</span> shows that lactate-induced lactylation of the homologous recombination (HR) protein meiotic recombination 11 results in HR hyperactivation and chemoresistance in cancer cells, establishing a previously unrecognized link between cellular metabolism and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair and providing new insights into how altered glucose metabolism can impact DNA damage response in cancer.</strong></span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"fc5d9afc2d46a5ab83a1d80a8d591ae253f5aed54cd4f80ec383e2e634695a7a","category":"Environment"}
