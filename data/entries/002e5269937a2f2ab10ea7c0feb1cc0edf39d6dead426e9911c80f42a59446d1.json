{"title":"The Effect of Sundarbans Honey vs Energy Drinks on Exercise, Fatigue, and Antioxidant Defense via NRF2/HO-1 Pathway – An Experiment in Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1297/v1","date":1721110872000,"content":"Excessive oxidative stress and exercise-induced fatigue reduce physical performance and can lead to dysfunction in antioxidant systems within muscular and hepatic tissues. Integrating natural substances with exercise may mitigate fatigue via anti-oxidant effects. This study aims to compare and evaluate the effects of exercise and supplementation with Sundarbans honey vs energy drinks on the strength, anxiety physiological profiles, and hepatic antioxidant capacity in mice undergoing extraneous exercise and fatigue. Forty-eight four-week-old Swiss albino mice were randomly assigned to one of eight groups: (1) Control, (2) Speed™ (Sp), (3) Royal Tiger™ (RT), (4) Sundarbans Honey (SH), (5) Exercise (Ex), (6) Exercise + Sundarbans Honey (Ex+SH), (7) Exercise + Speed™ (Ex+Sp), and (8) Exercise + Royal Tiger™ (Ex+RT). Supplements were administered via oral gavage: Sp (2.5 ml/kg BW), RT (2.5 ml/kg BW), and SH (1 g/kg BW), four times a week for 60 days. Mice in the Ex, Ex+SH, Ex+Sp, and Ex+RT groups underwent daily swimming and running. The strength, fatigue, anxiety levels, lipid profiles, and antioxidant biomarkers were evaluated post-treatment. The SH, Ex, and Ex+SH groups exhibited significantly enhanced physical performance (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"002e5269937a2f2ab10ea7c0feb1cc0edf39d6dead426e9911c80f42a59446d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
