Frame-to-frame resolution analysis provides an opportunity to resolve nuances in microstructural feature evolution unachievable by classical human-counting methods. In this work, we explore the localized impact of grain boundary (GB) defect sinks and their ability to modulate defect microstructure in a radiation condition. Temporally resolved defect density measurements are enabled by YOLOv5 deep learning object detection models.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c7510e0857f7706f5187dc858d31d45824fb4bda9937c5d9834ff18bfcf7c90f","category":"Environment"}
