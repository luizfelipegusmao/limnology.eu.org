The health and biological benefits of <i>P. radix</i> have been found across various diseases. The utilization of umbilical cord stromal stem cells, derived from Wharton's jelly of the human umbilical cord, has emerged as a promising approach for treating degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, growing evidence indicates that the function of stem cells declines with age, thereby limiting their regenerative capacity. The primary objective in this study is to investigate the beneficial effects of <i>P. radix</i> in senescent stem cells. We conducted experiments to showcase that diminished levels of Lamin B1 and Sox-2, along with an elevation in p21, which serve as indicative markers for the senescent stem cells. Our findings revealed the loss of Lamin B1 and Sox-2, coupled with an increase in p21, in umbilical cord stromal stem cells subjected to a low-dose (0.1 μM) doxorubicin (Dox) stimulation. However, <i>P. radix</i> restored the Dox-damage in the umbilical cord stromal stem cells. <i>P. radix</i> reversed the senescent conditions when the umbilical cord stromal stem cells exposed to Dox-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential are significantly changed. In Dox-challenged aged umbilical cord stromal stem cells, <i>P. radix</i> reduced senescence, increased longevity, prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS and protected against senescence-associated apoptosis. This study suggests that <i>P. radix</i> might be as a therapeutic and rescue agent for the aging effect in stem cells. Inhibition of cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction and aging-associated ROS with <i>P. radix</i> provides additional insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>","author":"Pei‐Ying Lee, \nMaria Angelina Sitorus, \nChia‐Hua Kuo, \nBruce Chi‐Kang Tsai, \nWei‐Wen Kuo, \nKuan‐Ho Lin, \nShang‐Yeh Lu, \nYueh‐Min Lin, \nTsung‐Jung Ho, \nChih‐Yang Huang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"879b29dd581cd596a557b2715be6b6e0ecc65b705f8eef9fa5d255722b16f15c","category":"Environment"}
