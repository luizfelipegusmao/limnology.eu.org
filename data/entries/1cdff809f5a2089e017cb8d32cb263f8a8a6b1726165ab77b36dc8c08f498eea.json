{"title":"Assessment of Long-Term Water Absorption on Thermal, Mor-Phological and Mechanical Properties of Polypropylene-Based Composites With Agro-Waste Fillers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0967/v1","date":1720776280000,"content":"Agro-waste fibres for polymer composite reinforcement have gained increased interest in industry and academia as a more sustainable alternative to synthetic fibres. However, natural fibre composites (NFC) hygroscopicity is still an issue that needs to be solved. This work investigates how prolonged exposure to water affects the properties of the polypropylene (PP)--based injection moulded composites reinforced with different contents of rice husk (rh) and olive pit (op) fibres. Both rh and op composites became more hydrophilic with increased fibre charge due to the affinity of cellulose and hemicellulose OH groups. Meanwhile, lignin contributes to the protection of the composites from thermo-oxidative degradation caused by water immersion. The PPrh composites had a higher saturation water content of 1.47% (20 wt.% rh) and 2.38 (30 wt.% rh) in comparison to PPop composites with absorption of 1.13% (20 wt.% op) and 1.59% (30 wt.% op). Tensile elastic modulus has slightly increased, at the cost of increased saturated composites' rigidity, in composites with 30% rh and op fibre content (up to 13%) while marginally decreasing (down to 8%) in PP30%op compared to unsaturated counterparts. A similar trend was observed for the flexural modulus, enhanced up to 18%. However, rh and op composites with 30% fibre content ruptured in bending, highlighting their fragility after hydrolytic ageing.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1cdff809f5a2089e017cb8d32cb263f8a8a6b1726165ab77b36dc8c08f498eea","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
