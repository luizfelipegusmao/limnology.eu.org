Parasitoids, mainly Hymenoptera and Diptera, are among the most diverse and important natural enemies of caterpillars in these forests. However, due to their cryptic lifestyle and taxonomic difficulties, we lack knowledge on the impact of insecticide applications on complex host-parasitoid networks.\n\nIn a large-scale field experiment, we tested the effect of spraying the lepidopteran-specific insecticide Mimic (tebufenozide) on the abundance and community composition of both adult and larval parasitoids. We combined morphological identification, DNA barcoding and metabarcoding to identify parasitoids adult or inside caterpillars, both sampled by canopy fogging during an outbreak and two subsequent years. We analysed the abundance of parasitoids, community composition and network specialisation using statistical methods that account for sample incompleteness in host-parasitoid data.\n\nFor adult parasitoid assemblages, we found strong annual effects on abundance, with highest numbers of adult parasitoids occurring in the outbreak year, as well as on annual changes in community composition, but no effect linked to insecticide application. However, the abundance and species number of immature parasitoids revealed negative effects of insecticide application, while community composition was only affected by annual variation.\n\nCoverage-based network analyses showed a reduction of taxonomic network diversity and network specialisation associated with insecticide application in the first 2 years.\n\n<i>Synthesis and applications</i>: This real-world experiment shows that parasitoid populations respond immediately to large-scale outbreaks but only limited to local disturbances. Results indicate that this group of natural enemies exhibits high mobility, enabling them to track host populations across large spatial scales. However, our observation of reduced network specialisation after insecticide application is a warning signal that ecosystem function, and consequently natural pest control services, may be impaired by human interference at the local stand scale.\n</p>","author":"Marina Wolz, \nAmelie Höcherl, \nJeremy Hübner, \nHans‐Peter Tschorsnig, \nDaniel Whitmore, \nBenjamin M.
