{"title":"Assessment of Multifunctional Activity of a Postbiotic Preparation Derived from Lactobacillus paracasei Postbio-P6","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0186/v1","date":1714722562000,"content":"Postbiotic is a preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host. Different bacterial strain and preparation method result in different functions. Herein, a postbiotic preparation named Postbiotic-P by intercepting 1-5 KD of the cell-free supernatants of L. caseiparacasei P6 fermentation broth was prepared, and its multifunctional activities were evaluated. The results showed that Postbiotic-P exerted good antihemolytic (10%-50% Postbiotic-P resulted in 4.9%-48.1% antihemolytic rate), anti-inflammatory (8% to 40% Postbiotic-P is comparable to 259.1-645.4 Î¼g/mL of diclofenac sodium equivalents), antioxidant [reducing power (1.25%-12.5% Postbiotic-P resulted in the increase of OD700 from 0.279-2.322), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (2.5%-50% Postbiotic-P resulted in 38.9%-92.4% free radical scavenging rate), and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (0.5%-4% Postbiotic-P resulted in 4.66%-10.38% hydroxyl radical scavenging rate)], and antimicrobial activities (against 2 Gram-positive, 8 Gram-negative and 1 fungus). Furthermore, it was proved that Postbiotic-P could significantly inhibit the increase of the peroxide value and the malondialdehyde content in cookies, indicating the application potential of Postbiotic-P in food preservation. Taken together, Postbiotic-P has good application potential for the development of health care products and functional foods. However, further studies are needed to determine their precise mechanism of action, to clarify the active components responsible for the function, and to validate the biological activities in animal models or clinical trials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a5bdd736b7e85c9be4698e72e8678650971858366a23e94be0c8ca8c7ffc2272","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
