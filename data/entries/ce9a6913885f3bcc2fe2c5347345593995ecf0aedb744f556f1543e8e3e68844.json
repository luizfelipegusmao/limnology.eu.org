{"title":"Quantum Dynamics under Gravitational Potential; Insights from Gravitational-Redshift","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0393/v2","date":1712646191000,"content":"This short paper briefly explores the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity, drawing from the principle of gravitational redshift and bringing it into quantum mechanical frameworks. The exploration basically modifies quantum mechanical relations and equations such as Planck-Einstein relation, De-Broglieâ€™s relation and the relativistic wave equations, accounting for the presence of gravitational fields through gravitational redshifts and the effect of gravitational potential on the quantum states of fields and particles. The general idea presented in this paper is conceptually similar to what we know as QFT in Curved Space-time, but is not entirely on based the same formulation. This paper also presents a reformulation of the mass-energy equivalence in the context of gravitational potential and redshift.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce9a6913885f3bcc2fe2c5347345593995ecf0aedb744f556f1543e8e3e68844","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
