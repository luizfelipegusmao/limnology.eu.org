This qualitative research explores the effectiveness of SRM tools in optimizing procurement processes, mitigating risks, and fostering collaborative partnerships with suppliers. The study employs semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in diverse e-commerce sectors to gather insights into the implementation and outcomes of SRM tools. Findings reveal that technological advancements, including AI, blockchain, and data analytics, facilitate real-time communication, decision-making, and supply chain visibility, thereby enabling organizations to achieve cost savings and operational efficiencies. Enhanced supplier relationships through SRM tools contribute to collaborative innovation, faster product development cycles, and improved customer satisfaction. However, challenges such as technological complexity, regulatory compliance, and supplier resistance necessitate strategic management and investment in cybersecurity and compliance frameworks. The research underscores the importance of executive sponsorship, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement in driving successful SRM implementations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe0b6958bc0e8893a50abd5004f1f3d9ae22692dbdc02840488a94161234d0cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
