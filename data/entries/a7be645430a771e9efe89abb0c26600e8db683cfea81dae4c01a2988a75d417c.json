{"title":"Validation of Ground Based Solar Irradiance Measurements against Meteosat-Msg and Himawari-8 Satellite Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1074/v1","date":1715853317000,"content":"The study conducts a comparative analysis of solar radiation estimation methods, assessing the efficacy of the Heliosat-2 algorithm against ground measurements across seven distinct countries: Netherlands, Spain, Japan, Namibia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and India. To achieve this, it utilizes two distinct satellite data sources—Himawari-8 for Japan and Metosat Second Generation-MSG for the rest of the countries—spanning the years Jan 2022 to April 2024. A robust methodology for determining albedo parameters specific to Heliosat-2 was developed. During cloudy days, the estimates provided by Heliosat-2 generally exceeded the ground measurements in all the countries. Conversely, on clear days, there was a tendency for underestimation, as indicated by the median value of the mean bias (MB) across most of the countries. The Heliosat-2 model slightly underestimates daily radiation values, with a median MB ranging from −27.5 to +10.2 W.m⁻². Notably, the median root mean squared error (RMSE) on clear days is significantly lower, with values ranging from 24.8 to 108.7 W.m⁻², compared to cloudy days where RMSE values lie between 75.3 and 180.2 W.m⁻². In terms of R² values, both satellites show a strong correlation between the estimated and actual values, with a median value consistently above 0.86 on a monthly scale and over 92% of daily data points falling within ±2 standard deviation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a7be645430a771e9efe89abb0c26600e8db683cfea81dae4c01a2988a75d417c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
