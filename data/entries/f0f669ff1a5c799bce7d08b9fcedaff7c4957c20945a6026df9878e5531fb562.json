{"title":"The tree peony DREB transcription factor PrDREB2D regulates seed α-linolenic acid accumulation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/195/1/745/7607900?rss=1","date":1707868800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>α-Linolenic acid (ALA), an essential fatty acid (FA) for human health, serves as the precursor of 2 nutritional benefits, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, and can only be obtained from plant foods. We previously found that phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (PrPDAT2) derived from ALA-rich tree peony (<span>Paeonia rockii</span>) can promote seed ALA accumulation. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying its promoting effect on ALA accumulation remains unknown. Here, we revealed a tree peony dehydration-responsive element binding transcription factor, PrDREB2D, as an upstream regulator of <span>PrPDAT2</span>, which is involved in regulating seed ALA accumulation. Our findings demonstrated that PrDREB2D serves as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator that directly activates <span>PrPDAT2</span> expression. PrDREB2D altered the FA composition in transient overexpression <span>Nicotiana benthamiana</span> leaves and stable transgenic Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) seeds. Repressing <span>PrDREB2D</span> expression in <span>P. rockii</span> resulted in decreased <span>PrPDAT2</span> expression and ALA accumulation. In addition, PrDREB2D strengthened its regulation of ALA accumulation by recruiting the cofactor ABA-response element binding factor PrABF2b. Collectively, the study findings provide insights into the mechanism of seed ALA accumulation and avenues for enhancing ALA yield via biotechnological manipulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"f0f669ff1a5c799bce7d08b9fcedaff7c4957c20945a6026df9878e5531fb562","category":"Environment"}
