Currently, the effects of motor interventions for muscle strengthening in people with ALS are unclear. This review intends to analyze the effects of motor interventions for muscle strengthening in individuals with ALS</p> Methods and analysis <p>Randomized, non-randomized, and quasi-experimental clinical trials assessing individuals with ALS of both sexes, aged 18 years or older, who have received motor interventions for muscle strengthening considering all practices that can lead to increased strength, endurance, power and muscular hypertrophy will be included. No restriction on language, location, or publication date will be applied. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), SPORTDiscus, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases will be searched. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the reference lists of included studies will also be searched. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts and extract data from included studies. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed by the PEDro scale and the certainty of the evidence by the GRADE approach. Disagreements will be resolved by a third researcher. Findings will be presented in text and table formats. A meta-analysis will compare the effects of motor interventions for muscle strengthening versus placebo or other interventions.</p>","author":"Aline Alves de Souza","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ce55b14820adf96fdd38f325e113e01a0e3294c1574abdcbb6d996dacd1ec9c3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
