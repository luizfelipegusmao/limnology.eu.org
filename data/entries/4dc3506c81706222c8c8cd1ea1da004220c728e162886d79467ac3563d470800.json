{"title":"Hemocytes from neonates of Biomphalaria glabrata are functionally less mature than those from adult snails","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ivb.12416?af=R","date":1712127600000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Gastropod molluscs, which serve as obligatory intermediate hosts for digenetic trematodes, possess an internal defense system (IDS) consisting of phagocytic hemocytes and plasma factors. This IDS is responsible for resistance to infection with larval trematodes, which are encapsulated and killed by hemocytes in incompatible snails. Like other physiological systems, the IDS probably undergoes maturation during early stages of life, and the relatively undeveloped state of the IDS in young snails has been hypothesized to be a factor in their increased susceptibility to infection with larval trematodes. In this study, hemocytes were examined in the BS-90 laboratory strain of <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i> that is resistant to infection with <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> as adults but susceptible to infection as neonates. Compared with hemocytes from adults, hemocytes from neonates had a smaller perimeter and lower intrinsic directional motility on glass microscope slides. Additionally, in vitro assays showed a lower association with fucoidan-linked polystyrene beads and less ability to produce superoxide anion in hemocytes from neonates compared to hemocytes from adults. These results support the hypothesis that the gastropod IDS undergoes maturation during growth. However, whether the observed differences between hemocytes of neonatal and adult BS-90 snails play a role in the susceptibility of the former and resistance of the latter to infection with <i>S. mansoni</i> is not known.</p>","author":"John T.
