{"title":"Optimizing Potato Yield through the Application of the Supporter Biostimulant","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1188/v1","date":1716155953000,"content":"Seed potato treatment is vital for plant protection, yield enhancement, and product quality. In the conducted research, the plant biostimulator Supporter was applied to evaluate its impact on potato yields. Field studies were conducted in Northeastern, Northwestern, Western, and Southwest Poland from 2015 to 2017, using a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement. The use of seed treatment technology with the Supporter product resulted in increased overall and commercial potato yields and improved yield tuber structure compared to traditional cultivation methods without tuber treatment before planting. Conclusion: The application of the plant biostimulator Supporter in seed potato treatment technology brings significant benefits, including, increased potato yield and improved yield structure. The cultivation location significantly influences potato yield and tuber structure. Understanding these differences can aid in better adapting cultivation practices and selecting varieties to specific local conditions, potentially leading to increased potato crop productivity. In terms of efficiency and yield quality, further research into its application in agricultural practice is recommended, which may contribute to further increasing potato production efficiency and quality. Developing more ecological and efficient farming practices can help meet society's growing food needs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74e114888af2bc068d87134014d06e64aaff407ab9129dd9288dc14d348aacce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
