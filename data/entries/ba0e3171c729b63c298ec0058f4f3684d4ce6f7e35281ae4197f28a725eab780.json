{"title":"Super-Dosing of Bacterial Phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) in Laying Hens&rsquo; Diets","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1469/v1","date":1726717390000,"content":"Despite the acknowledged advancements in the utilization of phytase super dosing, limited research has been conducted on commercial laying hens. To assess the effectiveness of superdoses of exogenous phytase, a total of 320 laying hens aged between 44 and 64 weeks were utilized. These hens were divided into five treatments, which were then distributed using a completely randomized design with eight replicates, each containing eight birds. The treatments consisted of phytase supplementation levels of 0, 500, 1000, 1500, and 3000 FTU/kg. Quadratic regression equations were utilized to determine the maximum and minimum values for the levels of phytase supplementation. A significant difference was observed in the levels of phytase supplementation, where a quadratic model was fitted to various variables including egg weight (g), egg mass (g/bird/day), feed conversion per egg mass (g/g), yolk concentration (%), albumen concentration (%), shell thickness (Î¼m), shell strength (kgf), specific gravity, yolk color, and also an increased supplementation improved the digestive tract of the hens, thereby providing a better villus: crypt ratio. Considering the advantageous effects of phytase super dosing, it is recommended to supplement corn and soybean meal-based diets with 1500 FTU/kg of bacterial phytase for laying hens during the 44 to 64 weeks of production period.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ba0e3171c729b63c298ec0058f4f3684d4ce6f7e35281ae4197f28a725eab780","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
