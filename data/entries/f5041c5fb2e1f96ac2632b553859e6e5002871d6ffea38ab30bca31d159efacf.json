{"title":"Digital Communication: From School to Society","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1452/v1","date":1718887300000,"content":"In this work we offer a broad overview of the combination of digital communication, education and society and show the link between learning with digital and awakening to the future. We trace the effects of digital communication acquired during postgraduate training at the Universidade Aberta of Portugal by professionals from African Portuguese-speaking countries. From a methodological point of view, the study identifies former postgraduate students at the Universidade Aberta (Public University of Higher Education) over the last five years who were given a comprehensive questionnaire aimed at finding out how the training they underwent contributed to gauging their current levels of application of digital communication in their current profession. We found that digital communication in learning and its diversification acts as a lever for personal and professional development following the acquisition of academic knowledge.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5041c5fb2e1f96ac2632b553859e6e5002871d6ffea38ab30bca31d159efacf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
