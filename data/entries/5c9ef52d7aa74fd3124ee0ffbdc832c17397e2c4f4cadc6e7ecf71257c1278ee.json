{"title":"Lignocellulosic Residues from Fruit Trees: Availability, Characterization, and Energetic Potential Valorization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0144/v1","date":1714701798000,"content":"Reducing the carbon footprint of energy production is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. Lignocellulosic biomass residues from fruit production industries show promise as a viable energy source. This paper presents a study of the Italian context concerning the utilization of orchard lignocellulosic residues for energy production as electricity or bioethanol. The potential of various orchard residues was assessed through chemical and physical analysis, and an equivalent electrical energy of about 6441.62 GWh or an amount of 0.48 Mt/y of bioethanol was obtained based on the average annual dry residue mass availability of about 3.04 Mt/y. These data represent the 9.30% of the national electrical energy production from renewable sources, as well as the 6.21% of the Italian demand for gasoline in 2022. Electricity generation from these residues shown its potential as a reliable and sustainable baseload power source, as well as source of renewable transportation fuel. The studied process could be a valuable reference to expand these concepts on global scale to achieve a greener and more sustainable energy future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5c9ef52d7aa74fd3124ee0ffbdc832c17397e2c4f4cadc6e7ecf71257c1278ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
