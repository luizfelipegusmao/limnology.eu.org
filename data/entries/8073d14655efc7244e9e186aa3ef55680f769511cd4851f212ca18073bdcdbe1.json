Here, we generated microsatellite data from adults, recruits, settlers and planktonic larvae of the brown mussel, <i>Perna perna</i>, from the southeast coast of South Africa, and identified a consistent mismatch in genetic structure between the adults and all earlier life stages. While adults could be assigned to two major geographical groups (western and eastern), most of the early-stage mussels were strongly affiliated with the eastern group. This suggests that few of the early-stage individuals present in the western portion of the sampling range will eventually establish themselves in the adult population, highlighting the importance of post-recruitment processes as drivers of population structure. Our findings caution against the exclusive use of genetic data generated from adults to assess population connectivity facilitated by the dispersal of planktonic propagules.</p>","author":"Jody‐Carynn Oliver, \nFrancesca Porri, \nArsalan Emami‐Khoyi, \nPeter R.
