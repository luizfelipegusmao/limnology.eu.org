{"title":"Influencing Pedagogy through Value-Based Business Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2578/v1","date":1722480818000,"content":"The intersection of pedagogy and business models offers a compelling framework for enhancing educational outcomes through strategic innovation and operational efficiency. This is the first study that explores integrating value-based business models into pedagogy, proposing four models: Value Positioning (critical thinking, AI-oriented), Value Delivery (actionable thinking, inquiry-oriented), Value Capture (analytical thinking, sustainability-oriented), and Value Propo-sition (creative thinking, project-oriented). These models aim to foster student engagement, op-timize resource allocation, and drive institutional growth, aligning educational objectives with market demands to prepare learners for future workforce challenges. For instance, Business An-alytics courses, under the Value Delivery category, emphasize actionable thinking. It secures low to middle-level jobs but lacking global decision-making power in value positioning for Finland and the UK. Integrating principles of customer-centric design, continuous improvement, and competitive differentiation, educational leaders can create responsive and impactful learning environments. Value-based business models enhance educational practices by providing a structured and quantifiable approach to improving teaching and learning outcomes. A symbiotic relationship between pedagogical theories and business strategies can lead to innovative educa-tional practices, improved student graduation outcomes, and sustainable success for institutions and countries. This alignment ensures educational programs remain relevant to current market needs and adaptable to future challenges and opportunities.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ab9ce9db0e2f36cb9ad1e1e4e30b25b3582137a23ac518aa9c9dac527444c397","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
