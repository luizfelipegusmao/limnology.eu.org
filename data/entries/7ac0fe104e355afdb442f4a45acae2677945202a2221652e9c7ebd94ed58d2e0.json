{"title":"Identifying Sample Provenance From SEM/EDS Automated Particle Analysis via Few-Shot Learning Coupled With Similarity Graph Clustering","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/4/741/7724952?rss=1","date":1722384000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Automated particle analysis (APA) provides a vast amount of compositional data via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy along with size and shape data via scanning electron microscopy for individual particles in a sample. In many instances, APA data are leveraged to support identification of the source of a sample based on the detection of particles of a specific composition. Often, the particles that provide context make up a minuscule portion of the sample. Additionally, the interpretation of complex samples can be difficult due to the diversity of compositions both in the mixture and within a particle. In this work, we demonstrate a method to compute and cluster similarity graphs that describe inter-particle relationships within a sample using a multi-modal few-shot learning neural network. As a proof-of-concept, we show that samples known to have been exposed to gunshot residue can be distinguished from samples occasionally mistaken for gunshot residue. Our workflow builds upon standard APA techniques and data processing methods to unveil additional information in a readily interpretable and quantitatively comparable format.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7ac0fe104e355afdb442f4a45acae2677945202a2221652e9c7ebd94ed58d2e0","category":"Environment"}
