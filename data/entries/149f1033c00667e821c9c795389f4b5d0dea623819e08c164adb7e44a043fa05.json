{"title":"Role of DHA in a Physicochemical Study of a Model Membrane of Grey Matter","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1880/v1","date":1729758470000,"content":"In this study, we present a multicomponent lipid model membrane composed of six lipids, in-cluding cholesterol, which represent the structure of neuronal membranes found in grey matter. To our knowledge, no previous studies have attempted a model like this. We constructed our model membranes using an esterified form of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid found in grey matter: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It is the most prevalent fatty acid in the brain and is essential for maintaining cellular structural integrity, acting as a major phospholipid in neural membranes. The aim of this work is to analyse the effects that different proportions of DHA have on the proposed membrane model. For this purpose, transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential, and molecular acoustics were used. The results showed differences that may be attributable to the influence DHA has on the nanodomains of sphingomyelin and cholesterol.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"149f1033c00667e821c9c795389f4b5d0dea623819e08c164adb7e44a043fa05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
