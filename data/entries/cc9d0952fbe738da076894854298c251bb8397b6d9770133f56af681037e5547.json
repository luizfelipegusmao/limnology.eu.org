{"title":"EMFSA: Emoji-based multifeature fusion sentiment analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310715","date":1726754400000,"content":"<p>by Hongmei Tang, Wenzhong Tang, Dixiongxiao Zhu, Shuai Wang, Yanyang Wang, Lihong Wang</p>\r\n\r\nShort texts on social platforms often suffer from insufficient emotional semantic expressions, sparse features, and polysemy. To enhance the accuracy achieved by sentiment analysis for short texts, this paper proposes an emoji-based multifeature fusion sentiment analysis model (EMFSA). The model mines the sentiments of emojis, topics, and text features. Initially, a pretraining method for feature extraction is employed to enhance the semantic expressions of emotions in text by extracting contextual semantic information from emojis. Following this, a sentiment- and emoji-masked language model is designed to prioritize the masking of emojis and words with implicit sentiments, focusing on learning the emotional semantics contained in text. Additionally, we proposed a multifeature fusion method based on a cross-attention mechanism by determining the importance of each word in a text from a topic perspective. Next, this method is integrated with the original semantic information of emojis and the enhanced text features, attaining improved sentiment representation accuracy for short texts. Comparative experiments conducted with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves accuracy improvements of 2.3%, 10.9%, and 2.7%, respectively, validating its effectiveness.","author":"Hongmei Tang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cc9d0952fbe738da076894854298c251bb8397b6d9770133f56af681037e5547","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
