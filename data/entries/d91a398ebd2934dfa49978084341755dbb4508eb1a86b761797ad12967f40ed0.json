{"title":"Smart Cities Governance: Governance Models for Sustainable Smart Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1481/v1","date":1718950247000,"content":"The influence of technology corporations on the development of smart cities can generate corporate-centric models of governance. Thus, it is relevant to examine which governance models help to promote sustainability. Based on a rapid review on the governance of smart cities, this paper aims to evaluate the merits and drawbacks of various governance models adopted by diverse smart city initiatives. It contends that top-down models often prioritize corporate-centric governance structures, potentially neglecting sustainability concerns. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that top-down approaches can mitigate corporate-centric tendencies by integrating citizen participation into their visions and strategies. Hybrid models offer the advantage of governmental leadership but may lean towards a triple-helix model, with limited citizen involvement. Conversely, bottom-up models represent quadruple-helix collaborations with active citizen engagement.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d91a398ebd2934dfa49978084341755dbb4508eb1a86b761797ad12967f40ed0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
