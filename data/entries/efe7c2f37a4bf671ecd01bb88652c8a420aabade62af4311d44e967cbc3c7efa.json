Methods: We performed enzyme-linked immunoassays using a human MUC5AC kit (NBP2-76703) in serum samples obtained from The Ohio State Uni-versity biorepository (between January 2010 and June 2021). Univariate (UV) and multivariate (MV) Cox regression models were used to quantify progression-free survival (PFS); clinical and pathological variables were adjusted in the MV models. UV logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the association of sMUC5AC with pathological features and survival. Results: Overall, 23 samples (19 FOLFIRINOX, 3 gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, 1 FOLFOX) were available for analysis. The median age was 66 years, and 52% were females. sMUC5AC was associated with a) treatment response, margin status, and residual disease (R0 vs. R1/R2) (all P","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"efe7c2f37a4bf671ecd01bb88652c8a420aabade62af4311d44e967cbc3c7efa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
