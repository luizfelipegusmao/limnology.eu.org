{"title":"Optical Rectennas -A Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1932/v1","date":1727229616000,"content":"With the ever-growing geopolitical tensions across borders arising, ultimately from the eternal energy needs, it is the peak time for humanity to put its reliance on a more quasi-perpetuity source of energy, such as the Sun. Even though current photovoltaics are the frontier of solar power harvesting, their efficiencies are reaching a state of stasis sooner or later. The efficiencies of single-junction solar cells are capped by the Shockley-Quiesser limit of 33.7%. Researchers are racing toward a way to beat this limit while keeping the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCE) to its minimum. Amongst all contenders, rectenna (or rectifying antenna), which was invented only a decade after the first practical PV cell by the Bells lab [1], is the most promising technology to take the forefront in quenching the energy needs, not only because of the absence of any such theoretical limit but also a lower cost of production. This report will review three state-of-the-art architectures for optical rectification developed by the leading groups worldwide. The review will compile a concise discussion on Metal-Double-Insulator-Metal diodes, CNT-Insulator-Metal diodes, and Point-contact-Metal-Insulator-Metal diodes, with an elaborative focus on their fabrication methods and results obtained.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d8f9c7ae71f0eeef42db3f7e129b3027e720e9fe4c94b17ff3907566cef1e2e5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
