It explores various ways to implement SPV technology in building and infrastructure design, and outlines the advantages, such as improved daylighting, thermal regulation, and energy efficiency. The analysis also considers how SPV integration affects energy and exergy performance, emphasizing its role in achieving net-zero energy buildings. Additionally, the article identifies existing research gaps, providing guidance for future studies and practical applications in the building sector.</p>","author":"Neha Gupta","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"b28fb26331cde729ae73c977769fdcaa6768b42565392c9d219342e8c7b880ff","entryHash":"c556262622fc9be6bf9469604f1378dc886f97941f779faf3d88a0f3520d0fb6","category":"Environment"}
