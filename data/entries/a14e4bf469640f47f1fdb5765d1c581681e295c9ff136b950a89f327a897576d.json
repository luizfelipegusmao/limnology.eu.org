{"title":"TEM Preparation and Characterization of a GeTe-based Phase Change Memory Device at Partial SET Mode","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.607/7719624?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Phase change memory (PCM) uses the resistance difference between amorphous and crystalline states in phase change materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.607-B1\">1</a>], such as Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> and GeTe. Between these two materials, GeTe films are a good alternative to Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> because of GeTe’s growth-dominated crystallization mode [<a href=\"#ozae044.607-B2\">2</a>] and Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>’s large cycle-to-cycle variability [<a href=\"#ozae044.607-B3\">3</a>]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques can elucidate the crystallization modes in GeTe-based PCM devices at 100 nm scale. However, careful specimen preparation of PCM devices is critical as the phase change layer is susceptible to ion beam damage [<a href=\"#ozae044.607-B4\">4</a>]. We previously showed Ga focused ion beam (FIB) preparation with post-FIB Ar milling of TEM specimens [<a href=\"#ozae044.607-B5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.607-B6\">6</a>], but specimens prepared by a Xe plasma FIB (pFIB) followed by concentrated Ar ion milling constitutes new work. Producing electron-transparent TEM specimens using a Xe pFIB deviates from the standard Ga FIB method due to the relatively large Xe beam and its wide beam tails [<a href=\"#ozae044.607-B7\">7</a>]. Here, we describe post-pFIB polishing by concentrated Ar ion milling of TEM specimens prepared using a Xe pFIB for controlled specimen thinning, which resulted in high quality specimens without Xe damage. Consequently, the growth dominated crystallization mechanism in GeTe-based, mushroom-type, PCM devices at partial SET state is revealed. By leaving the device in partial SET mode, crystallization of the initially amorphous areas formed during RESET programming in the GeTe layer is gradually controlled with the tunable intermediate electrical resistance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a14e4bf469640f47f1fdb5765d1c581681e295c9ff136b950a89f327a897576d","category":"Environment"}
