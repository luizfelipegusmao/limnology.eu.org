{"title":"Aluminum-Based Plasmonic Photodetector for Sensing Applications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1645/v1","date":1714031538000,"content":"Plasmonic sensors have great potential for widespread usage, but the prohibitive cost of noble metals restrains the wider adoption of this technology. The aim of our study is to develop a cost-effective Al-based alternative to plasmonic detectors commonly based on noble metals. We considered a structure that consists of a Si p-n junction with an overlying grating-relief aluminum layer. The investigation of the infrared plasmonic resonance dependency on the structure geometric parameters and optimization of the fabrication process allowed us to determine optimal parameters for photodetection enhancement. The resonance photoresponse of optimized aluminum-based plasmon-polariton photodetector was significantly improved and became comparable to noble metal-based analogs. Our results can be used for the creation of cost-effective high-sensitivity plasmonic sensors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7212628f16aefc82ce816bd3f21fd796aff05a2f0716deff8e0318ea14da2714","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
