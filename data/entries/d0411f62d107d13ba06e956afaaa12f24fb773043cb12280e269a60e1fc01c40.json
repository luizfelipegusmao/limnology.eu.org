{"title":"Deadwood Traits and Impacts on Forest Regeneration after Disturbance: Evidence from the High Tatra Mountains, Slovakia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1108/v1","date":1726295736000,"content":"In 2004, a significant portion of the spruce-dominated forests in the Tatra National Park (northern Slovakia) was destroyed by an exceptionally strong windstorm. Our study focused on the status of deadwood and its influence on post-disturbance forest regeneration 18 years after the destruction. Since some disturbed areas were salvaged and others were not, we could compare the situations between these two management approaches. In total, 40 research sites (20 salvaged and 20 unsalvaged) were measured, each represented by four satellite-like plots with a radius of 4 m. We measured the diameters of deadwood and its decay status (classes 1 â€“ 5). At the same time, we recorded the sizes (stem base diameter and height) and species of young trees. The results showed that while salvage conditions and contact with soil stimulated deadwood decomposition, the diameter of logs was not a significant factor. The highest decay class (3.83) was found in deadwood on salvaged areas and attached to the soil, while the lowest decay class (3.10) was found in deadwood on unsalvaged areas and in the case of logs unattached to the soil. While carbon content (based on percentage of wood mass) did not change with decay class, wood density decreased sharply with decay class. Water moisture showed an increasing tendency with decay class. Moreover, our results showed that post-disturbance management influenced forest regeneration. Significantly higher tree diversity was observed in salvaged areas (5.40 species per plot) compared to unsalvaged areas (3.85 species per plot). While areas with logging were predominantly covered by broadleaved species, those without logging were typically dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst). We concluded that although salvage logging decreased the total carbon and water content in deadwood, it can stimulate tree species diversity. Thus, the currently prevailing opinion about the exclusively negative ecological effects of salvage logging should be accepted with caution, and local conditions must be considered before making broad judgments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0411f62d107d13ba06e956afaaa12f24fb773043cb12280e269a60e1fc01c40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
