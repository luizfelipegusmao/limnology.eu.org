{"title":"A non-singularity in sweet taste","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae006/7608898?rss=1","date":1707955200000,"content":"<span>The ability to recognize sugars by their chemosensory properties intuitively supports foraging and ingestion of calories in animals. For mammals, class 1 taste receptors (the T1R family) and their second messenger elements found in taste cells are established to importantly participate in the gustatory transduction of sugars and other substances that taste sweet to humans. Among the T1Rs, a major sugar receptor expressed by type II taste bud cells is formed by heteromeric combination of the second (T1R2) and third (T1R3) members, with the T1R3 gene contained within the <span>Sac</span> locus known to influence preferences for natural and artificial sweeteners (e.g. <a href=\"#CIT0002\">Bachmanov et al. 2001</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0012\">Max et al. 2001</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0013\">Montmayeur et al. 2001</a>). Experimental perturbation of the T1Rs or their downstream cellular signaling elements disrupts normal taste and ingestive preferences for diverse sugars and sweeteners in mice (<a href=\"#CIT0004\">Damak et al. 2003</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0020\">Zhang et al. 2003</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0021\">Zhao et al. 2003</a>) and the oral perception of sweetness in humans (<a href=\"#CIT0014\">Nachtigal and Green 2020</a>; <a href=\"#CIT0003\">Breslin et al. 2021</a>). Thus, the T1Rs have critical roles in sugar and sweet taste perception, and would, in turn, importantly participate in orosensory-guided energy-seeking behaviors.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"b38b16f6160b185cc1a9b17cb14f398b615f7da8f3d5c20a428135dbf2faf65b","category":"Environment"}
