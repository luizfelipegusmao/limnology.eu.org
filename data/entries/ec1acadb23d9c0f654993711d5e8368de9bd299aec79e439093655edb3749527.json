{"title":"Extensions of Perturbation Theory for Spin Dressed Neutrons and 3He Comagnetometers in Superfluid 4He","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0474/v1","date":1725540887000,"content":"The nEDM experiment at Oak Ridge’s Spallation Neutron Source will probe for an electric dipole moment of the neutron at an unprecedented level of sensitivity. Polarized 3He atoms dressed by a radio-frequency field are a crucial component. For field parameters comparable to the parameters being used in the nEDM experiment, numerical studies using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver reveal inadequacies in earlier analyses of 3He spin dynamics. It’s seen that neutron absorption is influenced by avoided level-crossings omitted previously. Also, the critical dressing condition, used to eliminate effects of the static magnetic field, requires modification. First-order perturbative corrections to eigenstates and third-order corrections to eigenenergies are needed to account for the impact of avoided level-crossings and the changes in the critical dressing condition, respectively.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ec1acadb23d9c0f654993711d5e8368de9bd299aec79e439093655edb3749527","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
