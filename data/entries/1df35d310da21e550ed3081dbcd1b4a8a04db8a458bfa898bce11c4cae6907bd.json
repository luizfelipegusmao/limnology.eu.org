{"title":"Hydrogen Bonding in Amorphous Indomethacin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0824/v1","date":1720580913000,"content":"Amorphous Indomethacin has enhanced bioavailability over itsâ€™ crystalline forms, yet amorphous forms can still possess a wide variety of structures. Here, Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) has been used to provide accurate molecular models on the structure of five different amorphous Indomethacin samples, that are consistent with their high energy x-ray diffraction patterns. It is found that the majority of molecules in amorphous Indomethacin are non-bonded or bonded to one neighboring molecule via a single hydrogen bond, in contrast the doubly bonded dimers found in the crystalline state. The EPSR models further indicate a substantial variation in hydrogen bonding between different amorphous forms, leading to a diversity of chain structures not found in any known crystal structures. The majority of hydrogen bonds are associated with the carboxylic acid group, although a significant number of amide hydrogen bonding interactions are also found in the models. Evidence of some dipole-dipole interactions are also observed in the more structurally ordered models. The results are consistent a distribution of Z-isomer intra-molecular type conformations in the more disordered structures, that dis-tort when stronger inter-molecular hydrogen bonding occurs. The findings are supported by 1H and 2H NMR studies of the hydrogen bond dynamics in amorphous Indomethacin.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1df35d310da21e550ed3081dbcd1b4a8a04db8a458bfa898bce11c4cae6907bd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
