{"title":"How much light intensity to induce repulsion or attraction behaviour in juvenile salmon?","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10750-023-05452-8","date":1714521600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>Techniques to control the phototactic behaviour of fish have expanded with progress in LED lights. However, the phototaxis direction of fish could be reversible at some light intensities, and thus it is necessary to evaluate the light-intensity levels that will induce repulsion or attraction behaviour to understand the transition. This study determined the light intensities of white LED light required to induce repulsion or attraction behaviour from a dark place, and the degree of dark-adapted visual sensitivity in juvenile of two salmon species. <em>Oncorhynchus keta</em> smolts showed negative phototaxis under intense light intensity, but positive phototaxis was not observed. The range of light intensities under which <em>O. masou</em> exhibited positive phototaxis changed with the life stage (from pre-smolts to smolts). Notably, the light intensities that elicited positive phototaxis were relatively low and narrow for pre-smolts, whereas smolts responded to a greater range of intensities. Positive phototaxis disappeared in <em>O. masou</em> pre-smolts under intense light intensity, but not in <em>O. masou</em> smolts under the most-intense light intensity tested here. Negative phototaxis was not observed in <em>O. masou</em> pre-smolts or smolts. The appropriate light intensity indicated here may be used to either guide juvenile <em>O. masou</em> from the dam reservoir to fishways or bypass channels, or to repel <em>O. keta</em> smolts from the water intakes of agricultural diversion weirs or hydropower dams.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"2d57426d4a570bbaaf610cf35faed749bdf9ddd675e5a489f86108359fec5335","category":"Environment"}
