Often, when the atomic occupancy at neighboring lattice sites is correlated within only a short distance, a chemical short-range order (SRO) emerges, which has been noticed to dictate the mechanical, magnetic, thermoelectric, and electrochemical properties of crystalline solid solutions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"6db8e7c296594cc2d0d118ecd07533e5b23e4ce8698934a05493a9d0ae402164","category":"Environment"}
