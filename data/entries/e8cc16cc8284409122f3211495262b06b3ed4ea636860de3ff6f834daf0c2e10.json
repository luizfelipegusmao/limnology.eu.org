{"title":"Enhancing Beamforming Efficiency: Utilizing Taguchi Optimization and Neural Network Acceleration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1158/v1","date":1713348589000,"content":"The article presents an innovative method for synthesizing radiation patterns efficiently by 1\ncombining the Taguchi method and neural networks, while validating the results on a 10-element 2\nantenna array. The Taguchi method aims to minimize product and process variability, while neural 3\nnetworks are used to model the relationship between antenna design parameters and radiation 4\npattern characteristics. This approach utilizes Taguchi parameters as inputs for the neural network, 5\nwhich is then trained on a dataset generated by the Taguchi method. After training, the network is 6\nvalidated using a real 10-element antenna array. Analytical results demonstrate that this method 7\nenables efficient synthesis of radiation patterns with a significant reduction in computation time 8\ncompared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, validation on the antenna array confirms the 9\naccuracy and robustness of the approach, showing a high correlation between predicted performances 10\nby the neural network model and actual measurements on the antenna array.In summary, our article 11\nhighlights that the combined use of the Taguchi method and neural networks, with validation on a 12\nreal antenna array, offers a promising approach for efficient synthesis of antenna radiation patterns. 13\nThis approach combines speed, accuracy, and reliability in antenna system design.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e8cc16cc8284409122f3211495262b06b3ed4ea636860de3ff6f834daf0c2e10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
