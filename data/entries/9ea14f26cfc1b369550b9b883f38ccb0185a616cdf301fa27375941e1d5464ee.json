{"title":"InSAR Phase Linking with L2-CSLCs: Enhancing Infrastructure Monitoring Accuracy at Algeciras Port","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0120/v1","date":1727863130000,"content":"This paper presents an advanced methodology for processing radar imagery stacks using Persistent Scatterer and Distributed Scatterer Interferometry (PSDS) to enhance spatial coherence and improve displacement detection accuracy. The workflow leverages Level 2 Coregistered Single Look Complex (L2-CSLC) images generated by the open-source COMPASS (COregistered Multi-temPorAl Sar SLC) framework in combination with the Combined eigenvalue maximum likelihood Phase Linking (CPL) approach as implemented in MiaplPy. Starting the analysis directly from Level 2 products offers a significant advantage to end-users, as they simplify processing by being pre-geocoded and ready for immediate analysis. Additionally, the open-source nature of the workflow and the use of L2-CSLC products simplify the processing pipeline, making it easier to distribute directly to users for practical applications in monitoring infrastructure stability in dynamic environments. The ISCE3-MiaplPy workflow is compared against ISCE2-MiaplPy and the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) to assess its performance in detecting infrastructure deformation in dynamic environments, such as the Algeciras port. Results indicate that ISCE3-MiaplPy delivers significantly denser measurements, albeit with increased noise, compared to its counterparts. This higher resolution enables a more detailed understanding of infrastructure stability and surface dynamics, which is critical for environments with ongoing human activity or natural forces.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ea14f26cfc1b369550b9b883f38ccb0185a616cdf301fa27375941e1d5464ee","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
