{"title":"Machine Learning Discoveries of ANTXR2-X Synergy in etc-1922159 Treated Colorectal Cancer Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0817/v1","date":1725969053000,"content":"Often, in biology, we are faced with the problem of exploring relevant unknown biological hypotheses in the form of myriads of combinations of factors/genes/proteins that might be affecting the pathway under certain conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with ETC-1922159, many genes were found up and down regu- lated, individually. A recently developed search engine ranked combinations of AN- TXR cell adhesion molecule 2 (ANTXR2)-X (X, a particular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. These rankings reveal which ANTXR2-X combinations might be working synergistically in CRC. If found true, oncologists can further test the combination of interest in wet lab and determine the mechanism of functioning be- tween the ANTXR2 and X. In this research work, we cover combinations of ANTXR2 with Collagen (COL), Integrin (ITG), Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), WNT, TNF and Interleukin (IL) .","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ce2e16d96489390ca8346089e1ededf2ba4df05879e639e888b9a2fef55c016d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
