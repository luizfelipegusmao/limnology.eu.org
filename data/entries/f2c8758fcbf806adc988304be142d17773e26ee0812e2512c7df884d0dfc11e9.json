The efficiency of the electrochemical reactions depends on the microstructure and the material properties of both the porous oxygen and hydrogen electrodes [<a href=\"#ozae044.050-B1\">1</a>]. These materials are subject to extreme environments during operation at high temperatures and electric field polarization. Understanding changes in the electrode material itself can provide valuable insights into the long-term feasibility (e.g. stability / structural stability / performance) of solid oxide cells for industrial applications. Fuel cell materials have historically been challenging to analyze with atom probe tomography (APT) due to their porous nature and low yield. Analysis of perovskites has been enabled by use of a shorter wavelength laser pulse in the LEAP 6000XR series, providing higher yield compared to previous generations of instruments and making measurements of these materials routine [<a href=\"#ozae044.050-B2\">2</a>].</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f2c8758fcbf806adc988304be142d17773e26ee0812e2512c7df884d0dfc11e9","category":"Environment"}
