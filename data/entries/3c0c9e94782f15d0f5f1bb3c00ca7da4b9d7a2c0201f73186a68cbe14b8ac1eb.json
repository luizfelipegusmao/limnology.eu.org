{"title":"The REPLUMLESS Transcription Factor Controls the Expression of the RECEPTOR-LIKE CYTOPLASMIC KINASE VI_A2 Gene Involved in Shoot and Fruit Patterning of Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0524/v1","date":1720497813000,"content":"The promoter of the RECEPTOR-LIKE CYTOPLASMIC KINASE VI_A2 gene contains nine binding sites for the REPLUMLESS transcription factor. In agreement, the expression of the kinase gene was strongly downregulated in the rpl-4 mutant. Comparing phenotypes of loss-of-function mutants, it was revealed that both genes are involved in stem growth, phyllotaxis, organization of the vascular tissues, and the replum, highlighting potential functional interactions. Expression of the RLCKVI_A2 gene from the constitutive 35S promoter could not complement the rpl-4 phenotypes, but exhibited a dominant positive effect on stem growth and affected vascular differentiation and organization. The results also indicated that the number of vascular bundles is independently regulated from stem thickness. Although our study cannot demonstrate the direct link between the RPL and RLVKVI_A2 genes, it highlights the significance of the proper developmental regulation of the RLCKVI_A2 promoter for balanced stem development.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3c0c9e94782f15d0f5f1bb3c00ca7da4b9d7a2c0201f73186a68cbe14b8ac1eb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
