{"title":"On the Prediction of the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) from the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) for Subgrade Soil","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1459/v1","date":1716425738000,"content":"This study investigates the correlation between the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) for subgrade soil analysis. The paper aims to provide practical equations for predicting CBR values from DCP test results, enhancing the efficiency of soil assessments in engineering practice. By analyzing test data and proposing correlations for different soil groups, the study introduces recalibrated correlations that demonstrate high accuracy in predicting CBR values. The newly proposed equations offer reliable predictions with R2 values of 0.89, 0.92, and 0.94 for clean sand, silty sand or sandy silt, and cohesive soil, respectively. These correlations serve as valuable tools for engineers, enabling rapid and accurate CBR estimations for improved decision-making in various engineering projects.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74a04941ffa83274db71cb5b91f3d0bf3f5ae22d157e13d04c4fe49049277d9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
