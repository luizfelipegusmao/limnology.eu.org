{"title":"Dislocations in Metals and Ceramic Materials Studied by TEM","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.522/7719937?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>This talk is dedicated to Terry Mitchell in celebration of his contribution to the study of defects in metals and ceramic materials using transmission electron microscopy. Terry’s work has been well reviewed by Hecker [<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B1\">1</a>] and others when Terry retired from LANL. It will begin with a discussion of his work on metals, both FCC and BCC. The work on defects in FCC alloys was part of what became the basis of our knowledge of work-hardening. I’ll pay particular attention to Terry’s interest in stacking-fault energies [<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B2\">2</a>] which built on [<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B3\">3</a>] and contributed to [<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B4\">4</a>] the research of Smallman’s team and then my own work on these materials [<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B6\">6</a>]. Terry’s study of work -hardening of bcc metals (e.g., Nb [<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B7\">7</a>]) again led the field; it’s the fundamental study using classical diffraction contrast—the study of dislocations in FCC and HCP Ta [<a href=\"#ozae044.522-B8\">8</a>] (another BCC metal) might well have intrigued him. (We note here that Terry did later publish 8 papers in the Journal of Materials Science.) The defect configuration in Figure 1 can only occur if the stacking-fault energy is quite small.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4612a2e6f2b219741ca7edaa00bb1ca518686c670ab7c59f5934b34ac6b87200","category":"Environment"}
