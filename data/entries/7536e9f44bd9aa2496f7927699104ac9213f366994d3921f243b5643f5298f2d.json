In Africa, coinfection of HBV with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is high, yet the condition remains overlooked in many countries. While antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved HIV survival, viral hepatitis continues to contribute to morbidity and mortality. Occult Hepatitis B infection (OBI), characterized by a low-level of HBV DNA in individuals with negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is an emerging concern among HIV seropositive individuals due to the risk of HBV reactivation and associated complications, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ghana has an estimated HBV/HIV coinfection prevalence of 13.6% making it important to also determine potential cases of OBI. This study aims to assess OBI prevalence in persons living with HIV (PLHIV). A cross-sectional study was conducted in five health facilities in the Cape Coast Metropolis. HBV-related serological markers were determined among 116 PLHIV using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. HBV DNA was extracted from 30 participants found to be HBsAg negative but positive for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb+). Nested PCR was employed in detecting HBV DNA and HBV viral load was performed using qPCR. The median age of the participants was 37 years (IQR 22–65). Serologically, 7.8% (n = 9, 95% CI: 3.5–22.7), 12.1% (n = 14), and 25.9% (n = 30) tested positive for solely HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb respectively. OBI prevalence among HBsAg-/HBcAb+ participants was 16.7% (n = 5, 95% CI: 6.5–23.7) with a median HBV DNA level of 139.2 IU/ml (IQR, 96.7–142.0). The prevalence of OBI among HIV-positive participants in the Cape Coast Metropolis highlights the need to consider screening for HBV among HIV patients using nucleic acid amplification tests. This can inform medical management and reduce the risk of liver complications, including HCC.","author":"Emmanuel Salia","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"7536e9f44bd9aa2496f7927699104ac9213f366994d3921f243b5643f5298f2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
