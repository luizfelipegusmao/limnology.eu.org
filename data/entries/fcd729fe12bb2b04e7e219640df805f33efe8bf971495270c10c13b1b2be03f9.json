{"title":"Fortification of Goat Milk Yogurts with Encapsulated Postbiotic Active Lactococci","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0171/v1","date":1719924530000,"content":"The species Lactococcus lactis is the bacterium extensively used in dairy industry. This bacterium is generally recognized as safe which was added to the European Food Safety Authority Qualified Presumption of Safety list. The major functions of this species in dairy fermentation are production of lactic acid from lactose, citric acid fermentation and hydrolysis of casein. But the representatives of this species producing bacteriocin substances can exert an inhibitory effect against spoilage bacteria. The aim of this study was to test three lactococcal strains isolated from raw goat milk for their postbiotic activity and to test their stability in goat milk yogurts in encapsulated form for further application. To reach the aims, validated methods were used. Three postbiotic active Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (identified by Blastn 16S rRNA analysis) from raw goat milk produced bacteriocin substances which in their concentrated form inhibited the growth of indicator enterococci and staphylococci up to 97.8 % with inhibitory activity up to 800 AU/mL. The encapsulated (freeze dried) lactococci fortified goat milk yogurts showed sufficient stability and survival in yogurts. The highest amount was reached using the strain MK2/8 (8.1 Â± 0.0 cfu/g log 10) not influencing yogurt pH.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fcd729fe12bb2b04e7e219640df805f33efe8bf971495270c10c13b1b2be03f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
