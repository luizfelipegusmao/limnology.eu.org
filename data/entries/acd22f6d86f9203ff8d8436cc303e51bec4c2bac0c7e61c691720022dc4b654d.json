{"title":"Recent Advances in Chromatographic Analysis of Emerging Pollutants in Dairy Milk: A Review (2018&ndash;2023)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0662/v1","date":1710235345000,"content":"Emerging pollutants (EPs) encompass natural or synthetic substances in the environment that pose potential risks but have only recently been recognized or monitored. EPs consist of various categories including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hormones, mycotoxins, and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Through several pathways, EPs can access food, potentially leading to health impacts when their safe concentrations are exceeded. Milk, being a highly nutritious and a heavily consumed food product by many consumers of different ages, is a crucial food matrix where EPs should be regularly monitored. In literature, large number of studies was dedicated for the determination of different EPs in dairy milk, employing different analytical techniques. Chromatographic based techniques were the most prevalent means for analysis of EPs in milk, which demonstrated significant efficiency, sensitivity and accuracy for this specific purpose. Prior to chromatographic analysis, extraction of EPs from a complex matrix like milk, is essential. This review comprehensively covers relevant research papers on extraction and subsequent detection and determination of EPs in milk by chromatographic methods from 2018 and until 2023.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"acd22f6d86f9203ff8d8436cc303e51bec4c2bac0c7e61c691720022dc4b654d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
