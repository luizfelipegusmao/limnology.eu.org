{"title":"Magnitude of standard precautions practices among healthcare workers in health facilities of Low and Middle Income Countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0302282","date":1714485600000,"content":"<p>by Mengistu Yilma, Girma Taye, Workeabeba Abebe</p>\r\nBackground <p>Standard precautions are the minimum standard of infection control to prevent transmission of infectious agents, protect healthcare workers, patients, and visitors regardless of infection status. The consistent implementation of standard precautions is highly effective in reducing transmission of pathogens that cause HAIs. Despite their effectiveness, compliance, resources, patient behavior, and time constraints are some of the challenges that can arise when implementing standard precautions. The main objective of this meta-analysis was to show the pooled prevalence of safe standard precaution practices among healthcare workers in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs).</p> Methods <p>A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted for this study. We systematically searched observational study articles from PubMed Central and Google Scholar. We included articles published any year and involving healthcare workers. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The random effect model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. The meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and publication bias (funnel plot, and Eggerâ€™s tests) were conducted.</p> Results <p>A total of 46 articles were included in this study. The pooled prevalence of standard precautions practices among healthcare workers in LMICs was 53%, with a 95% CI of (47, 59). These studies had a total sample size of 14061 with a minimum sample size of 17 and a maximum sample size of 2086. The majority of the studies (82.6%) were conducted in hospitals only (all kinds), and the remaining 17.4% were conducted in all health facilities, including hospitals.</p> Conclusions <p>The pooled prevalence of standard precautions practices among healthcare workers in LMICs was suboptimal. The findings of this study can have substantial implication for healthcare practice and policy making by providing robust evidence with synthesized and pooled evidence from multiple studies.</p> Trial registration <p>Registered on PROSPERO with record ID: CRD42023395129, on the 9<sup>th</sup> Feb. 2023.</p>","author":"Mengistu Yilma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b5bb4b804412abc02a69cef18cba9155576363391757305595102b6368cfce61","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
