{"title":"Regional differences, distributional dynamics and convergence of multidimensional food security levels in China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309071","date":1723816800000,"content":"<p>by Jing Cheng, Xiaobin Yu</p>\r\n\r\nFood security is one of the important issues in the current world development process. The article takes 31 provinces (districts and cities) in China as the research object and constructs a multidimensional food security level evaluation index system from four dimensions: quantitative security, nutritional security, ecological security, and capacity security. Using the entropy method, China’s food security index was calculated for the ten-year period from 2013 to 2022. Overall, China’s food security level showed an upward trend during the decade, with the provinces of Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Henan having the highest level of security. The distribution dynamics of food security and its spatiotemporal evolution in the seven regions were examined using the Dagum Gini coefficient and its decomposition, and the absolute and conditional convergence of food security in the different areas was verified. The results of the study show that the provinces within East China have the largest gap in food security levels between them, and there is absolute β-convergence. Looking at China as a whole, the development of its food security level is characterized by significant convergence, which means that provinces with a low level of food security will have a faster rate of growth than those with a high level of food security, resulting in a gradual narrowing of the gap in food security levels between provinces.","author":"Jing Cheng","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"40883c5738a61956e6fe8a48be58e86f4c70ce3238cf1975d06533f15c7d1232","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
