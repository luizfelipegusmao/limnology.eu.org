Examples include perovskite solar cells, ferromagnetic semiconductors, and shape memory alloys. The integration of combinatorial methods with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) allows for a comprehensive analysis of surface structure, offering insights into distributions and chemistries.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f7a634efdfec94b50a711a255ffa2f3e32b4e7ad754a32e77e2138b4c2f1a21e","category":"Environment"}
