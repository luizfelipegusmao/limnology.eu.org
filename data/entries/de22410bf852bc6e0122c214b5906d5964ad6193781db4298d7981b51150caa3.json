This concept of heterologous immunity was explored in healthy children receiving both DTP and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. \nMethods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 154 healthy children aged 6–8 years old in Jakarta, Indonesia. Their vaccination status of DTP (including diphtheria-tetanus booster vac-cine at 5 years old) and CoronaVac (from 6 years old) were recorded. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all participants, in which anti-diphtheria toxoid IgG, anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD antibodies and T cell-derived IFN- were measured. \nResults: Study participants with complete DTP vaccination had significantly higher titer of an-ti-diphtheria toxoid IgG than the ones without (median=0.9349 versus 0.2113 IU/mL; p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"de22410bf852bc6e0122c214b5906d5964ad6193781db4298d7981b51150caa3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
