{"title":"265 Effect of L-glutamine and enzyme supplementation of liquid creep feed from d 8 to 28 of age on pre-weaning growth and health of pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_2/166/7664718?rss=1","date":1714780800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The provision of liquid creep feed has been shown to increase dry matter intake (DMI) compared with dry creep feeding. The greater DMI associated with liquid feeding means that it could be used as an effective route for feed additive supplementation of suckling pigs to optimize growth and health at weaning. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of L-glutamine or enzyme supplementation of liquid creep feed on growth and medication usage in suckling pigs. Sows (n = 60) were blocked on parity, previous number of piglets weaned and body weight (BW) at d 107 of gestation, and randomly assigned to one of 3 dietary treatments from d 8 of age to weaning at d 28: 1) liquid starter (control); 2) control supplemented with 10 kg of L-glutamine per tonne of starter diet (glutamine); and 3) control supplemented with a cocktail of enzymes (lipase, protease and α-amylase included at 200 g, 50 g and 112.5 g, respectively per tonne of starter diet; enzymes). Individual piglets were weighed on d 8, 14, 21 and 27 of age. Litter dry matter intake, the volume of antibiotics and anti-inflammatories administered per pig and per sow were recorded for the pre-weaning period. Data were analyzed using the mixed models procedure in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.) with treatment as a fixed effect, and day post-partum as the repeated measure. Block was included as a random effect and the number of pigs/litter at d 8 and the average pig BW at d 8 were included as co-variates when significant in the model. Means separation was by Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons. The piglet nested within sow was the experimental unit. The DMI of creep feed did not differ between treatments (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). From d 14 to 21, glutamine decreased average daily gain (ADG) by 7% compared with the control (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). However, ADG did not differ between treatment groups from d 8 to 14 or from d 21 to 27. Body weight was not affected by treatment at d 8 or 14 (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.05). However, at d 21, glutamine tended to reduce BW by 2% compared with the control (<span>P =</span> 0.09) and at d 27, it tended to reduce BW by 2% compared with the control and enzymes (<span>P =</span> 0.08). The volume of antibiotics or anti-inflammatories administered to piglets or sows was not affected by treatment. However, glutamine tended to increase diarrhea incidence by 12% between d 8 and 27 compared with the control (<span>P =</span> 0.09). In conclusion, supplementing liquid creep feed with 10 kg of glutamine/tonne of feed reduced pre-weaning growth and tended to increase diarrhea incidence in piglets. In addition, supplementing liquid creep feed with enzymes had no effect on pre-weaning growth and medication usage in piglets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"bdcae3ab4aea3c690c92db4b5e483807a6df8f8561853a10b34465a8fbf29baf","category":"Environment"}
