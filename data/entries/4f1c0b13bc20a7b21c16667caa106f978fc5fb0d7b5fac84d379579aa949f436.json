{"title":"Fused Filament Fabrication of WC-10Co Hardmetals: A Study on Binder Formulations, and printing variables.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0642/v1","date":1715336090000,"content":"This research investigates the application of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) in producing WC-10Co hardmetals, focusing binder formulations and understanding its influence on extrusion force and the influence of printing variables on green density of the samples. By examining the interplay between different binder compositions and backbone contents, the study aims to enhance the mechanical properties of the sintered parts while reducing defects inherent in the printing process. Evidence suggested that formulated feedstocks influenced the hardness of the sintered hardmetal, not due to microstructural changes but to macrostructural responses like macro defects introduced during printing, debinding and sintering of the samples. The results demonstrate the critical role of PP-MA content in improving part density and sintered hardness, suggesting the need for specific thermal debinding protocols tailored to each feedstock. The study provides insights into the formulation of feedstocks for hardmetal FFF, proposing a path toward refining manufacturing processes for better quality and performance of 3D printed hardmetal components.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f1c0b13bc20a7b21c16667caa106f978fc5fb0d7b5fac84d379579aa949f436","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
