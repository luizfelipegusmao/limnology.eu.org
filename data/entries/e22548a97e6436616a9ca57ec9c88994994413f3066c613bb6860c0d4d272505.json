{"title":"Challenges of Urologic Oncology in Low‐to‐Middle Income Countries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0771/v1","date":1720597304000,"content":"We performed a literature review to identify articles regarding the state of urological cancers in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC). The challenges that LMIC face are multifactorial and can include, poor health education, inadequate screening, as well as limited access to treatment options and trained urologists. Many of the gold standard treatments in high income countries (HIC) are scarce in LMIC due to their poor socioeconomic status leading to advanced stage of disease at diagnosis and ultimately a higher mortality rate. These standards of care are vital components of oncological disease management, however, the current and sparse literature available from LMIC indicate that there are many obstacles delaying early diagnosis and management options in LMIC. In the era of evolving medical diagnosis and treatments, sufficient data must be gathered and understood in order to provide appropriate diagnostic and treatment options to curtail rising mortality rates, and therefore help to alleviate the bur-den in LMIC.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e22548a97e6436616a9ca57ec9c88994994413f3066c613bb6860c0d4d272505","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
