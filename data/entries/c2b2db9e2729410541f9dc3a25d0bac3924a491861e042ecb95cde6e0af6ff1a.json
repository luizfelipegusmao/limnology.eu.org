{"title":"Social Network Analysis: Understanding Volleyball Dynamics Through Match Opponents","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1243/v1","date":1716190235000,"content":"The current investigation scrutinized the strategic approaches employed by the top four teams in the Brazilian Men's Volleyball Superliga, according to the match's opponent. The study encompasses the analysis of 22 matches, involving teams ranked first through fourth, competing against each of the 12 teams participating in the 21-22 season of the Brazilian Men's Volleyball Superliga, including one home and one away match for each team. Utilizing social network analysis facilitated the identification of the interconnections and particularities among all variables, offering a comprehensive perspective. The findings unveiled that during the offensive phase, the second, third, and fourth-ranked teams consistently exhibited higher eigenvector values, irrespective of the opposing team, notably when the middle-blocker positioned themselves in front and near the setter. Conversely, the championship-winning team displayed variations in offensive tactics. The team securing the second position demonstrated alterations in setting placement, whereas the other teams executed settings aimed at zones 3 and 4. Additionally, the initial setter's position at the commencement of a rally displayed varying eigenvector values based on the opponent, indicating team rotation as a performance determinant. Thus, barring the finalist team, the performance of the remaining teams is intricately intertwined with the individual characteristics of players.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c2b2db9e2729410541f9dc3a25d0bac3924a491861e042ecb95cde6e0af6ff1a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
