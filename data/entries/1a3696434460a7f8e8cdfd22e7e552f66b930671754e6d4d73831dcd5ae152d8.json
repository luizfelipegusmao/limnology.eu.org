{"title":"Highly Efficient Asymmetric [3+2] Cycloaddition Promoted by Chiral Aziridine-Functionalized Organophosphorus Compounds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1914/v1","date":1716960505000,"content":"An asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylides generated from the corresponding imino esters to trans-Î²-nitrostyrene catalyzed by chiral aziridine-containing phosphines and phosphine oxides is described. Of the sixteen stereoisomers that could be formed as a result of the title reac-tion, three were formed, two of which were obtained in an enantiomerically enriched or pure form, and one in a racemic form. One of the products underwent epimerization under basic reaction conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1a3696434460a7f8e8cdfd22e7e552f66b930671754e6d4d73831dcd5ae152d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
