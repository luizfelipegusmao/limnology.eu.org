{"title":"Genomic Characterisation of Methicillin-Resistant and Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus Implicated in Bloodstream Infections, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1137/v1","date":1721032656000,"content":"Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of bloodstream infections. It can acquire different antibiotic resistance genes, leading to treatment failure. Aim: We elaborate on the genomic characteristics; antibiotic resistance, virulence, pathogenicity, phylogenomics and clonal diversity of S. aureus implicated in bloodstream infections. Six multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus, three methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and three methicillin-sensitive S. aureus obtained from blood cultures underwent whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. All isolates carried different permutations and combinations of resistance genes including, blaZ, mecA, aac(6')-aph (2''), ant(9)-Ia, ant(6)-Ia, mepR, fosB,  norA, norC, lmrS, arlS, arlR, mgrA, kdpD and sdrM.  We found 6 spa types (t9475, t355, t045, t1265, t1257, and t7888) with varying profiles of virulence genes responsible for immune invasion, enterotoxins, adhesion/biofilm, haemolysins, and leukotoxins. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (Luk-PV) was found in one MSSA isolate. Two SCCmec types IVd(2B) and I(1B) were identified. Isolates belonged to four multilocus sequence types (MLSTs), the most common of which was ST5 (n=3). The STs were clustered into two clonal complexes CC5 and CC8. We found two MRSA clones typed as ST5-CC5-t045-SCCmec_I(1B), and the human-associated MRSA endemic clone ST612-CC8-t1257-SCCmec_IVd(2B). The insertion sequences IS30 and IS6 associated with virulence were found in two isolates. The presence of virulent MDR S. aureus in bloodstream infections poses a clinical concern because of limited treatment options and increased risk of mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3d375040f7048618829660ee7b5f1f81e97f5c93e99524f8d17452e7feb83b74","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
