{"title":"Vibration Analysis of Multilayered Quasicrystal Cylindrical Shells, Annular Plates, and Truncated Conical Shells Filled with Fluid","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.2247/v1","date":1725024907000,"content":"An approach to estimate the dynamic characteristic of multilayered three-dimensional cubic quasicrystal cylindrical shells, annular plates, and truncated conical shells with different boundary conditions is presented. These investigated structures can be in a vacuum, totally filled with quiescent fluid, and subjected to internal flowing fluid, in which the fluid is incompressible and inviscid. The velocity potential, Bernoulliâ€™s equation, and impermeability condition have been applied to the shell-fluid interface to obtain an explicit expression, from which the fluid pressure can be converted into the coupled differential equations in terms of displacement functions. The state-space method is formulated to quasicrystal linear elastic theory to derive the state equations for three structures along the radial direction. The mixed supported boundary conditions are represented by means of the differential quadrature technique and Fourier series expansions, respectively. A global propagator matrix, which connects the field variables at the internal interface to those at the external interface for the whole structure, is further completed by joint coupling matrices to overcome the numerical instabilities. Numerical examples show the correctness of the proposed method and the influence of the semi-vertical angle, different boundary conditions, and the fluid debit on the natural frequencies and mode shapes for various geometries and boundary conditions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35554b3ae06393fc26d2defae49d200d1715f28424f7d07c08b5db3c23ed06f9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
