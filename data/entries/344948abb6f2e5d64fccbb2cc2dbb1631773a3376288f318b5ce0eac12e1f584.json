In growing cells, cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs), which are assembled in the Golgi apparatus and trafficked to the cell surface (<a href=\"#kiae305-B7\">McFarlane et al. 2014</a>). Despite the importance of cellulose in plant growth and development, many aspects of its synthesis remain unknown. Chemical genetics has proven to be a powerful approach to study complex cellular processes like cellulose biosynthesis (<a href=\"#kiae305-B1\">Brabham and DeBolt 2013</a>). By screening chemical libraries for compounds that affect plant growth, researchers can identify new cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs) and gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of cellulose production.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"344948abb6f2e5d64fccbb2cc2dbb1631773a3376288f318b5ce0eac12e1f584","category":"Environment"}
