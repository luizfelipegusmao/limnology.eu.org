{"title":"Revealing Consequences of the Husking Process on Nutritional Profiles of Two Sorghum Races on the Male Sterility Line","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0622/v1","date":1710155131000,"content":"Sorghum grain processing can improve the nutritional content by promoting dietary properties that contribute to food security and economic development.  The quality, nutritional content, and processing properties of sorghum bicolor grain can greatly affected by the inbred line races and variance in pericarp colour.The current study assessed the influence of the Husking Fraction Time Units (HFTU) process, which employed set time units per second (S), on the variation in the nutritional profile of fifty-one inbred line sorghum varieties based on distinct pericarp colours. When the assessment of the nutritional profile was involved: dry matter, total protein besides, namely mineral (P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Zn, and Mn).  The variety groups showed a significance value of (P &lt; 0.05), indicating the study hypothesis's truth.The results demonstrated substantial impacts implied by the  Husking Fraction Time Unit (HFTU) technique. This occurrence was noted when the dry matter percentage was increased in the husked products, specifically the endosperm (grits) and bran. The protein percentage redistributed by 19.2% compared to the whole grain and bran content. In comparison, the ratio of N/S was 14:1 in the S. bicolor and 12:1 in the kafirin in the bran part.  Moreover, a strong correlation was observed among the examined minerals of S.bicolor and kafirin, such as the correlation between Ca: P,  K: Na, and Fe: Zn attributed 80 (S) time unit, with correlation coefficients of R = 0.784 and R = 0.586, R= 517, R= 0.884, R= 0.745, and R = 0.893, respectively. At the same time, the  80 (S) time unit showed a significant effect on the colour property profile.The study results could benefit breeders and nutrition specialists in developing genotypes and processing sorghum grains, promoting research, and aiding several industrial sectors owing to the grain's adaptability and nutritional properties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e2e9846afefa982a95b163156908389014f560fe302fa997a4ad8da6396de1dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
