Sequeira Gross, Evaldas Girdauskas</p>\r\nBackground <p>We aimed to determine the rate and impact of post-pericardiotomy syndrome after native valve-sparing aortic valve surgery and the perioperative factors associated with its occurrence.</p> Methods <p>All consecutive patients who underwent native valve-sparing aortic valve surgery (i.e., repair ± ascending aorta replacement, valve-sparing root replacement, Ross procedure ± ascending aorta replacement) at our institution between January 2021 and August 2023 served as our study population. Post-pericardiotomy syndrome was diagnosed if patients showed at least two of the following diagnostic criteria: evidence of (I) new/worsening pericardial effusion, or (II) new/worsening pleural effusions, (III) pleuritic chest pain, (IV) fever or (V) elevated inflammatory markers without alternative causes. A logistic regression model was calculated.</p> Results <p>During the study period, 91 patients underwent native valve-sparing aortic valve surgery. A total of 21 patients (23%) developed post-pericardiotomy syndrome early after surgery (PPS group). The remaining 70 patients (77%) showed no signs of post-pericardiotomy syndrome (non-PPS group). Multivariate logistic regression revealed blood type O (OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.06–9.41, p = 0.040), valve-sparing root replacement (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.01–9.59, p = 0.048) and peak C-reactive protein &gt;15 mg/dl within 48 hours postoperatively (OR: 4.27, 95% CI: 1.05–17.29, p = 0.042) as independent risk factors. 73% (8/11) of patients displaying all three risk factors, 60% (9/15) of patients with blood type O and valve-sparing root replacement, 52% (11/21) of patients with blood type O and early postoperative peak C-reactive protein &gt;15 mg/dl and 45% (13/29) of patients with early postoperative peak C-reactive protein &gt;15 mg/dl and valve-sparing root replacement developed post-pericardiotomy syndrome.</p> Conclusion <p>In summary, blood type O, valve-sparing root replacement and peak C-reactive protein &gt;15 mg/dl within 48 hours postoperatively are significantly associated with post-pericardiotomy syndrome after native valve-sparing aortic valve surgery. Particularly, the presence of all three risk factors is linked to a particularly high risk of post-pericardiotomy syndrome.</p>","author":"Theresa Holst","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f5613ec93319153f8f1230fcd4b18b2d4de2fa0b8f68c691cd9b8bbfc0152aa9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
