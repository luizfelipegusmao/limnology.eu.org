{"title":"Enhancement of functional properties, digestive properties, and in vitro digestion product physiological activity of extruded corn gluten meal by enzymatic modification","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13233?af=R","date":1710911381000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Enzymatic modification is an effective means of improving the functional properties, digestive properties, and <i>in vitro</i> digestion product physiological activity of proteins, thus significantly expanding protein uses in various food applications.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>In this study, the addition of chymotrypsin (CT) at pH 9.0 and 11.0 was found to significantly improve the functional properties (solubility, foaming properties, water holding capacity, oil holding capacity, etc.) and digestive properties of extruded corn gluten meal (ECGM). Similar changes were observed when treating ECGM with glutaminase, protein glutaminase, and papain. These changes were likely due to the increase in number of carboxyl groups and the multiple effects of change in protein net charge and conformation caused by enzymatic deamidation. Of note, ECGM deamidated by CT showed the highest degree of deamidation, solubility, and gastrointestinal digestibility at pH 11.0, up to 44.92%, 43.75%, and 82.22%, respectively. In addition, CT-ECGM digestion product exhibited strong antioxidant activity and potential to promote alcohol metabolism in both a static digestion model and dynamic digestion model, even comparable to commercial corn peptides (CCP), while being inexpensive and of low bitterness compared to CCP. Meanwhile, the physiological activity enhanced as the molecular weight of digestion product decreased with the digested component having strongest activity.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study may promote the application of ECGM as a food component in the food industry or even as a substitute for CCP. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Pimiao Huang, \nWenke Zhao, \nLei Cai, \nYing Liu, \nJing Wu, \nChun Cui","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"c00f7127be0d336661bd71ffd394837520877fbe590f207ac39e9ce90cca6b6f","category":"Environment"}
