{"title":"In vivo treatment with a non-aromatizable androgen rapidly alters the ovarian transcriptome of previtellogenic secondary growth coho salmon (<i>Onchorhynchus kisutch</i>)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311628","date":1728482400000,"content":"<p>by Christopher Monson, Giles Goetz, Kristy Forsgren, Penny Swanson, Graham Young</p>\r\n\r\nRecent evidence suggests that androgens are a potent driver of growth during late the primary stage of ovarian follicle development in teleosts. We have previously shown that the non-aromatizable androgen, 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), both advances ovarian follicle growth in vivo and dramatically alters the primary growth ovarian transcriptome in coho salmon. Many of the transcriptomic changes pointed towards 11-KT driving process associated with the transition to a secondary growth phenotype. In the current study, we implanted previtellogenic early secondary growth coho salmon with cholesterol pellets containing 11-KT and performed RNA-Seq on ovarian tissue after 3 days in order to identify alterations to the ovarian transcriptome in early secondary growth. We identified 8,707 contiguous sequences (contigs) that were differentially expressed (DE) between control and 11-KT implanted fish and were able to collapse those to 3,853 gene-level IDs, more than a 3-fold more DE contigs than at the primary growth stage we reported previously. These contigs included genes encoding proteins involved in steroidogenesis, vitellogenin and lipid uptake, follicle stimulating hormone signaling, growth factor signaling, and structural proteins, suggesting androgens continue to promote previtellogenic secondary growth.","author":"Christopher Monson","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ac6efc4ef4024580e2ff4092805adf143bba0d4e302616c196d840294b721857","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
