However, itâ€™s still a rare case to use machine learning to help data acquisition during the experiment. Such attempt has been proven successful in the form of deep kernel learning (DKL) for piezoelectric force microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.158-B1\">1</a>] and combinatorial library exploration [<a href=\"#ozae044.158-B2\">2</a>] with scanning probe microscopy based on human in the loop automated experiment (hAE). It not only offers high-throughput characterization of materials, but also enables studying systems with giant amounts of data that human researchers cannot handle. In a typical hAE workflow, human operators provide the reward function to define the goal of the experiment and experiment policy to guide the behavior of the machines. Then the machine learning will learn the correlation within the acquired data and determine the next location for the next measurement based on reward function and policy. In this talk, I will present the hAE simulation based on complete STM data pre-acquired on various quantum materials, showing the possibility of accelerating physics research with hAE.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"baeb287792a754e4d4887c0e58465cfc2d12521b2d3687135f3ccf50d414c938","category":"Environment"}
