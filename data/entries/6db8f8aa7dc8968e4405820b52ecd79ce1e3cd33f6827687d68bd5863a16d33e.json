{"title":"Integrating Curriculum, Extracurricular Activities, and Community Engagement: A Study on Under Graduates Awareness, Sustainable Environmental Education, and Well-Being in Higher Education","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1921/v1","date":1716957901000,"content":"Higher education equips youth with the requisite knowledge and skills for navigating environmental education and sustainability. The current study aims to test a comprehensive model for integrating environmental education and sustainability principles within the higher education ecosystem. The model emphasizes problem-based and service-learning approaches, technological integration, and behaviour change models to foster environmental education, and community engagement and enhance overall well-being. In this study, researchers examined the impact of curriculum, extracurricular activities, and community engagement as independent variables on dependent variables namely environmental education, sustainability, and well-being while also considering the mediating role of the undergraduates' awareness level. Data was collected from a higher education academic Institute in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The variance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) technique using Smart-Partial Least Squares (PLS) software was used to test these hypothesized relationships empirically. The study findings revealed a significant positive impact of curriculum development, extracurricular activities, and community engagement efforts on elevating undergraduates' awareness levels. Awareness levels mediated the effect of environmental education, sustainability, and well-being, highlighting the need to integrate environment-related topics into academic and extracurricular activities. This underscores higher education's potential to shape eco-conscious leaders by infusing environmental education into academic life. These findings have implications for higher education institutions, policymakers, and community organizers, emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach to environmental education for a sustainable society. By fostering environmental awareness among youth and integrating it into broader societal initiatives, educational institutions can play a crucial role in shaping a generation committed to sustainability and well-being.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6db8f8aa7dc8968e4405820b52ecd79ce1e3cd33f6827687d68bd5863a16d33e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
