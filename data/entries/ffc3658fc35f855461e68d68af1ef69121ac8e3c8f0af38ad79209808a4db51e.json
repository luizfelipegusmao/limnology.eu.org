{"title":"Novel Fluidic Oscillator Evaluation Considering Dimensional Modifications","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1782/v1","date":1727090785000,"content":"Although flow mixing and cooling can be greatly enhanced when considering the use of Fluidic Oscillators (FO), they are more commonly employed in Active Flow Control (AFC) applications where the injected pulsating flow interacts with the boundary layer in order to usually delay its separation. In fact, prior to any FO implementation in a given application, it is essential to study the range of frequencies and amplitudes it can generate as a function of the incoming mass flow and its dimensions. This point is what is being enlightened in the present manuscript for a rather novel FO configuration. We are numerically studding a standard FO configuration in three dimensions 3D and also using a two dimensional 2D approach. After comparing the 3D and the 2D results and analyzing the main differences, we modified some of the internal dimensions of the FO in order to evaluate the variation of its dynamic performance. The present results clarify which internal dimensional modifications are more effective in generating larger output frequencies and velocity field variations. Care is taken to analyze the origin of the self sustained oscillations. In fact, the present research needs to be seen as the continuation of a former one recently published , where the effect of several Reynolds numbers as well as some different internal dimensions was considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"ffc3658fc35f855461e68d68af1ef69121ac8e3c8f0af38ad79209808a4db51e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
