{"title":"Comparing atmospheric changes over Texas, USA and Wuhan, China before and after the COVID-19 global shutdown using Sentinel-5P","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1499/v1","date":1716443322000,"content":"The COVID-19 virus was first detected in Wuhan, China and its genesis was traced to infected bats, passed through an intermediate host to humans. COVID-19 or “Coronavirus” reached approximately 4 million confirmed cases in the United States by July 2020. The spread of this virus has affected both social and economic affairs on a global scale with more than 15 million confirmed cases worldwide in July 2020. The pandemic has proven a global public health and socio-economic crisis. In addition, the shelter-in-place orders provide an unprecedented opportunity for examining the resulting reduction in greenhouse gases and aerosols on the atmosphere. The Sentinel-5P satellite has shown distinct changes in atmospheric compounds over the COVID-19 epicenter in Wuhan. After Texas, U.S.A. established similar shelter-in-place orders to prevent the spread of the virus, the state’s industrial activity experienced an economic slowdown. This paper quantifies the changes in the atmosphere during the time of the COVID-19 slowdown over major cities in Texas and compares it to similar changes in Wuhan, China using satellite imagery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c96df71350ef296ac316fe1945b2ebed98ff8d3d5a6a4d47e252964e6c88452a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
