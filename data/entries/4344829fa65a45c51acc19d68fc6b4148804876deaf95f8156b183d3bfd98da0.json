{"title":"Hidden seafloor hypoxia in coastal waters","link":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.12607?af=R","date":1721715347000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The expansion of transient and permanent coastal benthic anoxia is one of the most severe problems for the coastal ocean globally. We report frequent, hidden hypoxia in the bottom 5 cm of the water column of a coastal site in the central Baltic Sea by continuous high-resolution profiling of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) directly above the sediment surface. This hypoxia stood in stark contrast to 30-yr O<sub>2</sub> monitoring records at this site that suggest apparent continuous well-oxygenated conditions. In situ measurements showed highly dynamic conditions in the bottom 30 cm recording frequent gradual and abrupt changes between normoxic (&gt; 63 <i>μ</i>mol L<sup>−1</sup>) and hypoxic (&lt; 63 <i>μ</i>mol L<sup>−1</sup>) conditions that would remain undetectable by conventional bottom water O<sub>2</sub> monitoring. The temporal variability of these “hidden” hypoxia is tied to the dynamic current field and to changes in O<sub>2</sub> consumption following resuspension events. Our observations suggest that transient benthic hypoxia is much more common than routine monitoring data indicate.</p>","author":"Jonas Patrik Fredriksson, \nKarl Attard, \nChristian Stranne, \nInga Monika Koszalka, \nRonnie N.
