{"title":"Docking Analysis on Mutated Proteins in Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous Syndrome: Amentoflavone E Hypericin Potential Role","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0140/v1","date":1725355949000,"content":"Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, linked to mutations in genes including KRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2, leads to dysregulated RAS-MAPK signaling with limited therapeutic options. This study utilized molecular docking simulations to screen natural compounds against mutated KRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 structures. Promising candidates such as Amentoflavone and Hypericin displayed strong binding affinities and favorable interactions with mutated sites, suggesting their potential as lead molecules for targeted therapies in CFC syndrome. This research offers novel insights into therapeutic interventions for this rare genetic disorder.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6bea993115e254212e25c1ab4e3d39eadb1df3cc48b59ffa7a03ff735b04a2b0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
