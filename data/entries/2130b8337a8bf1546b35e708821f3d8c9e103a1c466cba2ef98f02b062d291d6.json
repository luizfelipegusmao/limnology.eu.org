{"title":"Impact of carbon emissions factors on economic agents based on decisions modeling in complex systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0403/v1","date":1712290585000,"content":"The article presents a methodology for modeling the impact of factors of both on-farm activity and environmental factors on the resulting indicators of an international company. The dataset includes the company's profit, revenue, valuation, share price, and market share from 2012 through 2022. This empirical period is optimal for such a type of modeling. Modeling the impact of carbon emissions factors on the resulting indicators is considered based on complex systems theory. Endogenous model variables include indicators of the development of the international company. Predefined model variables reflect the influence of both the external environment and internal factors on the development indicators of an international company. An approach of picture fuzzy rough sets based on time series of endogenous and exogenous variables can provide an opportunity to analyze and consider the consequences of feedback changes in the systems of which they are a part. Based on the results of the analysis of the model construction, it is concluded that picture fuzzy rough sets can be an excellent way to model interdependent social processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2130b8337a8bf1546b35e708821f3d8c9e103a1c466cba2ef98f02b062d291d6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
