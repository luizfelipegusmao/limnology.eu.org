It is a leading cause of death and illness and is associated with a substantial economic burden worldwide. Furthermore, it is marked by frequent exacerbations, which significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality, as well as the overall burden. These exacerbations are frequently triggered by bacterial infections.So far, the most commonly implicated Bacteria are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.The advent of culture-independent techniques, such as next-generation sequencing techniques (NGS), allows us to characterise the lung microbiome in different disease states.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e066091d0dec48e9d4fd530e5d9c4b1c4bcf7b4e0f8e67a624d1c044adea6c10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
