{"title":"Manuka Honey Inhibits Human Breast Cancer Progression in Preclinical Models","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0820/v1","date":1718179899000,"content":"Manuka honey (MH) exhibits potential antitumor activity in preclinical models of a number of human cancers. Treatment in vitro with MH at concentrations ranging from 0.3-5.0% (w/v) led to significant dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, but anti-proliferative effects of MH were less pronounced in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Effects of MH were also tested on non-malignant human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) at 2.5% w/v, and it was found that MH reduced proliferation of MCF-7 cells but not that of HMEC. Notably, the antitumor activity of MH was in the range of that exerted by treatment of MCF-7 cells with the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Further, MH treatment stimulated apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in vitro, with most cells exhibiting acute and significant levels of apoptosis that correlated with PARP activation. Additionally, effects of MH induced activation of AMPK and inhibition of AKT/mTOR downstream signaling. Treatment of MCF7 cells with increased concentrations of MH induced AMPK phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner that was accompanied by inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR downstream effector protein S6. In addition, MH reduced phosphorylated STAT3 levels in vitro which may correlate with MH and AMPK-mediated anti-inflammatory properties. Further, in vivo, MH administered alone significantly inhibited the growth of established MCF-7 tumors in nude mice by 84%, resulting in an observable reduction in tumor volume. Our findings highlight the need for further research into the use of natural compounds, such as MH, for antitumor efficacy and potential chemoprevention and investigation of molecular pathways underlying these actions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"021f47581ddf0fe5a1b7dba4ae6e13a66926c84d9ff041f79f46e24897fc1c3c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
