{"title":"Flexible Asymmetric Supercapacitors Constructed by Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoO3 and MnO2 Electrochemically Deposited on Carbon Cloth","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1852/v1","date":1716889899000,"content":"A flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASCs) is successfully developed by using the composite of MoO3 and graphene oxide (GO) electrochemically deposited on carbon cloth (CC) (MoO3/rGO/CC) as the negative electrode, the MnO2 deposited on CC (MnO2/CC) as the positive electrode and Na2SO4/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as gel electrolyte. The results show that the introduction of GO layer can remarkably increase the specific capacitance of MoO3 from 282.7 F g-1 to 341.0 F g-1. Furthermore, the combination of such good electrode materials and a neutral gel electrolyte renders the fabrication of high-performance ASC with a large operating potential difference of 1.6 V in 0.5 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution of water. Furthermore, the ASCs exhibit excellent cycle ability and the capacitance can maintain 87 % of its initial value after 6000 cycles. The fact that a light-emitting diode can be lighted up by the ASCs indicates the deviceâ€™s potential applications as energy storage devices. The encouraging results demonstrate a promising application of the composite of MoO3 and GO in energy storage devices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a431559f2e464665b9923336c27dc2a3142ab6a8f2176f37606c9a5784e8754c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
