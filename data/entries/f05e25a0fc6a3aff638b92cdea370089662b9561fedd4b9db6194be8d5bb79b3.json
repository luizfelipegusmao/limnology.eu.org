{"title":"Possible involvement of three-stemmed pseudoknots in regulating translational initiation in human mRNAs","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307541","date":1721656800000,"content":"<p>by Xiaolan Huang, Zhihua Du</p>\r\n\r\nRNA pseudoknots play a crucial role in various cellular functions. Established pseudoknots show significant variation in both size and structural complexity. Specifically, three-stemmed pseudoknots are characterized by an additional stem-loop embedded in their structure. Recent findings highlight these pseudoknots as bacterial riboswitches and potent stimulators for programmed ribosomal frameshifting in RNA viruses like SARS-CoV2. To investigate the possible presence of functional three-stemmed pseudoknots in human mRNAs, we employed in-house developed computational methods to detect such structures within a dataset comprising 21,780 full-length human mRNA sequences. Numerous three-stemmed pseudoknots were identified. A selected set of 14 potential instances are presented, in which the start codon of the mRNA is found in close proximity either upstream, downstream, or within the identified three-stemmed pseudoknot. These pseudoknots likely play a role in translational initiation regulation. The probability of their existence gains support from their ranking as the most stable pseudoknot identified in the entire mRNA sequence, structural conservation across homologous mRNAs, stereochemical feasibility as demonstrated by structural modeling, and classification as members of the CPK-1 pseudoknot family, which includes many well-established pseudoknots. Furthermore, in four of the mRNAs, two or three closely spaced or tandem three-stemmed pseudoknots were identified. These findings suggest the frequent occurrence of three-stemmed pseudoknots in human mRNAs. A stepwise co-transcriptional folding mechanism is proposed for the formation of a three-stemmed pseudoknot structure. Our results not only provide fresh insights into the structures and functions of pseudoknots but also unveil the potential to target pseudoknots for treating human diseases.","author":"Xiaolan Huang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"f05e25a0fc6a3aff638b92cdea370089662b9561fedd4b9db6194be8d5bb79b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
