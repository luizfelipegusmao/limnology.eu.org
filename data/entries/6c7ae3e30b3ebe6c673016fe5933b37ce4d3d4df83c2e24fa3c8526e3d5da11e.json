{"title":"<i>Treponema pallidum</i> subsp. <i>pallidum</i> strains DAL-1 and Philadelphia 1 differ in generation times <i>in vitro</i> as well as during experimental rabbit infection","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304033","date":1716559200000,"content":"<p>by Juraj Bosák, Lenka Mikalová, Matěj Hrala, Petra Pospíšilová, Martin Faldyna, David Šmajs</p>\r\n\r\nIn this work, we determined that <i>Treponema pallidum</i> subsp. <i>pallidum</i> (TPA) DAL-1 (belonging to Nichols-like group of TPA strains) grew 1.53 (± 0.08) times faster compared to TPA Philadelphia 1 (SS14-like group) during <i>in vitro</i> cultivations. In longitudinal individual propagation in rabbit testes (n = 12, each TPA strain), infection with DAL-1 manifested clinical symptoms (induration, swelling, and erythema of testes) sooner than Philadelphia 1 infection, which resulted in a significantly shorter period of the experimental passages for DAL-1 (median = 15.0 and 23.5 days, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). To minimize the confounding conditions during rabbit experiments, the growth characteristics of DAL-1 and Philadelphia 1 strains were determined during TPA co-infection of rabbit testes (n = 20, including controls). During two weeks of intratesticular co-infection, DAL-1 overgrew Philadelphia 1 in all twelve testes, regardless of inoculation ratio and dose (median of relative excess DAL-1 multiplication = 84.85×). Moreover, higher DAL-1 to Philadelphia 1 inoculum ratios appeared to increase differences in growth rates, suggesting direct competition between strains for available nutrients during co-infection. These experiments indicate important physiological differences between the two TPA strains and suggest growth differences between Nichols-like and SS14-like strains that are potentially linked to their virulence and pathogenicity.","author":"Juraj Bosák","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6c7ae3e30b3ebe6c673016fe5933b37ce4d3d4df83c2e24fa3c8526e3d5da11e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
