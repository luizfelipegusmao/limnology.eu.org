{"title":"Mitophagy suppression by miquelianin‐rich lotus leaf extract induces ‘beiging’ of white fat via AMPK/DRP1‐PINK1/PARKIN signaling axis","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13143?af=R","date":1709912947000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Lotus (<i>Nelumbo nucifera</i>) leaf has been described to have anti-obesity activity, but the role of white fat ‘browning’ or ‘beiging’ in its beneficial metabolic actions remains unclear. Here, 3T3-L1 cells and high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice were used to evaluate the effects of miquelianin-rich lotus leaf extract (LLE) on white-to-beige fat conversion and its regulatory mechanisms.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>Treatment with LLE increased mitochondrial abundance, mitochondrial membrane potential and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting its potential in promoting mitochondrial activity. qPCR and/or western blotting analysis confirmed that LLE induced the expression of beige fat-enriched gene signatures (e.g. Sirt1, Cidea, Dio2, Prdm16, Ucp1, Cd40, Cd137, Cited1) and mitochondrial biogenesis-related markers (e.g. Nrf1, Cox2, Cox7a, Tfam) in 3T3-L1 cells and inguinal white adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, we found that LLE treatment inhibited mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 and blocked mitophagy markers such as PINK1, PARKIN, BECLIN1 and LC-3B. Chemical inhibition experiments revealed that AMPK/DRP1 signaling was required for LLE-induced beige fat formation via suppressing PINK1/PARKIN/mitophagy.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our data reveal a novel mechanism underlying the anti-obesity effect of LLE, namely the induction of white fat beiging via AMPK/DRP1/mitophagy signaling. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Zhenyu Wang, \nTian Yang, \nMaomao Zeng, \nZhaojun Wang, \nQiuming Chen, \nJie Chen, \nMark Christian, \nZhiyong He","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"3e104859771820e7b04864c8ca81e18542d05788ec6bc3f447dcdaf3ab2238f5","category":"Environment"}
