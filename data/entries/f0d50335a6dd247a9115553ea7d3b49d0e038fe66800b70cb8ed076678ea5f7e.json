With the development of high spatial resolution mass spectrometers, isotopic data of mineral grains are rapidly accumulated. To dig up information from these data, molecular-level theoretical models are urgently needed. Based on the microscopic definition of the diffusion coefficient (<em>D</em>), a new theoretical framework for calculating the diffusional isotope effect (DIE<sub>(v)</sub>) (in terms of <em>D</em><sup><em>*</em></sup><em>/D</em>) for vacancy-mediated impurity diffusion in solids is provided based on statistical mechanics formalism. The newly derived equation shows that the DIE<sub>(v)</sub> can be easily calculated as long as the vibration frequencies of isotope-substituted solids are obtained. The calculated DIE<sub>(v)</sub> values of <sup>199</sup>Au/<sup>195</sup>Au and <sup>60</sup>Co/<sup>57</sup>Co during diffusion in Cu and Au metals are all within 1% of errors compared to the experimental data, which shows that this theoretical model is reasonable and precise.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"f0d50335a6dd247a9115553ea7d3b49d0e038fe66800b70cb8ed076678ea5f7e","category":"Environment"}
