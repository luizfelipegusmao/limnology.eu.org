{"title":"Persulfidation and phosphorylation of transcription factor SlWRKY6 differentially regulate tomato fruit ripening","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/210/7668393?rss=1","date":1715299200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cysteine desulfhydrase catalyses the generation of the signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in plants. In this study, we found that H<sub>2</sub>S can inhibit tomato (<span>Solanum lycopersicum</span>) fruit ripening and SlWRKY6 undergoes differential protein persulfidation in <span>SlLCD1</span>-overexpressing leaves. Then, further study indicated that SlWRKY6 could be persulfidated by H<sub>2</sub>S at Cys396. By construction of <span>slwrky6</span> mutants and <span>SlWRKY6-OE</span> lines, we found that SlWRKY6 positively regulates leaf senescence and fruit ripening by activating the transcription of ripening-related genes <span>STAYGREEN 1</span> (<span>SlSGR1</span>) and <span>Senescence-Associated Gene 12</span> (<span>SlSAG12</span>). In addition, SlWRKY6 interacted with kinase SlMAPK4 and was phosphorylated at Ser33. Dual-luciferase transient expression assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that SlWRKY6 persulfidation attenuated its transcriptional regulation of target genes <span>SlSGR1</span> and <span>SlSAG12</span>, whereas SlWRKY6 phosphorylation by SlMAPK4 activated the transcription of target genes to promote fruit ripening. Moreover, we provided evidence that SlWRKY6 persulfidation attenuated its SlMAPK4-mediated phosphorylation to inhibit tomato fruit ripening. By transient expression of SlWRKY6, SlWRKY6<sup>C396A</sup>, SlWRKY6<sup>S33A</sup>, and SlWRKY6<sup>S33D</sup> in <span>slwrky6</span> fruits, we found that SlWRKY6 persulfidation attenuated the expression of <span>SlSGR1</span> and <span>SlSAG12</span> thereby delaying tomato fruit ripening, while SlWRKY6 phosphorylation increased the expression of target genes. As tomato fruits ripened, endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S production decreased, while <span>SlMAPK4</span> expression increased. Therefore, our findings reveal a model in which SlWRKY6 persulfidation due to higher endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels in un-ripened fruit inhibits its ability to activate <span>SlSGR1</span> and <span>SlSAG12</span> expression, while SlWRKY6 phosphorylation by SlMAPK4 activates its transcriptional activity, thereby promoting tomato fruit ripening.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"563aa7334eb6db541b28c4ca6bb5dd39cbef3a125993ca8dce3856911a27a3bc","category":"Environment"}
