{"title":"Advanced Analytics and Data Management in the Procurement Function: An Aviation Industry Case Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1845/v1","date":1711704962000,"content":"The company strategic procurement function makes a significant contribution to overall corporate success, and yet remains under-researched in terms of digitalisation and digital maturity. This research adopts an inductive case study approach, using qualitative data from in-depth inter-views with industry practitioners, to develop and apply a digital maturity model for the deployment of strategic procurement analytics. The research presents a snapshot of the digital maturity of the strategic procurement function of a global aircraft manufacturer, and finds that current exploitation of analytics remains constrained by a range of factors, including the need for close compliance with regulatory norms. Thematic analysis of the interview material provides the basis for the development of the maturity model, which - although geared to a specific industry context - is nevertheless of relevance in other business environments. The research thus con-tributes to the existing literature in this field, and will also be of interest to procurement professionals. However, the research clearly has its limitations, not least in that it is based on just one industry case, and cross-industry generalisations from the findings must therefore be treated with caution.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3e6c1f9a9b1c670026c0dce4c66d2100c4b67985dfc3ebfaf8e22a04a279dba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
