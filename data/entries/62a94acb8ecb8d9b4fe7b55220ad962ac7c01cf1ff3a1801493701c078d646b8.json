{"title":"Enzymatic Desymmetrisation of Prochiral Meso-1,2-Disubstituted-1,2-Diaminoethane for the Synthesis of Key Enantioenriched (-)-Nutlin-3 Precursor","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1026/v1","date":1718371461000,"content":"Herein we present the biocatalysed preparation of mono-N-carbamate-protected precursor of antitumoral Nutlin-3a, through enantioselective alkoxycarbonylation of meso-1,2-disubstituted-1,2-diaminoethane, using enzyme lipases and dialkyl carbonates as acylating agents. A series of supported or free lipase enzymes were screened in combination with commercially available diallyl-, diethyl and dimethyl- carbonate. The reactions were conducted at different temperatures, reaction times and with variable co-solvent systems to evaluate the effect on the enzyme catalytic activity. The best results in terms of conversion, enantiomeric excess and yield were obtained when lipase from Candida antarctica B (CAL-B) was used with diallyl carbonate (DAC) conducting the reaction solventless at 75 Â°C.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"62a94acb8ecb8d9b4fe7b55220ad962ac7c01cf1ff3a1801493701c078d646b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
