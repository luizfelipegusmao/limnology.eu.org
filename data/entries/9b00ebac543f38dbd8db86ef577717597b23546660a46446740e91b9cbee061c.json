{"title":"Effect of Different Marinades and Types of Grills on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Content in Grilled Chicken Breast Tenderloins","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2349/v1","date":1727663281000,"content":"Grilling has become a widespread method of thermal food processing. However, food prepared this way may be a source of carcinogenic organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of different marinades and grilling tools on PAH contamination of chicken breast tenderloins. Together with the determination of PAHs carried out using the QuEChERS–HPLC–FLD/DAD method, the amount of meat weight loss after the thermal process and the color of raw and grilled samples were analyzed. Statistically, the highest levels of PAH contamination were stated in samples prepared on a charcoal grill without a tray, whereas the lowest using the ceramic contact grill. Meat marination showed that universal and chicken marinades can be barriers against PAHs. Following requirements set in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 915/2023, none of the analyzed samples exceeded the maximum allowable level for B[a]P (5.0 µg/kg), and the sum of 4 marker–heavy PAHs (30.0 µg/kg). Thus, preparing meat before the thermal process, including marinades rich in phenolic compounds, and selecting a grilling method with appropriate grilling tools can ensure food safety and effectively reduce PAH contamination in grilled poultry meat.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b00ebac543f38dbd8db86ef577717597b23546660a46446740e91b9cbee061c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
