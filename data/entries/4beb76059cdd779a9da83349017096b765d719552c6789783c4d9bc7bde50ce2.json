Crucial to unlocking the potential for these materials is understanding and controlling the origins of voltage fade. These materials make use of redox of lattice O<sup>2-</sup> ions which allows for increased energy densities beyond those offered by simply making use of transition metal (TM) redox. The problem of voltage fade can be caused by caused by the oxygen vacancy formation, reduction of TMs, TM migration and irreversible O-lattice distortions [<a href=\"#ozae044.571-B1\">1</a>] of the materials in cycling. Less well understood is the evolution of the cathode nanostructure on cycling, particularly the role of crystal defects.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"4beb76059cdd779a9da83349017096b765d719552c6789783c4d9bc7bde50ce2","category":"Environment"}
