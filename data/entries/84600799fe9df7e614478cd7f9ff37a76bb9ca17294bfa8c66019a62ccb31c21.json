In 1956, Jesmanowicz conjectured that for any positive integer w, the only solution of (aw)x+(bw)y=(cw)z in positive integers is (x, y, z) = (2, 2, 2). In this paper, based on Gaussian integer ring, we show that Je$\\acute{s}$manowicz' conjecture is true for any positive integer","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"84600799fe9df7e614478cd7f9ff37a76bb9ca17294bfa8c66019a62ccb31c21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
