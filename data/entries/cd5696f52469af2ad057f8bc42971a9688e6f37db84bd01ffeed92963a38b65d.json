{"title":"Modelling sludge dewatering in treatment reed bed considering sludge deposit formation","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40808-023-01930-z","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>The accumulation of sludge deposits is a crucial factor in the dewatering efficiency of sludge treatment reed bed (STRB). This paper presents an improved one-dimensional process-based mathematical model to simulate the dewatering mechanism in STRBs, in which the compressible cake filtration (CCF) theory was implemented to simulate the sludge deposits accumulation on the surface of the reed bed, while the varying sludge deposit thickness was accounted for using the moving mesh method. The proposed model also included the dual porosity variably saturated flow model and the Penmanâ€“Monteith equation to describe the dewatering through gravity drainage and evapotranspiration, respectively. The results from the model were validated with experimental data from laboratory-scale STRBs treating septage. The simulation results showed that considering the sludge deposit layer as a specific flow resistance effectively avoids the overprediction of water infiltration rate in the reed bed. The predicted results showed excellent agreement with the actual data, where only five cases of the root mean square error were above 10% compared to the average effluent flux. Further, the effect of evapotranspiration was found to be insignificant within a short-term simulation. The consideration of the influence of sludge deposit formation on drainage dewatering using the CCF model and moving mesh model has delivered a more robust simulation for sludge dewatering in STRBs, and the proposed model is capable of facilitating the understanding of the interactions between the sludge dewatering in STRB with respect to the bed characteristics, hydraulic load, and solid load.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"cd5696f52469af2ad057f8bc42971a9688e6f37db84bd01ffeed92963a38b65d","category":"Environment"}
