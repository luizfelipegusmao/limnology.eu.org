{"title":"Do First Ray-Related Angles Change Following Subtalar Arthroereisis in Pediatric Patients? A Radiographic Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.2015/v1","date":1714482174000,"content":"Introduction: Subtalar Arthroereisis (STA) is a surgical intervention for pediatric flexible flatfoot (PFF), primarily targeting hindfoot alignment by limiting excessive subtalar eversion. However, its effects on forefoot parameters remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate radiological changes following STA in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients treated with STA for PFF. First ray-related angles, including Hallux Valgus Angle (HVA) and Inter-Metatarsal Angle (IMA), alongside hindfoot radiological parameters such as Meary, Calcaneal Pitch, and Costa Bartani angles, were assessed. Subgroup analysis by gender was performed, and correlations between demographic and pre-operative radiological parameters were examined. Results: Forty-one patients (81 feet) with a mean age of 11.6 years were included, with a mean follow-up duration of 6.4 months. No significant differences were observed in first ray-related an-gles pre- and post-operatively, with mean IMA changing from 7.97째 to 7.18째 and mean HV angles from 9.51째 to 8.66째. Noteworthy improvements were seen in flat foot angles, including Meary, Calcaneal Pitch, and Costa Bartani angles, postoperatively. Age subgroup analysis revealed similar trends in IMA and HVA changes between Group A (operated before peak growth) and Group B (operated later). Higher preoperative angles tended to improve, while lower preoperative IMA and HVA tended to worsen postoperatively, all remaining within normal ranges. Conclusion: STA showed positive radiological outcomes for PFF treatment, while negligible changes in first ray-related angles were observed. Age subgroup analysis indicated similar trends regardless of operation timing. Higher preoperative angles tended to improve, while lower preoperative angles tended to worsen postoperatively, despite all falling within non-pathological ranges. Further re-search is warranted to confirm this correlation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82d716bf9a4d1cb65f026317ed6be9d84beb9cf00a8b30c85b3f4def838a11e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
