{"title":"Examining the causal relationship between sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and infertility: A Mendelian randomization study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304216","date":1717768800000,"content":"<p>by Hanghao Ma, Yan Chen</p>\r\nBackground <p>The causal relationship between sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and infertility has remained unclear. Thus, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate this relationship.</p> Methods <p>Risk factors for SHBG were extracted from European individuals within the UK Biobank using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Summary-level data for infertility outcomes were obtained from the FinnGen dataset. The causal relationship between SHBG and infertility was examined using inverse variance weighted, weighted model, weighted median, and MR-Egger regression analyses. Additionally, Cochranâ€™s Q test and Egger intercept tests were used to confirm the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of identified instrumental variables (IVs).</p> Results <p>Our findings revealed a significant negative association between sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and infertility, particularly with anovulation, a specific form of female infertility. However, SHBG did not exert a causal impact on male infertility or on female infertility of tubal origin.</p> Conclusions <p>SHBG expression offers protection against the development of certain types of female infertility, suggesting it is a potential therapeutic target for infertility.</p>","author":"Hanghao Ma","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"34777c5a98805b73067fbc8e303afaf0665bcae553081fcc7e3b525f806c65d7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
