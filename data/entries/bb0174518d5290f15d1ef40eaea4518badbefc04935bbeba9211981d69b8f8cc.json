Consequently, there is a growing interest in automating processes related to the extraction, storage and labelling of these images, especially for electron microscopy [<a href=\"#ozae044.166-B1\">1</a>]. However, identifying and categorizing microscopy images poses challenges due to the limited availability of extensive labelled image databases.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"bb0174518d5290f15d1ef40eaea4518badbefc04935bbeba9211981d69b8f8cc","category":"Environment"}
