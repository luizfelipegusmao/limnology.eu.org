{"title":"Emerging Cybersecurity and Privacy Threats of ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot: Current Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1909/v1","date":1729758474000,"content":"Generative AI chatbots have emerged as a significant scientific contribution. They can produce text, images, audio, and video, and their applications are vast and varied in every field. However, it is identified that these chatbots can be used by script kiddies and malicious actors to generate phishing emails, security exploits, and executable payloads that can present notable risks and challenges for cybersecurity. This research provides an extensive review of the current status of the three most popular generative AI chatbots which are ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Bing. The article further reviews the different ways in which an attacker can intentionally use a chatbot for malicious activities and intensify cyber attacks. Moreover, the article provides insights on how an attacker uses certain keyword queries to manipulate chatbot behavior and tricks it into generating content that I wonâ€™t otherwise. We also explored the role of AI chatbots in enhancing cyber resilience against sophisticated attacks and their applications in detecting and mitigating security incidents. Finally, we proposed strategies that can empower modern chatbots to defend against such threats so that an attacker will not be able to bypass their content filtering mechanisms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91f6b8a9bd2fd54aed453d994cdaaa20ba7bca2627d80fdcae64da0c9bc666c0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
