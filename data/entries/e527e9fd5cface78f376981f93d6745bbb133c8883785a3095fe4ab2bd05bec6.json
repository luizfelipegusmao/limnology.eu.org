Because of their expected lower cervical cancer risk, we must reassess our screening strategies. We analyzed Danish HPV-vaccinated women’s outcomes after the first screening test at age 23.</p> Methods and findings <p>Our study was embedded in Danish routine cytology-based screening. We conducted an observational study and included women born in 1994, offered the 4-valent HPV vaccine at age 14, and subsequently invited to screening at age 23. Cervical cytology was used for diagnostics and clinical management. Residual material was HPV tested with Cobas® 4800/6800. The most severe histology diagnosis within 795 days of screening was found through linkage with the Danish National Pathology Register. We calculated the number of women undergoing follow-up (repeated testing and/or colposcopy) per detected cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+). A total of 6021 women were screened; 92% were HPV-vaccinated; 12% had abnormal cytology; 35% were high-risk HPV-positive, including 0.9% HPV16/18 positive, and 20% had follow-up. In women that were cytology-abnormal and HPV-positive (Cyt+/HPV+), 610 (98.5%) had been followed up, and 138 CIN2+ cases were diagnosed, resulting in 4.4 (95% CI 3.9–5.2) women undergoing follow-up per detected CIN2+. In contrast to recommendations, 182 (12.2%) cytology-normal and HPV-positive (Cyt-/HPV+) women were followed up within 795 days, and 8 CIN2+ cases were found, resulting in 22.8 (95% CI 13.3–59.3) women undergoing follow-up per detected CIN2+.</p> Conclusion <p>Overall, HPV prevalence was high in HPV-vaccinated women, but HPV16/18 had largely disappeared. In the large group of cytology-normal and HPV-positive women, 23 had been followed up per detected CIN2+ case. Our data indicated that primary HPV screening of young HPV-vaccinated women would require very effective triage methods to avoid an excessive follow-up burden.</p> Trial registration <p>Trial registration number: NCT0304955.</p>","author":"Mette Hartmann Nonboe","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e527e9fd5cface78f376981f93d6745bbb133c8883785a3095fe4ab2bd05bec6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
