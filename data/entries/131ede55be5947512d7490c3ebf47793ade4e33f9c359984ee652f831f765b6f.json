These tissues are often employed by organisms to sustain large and/or repeated loads in a challenging chemical environment for prolonged periods of time. Pure, monolithic HA is a rather brittle material, but through a combination of complex and hierarchical design elements from the micro- to the nanoscale, it can endure decades of use. Recent studies of human dental enamel have indicated that there exist chemical gradients within the HA nanocrystals (cross section âˆ¼50 x 100 nm), inducing a residual stress on the surface of the nanocrystal to resist fracture while simultaneously improving the resistance to dissolution [<a href=\"#ozae044.028-B1\">1</a>]. Thus, building a strong and accurate understanding of the nanoscale composition is fundamental to further therapeutic efforts to rebuild or integrate with HA-based biominerals.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"131ede55be5947512d7490c3ebf47793ade4e33f9c359984ee652f831f765b6f","category":"Environment"}
