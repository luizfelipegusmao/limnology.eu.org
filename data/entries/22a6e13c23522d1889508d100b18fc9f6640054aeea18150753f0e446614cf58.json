{"title":"&beta;-tocotrienol and &delta;-tocotrienol as Additional Inhibitors of the Main Protease of Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus: An In-Silico Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0532/v1","date":1720401935000,"content":"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a severe and invariably fatal disease affecting both domestic and wild felines with limited effective therapeutic options available. By considering the significant immunomodulatory effects of vitamin E observed in both animal and human models under physiological and pathological conditions, we have provided a full in-silico investigation of vitamin E and related compounds and their effect on the crystal structure of feline infectious peritonitis virus 3C-like protease (FIPV-3CLpro). This work revealed the β-tocotrienol and δ-tocotrienol analogues as inhibitor candidates for this protein, suggesting their potential as possible drug compounds against FIP or their supplementary use with current medicines against this disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"22a6e13c23522d1889508d100b18fc9f6640054aeea18150753f0e446614cf58","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
