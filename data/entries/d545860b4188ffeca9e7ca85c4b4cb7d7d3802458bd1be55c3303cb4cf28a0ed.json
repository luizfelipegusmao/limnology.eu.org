{"title":"NPCC4: Tail risk, climate drivers of extreme heat, and new methods for extreme event projections","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.15180?af=R","date":1724093094000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>We summarize historic New York City (NYC) climate change trends and provide the latest scientific analyses on projected future changes based on a range of global greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Building on previous NPCC assessment reports, we describe new methods used to develop the projections of record for sea level rise, temperature, and precipitation for NYC, across multiple emissions pathways and analyze the issue of the “hot models” associated with the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and their potential impact on NYC's climate projections. We describe the state of the science on temperature variability within NYC and explain both the large-scale and regional dynamics that lead to extreme heat events, as well as the local physical drivers that lead to inequitable distributions of exposure to extreme heat. We identify three areas of tail risk and potential for its mischaracterization, including the physical processes of extreme events and the effects of a changing climate. Finally, we review opportunities for future research, with a focus on the <i>hot model problem</i> and the intersection of spatial resolution of projections with gaps in knowledge in the impacts of the climate signal on intraurban heat and heat exposure.</p>","author":"Luis Ortiz, \nChristian Braneon, \nRadley Horton, \nDaniel Bader, \nPhilip Orton, \nVivien Gornitz, \nBernice Rosenzweig, \nTimon McPhearson, \nLauren Smalls‐Mantey, \nHadia Sheerazi, \nFranco A.
