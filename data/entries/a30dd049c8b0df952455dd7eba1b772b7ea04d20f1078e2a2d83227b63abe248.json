Findings reveal that heightened alkalinity exacerbates rock damage, although a temporary alleviation in mass loss occurs between pH 9 and 11 due to pore clogging by complexes formed from cations like Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.Increased alkalinity induces marked changes in pore features, with an observed rise in pore numbers, transformation of pore shapes from elongated to more spherical, and adjustments in porosity, pore size, and roundness. Furthermore, the study confirms a decline in both the rockâ€™s compressive strength and elastic modulus as pH rises. These revelations shed light on the role of pH in the corrosion behavior of weakly cemented sandstone under alkaline conditions, providing a fresh perspective for understanding its corrosion mechanisms in such environments.","author":"Jie Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a30dd049c8b0df952455dd7eba1b772b7ea04d20f1078e2a2d83227b63abe248","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
