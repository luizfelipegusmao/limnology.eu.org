{"title":"Status, variation, development, and utilization of water resources in China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.70?af=R","date":1703089729000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The information about China's water resources yield and its utilization have been publicly released by its annual <i>China Water Resources Bulletin</i> since 1998. This paper introduces the facts of China's water resources and its development and utilization in 2022 and analyzes the variation of water resources, water supply structure, water use volume, and efficiency. In 2022, both precipitation and total volume of water resources in China were less than normal, and were unevenly distributed both temporally and geographically. There has been some decrease in water storage of some large- and medium-sized reservoirs, while the storage of lakes has remained relatively stable. Total water use increased to some extent compared with that in 2021, with further improvements of efficiency and pattern of water uses. There was no significant trend of change on annual precipitation and water resources in China from 1956 to 2022, but the capability of runoff generation in North China showed a decrease. To ensure national water security, China has made great effort to cope with the impacts of climate change and human activities by refined management of surface water resources and groundwater resources, as well as ambitious water-saving goals.</p>","author":"Yaqin Qiu, \nChunfeng Hao, \nLing Jia, \nYingying Shen, \nHaiying Liu, \nZhuoran Wang","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"b5b8e28595be5ab73cddf7f35abb5500eedac03e79798cb58d8eb2a1047bd142","category":"Environment"}
