With certain aspects of their morphology and behavior more characteristic of plants than of insects, they can avoid detection by visually orienting insect-eating predators. This attribute is reflected by the names people (including entomologists) have given them. Depending on the vegetation they resemble, they’re variously known as “walking sticks,” “stick insects,” or “leaf insects,” although beyond sticks and leaves, there are species that resemble twigs, branches, blades of grass, bark, moss, lichen, and other bits of vegetation. Not all common names reference plants, however; other common names of North American species include “devil rider,” “musk mare,” and, mystifyingly, “prairie alligator” (<span>Anisomorpha ferruginea</span>). Behaving like vegetation—i.e., responding to disturbance with catalepsy (suppression of fast movements in response to external perturbations) and thanatosis (“death-feigning” or suppression of voluntary movement) helps reinforce the camouflage (<a href=\"#CIT0009\">Büschges et al. 2021</a>).</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"American Entomologist Current Issue","siteHash":"718e0ce511af4548d0dc98d99e3fcb2a0cedb968506172cfd4871c3567f613f2","entryHash":"87eb02474562f6867e9d9218cf1718b1efcf050bdfd0fca7bba79a69e02c5121","category":"Environment"}
