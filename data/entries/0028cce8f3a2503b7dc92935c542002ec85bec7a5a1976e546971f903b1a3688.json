{"title":"Influence of Vermicompost on the Concentration of Exogenous Indole-3-Acetic Acid and Its Effect on the Development of Tomato Plants (Lycopersicum esculentum L.)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1480/v2","date":1717505589000,"content":"The presence of exogenous auxins such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), has been reported in organic materials such as vermicompost. The objectives of this work were to quantify the concentration of IAA in sand-based substrates with vermicompost (S-VC), to establish the relationship between the concentration of exogenous IAA and the amount of vermicompost (VC), as well as determine its influence on the development of tomato plants. S-VC substrates with different percentages based on volume (0, 20, 40 and 50% VC) placed in pots were used to transplant tomato seedlings. In each substrate, the concentration of IAA was determined at the beginning and at the end of a culture cycle, as well as the bacterial load. In addition, some performance components were measured in the plants. The results show that by increasing 1 kg of VC in a sand-based substrate, the concentration of exogenous IAA increases both at the beginning and at the end of the experiment (0.0470 and 0.0642 mg g-1, respectively); a result that, in turn, was related to the colony-forming units of gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus spp., mainly). Behavior that is reflected in tomato plants; for example, the root had its maximum development (371.33 cm-3) when the amount of VC in the substrate was 4.12 kg.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"0028cce8f3a2503b7dc92935c542002ec85bec7a5a1976e546971f903b1a3688","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
