{"title":"Circular Defect in 2-Dimensional Photonic Crystal Laser With Convex Edge Structure","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1936/v1","date":1719481208000,"content":"We have developed circular defects in 2-dimensional photonic crystal lasers that allow current injection for interconnected optical communications. However, when cleaving the sample to measure the output light, the output light intensity changes due to the cleaving position. In a previous study, we discovered through simulation that this effect could be eliminated and that a higher optical output might be obtained by applying a convex edge structure. In this paper, we develop the fabrication technology for this structure, fabricate samples, and measure the output light experimentally. Room-temperature continuous-wave laser oscillations using this structure are observed. The laser threshold is similar to well-lasing samples with normal cleavage edge faces. We are assured that these results contribute to future work such as accurate manufacturing and improving the end-face configuration to obtain higher outputs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6e3e1202ec1a37dea416c098b85eb4c5f4cd2257ab4ff6c368f02c37c1beee95","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
