{"title":"Pulmonary Artery Obstruction Index, Biomarkers, and their Prognostic Value in Different Ethiologies of Pulmonary Embolism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1287/v1","date":1721109408000,"content":":. Background and Objectives: Pulmonary embolism, PE, incidence had been increasing in the last ten years. Computed thoracic pulmonary angiography, CTPA, had a major role in confirming PE di-agnosis.The main purpose of the study was to establish the prognostic value of a CTPA parameter: pulmonary artery obstruction index, PAOI, for PE risk assessment . A second objective of the re-search was to investigate the predictive accuracy of biomarkers (D-dimer, and cardiac Troponin T, c-TnT ), and PAOI, in 7-day mortality. The third objective of the study was the relationship between PAOI, and these biomarkers, in different etiologies of PE. Materials and Methods: The study com-prised 109 patients with PE, hospitalized, and treated between February 2021, and August 2022. They had different etiologies: deep vein thrombosis, DVT; persistent atrial fibrillation, AF; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, exacerbation; Covid; and cancers. The investigations were the following: clinical examination; D-dimer testing, as a mandatory method for PE suspicion( values ≥ 500 µg/L were highly suggestive for PE); c-TnT , as a marker of myocardial injury(values ≥ 14 ng/L were abnormal); CTPA, with right ventricle dysfunction, RVD, signs, and PAOI. Treat-ments were according to PE risk: systemic thrombolysis (in high risk , and hemodynamic instability); low weight molecular heparins, LWMH, after systemic thrombolysis, or in high risk PE, with he-modynamic stability; direct oral anticoagulants, DOAC (in low, and intermediate risk). Results: The relationship PAOI- D-dimer, and PAOI- c-TnT, had very strong statistical correlation, for the entire sample, and for DVT, AF, COPD, Covid subgroups ( Rho = 0.815-0.982). PAOI had a high predic-tive accuracy for intermediate , and high risk together (area under curve, AUC=0.948), and high risk PE (AUC= 0.993). For 7-day mortality, D-dimer , and c-TnT had high predictive accura-cy(AUC=0.921, and 0.979). PAOI had statistical significance for 7-day mortality in Covid (p=0.045), and cancer (p=0.038) patients. Conclusions: PAOI was an important tool for PE risk as-sessment. D-dimer , and c-TnT were valuable predictors, for 7-day mortality in PE. PAOI, and D-dimer; PAOI, and c-TnT were strongly correlated, for the entire PE sample, and for DVT, AF, COPD, and Covid patients.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"362a87301754b44e6a1a858b06aef04f4d658b09d70d585d7986d820f87a89cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
