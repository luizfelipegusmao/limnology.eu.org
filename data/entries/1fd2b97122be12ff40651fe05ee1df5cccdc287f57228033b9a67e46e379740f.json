Although banned in some countries, paraquat (PQ) is commonly used to control weeds. In this study, we investigated the effects of increasing concentrations of PQ on <i>S</i>. <i>maltophilia</i> and its antimicrobial resistance. The sequential exposure of <i>S</i>. <i>maltophilia</i> K279a to increasing concentrations of PQ induces the formation of strains with increased resistance to PQ. Among the 400 PQ-resistant isolates tested, 70 clones were resistant to 16 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (CIP), and around 18% of the PQ/CIP-resistant isolates showed increased resistance to all the tested antimicrobials including, the aminoglycosides, quinolones, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole. The results of the expression analysis of the antimicrobial resistance genes in the five selected PQ/CIP-resistant isolates demonstrated the high expression of genes encoding efflux pumps (<i>smeYZ</i>, <i>smaAB</i>, <i>smaCDEF</i>, <i>smeDEF</i>, <i>smeVWX</i>, and <i>smtcrA</i>) and the enzymes <i>aph(3’)-IIc</i>, <i>blaL1</i>, and <i>blaL2</i>. However, expression of the genes known for PQ resistance (i.e., <i>mfsA</i> and <i>sod</i>) were not altered relative to the wild-type levels. Whole genome sequence analysis identified gene mutations that could account for the antimicrobial resistance, namely, <i>smeT</i> (TetR family regulatory protein), <i>rplA</i> (ribosomal protein L1), and <i>acnA</i> (aconitase A). Ectopic expression of wild-type AcnA partially complemented the fluoroquinolone-resistant phenotype of the mutant with mutated <i>acnA</i>, which suggests the role of aconitase A in antimicrobial susceptibility. Exposure of <i>S</i>. <i>maltophilia</i> to PQ thus induces the development of strains that increase resistance to multiple antimicrobials.","author":"Veerakit Vanitshavit","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"1fd2b97122be12ff40651fe05ee1df5cccdc287f57228033b9a67e46e379740f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
