{"title":"Fine Tuning of an Advanced Planner for Cognitive Training of Older Adults","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0458/v1","date":1720131547000,"content":"Developing effective cognitive training tools for older adults, specifically addressing executive functions such as planning, is a challenging task. It is of paramount importance to ensure the implementation of engaging activities, which must be tailored to the specific needs and expectations of older adults. Furthermore, it is essential to provide the appropriate level of complexity for the planning task. A human-centred approach was employed to address the issues identified in the design of the tool. Two pilot studies were conducted with older adults to fine-tune the training task and optimise its suitability for them. This also led to an enhancement of the underlying planning engine, transitioning from simple fast-forward planner (PDDL4J) to an advanced heuristic search planner (ENHSP). The results show that conducting user studies enabled the development of a cognitive training system that gradually increases the proposed difficulty levels of the planning task while maintaining usability and satisfaction among older adults. This highlights the importance of conducting user studies when implementing cognitive training tools for older adults.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c6e6039bc0174f48cf1179a0b01fa3c1245045f6ce22eca392347b4d6cf8d8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
