{"title":"Experiential-sensorial adaptive system model for hospitality based on 360° VR videos and case-based reasoning","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299387","date":1710165600000,"content":"<p>by Luis Alfaro, Claudia Rivera, Jorge Luna-Urquizo, Francisco Ayala, Lucy Delgado, Elisa Castañeda</p>\r\n\r\nIn this work, an adaptive software architecture is proposed for the generation of experiences for hotel promotion and marketing, based on Case-based Reasoning (CBR) that uses the attributes and user characteristics and immersive 360° videos. Considering that immersion in virtual reality (VR) environments can trigger responses in various dimensions, such as affective, cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral dimensions, these dimensions are evaluated in immersive environments with 360° videos. To validate the results obtained with the software architecture, a quasi-experimental study was conducted through the evaluation of the experience, consisting in the visualization of the environments of a boutique hotel, with a sample of a randomly selected group of young people. The contribution of this work lies in the use of 360° VR videos, for the visualization of the hotel characteristics and environments according the user profiles, to evaluate the affective, cognitive and attitudinal and behavioral responses and their influence on the booking intention and attitude. Finally, conclusions and recommendations for future work have been established.","author":"Luis Alfaro","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"57927eacf453c5f5c6a37b81ea5a8a7c8f3dd223c6639bc52280c02eca39a3ef","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
