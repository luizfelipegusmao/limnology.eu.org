Advances in whole genome sequencing techniques provide greater resolution of genome-wide genetic diversity and inbreeding. Subspecies of golden eagles (<span>Aquila chrysaetos</span>) in Scotland (<span>A. c. chrysaetos</span>) and Japan (<span>A. c. japonica</span>) are endangered; it is therefore important to understand genetic diversity and inbreeding of these small island populations to increase the chances of conservation success. We investigated this using whole genome sequencing data from golden eagles in Scotland, continental Europe, Japan, and the USA. Following determination of population genetic structure, analysis of heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity revealed reduced levels of genetic diversity together with runs of homozygosity, suggesting evidence of inbreeding attributable to recent shared parental ancestry in the island populations. These results highlight the need to consider genetic reinforcement of small isolated golden eagle populations from neighbouring outbred populations, alongside existing efforts to boost population size through within-island conservation translocations and captive breeding programmes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"49e2627ca4236f035605387a5e9b308f0f71198bce05f1a2f79007f5fd444361","entryHash":"604b40faf383ffc665f3118b852fc314518201119ab8198ab22af492e9e5e281","category":"Environment"}
