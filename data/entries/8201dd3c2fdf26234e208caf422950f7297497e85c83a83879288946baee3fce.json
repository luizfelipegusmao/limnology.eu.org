{"title":"The Hidden Loopholes Undermining Photonic Quantum Nonlocality: Quantum Rayleigh Scattering and Time-Dependent  States of Independent Photons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202307.2077/v6","date":1719494808000,"content":"TThe locality condition of probabilities underpinning the derivation of Bell inequalities can be violated classically. The wave function collapse of an entangled state of single photons results in the factorization of quantum probabilities. It is possible to differentiate, locally, between ensemble probabilities of single detections with and without wave function collapse for the alleged quantum nonlocality. The theoretical concept of photonic quantum nonlocality cannot be implemented physically because of the quantum Rayleigh scattering of single photons. A distinction needs to be made between the correlation of individual, single measurements of pure states and the correlation of the measurement ensemble of the mixed states. The correlation operator of Pauli vector operators delivers the same probabilities of correlated detections of photons for both independent and multi-photon states as for ‘entangled’ states of photons. As single-photon sources are not needed, the design and implementation of quantum computing operations and other devices will be significantly streamlined.  © 2024 The Author","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8201dd3c2fdf26234e208caf422950f7297497e85c83a83879288946baee3fce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
