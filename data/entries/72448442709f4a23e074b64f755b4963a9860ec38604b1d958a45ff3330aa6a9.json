{"title":"Associations between Meal Patterns and Risk of Overweight/Obesity and Metabolically Unhealthy Obesity in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies and Randomised Controlled Trials","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2593/v1","date":1722431641000,"content":"Childhood overweight/obesity (OV/OB) is a major public health problem, of greater concern when accompanied with comorbidities such as hypertension and insulin resistance leading to metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). Aetiologic associations between meal patterns, OV/OB risk and MUO are limited. The aim of this systematic review was to explore associations between meal patterns and the risk of childhood OV/OB and MUO. Longitudinal studies and randomised controlled trials from PUBMED and Scopus published between January 2013 - April 2024 were retrieved. Twenty-eight studies were included, all of which reported on OV/OB risk; none on MUO risk. Regular consumption of breakfast and family meals and avoiding dining while watching TV may be protective factors against childhood OV/OB, whereas meal skipping (primarily breakfast) may be a detrimental factor. Mixed effects of meal frequency on OV/OB risk were observed; no effects of frequency of lunch or of fast-food consumption and of meals served at school were found. There was insufficient evidence to support the role of other patterns (meal timing, eating in other social contexts). Meals were mainly participant-identified, leading to increased heterogeneity. Research focusing on childhood MUO and improved methodological approach (e.g. harmonised definitions) regarding the assessment of meal patterns are highly warranted.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"72448442709f4a23e074b64f755b4963a9860ec38604b1d958a45ff3330aa6a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
