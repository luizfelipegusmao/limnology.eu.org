{"title":"Bioactive Polysaccharides from Gracilaria lemaneiformis: Preparation, Structures, and Therapeutic Insights","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0022/v1","date":1722508518000,"content":"Gracilaria lamaneiformis, a red seaweed, is an abundant source of bioactive polysaccharides with significant health-promoting properties. Nevertheless, the broad application of G. lamaneiformis in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical sectors remains constrained due to the absence of comprehensive data. This review provides a detailed examination of the preparation methods, structural characteristics, and biological activities of G. lamaneiformis polysaccharides (GLP). We explore both conventional and advanced extraction techniques, highlighting the efficiency and yield improvements achieved through methods such as microwave-, ultrasonic-, and enzyme-assisted extraction. The structural elucidation of GLP using modern analytical techniques, including high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is discussed, providing comprehensive insights into their molecular composition and configuration. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the diverse biological activities of GLP, including their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and gut microbiota modulation properties. This review underscores the therapeutic potential of GLP and suggests future research directions to fully harness their health benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dda940fc69af40bbd6ae81ceac3387e25d197f4f411a30802dd302b8c80257b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
