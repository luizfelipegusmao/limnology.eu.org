This study evaluated the gonadal morphology of freshwater fish exposed to pyriproxyfen and fenthion. Forty-five juvenile male Nile tilapias (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>) were divided into control, pyriproxyfen-exposed (0.01 g/L), and fenthion-exposed (0.001 g/L) groups. They were evaluated in three moments (30, 60, and 90 days). The variables analyzed were the gonadosomatic index (GSI), weight to length ratio, seminiferous tubules morphometry (diameter and height), tissue damage, and immunohistochemical analysis for caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Pyriproxyfen and fenthion injured the seminiferous tubule tissue, and the damage progressed according to the exposure time. In addition, the GSI gradually reduced over time in all groups compared with the first moment (30 days), while caspase-3, TNF-α, and VEGF values increased only in the fenthion-exposed group. Therefore, pyriproxyfen and fenthion changed the gonadal morphology of male <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>, which may affect their reproduction in the wild or captivity.</p>","author":"Glaucia Moises Marques e Silva, \nJorge Eduardo Lins Oliveira, \nNaisandra B.
