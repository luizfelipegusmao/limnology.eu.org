{"title":"Acute impacts of invasive toads on the population demography of a native predator in tropical Australia","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10530-024-03419-x","date":1730419200000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>If an animalâ€™s size, age and/or sex influence its vulnerability to an invasive species, the arrival of such an invader can cause rapid changes in the population demography of an affected species. We studied free-ranging varanid lizards (Yellow-spotted monitors, <em>Varanus panoptes</em>) at a site in tropical Australia during the influx of fatally toxic cane toads, <em>Rhinella marina</em>. Mortality was inferred from shifts in population structure, as well as the survival rates (time to death) of 107 radio-tracked lizards. Of 57 deaths whose cause was unambiguous, 32 were due to fatal poisoning by ingesting a cane toad; the other 25 lizards were consumed by pythons. Size and age structure shifted between years, such that the population post-invasion was dominated by smaller, younger lizards, and by females rather than males. Radiotelemetric monitoring confirmed that survival rates were reduced more in males than in females in the post-toad year, with males most at risk late in the dry-season, when food was scarce and females were nesting rather than foraging. Pythons disproportionately consumed larger female lizards during the nesting season. Toad-induced poisoning of adult male varanids (which are larger and bolder than females) likely produced a population that was more resilient to toad impact, but less easily surveyed by conventional techniques.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Ecology","siteHash":"1089acfc3d822f13908492f60c57e4969750bab33665a32c6ecd61d1e946f905","entryHash":"a57162fbee9841819c84f6232a3c257f16c0afabec133295c27a75e046ba8cb7","category":"Environment"}
