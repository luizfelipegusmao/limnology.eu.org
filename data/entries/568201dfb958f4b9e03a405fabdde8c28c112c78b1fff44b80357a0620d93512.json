In this study, a two-stage expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors system has been investigated at both bench and pilot scale for the treatment of complex and toxic real wastewater from a petrochemical industry. The effect of different operational parameters including organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and influent characteristics over COD removal and biogas production and composition have been studied. Additionally, biomass specific methanogenic activity (SMA) and wastewater toxicity have been evaluated after long-term operation. Optimum total HRT of 24 h has been determined resulting in total COD and SO<sub>4</sub>\n<sup>2−</sup> removal of 56.30 ± 5.25% and 31.68 ± 14.71%, respectively, at pilot scale, and average biogas production of 93.47 ± 34.92 NL/day with 67.01 ± 10.23 %CH<sub>4</sub> content and 5210.11 ± 6802.27 ppmv of H<sub>2</sub>S. SMA and toxicity tests have confirmed inhibitory and toxic effects of wastewater over anaerobic biomass with average maximum inhibition of 65.34% in the unacclimated anaerobic inoculum while chronic toxicity produced a decrease of an order of magnitude in SMA after 600 days of operation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying an anaerobic treatment to this wastewater using EGSB reactors between a 0.97–1.74 gCOD/L/day OLR range. Nonetheless, periodic reinoculation would be necessary for long-term operation due to chronic toxicity of the wastewater exerted on the anaerobic biomass.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nA two-stage EGSB reactors system has been operated at bench and pilot scale to treat complex and toxic petrochemical wastewater.\nOptimal total HRT of 24 h resulted in average COD removal ranging from 40% to 60%.\nSMA and toxicity tests have been performed to study long-term acclimation, detecting an activity depletion of an order of magnitude.\n</p>","author":"Ruben Garcia‐Tirado, \nEmma Fernandez‐Crespo, \nXavier Font, \nTeresa Vicent, \nJuan Peralta, \nDelia Trifi, \nRaul Martinez‐Cuenca, \nSergio Chiva","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"568201dfb958f4b9e03a405fabdde8c28c112c78b1fff44b80357a0620d93512","category":"Environment"}
