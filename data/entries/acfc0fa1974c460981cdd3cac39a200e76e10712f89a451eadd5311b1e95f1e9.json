{"title":"Effects of tourism resource search on folk sports project development fuzzy front-end performance: The moderating role of environmental dynamics change","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304161","date":1716991200000,"content":"<p>by Chuanwen Yu, Mengmeng Liu, Hong Yang, Bei Wu</p>\r\n\r\nHow to improve the success of new project development through the collection of resources in the preliminary stages of new project development is a new area of research. Given the speed and magnitude of changes in the folk sports market environment, this study analyses the impact of tapping folk tourism resources on sports projects at the project development stage. Through stratified regression analyses of 600 Chinese firms engaged in folk sports project development, this paper finds that tapping internal tourism resources positively affects the Fuzzy Front-End Performance of incremental innovative project development. In contrast, tapping external tourism resources positively affects the Fuzzy Front-End Performance of breakthrough innovation projects. The study also indicates that the speed of environmental change (SEC) positively moderates the relationship between exploring external tourism resources (ERS) and Fuzzy Front-End Performance of incremental innovation projects. In contrast, the magnitude of environmental change (MEC) negatively moderated the relationship between internal tourism resource exploration (IRS) and the FFE-P of similar projects.","author":"Chuanwen Yu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"acfc0fa1974c460981cdd3cac39a200e76e10712f89a451eadd5311b1e95f1e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
