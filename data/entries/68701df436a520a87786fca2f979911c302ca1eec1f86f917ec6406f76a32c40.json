A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of asthma was admitted to a local hospital due to dyspnea, cough, and wheezing where she was diagnosed with HIV infection, ARDS, and combined pneumocystis and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Her pulmonary function quickly declined neces-sitating mechanical ventilation (MV). After she failed all conventional therapies, she was trans-ferred to a tertiary medical center for VV-ECMO therapy. Patient was successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), antibiotics, antivirals, steroids, and 48 days of VV-ECMO support, with complete resolution of her respiratory symptoms. She was discharged on hospital day 82. HIV positive patients with ARDS complicated by opportunistic pulmonary infections can be successfully managed with ART, appropriate anti-infective therapies, and VV-ECMO.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"68701df436a520a87786fca2f979911c302ca1eec1f86f917ec6406f76a32c40","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
