{"title":"Prevalence of major depressive disorder and its determinants among young married women and unmarried girls: Findings from the second round of UDAYA survey","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306071","date":1719928800000,"content":"<p>by Shromona Dhara, Joyeeta Thakur, Neelanjana Pandey, Arupendra Mozumdar, Subho Roy</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Depression is a prevalent and debilitating mental illness affecting young women worldwide. This study aimed to identify psychosocial determinants of major depressive disorder (MDD) among young women in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India.</p> Methods <p>Data from \"Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults\" (UDAYA) study (2018-19) for young women aged 12-23 years, both married and unmarried was used for this paper. MDD was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 with a cut-off score of ≤10. The determinants of MDD were identified through multilevel binary logistic regression analysis.</p> Results <p>The prevalence of MDD was 13.6% (95% CL 12.2-15.2) and 5.1% (95% CL 4.2-6.1) for young married women and unmarried girls, respectively. Among the young married women, community-level variables like dowry-related humiliation (1.74, 95% CI 1.15-2.64), and sexual assaults (2.15, 95% CI 1.24-3.73) were significantly associated with MDD. For unmarried girls, reporting of family violence <sub>&lt;10% of participants</sub> (0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.85), family violence <sub>(≥10% of participants) %</sub> (0.35 95% CI 0.19-0.68) and interpartner violence <sub>(&gt;25% of participants)</sub> (0.42; 95% CI 0.23-0.74) remain significant predictors of MDD. At individual level, for both the groups, age, participation in decision making (on education), social capital (currently attending school/educational course and number of friends), self-efficacy, telephonic harassment, and physical activity were associated with MDD. Wealth index, job seeking, participation in decision making (on health-seeking), parental interactions and physical abuse (for unmarried girls only) and education, reported last sexual intercourse, pressure from the in-laws’ to conceive (for young married women only) were associated with MDD.</p> Conclusions <p>For young married women, community level targeted interventions should focus on the social ecology to foster a sense of safe community environment. For unmarried girls, additionally, interventions should aim to optimize their family environment for effective mental health outcomes.</p>","author":"Shromona Dhara","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"ae529d1cd9367c318a12238898fd449c8a468844cfb15dcd852f0d0211a4f9a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
