{"title":"Navigating Uncertainty in High-Frequency Trading: A DIKWP Model Approach to Compliance and Strategy under the Financial Regulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0141/v1","date":1712035282000,"content":"The paper examines the various uncertainties encountered in high-frequency trading (HFT) environments and delves into the multiple challenges faced by HFT firms in navigating the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (referred to as the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), particularly during the initial stages of its enactment. These challenges include the ambiguity surrounding the definition of HFT, the lack of clarity regarding regulatory requirements and boundaries, inconsistencies in enforcement resulting from deviations in understanding the content, and the absence of detailed descriptions of the Actâ€™s provisions. These hurdles significantly impact not only the daily operations of HFT firms but also pose higher demands on their long-term strategic planning and risk management. Drawing upon the Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom, and Purpose (DIKWP) model, this study employs an innovative analytical framework. Through the comprehensive application of conceptual space, cognitive space, and semantic space, it provides a systematic methodology for identifying and analyzing the aforementioned issues. This approach not only aids firms in better comprehending and adhering to complex regulatory requirements but also enables them to explore new business opportunities and competitive advantages while ensuring compliance.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7143f2946a01abc2866f2d30799b6f9cb88378b9495f4c3d71bf25383f158aad","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
