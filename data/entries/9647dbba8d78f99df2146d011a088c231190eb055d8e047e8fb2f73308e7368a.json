{"title":"Cytomegalovirus Cause Congenital Hearing Loss by Regulating the Signaling Pathways in Developing Peripheral Auditory Organ","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1552/v1","date":1719194966000,"content":"Cytomegalovirus infection contributes to 10-30% congenital hearing loss in children. Vertebrate peripheral auditory organs include the outer, middle and inner ear. Their development is regulated by multiple signaling pathways. However, most ear diseases due to viral infections are due to congenital infections and reactivation, and affect healthy adults to a lesser extent. This may be due to the fact that viral infections affect signaling pathways that are important for the development of peripheral hearing organs. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the relationship between viral infections and the signaling pathways involved in the development of peripheral hearing organs is important for the prevention and treatment of ear diseases. In this review, we summaries the effects of viruses on signaling pathways and signaling molecules in development of peripheral auditory organ, with a focus on Human cytomegalovirus as an example.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9647dbba8d78f99df2146d011a088c231190eb055d8e047e8fb2f73308e7368a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
