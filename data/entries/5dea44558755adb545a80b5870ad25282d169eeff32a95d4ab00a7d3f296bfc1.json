{"title":"The awareness of public about the Emergency Medical Services in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306878","date":1720706400000,"content":"<p>by Ahmed Alanazy, Abdullah Alruwaili, Saleh Alswaidan, Hassan Alobaid, Ahmed Alomran, Abdulkarim Hzazi, Ibrahim Alhussain, Meshal Alharbi, Meshary Binhotan</p>\r\n\r\nEmergency Medical Services (EMS) are crucial for immediate medical assistance during life-threatening situations. However, insufficient public awareness about EMS services can impede their effectiveness. This study aimed to assess EMS knowledge and trust among the population of Eastern Saudi Arabia while identifying factors contributing to low awareness. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Eastern Saudi Arabia from September 2022 to September 2023. The study included participants aged 18 to 60 from diverse backgrounds. Using a convenience sampling approach, data was collected using a validated questionnaire covering demographics, hypothetical scenarios, EMS knowledge, and trust in EMS. We conducted the Chi-square tests and logistic regression using Jamovi software, with significance levels set at p &lt; 0.05. Our study yielded 435 participants; 55% were males. Gender-based analysis showed significant differences in responses regarding first aid provision and EMS services (P &lt; 0.001). Expectations for EMS response times also varied by gender (P = 0.01). Knowledge-based analysis revealed that age and education significantly influenced EMS knowledge (P &lt; 0.001). Respondents with EMS knowledge were more likely to know how to provide first aid, understand the importance of emergency number 112, and trust EMS (P &lt; 0.001). Trust-based analysis showed age and education-related differences in EMS trust (P &lt; 0.001). Respondents with EMS knowledge and awareness of emergency numbers displayed higher trust in EMS (P &lt; 0.001). This study underscores the need for enhanced public awareness of EMS services in Eastern Saudi Arabia. Age, education, and gender emerged as critical factors affecting EMS knowledge and trust. Bridging this awareness gap necessitates tailored educational campaigns and continuous monitoring. Policymakers should prioritise EMS awareness within broader healthcare strategies, contributing to improved public health outcomes and community well-being.","author":"Ahmed Alanazy","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5dea44558755adb545a80b5870ad25282d169eeff32a95d4ab00a7d3f296bfc1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
