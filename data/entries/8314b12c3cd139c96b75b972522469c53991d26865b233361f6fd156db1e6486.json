{"title":"Effects of Ibuprofen and Diclofenac Pre-treatment on Viability and Apoptosis Processes in Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0115/v1","date":1711984964000,"content":"Stem cell-based regeneration strategies have shown therapeutic efficacy in various fields of regenerative medicine. These include bone healing after bone augmentation, often complicated by pain, that is managed by using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDSs). Information is limited about how NSAIDSs affect the therapeutic potential of stem cells. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ibuprofen and diclofenac in low and high therapeutic doses on the properties of human mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from the dental pulp (DPSCs) and cultured in vitro. Ibuprofen and diclofenac significantly reduced the viability of DPSCs, while the expression of mesenchymal stem cell surface markers was unaffected. Both ibuprofen and diclofenac treatment significantly upregulated the expression of HGF, while the expression of VEGFA remained unchanged. Ibuprofen significantly altered the expression of several apoptosis-related genes, including upregulation of CASP9 and BCL2, with decreased CASP3 expression. BAK, CASP3, CASP9, and BCL2 expressions were significantly increased in the diclofenac-treated DPSCs, while no difference was demonstrated in BAX expression. Our results suggest that concomitant use of the NSAIDSs ibuprofen or diclofenac with stem cell therapy may negatively impact cell viability and alter the expression of apoptosis-related genes, which can affect the efficacy of stem cell therapy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8314b12c3cd139c96b75b972522469c53991d26865b233361f6fd156db1e6486","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
