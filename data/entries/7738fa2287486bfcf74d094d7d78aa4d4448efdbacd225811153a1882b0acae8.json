{"title":"Comprehensive Risk and Efficacy Analysis of Emergency Medical Response Systems in Serbian Healthcare: Assessing Systemic Vulnerabilities in Disaster Preparedness and Response","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1294/v1","date":1724062603000,"content":"Emergency Medical Response Systems (EMRS) play a vital role in delivering medical aid during disasters. In Serbia, these systems encounter several obstacles due to economic limitations, scarce resources, and ongoing healthcare reforms, all of which affect their performance. This study focuses on examining the risk factors and effectiveness of Serbia's EMRS, identifying systemic issues, and proposing enhancements to improve emergency preparedness for disasters. A survey was conducted across healthcare institutions in Serbia to gather comprehensive insights. The survey explored various aspects, including organizational structures, resource distribution, communication systems, and the speed of emergency responses. Statistical methods such as Pearson's correlation, multivariate regression analysis and chi-square tests were utilized to interpret data collected from 172 healthcare institutions. The multivariate regression analysis of EMS organization identified that factors such as the structuring of working hours and shift patterns are significant predictors, contributing to small but meaningful variations in various EMS outcomes. In contrast, other factors, such as financial resources and the availability of ambulance vehicles, showed more targeted significance depending on the specific EMS aspect being analyzed. Institutions with written mass casualty plans and procedures demonstrate superior effectiveness in EMS activities, excelling in resource allocation, operational continuity, and emergency preparedness, particularly through enhanced coordination and specialized systems for managing large-scale emergencies. The findings highlighted notable disparities in how EMRS are organized, with only 46% of institutions having specific emergency departments. Resource limitations were evident, as many facilities operated with minimal staff and outdated equipment. The communication systems revealed weaknesses, with just 54% having established protocols for handling emergency calls. Response times frequently surpassed international standards, which negatively affected patient outcomes. Additionally, the study found training deficiencies, with 68% of participants expressing a need for further education. Serbiaâ€™s EMRS are significantly impacted by systemic issues such as insufficient funding, disjointed service delivery, and inadequate training. Overcoming these challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes boosting financial support, implementing standardized protocols, and fostering enhanced collaboration across different sectors.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7738fa2287486bfcf74d094d7d78aa4d4448efdbacd225811153a1882b0acae8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
