{"title":"Administering the maternal appeasing substance before slaughter to improve carcass characteristics of finishing cattle","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae048/7639016?rss=1","date":1712016000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Two experiments evaluated carcass characteristics of finishing steers administered the maternal bovine appeasing substance (<strong>mBAS</strong>) prior to slaughter. In Exp. 1, 954 Angus-influenced finishing steers housed in 6 original pens were used. Each original pen was split into a pair of experimental pens 14.3 d ± 3 d prior to slaughter, in a manner that number of steers and average pen body weight (<strong>BW</strong>; 636 ± 4 kg) were similar. An oiler containing mBAS (Ferappease Finish Cattle 5%; FERA Diagnostics and Biologicals; College Station, TX) was added to one of the experimental pens 7 d prior to slaughter (<span>n</span> = 6), whereas the other pen did not contain an oiler (<strong>CON</strong>; <span>n</span> = 6). The oiler delivered 120 mL of mBAS/steer during a 7-d period. Steer BW was recorded 7 d prior to and during loading (final BW) to the packing plant. No treatment effects were detected (<span>P </span>≥ 0.51) for BW gain, final BW, and proportion of carcasses that graded Choice or Prime. Carcass dressing percentage was greater (<span>P </span>= 0.02) in mBAS compared with CON steers (65.9% vs. 64.2%; SEM = 0.5), which was not sufficient to impact hot carcass weight (<strong>HCW</strong>; <span>P </span>= 0.29). Incidence of dark-cutting carcasses did not differ between treatments (<span>P </span>= 0.23). In Exp. 2, 80 Angus-influenced finishing steers housed in 16 pens (5 steers/pen; 600 ± 4 kg of BW) were used. Pens were arranged in 4 rows of 4 pens/row, and rows were alternately assigned to receive an oiler containing mBAS (<span>n</span> = 8) or mineral oil (<strong>CON+</strong>; <span>n</span> = 8) 7 d prior to slaughter. Oilers were designed to deliver 120 mL/steer of mBAS or mineral oil during the 7-d period. Steer BW was recorded as in Exp. 1, and a blood sample was collected during exsanguination. No treatment effects were detected (<span>P </span>≥ 0.20) for BW parameters, carcass marbling score, backfat thickness, <span>Longissimus</span> muscle area, yield grade, and proportion of carcasses that graded Choice or Prime. Carcass dressing was greater (<span>P </span>= 0.02) in mBAS steers compared with CON + (60.6 vs. 59.6%; SEM = 0.3) but HCW did not differ (<span>P </span>= 0.47) between treatments. Plasma cortisol concentration was less (<span>P </span>&lt; 0.01) in mBAS steers compared with CON + (11.7 vs. 20.8 ng/mL; SEM = 1.6). Incidence of dark-cutting carcasses did not differ (<span>P </span>= 0.53) between treatments. In summary, mBAS administration to finishing cattle using oilers during the last 7 d on feed alleviated the adrenocortical stress response elicited by the process of slaughter, which likely resulted in increased carcass dressing.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"2c638f4ca363246746fa25bbd64f44edff270630893f024f558e970fa358d1fe","category":"Environment"}
