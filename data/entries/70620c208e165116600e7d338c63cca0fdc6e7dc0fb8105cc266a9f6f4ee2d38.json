{"title":"Factors Influencing the Prevalence of Hyperpigmented Melanistic Lesions in Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu in the Susquehanna River Basin, Pennsylvania","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.14033?af=R","date":1729680570000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Hyperpigmented melanistic lesions (HPMLs) are a visual anomaly documented on the skin of smallmouth bass <i>Micropterus dolomieu</i> in the Susquehanna River Basin, Pennsylvania and in numerous other geographical locations. Currently, there is a lack of information on environmental and fish characteristics that may influence the prevalence of HPMLs associated with a recently described <i>Adomavirus</i>. The goal of this study was to understand potential drivers associated with HPMLs in socioeconomically and ecologically important riverine smallmouth bass populations. A total of 16,220 smallmouth bass were collected and examined for HPMLs between 2012 and 2022 in the Susquehanna River Basin. Overall, HPMLs were documented on 2.9% of fish collected. The interaction between temperature and fish size suggested differing relationships between shorter and longer fish with respect to temperature. Predicted probability of HPML prevalence ranged from 1.1% (95% CI = 0.3, 3.2) at 4°C to 0.01% (CI = 0.00, 0.04) at 26°C for an age-0 (125 mm) fish. In contrast, predicted probability of HPML prevalence ranged from 10.5% (95% CI = 5.8, 18.9) at 4°C to 0.8% (CI = 0.4, 1.5) at 26°C for an adult (322 mm) fish. Overall, HPMLs were more common in longer fish during cooler temperature periods which also corresponds to key life history periods for smallmouth bass (e.g., pre-spawn and overwintering) and could represent different exposure histories for juvenile and adult fish.</p>","author":"Megan K.
