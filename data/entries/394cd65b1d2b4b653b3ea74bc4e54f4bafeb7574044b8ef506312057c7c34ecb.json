{"title":"144 Utilizing invasive pigweed (Amaranthus Spinosus) as a novel methane mitigation strategy in beef cattle feed: A sustainable approach","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/72/7617912?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>By 2050, the US beef industry must produce an extra 40 million tons of beef to satisfy the global demand, while reducing methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions. This surplus of cattle will be provided mostly by cow-calf operations, which rely primarily on grazing. Those pastures are often infested with weeds such as pigweed (<span>Amaranthus spinosus</span>), one of the most invasive in the US, known for its increased polyphenols concentration. Despite the known effect of polyphenols on CH<sub>4</sub> reduction, few studies have explored pigweed as a feed additive. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of in vitro addition of pigweed on ruminal fermentation, digestibility, and CH<sub>4</sub> production. We collected ruminal fluid from three American Aberdeen steers (374 ± 21 kg) receiving a backgrounding diet (80:20% corn silage:cotton gin trash, as fed). We incubated (24 h, 39°C) diet (0.7 g) plus the inclusion of 0, 2.5, 5, or 10% (of diet DM) of roots, stems, leaves, seeds, or the whole pigweed plant (WHO). Volatile fatty acids (VFA), CH<sub>4</sub> (mmol g<sup>-1</sup> organic matter), ammonia, pH, gas, in vitro dry matter, and organic matter digestibility (IVDMD and IVOMD) were determined. Using the MIXED procedure of SAS, data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with a 5 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments with plant part (n = 5) and inclusion level (n = 4) as fixed main factors. Incubation and bottle within incubation were random effects. Polynomial orthogonal contrasts were used to determine linear, quadratic, and cubic effects of inclusion level. Plant × level interactions were detected in acetate, propionate, and butyric molar proportion, total VFA, CH<sub>4</sub> production, and IVDMD (P &lt; 0.01). Increasing levels of stems increased acetate concentration (P = 0.03), while those from WHO led to a linear reduction of acetate (P &lt; 0.01). The inclusion of 2.5% of leaves, seeds, and WHO increased propionate concentration (P = 0.05), but greater levels decreased it (P &lt; 0.01). Increasing levels of all parts decreased acetate:propionate proportion (P &lt; 0.001). Increasing levels of WHO resulted in a linear reduction of CH<sub>4</sub> production (P &lt; 0.05), while increasing inclusion of roots and stems increased CH<sub>4</sub> production (P &lt; 0.01). Quadratic reductions in CH<sub>4</sub> production were observed after increasing the addition of leaves, seeds, and WHO (P &lt; 0.001). Increasing levels of leaves and roots decreased ammonia concentration (P &lt; 0.01) while stems increased it (P = 0.01). Except for stems and roots, there was a linear decrease in IVDMD with increasing levels of all parts (P &lt; 0.001). The inclusion of low levels of seeds, leaves, and WHO promoted ruminal changes leading to a reduction of CH<sub>4</sub> production without significantly compromising the digestibility.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"394cd65b1d2b4b653b3ea74bc4e54f4bafeb7574044b8ef506312057c7c34ecb","category":"Environment"}
