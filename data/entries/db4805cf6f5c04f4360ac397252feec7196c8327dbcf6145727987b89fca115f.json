{"title":"The Most Used Methods of Chrome Extraction from Leather Polymer Wastes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0731/v1","date":1715492689000,"content":"The leather industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world due to the large amounts of waste following the raw hides processing, but also due to the high content of chemicals present in their composition. The main problem of chromium-tanned leather solid waste is related to their storage, because of the ability of chromium to leach in soil or water, and also owing to the high ability of trivalent chromium to oxidize to its toxic form, hexavalent chromium. The purpose of this study is to present the latest methods for extracting trivalent chromium from the composition of solid leather wastes. The extraction methods identified in the present study are based on acid/basic/enzymatic hydrolysis and substitution with the help of organic chelators (organic acids and organic acid salts). In addition, the study includes a comparative analysis between the advantages and disadvantages of each identified extraction method. At the same time, the study also presentes alternative chromium extraction methods based on the combination of conventional extraction methods and ultrasound-assisted extraction.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db4805cf6f5c04f4360ac397252feec7196c8327dbcf6145727987b89fca115f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
