{"title":"In-Situ Screening of Defective Electronic Components through Edge Real-Time Big Data AI Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0870/v1","date":1710511285000,"content":"This paper presents a groundbreaking approach to real-time image processing in electronic component assembly, enhancing quality control in manufacturing. By capturing images from pick and place machines between component pickup and mounting, defects are identified and addressed in-line, significantly reducing the likelihood of defective products. Leveraging fast network protocols like gRPC and orchestration with Kubernetes, along with C++ programming and TensorFlow, this method achieves an average turnaround time of less than 5 milliseconds. Tested on 20 live production machines, it ensures compliance with IPC-A-610, and IPC-STD-J-001 standards while optimizing production efficiency and reliability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9facee8f3b21cbb5550f1961d622f4794c64fc06fc96f1827aee3cd561227d5c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
