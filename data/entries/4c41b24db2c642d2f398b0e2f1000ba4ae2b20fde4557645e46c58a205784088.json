{"title":"Geometric morphometrics reveal that Conus anabathrum Crosse, 1865 (Neogastropoda: Conidae) should be an accepted species","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyae019/7684639?rss=1","date":1717027200000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>In 2022, the accepted name for a marine gastropod species from Florida until then known as <span>Conus anabathrum</span> Crosse, 1865, was replaced by <span>C. floridanus</span> Gabb, 1869. The main argument was that the type of <span>C. anabathrum</span>, a specimen with no type locality in the description, actually represents the eastern Pacific species <span>C. scalaris</span> Valenciennes, 1832. This allocation of the type of <span>C. anabathrum</span> to an eastern Pacific taxon was based on several factors, with shell shape as the main determinant. We demonstrate via geometric morphometrics that the type of <span>C. anabathrum</span> actually falls outside the morphospace of <span>C. scalaris</span>, belonging instead to the morphospace of the Floridian taxon. We also discuss other arguments presented to assign the type of <span>C. anabathrum</span> to the eastern Pacific species. These discussions and our geometric morphometric analytical results demonstrate that the type of <span>C. anabathrum</span> actually represents the Floridian species, and that <span>C. anabathrum</span> should be the accepted name.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"4c41b24db2c642d2f398b0e2f1000ba4ae2b20fde4557645e46c58a205784088","category":"Environment"}
