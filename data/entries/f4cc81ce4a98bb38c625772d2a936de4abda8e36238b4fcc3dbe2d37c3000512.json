{"title":"Biocompatibility Study of Purified and Low-Temperature Sterilized Injectable Collagen for Soft Tissue Repair: Intramuscular Implantation in Rats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1229/v1","date":1723795612000,"content":"The clinical application of collagen-based biomaterials is expanding rapidly, especially in tissue engineering and cosmetics. While oral supplements and injectable skin boosters are popular for enhancing skin health, clinical evidence supporting their effectiveness remains limited. Injectable products show potential in revitalizing skin, but safety concerns persist due to challenges in sterilization and the risk of biological contamination. Traditional methods of sterilization (heat and irradiation) can denature collagen. This study addresses these issues by introducing a novel technique: double filtration and low-temperature steam sterilization of a collagen gel. In vitro tests document sterility and confirm that the collagen structure remained intact without modification. An in vivo study found no adverse effects in rats or significant lesions at the implantation site over 13 weeks. These results suggest that this novel method to process collagen gels is a safe and effective skin booster. Advanced processing methods are likely to mitigate safety risks associated with injectable collagen products, though further research is needed to validate their biological effectiveness and clinical benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f4cc81ce4a98bb38c625772d2a936de4abda8e36238b4fcc3dbe2d37c3000512","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
