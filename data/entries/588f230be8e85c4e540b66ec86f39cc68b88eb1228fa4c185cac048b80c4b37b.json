{"title":"Taste of common prebiotic oligosaccharides: impact of molecular structure","link":"https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjae023/7686462?rss=1","date":1717286400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Prebiotic oligosaccharides are naturally occurring nondigestible carbohydrates with demonstrated health benefits. They are also a chemically diverse class of nutrients, offering an opportunity to investigate the impact of molecular structure on oligosaccharide taste perception. Accordingly, a relevant question is whether these compounds are detected by the human gustatory system, and if so, whether they elicit sweet or “starchy” taste. Here, in 3 psychophysical experiments, we investigated the taste perception of 3 commercially popular prebiotics [fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), xylooligosaccharides (XOS)] in highly pure form. Each of these classes of prebiotics differs in the type of glycosyl residue, and position and type of bond between those residues. In experiments I and II, participants were asked to discriminate a total of 9 stimuli [FOS, GOS, XOS; degree of polymerization (DP) of 2, 3, 4] prepared at 75 mM in the presence and absence of lactisole, a sweet receptor antagonist. We found that all 9 compounds were detectable (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05). We also found that GOS and XOS DP 4 were discriminable even with lactisole, suggesting that their detection was not via the canonical sweet receptor. Accordingly, in experiment III, the taste of GOS and XOS DP 4 were directly compared with that of MOS (maltooligosaccharides) DP 4-6, which has been reported to elicit “starchy” taste. We found that GOS and MOS were perceived similarly although narrowly discriminable, while XOS was easily discriminable from both GOS and MOS. The current findings suggest that the molecular structure of oligosaccharides impacts their taste perception in humans.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Chemical Senses Current Issue","siteHash":"eaf999c97f18ab6d9732972032217d08ae5a0287f7a7d719a702f9f5727afa53","entryHash":"588f230be8e85c4e540b66ec86f39cc68b88eb1228fa4c185cac048b80c4b37b","category":"Environment"}
