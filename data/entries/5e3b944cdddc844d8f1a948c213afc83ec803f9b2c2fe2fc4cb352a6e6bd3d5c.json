{"title":"Studying how dry extract can affect the aroma release and perception in different red wine styles","link":"https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13882?af=R","date":1725961920000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Four red wine matrices representing different red wine styles with the same VOCs (volatile organic compounds), were obtained by enriching a bleed wine with increasing amounts of deodorized dry extract obtained from the pressed wine of the same vinification. The release of VOCs was determined by solid phase micro-extraction-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME-GC–MS), in conditions mimicking those applied during sensory assessments.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>Results show that even though the perception of the overall odor intensity was not significantly influenced by the matrix, this latter modulated the odor profiles: at rising wine dry extract, fruity, floral odors decreased, while dehydrated fruit, woody-toasty, vegetal-earthy notes increased. These changes cannot be fully explained by the observed significant influence of the matrix on the release of VOCs or by their correlations with the considered matrix components (ethanol, residual sugars, phenolics, pH), but findings suggest that perceptual interactions are involved.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>This study could be useful in pressing and blending management for wine aroma quality also considering wine compositional trends under the current climate change context. © 2024 The Author(s). <i>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</i> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"Paola Piombino, \nMaria Tiziana Lisanti, \nElisabetta Pittari, \nAngelita Gambuti, \nLuigi Moio","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"5e3b944cdddc844d8f1a948c213afc83ec803f9b2c2fe2fc4cb352a6e6bd3d5c","category":"Environment"}
