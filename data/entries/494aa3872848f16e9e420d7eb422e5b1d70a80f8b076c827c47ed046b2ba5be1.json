{"title":"Heterogeneous Solid Acid Catalysts for Sustainable Biodiesel Production from Wastewater-Derived Sludge: A Systematic and Critical Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1324/v1","date":1716276887000,"content":"This comprehensive review has systematically examined the use of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts in the production of biodiesel from wastewater-derived sludge by using the PRISMA methodology. The manuscript highlighted the composition and characteristics of wastewater-derived sludge, presenting both the opportunities and challenges associated with its use as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Various types of catalysts were dis-cussed, with a detailed exploration of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts, including zeolites, hetero-polyacid (HPA), mixed metal oxides, and sulphonic acid group catalysts. The advantages and limitations of these catalysts were critically analyzed, providing a balanced view of their potential in industrial applications. The application section delved into the catalytic transesterification reaction, mechanisms of biodiesel production, and the effects of catalyst loading on yield. Performance metrics such as catalytic activity, stability, recyclability, cost-effectiveness, and environ-mental impact were thoroughly evaluated, offering a clear understanding of the efficacy of these catalysts. Synthesis and characterization techniques were also reviewed, shedding light on the latest preparation methods and characterization techniques. Recent advances in catalyst development were presented, showcasing the innovative strides made in enhancing catalyst performance. The environmental and economic implications of using solid acid catalysts for bio-diesel production were assessed, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and economic viability.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"494aa3872848f16e9e420d7eb422e5b1d70a80f8b076c827c47ed046b2ba5be1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
