{"title":"Increasing the Wear and Corrosion Resistance of a CP-Ti Surface by Plasma Electrolytic Borocarburizing and Polishing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1299/v1","date":1724054383000,"content":"The paper examines the possibility of increasing the wear and corrosion resistance of a CP-Ti surface by duplex plasma electrolytic treatment (borocarburizing and polishing). The structure and composition of diffusion layers, their microhardness, surface morphology and roughness, wear resistance during dry friction and corrosion resistance in Ringer's solution were studied. The formation of a surface hardened layer up to 200 m thick with a microhardness of up to 950 HV, including carbides and a solid solution of boron and carbon, is shown. Subsequent polishing makes it possible to reduce surface roughness and remove weak areas of the porous oxide layer, which is formed during high-temperature oxidation in aqueous electrolyte vapor during borocarburizing. Changing the morphology and structural-phase composition of the CP-Ti surface helps reduce weight wear by 3 times (the mode of frictional interaction changes from microcutting to oxidative wear) and corrosion current density by 4 times after borocarburizing in a solution of boric acid, glycerin and ammonium chloride at 950 °C for 5 minutes and subsequent polishing in an ammonium fluoride solution at a voltage of 250 V for 3 minutes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f0ffcb1cab95eb5739047a52726f4fcfe50fa9aebb5675cd9e5f15bc0931b155","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
