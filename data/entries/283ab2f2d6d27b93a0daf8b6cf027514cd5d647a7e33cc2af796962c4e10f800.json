{"title":"Quantifying the Societal Impact of Delayed Access to Innovative Medicines: A Mathematical Framework for Health Policy Decision-Making","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1687/v1","date":1729758249000,"content":"This study presents a novel statistical framework for evaluating the social and economic impact of delays in the reimbursement of innovative medicines. With the growing importance of timely access to advanced therapies, particularly in managing chronic diseases, we develop a model that quantifies social loss in terms of life years, productivity, productivity cost and overall well-being. The framework integrates several key factors, including years of life lost, years of potential productive life lost, deaths, delays in reimbursement, and cost of labor productivity losses. By providing a comprehensive assessment of the societal costs associated with delayed access, the model offers valuable insights for policymakers seeking to balance healthcare innovation with sustainability. The results emphasize the need for efficient pharmaceutical policies that reduce delays in access to innovative treatments, promote equity in healthcare, and ensure long-term system viability. This approach has broad implications for improving health outcomes and economic productivity, particularly in publicly funded healthcare systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"283ab2f2d6d27b93a0daf8b6cf027514cd5d647a7e33cc2af796962c4e10f800","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
