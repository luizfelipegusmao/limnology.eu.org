{"title":"FedOps Mobile: A Platform of Federated Learning Management for Enhanced Mobile Collaboration","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1479/v1","date":1716446344000,"content":"Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a crucial technology in today’s data-centric technological environment, enabling decentralized machine learning and safeguarding user privacy. This study introduces “Federated Operations (FedOps) Mobile,” a novel FL framework optimized for the dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem of mobile devices. FedOps Mobile enhances traditional FL approaches for mobile devices by integrating real-time operational control and advanced on-device training capabilities using TensorFlow Lite and CoreML, addressing critical challenges in scalability, efficiency, and system heterogeneity. Our approach utilizes a wide range of devices, facilitated by intelligent client-selection mechanisms. This mechanism evaluates the capabilities and readiness of multiple devices per client to ensure fair and efficient network participation. The framework also utilizes remote device control for seamless task management and sustained engagement, enabling continuous learning without compromising the user experience. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the framework’s performance, focusing on three core aspects: operational efficiency, model personalization, and resource optimization in multi-device environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for efficient client selection, energy consumption, and model optimization.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a6f7bcf6eb9e3a641009605299ec2dbecd0860205c455f9d67bd7447e6bbd666","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
