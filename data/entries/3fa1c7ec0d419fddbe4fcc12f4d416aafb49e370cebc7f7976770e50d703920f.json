{"title":"Transmission of dominant strains of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> and <i>Campylobacter coli</i> between farms and retail stores in Ecuador: Genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308030","date":1727186400000,"content":"<p>by Lorena Montero, José L.

A total of 468 samples were collected, of which 335 were chicken carcass samples (representing the food component), and 133 were chicken caeca samples (representing the animal component). These samples underwent culture, with colonies examined under a microscope. Species identification was achieved through multiplex PCR. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined using the Kirby-Bauer method, testing for sensitivity to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. Additionally, 55 <i>C</i>. <i>jejuni</i> (62.5%) and 33 <i>C</i>. <i>coli</i> (37.5%) isolates were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS). A High prevalence of <i>Campylobacter</i> was observed, with rates of 95.5% (n = 127, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 92.5% - 98.5%) in the animal component and 72.5% (n = 243, CI<sub>95%</sub>: 69.9% - 75.1%) in the food component. Specifically, <i>C</i>. <i>jejuni</i> was detected in 33.1% (n = 42) of poultry farms and 38.3% (n = 93) of chicken carcasses, while <i>C</i>. <i>coli</i> was found in 64.6% (n = 82) of poultry farms and 60.5% (n = 147) of chicken carcasses. Antimicrobials with the highest rates of resistance (67%-100%) were ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, in both animal and food component isolates. Erythromycin resistance was notable, ranging from 22% to 33%, with only two <i>C</i>. <i>jejuni</i> isolates from retail were resistant to gentamicin. Furthermore, multidrug resistance was identified in 23% (20 isolates) of the <i>Campylobacter</i> isolates. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of fourteen resistance genes in both <i>C</i>. <i>jejuni</i> and <i>C</i>. <i>coli</i> isolates, including <i>tet(O)</i>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-460</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-184</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-489</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-193</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-784</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-603</sub>, <i>aph(3’)-IIIa</i>, <i>aad9</i>, <i>aph(2’’)-If</i>, <i>aadE-Cc</i>, <i>sat4</i>, and <i>ant(6)-Ia</i>. Additionally, twenty-five plasmids were detected in the 88 <i>Campylobacter</i> isolates examined. Interestingly, most isolates also harbored genes encoding putative virulence factors associated with pathogenicity, invasion, adherence, and production of cytolethal distending toxin (cdt): <i>cheV</i>, <i>cheA</i>, <i>cheW</i>, <i>cheY</i>, <i>flaA</i>, <i>flgR</i>, <i>flaC</i>, <i>flaD</i>, <i>flgB</i>, <i>flgC</i>, <i>ciaB</i>, <i>ciaC</i>. The WGS analysis showed the presence of several cgSTs in both animal and food components, with nine of them widely disseminated between components. Moreover, <i>C</i>. <i>coli</i> and <i>C</i>. <i>jejuni</i> isolates from different sources presented less than 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), suggesting clonality (16 isolates). Further analysis using SNP tree demonstrated widespread distribution of certain <i>C</i>. <i>jejuni</i> and <i>C</i>. <i>coli</i> clones across multiple farms and retail stores. This study presents, for the first-time, insights into the clonality, plasmid diversity, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of thermotolerant <i>Campylobacter</i> strains originating from the Ecuadorian poultry industry. The identification of AMR genes associated with the main antibiotics used in the treatment of campylobacteriosis in humans, highlights the importance of the prudent use of antimicrobials in the poultry industry. Additionally, this research remarks the need for regional studies to understand the epidemiology of this pathogen.","author":"Lorena Montero","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"3fa1c7ec0d419fddbe4fcc12f4d416aafb49e370cebc7f7976770e50d703920f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
