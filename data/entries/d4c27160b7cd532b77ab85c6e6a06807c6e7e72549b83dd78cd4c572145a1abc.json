{"title":"Numerical Study on Remote Infrared Signal Fluctuation Properties of Gas Free Jet Based on Improved SGS-TRI Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1979/v1","date":1729786535000,"content":"To address the issue of low prediction accuracy for sub-grid scale turbulence-radiation interaction (SGS-TRI) characteristics, which impacts the precision of remote infrared signal calculations for gas jet, a term for correlation of radiation-participating component fluctuations with temperature fluctuation was introduced into the current sub-grid Snegirev equation; Simultaneously, we established a new method that is more convenient in complex projects for solving the dynamic sub-grid model coefficients, e.g., dynamic Smagorinsky model and temperature variance model. The validity of these algorithms was confirmed through direct numerical simulations (DNS) for isotropic turbulence and test data of high-temperature air jet flow. The Multi-Scale Multi-Group Wide-Band (MSMGWB) k-distribution model was used to calculate radiative transfer in strongly non-isothermal and inhomogeneous media such as the remote infrared sensing of jet plume scenario considering influences of TRI and SGS-TRI. The study for axisymmetric jet plume revealed that the TRI accounts for more than 1/3 of total remote infrared signal in the 3-5micron band, with the SGS-TRI effect contributing more than 10%. Additionally, this influence was found to further increase with increasing detection distances.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d4c27160b7cd532b77ab85c6e6a06807c6e7e72549b83dd78cd4c572145a1abc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
