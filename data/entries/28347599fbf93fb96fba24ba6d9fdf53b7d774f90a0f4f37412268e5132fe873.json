{"title":"Microscopy Characterization of Halloysite/Carbon Dots Composite","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.620/7719704?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Since fluorescent nanoparticles have promising uses in several material science domains, including photoelectric devices, biology, and environmental remediation, they have been thoroughly investigated in recent years [<a href=\"#ozae044.620-B1\">1</a>]. Because of their remarkable qualities, Carbon dots-based materials have gained significant research interest. This class of carbon materials is formed through the sp2 and sp3 hybridization of carbon atoms, which constitute abundant polymer chains that are functionalized with amine groups, and exhibit strong fluorescence emission, biocompatibility, good water solubility, and optical, and antibacterial qualities due to their nanometric size [<a href=\"#ozae044.620-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.620-B2\">2</a>]. However, these quantum dots may show low thermal and chemical stability, which can drastically limit the application of these materials in specific areas [<a href=\"#ozae044.620-B3\">3</a>]. Conversely, clay minerals are a viable option for creating adaptable and multipurpose hybrid nanoplatforms for a range of uses. In this sense, Halloysite mineral is a great choice for an inorganic equivalent for developing hybrid nanostructures, since it combines strong mechanical capabilities, a tubular microstructure, biocompatibility, and variable surface chemistry [<a href=\"#ozae044.620-B4\">4</a>]. Based on these premises, the present study aimed to develop a hybrid system based on Carbon dots and halloysite tubular clay. The combination of carbon dots and Halloysite can provide the final material with tunability and control of properties such as size, shape, surface charge, and chemical functionalities. These new features are very interesting to meet specific application requirements [<a href=\"#ozae044.620-B5\">5</a>], where Halloysite can act as a porous tubular support for Carbon dots, protecting them from possible degradation and/or agglomeration, allowing its application in advanced optoelectronic devices with enhanced energy efficiency, selective adsorption, or improved biocompatibility for controlled drug release systems.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"28347599fbf93fb96fba24ba6d9fdf53b7d774f90a0f4f37412268e5132fe873","category":"Environment"}
