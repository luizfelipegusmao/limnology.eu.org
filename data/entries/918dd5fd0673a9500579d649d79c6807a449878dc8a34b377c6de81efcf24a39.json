{"title":"Are protective measures against Covid-19 still active in orthodontic practices? A cross-sectional online survey of French orthodontists three years on from the pandemic","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307453","date":1721397600000,"content":"<p>by Astrid Loiseau, Tiphaine Davit-Béal, Damien Brézulier</p>\r\nPurpose <p>The Covid-19 epidemic has imposed profound changes on the practice of orthodontics. It was in this anxiety-inducing context that drastic measures were imposed on orthodontists. The main aim of this online survey is to highlight the measures that are still in place in French orthodontic practices three years after the emergence of the pandemic.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to French orthodontists from march to June 2023. The questionnaire, consisting of 32 questions, was divided into five sections covering habits before and after the pandemic, and the feelings of professionals.</p> Results <p>In this survey 230 complete answers were recorded. Three years later, the daily pace had returned to its pre-crisis level. Disinfection and aeration times were still present (p &lt; 0.001). Orthodontists maintained and generalized the use of protective glasses (p = 0.17) and visors (p &lt; 0.001). The same was true for the FFP2 mask and its frequency of change, as well as rigorous hand washing. Finally, the dedicated layout of the practices was maintained: protective screen, filtration system, supply of SHA, travel paths, removal of magazines (for all, p &lt; 0.001).</p> Conclusion <p>This study shows that the professional practices imposed by the Covid-19 crisis have been adopted by the majority of French orthodontists, and now appear to be anchored in their routine practice.</p> Trial registration number <p>opinion n°2023–004, dated 01.25.2023.</p>","author":"Astrid Loiseau","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"918dd5fd0673a9500579d649d79c6807a449878dc8a34b377c6de81efcf24a39","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
