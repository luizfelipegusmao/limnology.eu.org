{"title":"Integration of Isotopic and Nuclear Techniques to Assess Water and Soil Resources Degradation. A Critical Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1216/v1","date":1724082785000,"content":"The isotopic and nuclear techniques discussed, namely: Fallout Radionuclide, Fingerprint, and Isotope Hydrology, are linked to the evaluation of soil and water degradation processes. A traditional literature review was conducted to gain the most comprehensive understanding of both the current state of the art and the subject matter, with the aim of proposing a hypothesis that integrates the synergistic convergence of these techniques in order to offer results that are more reliable. A case study is presented as a synthesis of the preceding discussion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"33a8d31dbb01ee7a940a41afb05266879e3bddf20bb85e140146c997cd7fe42b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
