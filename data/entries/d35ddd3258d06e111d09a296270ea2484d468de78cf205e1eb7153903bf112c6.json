{"title":"Bacterial Communities Across Multiple Ecological Niches (Water, Sediment, Plastic, and Snail Gut) in Mangrove Habitats","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0281/v1","date":1719997086000,"content":"Microbial composition across substrates in mangroves, particularly in the Middle East, remains unclear. This study characterized bacterial communities in sediment, water, Terebralia palustris snail guts, and plastic associated with Avicennia marina mangrove forests in two coastal lagoons in the Sea of Oman using 16S rDNA gene MiSeq sequencing. The genus Vibrio dominated all substrates except water, which featured unique genera Sunxiuqinia and Pseudomonas. There were significant differences in bacterial communities on different substrata, in particular plastic. Snail guts harbored the highest number of unique Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in both lagoons. Plastic in the polluted Sawadi lagoon with low salinity harbored distinct genera like Vibrio, Aestuariibacter, Zunongwangia, and Jeotgalibacillus absent in Qurum lagoon with higher salinity and low pollution. Sawadi lagoon exhibited higher species diversity in sediment and plastic substrates, Qurum lagoon demonstrated lower overall species diversity. The PCA indicates that environmental factors like salinity, pH, and nutrient levels significantly influence bacterial community composition across substrates. Variations in organic matter and potential anthropogenic influences, particularly from plastics, further shape bacterial communities. This study highlights the complex microbial communities in mangrove ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple substrates in mangrove microbial ecology studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d35ddd3258d06e111d09a296270ea2484d468de78cf205e1eb7153903bf112c6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
