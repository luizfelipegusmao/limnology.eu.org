{"title":"A flexible and interpretable spatial covariance model for data on graphs","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.2879?af=R","date":1728526425000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Spatial models for areal data are often constructed such that all pairs of adjacent regions are assumed to have near-identical spatial autocorrelation. In practice, data can exhibit dependence structures more complicated than can be represented under this assumption. In this article, we develop a new model for spatially correlated data observed on graphs, which can flexibly represented many types of spatial dependence patterns while retaining aspects of the original graph geometry. Our method implies an embedding of the graph into Euclidean space wherein covariance can be modeled using traditional covariance functions, such as those from the Matérn family. We parameterize our model using a class of graph metrics compatible with such covariance functions, and which characterize distance in terms of network flow, a property useful for understanding proximity in many ecological settings. By estimating the parameters underlying these metrics, we recover the “intrinsic distances” between graph nodes, which assist in the interpretation of the estimated covariance and allow us to better understand the relationship between the observed process and spatial domain. We compare our model to existing methods for spatially dependent graph data, primarily conditional autoregressive models and their variants, and illustrate advantages of our method over traditional approaches. We fit our model to bird abundance data for several species in North Carolina, and show how it provides insight into the interactions between species-specific spatial distributions and geography.</p>","author":"Michael F.
