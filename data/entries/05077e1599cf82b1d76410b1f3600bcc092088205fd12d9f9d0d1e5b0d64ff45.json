We need to find out why, as choanoflagellates can help us to understand how symbiosis may have shaped the early evolution of animals.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental bacteria influence many facets of choanoflagellate biology, yet surprisingly few examples of symbioses exist. This Perspective explores why choanoflagellates are an exciting system for enriching our understanding of eukaryote-bacteria symbioses and for considering how symbiotic associations with bacteria may shaped the early evolution of animals.","author":"Arielle Woznica","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"05077e1599cf82b1d76410b1f3600bcc092088205fd12d9f9d0d1e5b0d64ff45","category":"Environment"}
