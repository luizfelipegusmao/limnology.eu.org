{"title":"Efficacy and Safety of Magnesium Sulfate as an Adjunct to Ropivacaine Wound Infiltration in Thyroid Surgery.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0878/v1","date":1718270208000,"content":"Abstract \n\nObjective: To assess wound infiltration with ropivacaine plus magnesium sulfate for pain relief following thyroid surgery. \nBackground: Analgesia with local anesthetics following surgery is a critical element of alleviating postoperative pain. However, such strategies in neck surgery has not been a well-established practice.\nMethods: This prospective double-blind randomized study enrolled 68 patients who underwent thyroid surgery. Concerning the solution used for surgical wound infiltration the study participants were randomly allocated into three groups: 1) 100 mg of ropivacaine (Group R), 2) 100mg of ropivacaine plus magnesium sulfate 10mg/kg (Group RMg), and 3) normal saline which served as placebo (Group P). Pain perception both at rest and at movement, was measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 30 minutes, as well as 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The total consumption of analgesics in morphine equivalents was also recorded. Moreover, adverse effects and patient satisfaction were recorded. Cortisol, TNF-Î±, and IL-6 levels were measured 30 minutes before infiltration, 6 hours and 24 hours postoperatively.\nResults: Demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between the groups. The VAS scores at rest and during movement were significantly lower in the RMg group compared to saline or ropivacaine groups. Total analgesic consumption was also significantly lower in the RMg group. No operational, wound or infiltration-related adverse effects were recorded in the study groups. Better overall satisfaction was obtained for the group RMg. \nConclusions: Ropivacaine plus magnesium sulfate wound infiltration provided better pain control and analgesic effect was more significant, contributing to effective postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thyroid surgery.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6ae355987325a740d0c3f202bde2f87f61278600ad8e2f7c74c23cedbfebec5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
