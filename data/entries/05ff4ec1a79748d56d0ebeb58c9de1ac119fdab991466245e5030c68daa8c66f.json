{"title":"Influence of the perceptions of amenities on consumer emotions in urban consumption spaces","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304203","date":1716991200000,"content":"<p>by Jiajie Tan, Yingying Li</p>\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study is to understand how consumers perceive amenities and their impact on promoting positive consumer emotions and comprehend the role of amenities in fostering urban consumption. We collected over 120,000 comments spanning 60 months (2015â€“2019) from 18 urban shopping centers in Shanghai. By applying text mining methods, we constructed a panel data model on the perception of four types of amenities and consumer emotions. Results indicate that different perceptions of amenities yield significantly different effects on consumer emotions. Specifically, we found that perceptions of cultural and safeguarded amenities significantly influence consumer emotions, albeit with different directions of impact. In contrast, perceptions of commercial and natural amenities did not significantly affect consumer emotions. The findings of this study provide a key reference for how to scientifically plan and reasonably introduce the types of amenities in urban consumption space, so as to reflect the promoting effect of amenities on urban consumption.","author":"Jiajie Tan","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"05ff4ec1a79748d56d0ebeb58c9de1ac119fdab991466245e5030c68daa8c66f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
