Ozone, derived from atmospheric oxygen, exerts antimicrobial effects against various microorganisms, and degrades fungal toxins, which were initially recognized in the healthcare and food industries. However, highly concentrated ozone gas can be detrimental to human health. In addition, ozonated water is unstable and has a short half-life. Therefore, ultrafine-bubble technology is expected to overcome these issues. Ultrafine bubbles, which are nanoscale entitles that exist in water for considerable durations, have previously demonstrated bactericidal effects against various bacterial species, including antibiotic-resistant strains. This present study investigated the effects of ozone ultrafine bubble water (OUFBW) on various bacterial toxins. This study revealed that OUFBW treatment abolished the toxicity of pneumolysin, a pneumococcal pore-forming toxin, and leukotoxin, a toxin that causes leukocyte injury. Silver staining confirmed the degradation of pneumolysin, leukotoxin, and staphylococcal enterotoxin A, which are potent gastrointestinal toxins, following OUFB treatment. In addition, OUFBW treatment significantly inhibited NF-ÎºB activation by Pam3CSK4, a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide that activates Toll-like receptor 2. Additionally, OUFBW exerted bactericidal activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, including an antibiotic-resistant strain, without displaying significant toxicity toward human neutrophils or erythrocytes. These results suggest that OUFBW not only sterilizes bacteria but also degrades bacterial toxins.","author":"Fumio Takizawa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"a20a493c478b9a6f5c8dd4492a7f505b1e098fb57887acfd1c14f4813a4b580d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
