{"title":"Automatic Defects Recognition of Lap Joint of Unequal Thickness Based on X-ray Image Processing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0659/v1","date":1728490667000,"content":"It is difficult to automatically recognize defects using digital image processing method in X-ray radiograph that tested from lap joint of unequal thickness plates. The continuous change of the wall thickness for the lap joint workpiece brings about the very different gray levels in X-ray background image. Besides, due to the shape and fixturing of the workpiece, the distribution of the weld seam in the radiograph is not vertical and results in an existence of a certain angle with the vertical direction. This makes it difficult for automatic defect detection and localization. In this paper, a method of X-ray image correction based on invariant moments is presented to solve the problem. In addition, an automatic defect detection method combined of image noise suppression, background removal, image segmentation and mathematical morphology is introduced. The results show that the proposed method can effectively recognize the gas pores in lap joint of unequal thickness and it is suitable for automatic detection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5f76499967a3f1bca45e9aca8a15937d9585259b9323513e2843204ce78e92f1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
