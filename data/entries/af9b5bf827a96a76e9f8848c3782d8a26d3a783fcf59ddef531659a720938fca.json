{"title":"Structural Analysis Based on Frequency Response of a Quadrotor UAV","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1686/v1","date":1716788818000,"content":"In this work, the structural dynamics of a commercial quadrotor was investigated, which presents problems of lateral stability or sliding instead of remaining self-leveling through its autonomous control system. The possible existence of vibrations motivated the characterization of the frequency response of the arms and propellers by means of the frequency response function (FRF) using the impact hammer technique. The experimental results provided sufficient information for the future implementation of structural solutions or through reprogramming in the autonomous control algorithm that compensates or mitigates the negative effect of vibration levels due to resonance phenomenon and improves the stability in self-leveling condition of the quadrotor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"af9b5bf827a96a76e9f8848c3782d8a26d3a783fcf59ddef531659a720938fca","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
