{"title":"Exploring the Practical Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning in Maxillofacial Surgery: A Comprehensive Analysis of Published Works","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1758/v1","date":1714135631000,"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL) or machine learning (ML) is the ability of computer systems, machines and enginery to work devise procedures like humans. These technologies provide opportunities and possibilities to advance diagnostics and in planning also in the field of human medicine and dentistry. The purpose of this literature review was to ascertain the applicability and significance of AI, as well as to highlight its uses in maxillofacial surgery. The primary inclusion criterion for this publication was an original paper written in English focusing on the use of AI, DL or ML in maxillofacial surgery. The sources of information were PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, and the queries were made on 31st of December 2023. The search strings used were “artificial intelligence maxillofacial surgery”, “machine learning maxillofacial surgery” and “deep learning maxillofacial surgery”. Following the removal of duplicates, all remaining publications that were returned by the searches and were screened by three independent operators to minimize the risk of bias. The analysis of publications from 1992 to 2023 identified certain records, of which 324 were finally selected. These were calculated according to the year of publication with a continuous increase (excluding 2012 and 2013) of R2 = 0.9295. Generally, in orthognathic dentistry and maxillofacial surgery, artificial intelligence and machine learning have gained popularity over the past few decades. When we included the keywords \"planning in maxillofacial surgery\" and \"planning in orthognathic surgery\", the set of published papers significantly increased to the number of 7535 publications. The first publication appeared in 1965, with an increasing trend (excluding 2014-2018), with an R2 value of 0.8642. These tools have been found useful for diagnosis, treatment planning in head and neck surgical oncology, cosmetic and aesthetic surgery, and in oral pathology. In orthognathic surgery, they have been utilised for diagnosis, treatment planning, assessment of treatment needs, cephalometric analyses, and orthognathic surgeries, among other applications. The review confirms that the current use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in maxillofacial surgery is focused mainly on the evaluation of digital diagnostic methods especially radiology, treatment plans and postoperative results. However, as these technologies are integrated in maxillofacial surgery and robotic surgery in head and neck region, it is expected that in the future they will be gradually utilized to plan and comprehensively evaluate the success of maxillofacial surgeries.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"79a5746b41925a4b09cb11d4462fd12ebe313929c454b8a42e29dea6e33e4faa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
