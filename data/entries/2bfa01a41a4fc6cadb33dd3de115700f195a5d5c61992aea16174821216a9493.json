{"title":"Trends and Environmental Drivers of Marine Fish Landings in Cuba&rsquo;s Most Productive Shelf Area","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1128/v1","date":1715943414000,"content":"Marine finfish landings in Cuba have decreased during the last 30 years. However, in Cuba's most productive fishing region, certain species, including rays, herrings, and snappers, have increased landings over the past decade. Despite these anomalies, no comprehensive analysis of the interactions between multispecies landing dynamics, environmental factors, and fishing effort has been carried out. This study estimates the dynamics of multispecies finfish landings between 1981 and 2017 on the southeastern coast of Cuba. Dynamic factor analyses (DFA) were performed to identify common landing trends across multiple species and their relationship with fishing effort and environmental variables. During the period analyzed, finfish landings and fishing effort decreased by 46% and over 80%, respectively. Despite concerns about overfishing, landings per unit of effort (LPUE) increased by 2.8 times, suggesting the decline in landings was closely linked to decreasing fishing effort and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation cycles, with delays of 2 and 3 years. The study highlights the changing relationship between landings and fishing effort, suggesting that LPUE may not accurately reflect true stock abundance. The findings of this study will assist in integrating the dynamics of finfish species, ecosystem status, and management actions for Cubaâ€™s most productive fishing zone.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bfa01a41a4fc6cadb33dd3de115700f195a5d5c61992aea16174821216a9493","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
