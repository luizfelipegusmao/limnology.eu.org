However, a significant limitation of these methods is their lack of statistical robustness and representativeness for the materials being studied [<a href=\"#ozae044.811-B1\">1</a>]. In recent years, four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) has emerged as a method capable of gathering more comprehensive information across a broader field of view [<a href=\"#ozae044.811-B2\">2</a>] The integration of 4D-STEM with in situ methodologies has made it into a powerful tool for examining material dynamics [<a href=\"#ozae044.811-B3\">3-4</a>]. In this work, we have developed an in situ 4D-STEM technique specifically for the statistical analysis of the structural dynamics in nanocrystalline thin films. The statistical data obtained from in situ 4D-STEM represents a crucial enhancement to traditional in situ TEM methods, providing a more representative understanding of the materials under investigation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d4b6e4e54672efda3cb453ea26eb82a70d40e2a62e7262db9226b14a97494bc7","category":"Environment"}
