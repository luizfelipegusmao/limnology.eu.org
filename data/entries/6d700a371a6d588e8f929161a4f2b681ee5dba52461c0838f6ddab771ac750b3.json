{"title":"Development of an alternative method to quantify H2S: application in wine fermentation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13876?af=R","date":1726141837000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>A colorimetric method for the quantification of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) produced in microbial fermentations was developed using lead gelled alginate microparticles packed in glass columns. The formation of a lead sulfide complex, between H₂S and lead ion (Pb<sup>2+</sup>) immobilized on the microparticles, allowed simple and accurate quantification by colorimetry.</p>\n<h2>RESULTS</h2>\n<p>The microparticle-loaded columns were calibrated and showed significant analytical sensitivity. The calibration curve of the system showed a correlation coefficient (<i>r</i>\n<sup>2</sup>) of 0.995 and a detection limit of 1.29 ± 0.02 μg L<sup>−1</sup>. The application of the columns in laboratory wine fermentations was able to detect variations in H<sub>2</sub>S production from 10.6 to 23.5 μg L<sup>−1</sup> by increasing the sugar content in the medium, and from 10.6 to 3.2 μg L<sup>−1</sup> with decreasing nitrogen content in the medium.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Validation of the proposed method was carried out by determining H₂S in a vinic fermentation model, the results of which were compared with those obtained using a reference chemical method. The data obtained showed no statistically significant differences between the two methods, confirming the reliability and accuracy of the developed system. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>","author":"María José Paredes, \nSergio Benavides‐Valenzuela","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture: Table of Contents","siteHash":"fec355e96833084e79d8fcfe545b79bc45871fa0d8eab764467d4e96ba48f4c0","entryHash":"6d700a371a6d588e8f929161a4f2b681ee5dba52461c0838f6ddab771ac750b3","category":"Environment"}
