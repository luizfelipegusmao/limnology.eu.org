Lead halide perovskite, where B site is occupied by lead and X site is occupied by halides, was first applied in photovoltaic cells in 2009 [<a href=\"#ozae044.994-B1\">1</a>]. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been pushed to above 25% [<a href=\"#ozae044.994-B2\">2</a>], demonstrating great potential for commercial photovoltaic devices.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"795f05afa57ca4482b911b60b412ece7fb18c1c994e781579b8fd7932117d32f","category":"Environment"}
