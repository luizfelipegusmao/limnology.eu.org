{"title":"Acoustic Emission Monitoring in Prestressed Concrete: A Comparative Study of Signal Attenuation from Wire-Breaks and Rebound-Hammer Impulses","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1152/v1","date":1710850409000,"content":"Acoustic emission monitoring (AEM) has emerged as an effective technique for detecting wire-breaks resulting from, e.g., stress corrosion cracking, and its application on prestressed concrete bridges is increasing. The success of this monitoring measure depends crucially on a carefully designed sensor layout. For this the attenuation of elastic waves within the structureâ€™s material is determined ideally in-situ through object-related measurements with a reproducible signal source, typically a rebound-hammer. This assumes that the attenuation coefficients derived from rebound-hammer tests are comparable to those from wire-breaks, thus allowing their results to be directly applied to wire-break detection without further adjustments. This study challenges this assumption by analysing attenuation behaviour through an extensive dataset. Employing time-domain and frequency analysis, the research generates attenuation profiles from laboratory experiments and in-situ measurements across various girders and bridge structures, extracting the slope and standard deviation of the residuals. While generally validating this approach, the findings highlight differences in attenuation behaviour from among wire-break signals and rebound-hammer impulses, whereby the latter potentially underestimates the relevant attenuation of wire-breaks by approximately 20 %. Consequently, a transfer factor is proposed to adjust object-related measurement results for wire-break scenarios, including a variance of 1.0 dB/m to cover a 95 % confidence interval for sample scattering. Moreover, the anisotropic attenuation behaviour across different structures was studied, showing that transverse attenuation consistently exceeds the longitudinal, significantly influenced by structural features such as voids. In prefabricated concrete bridges with in-situ-cast concrete slabs, transverse signal transmission remains unhindered across multiple elements. Finally, the results provide a valuable reference for the design of sensor layouts in bridge monitoring, particularly benefiting scenarios where direct in-situ experiences are lacking.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"db06e83dd7b7bc1a3f8be5e59458bc7d54318a22533caac9535653fd8135af6d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
