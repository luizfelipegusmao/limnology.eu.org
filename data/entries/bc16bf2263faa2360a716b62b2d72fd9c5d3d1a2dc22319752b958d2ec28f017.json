Understanding such a dynamic process requires dissection in time and space; this has been a major hurdle in studying cytokinesis. Using lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM), we studied cell plate development in four dimensions, through the behavior of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged cytokinesis-specific GTPase RABA2a vesicles. We monitored the entire duration of cell plate development, from its first emergence, with the aid of YFPâ€“RABA2a, in both the presence and absence of cytokinetic callose. By developing a robust cytokinetic vesicle volume analysis pipeline, we identified distinct behavioral patterns, allowing the identification of three easily trackable cell plate developmental phases. Notably, the phase transition between phase I and phase II is striking, indicating a switch from membrane accumulation to the recycling of excess membrane material. We interrogated the role of callose using pharmacological inhibition with LLSM and electron microscopy. Loss of callose inhibited the phase transitions, establishing the critical role and timing of the polysaccharide deposition in cell plate expansion and maturation. This study exemplifies the power of combining LLSM with quantitative analysis to decode and untangle such a complex process.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"bc16bf2263faa2360a716b62b2d72fd9c5d3d1a2dc22319752b958d2ec28f017","category":"Environment"}
