{"title":"Non-invasive assessment of hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy in guanacos (Lama guanicoe) and its application in a wild population","link":"https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/doi/10.1093/conphys/coae003/7604205?rss=1","date":1707436800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Obtaining endocrinological profiles using non-invasive methodologies by the measurement of hormone fecal metabolites is a widely used method to monitor ovarian activity and pregnancy in wild species. These tools allow the obtention of physiological information without causing capture-related stress on the individuals. In this research, we aimed to 1) biologically validate a non-invasive method to assess fecal progestagens and estrogens fluctuations during gestation in guanacos (<span>Lama guanicoe</span>) and 2) apply this technique to assess pregnancy in a wild free-ranging population. Fecal samples were collected through the gestation period (~12 months) of female guanacos in a 6.5-ha paddock. An increase in fecal metabolites of both hormones was detected. Progestagens increased gradually, in contrast to estrogens, which remained at basal values for most of the gestation period and peaked only a few days before calving. To assess pregnancy in wild free-ranging animals, fecal samples were collected from a population of La Payunia provincial reserve (Mendoza, Argentina) during the beginning of gestation and at the end of gestation. Through the first months of possible gestation, pregnant females represented between 40 and 80% of the population; at the end of gestation, only 20–40% of the females had confirmed pregnancies. Our results demonstrated that the polyclonal antisera and sexual hormone metabolite assays used here detect variations in the metabolites excreted through feces in guanacos and provide the possibility of non-invasive hormone monitoring of female reproductive status. Also, the findings in wild conditions suggest that natural abortions could have occurred during the first months of gestation. Although some abortions may be natural, the harsh environmental conditions that challenge the support of such a long gestational process may be another relevant factor to consider. The results obtained here enhance our understanding of the reproductive physiology of one of the most emblematic ungulates in South America.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Conservation Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"4a082912a4c56fb995cff6adef0ae38f92bdd1ebaf3cc138784c2e321f859f92","entryHash":"0046cd53c07a9c547656f8a19b4de4afe85abfe36ec264cec548b50c4dae7d4f","category":"Environment"}
