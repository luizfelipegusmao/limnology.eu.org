{"title":"Effects of Light Intensity on the Growth and Nutrient Uptake of the Microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana from Digestate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0069/v1","date":1722562876000,"content":"Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganism able to receive light from sunlight and external light sources for their growth. Despite the simplicity of cultivation and their widespread presence, the growth of microalgae is affected by several factors, light intensity being a crucial one as it is linked to external environmental conditions. On the other hand, microalgae cultivation in wastewater with high nitrogen content has become a promising alternative as a low cost nutrients substrate method. However, effluents may contain many compounds, making therefore difficult the assessment of light intensity on cells growth profile and especially on nutrients assimilation rate. The aim of this study was the examination of the effect of intensity of light source on the growth and nutrient uptake rates by a freshwater microalgae, Chlorella sorokiniana in the effluent from an anaerobic digestion plant, with nitrogen content reaching up to 5 g/L. Microalgae were cultivated using three light intensities (1,500, 5,000 and 12,000 lx) in 10% digestate mixtures in water. Samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of microalgae cells, while aqueous phase samples were subjected to the analysis of nitrogen and phosphorous content. Biomass productivity followed the light intensity pattern: the highest the light the highest the cells growth. A similar pattern was observed in the reduction rate of nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations; however, nutrients reduction rate per gram of microalgae were mainly associated to biomass growth rate, indicating that the effect of light intensity was significant for biomass growth, without however changing the main nutrients assimilation pathway. In addition, results indicated that under high light intensity, microalgae might change their metabolism towards formation of lipids against nitrogenous compounds.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"91e15979cb0af41e1d4acf26663b8a926df7b46ddbc487d724c05c2fd7ec8714","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
