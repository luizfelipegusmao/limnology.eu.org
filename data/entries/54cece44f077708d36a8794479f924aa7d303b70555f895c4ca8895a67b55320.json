{"title":"Functional response of Franklinothrips vespiformis (Thysanoptera: Aeolothripidae) to eggs and nymphs of Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/doi/10.1093/jisesa/ieae030/7619557?rss=1","date":1709596800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The Middle East Asia Minor 1 biotype of <span>Bemisia tabaci</span> Gennadius (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a greenhouse and field crop pest of global significance. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of the generalist predatory thrips, <span>Franklinothrips vespiformis</span> Crawford (Thysanoptera: Aeolothripidae), as a biological control agent for <span>B. tabaci</span>. This was achieved by determining the functional responses of <span>F. vespiformis</span> larvae and adults to the egg and nymphal stages of <span>B. tabaci</span> under laboratory conditions. Analyses consisted of 10 replicates of each predator and prey stage combination on bean leaf discs for a 24-h period. Following logistic regression analyses to determine the functional response type exhibited, response parameters were estimated with nonlinear least squares regression using Rogerâ€™s equation. Results showed that <span>F. vespiformis</span> larvae and adults exhibited a Type II functional response when feeding on immature <span>B. tabaci</span>. The handling times (<span>T</span><sub><span>h</span></sub>) of <span>F. vespiformis</span> larvae and adults were magnitudes higher for <span>B. tabaci</span> nymphs than they were for eggs, which were in part driven by the higher attack rates (<span>a</span>) observed on eggs. The maximum attack rate (<span>T</span>/<span>T</span><sub><span>h</span></sub>) for <span>B. tabaci</span> eggs and nymphs exhibited by first-stage larvae, second-stage larvae, and adult <span>F. vespiformis</span> increased with increasing predator age. Results from this study suggest that <span>F. vespiformis</span> larvae and particularly adults are promising biological control agents for <span>B. tabaci</span> and are efficient predators at both low and high prey densities.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Insect Science Current Issue","siteHash":"138510f205cdefe00e375766040cc54e40d9554d03e26ae63e2eb3fff292ac04","entryHash":"54cece44f077708d36a8794479f924aa7d303b70555f895c4ca8895a67b55320","category":"Environment"}
