Her particular aim was to learn the intricacies of sample preparation for cryo-TEM in order to transfer the experience gained to cryo-STEM on soft matter respectively on liquid-solid interfaces. She joined a crowd of people that alike her came from different backgrounds, just to name a few: Elizabeth Villa, Julia Mahamid, Radostin Danev, Alexander Rigort and us (JP and WB). And Lena was determined to make \"life in cryo\" usable for materials science, which she later impressively demonstrated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ef05527d6bfc088550cd7e0f157de4639afb846f5cca9459587f2aebcde89cc8","category":"Environment"}
