{"title":"Production of Myxopyronin a Antibiotic from Different Soil Environments in Egypt","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0975/v1","date":1713181887000,"content":"Background:\nAntibiotic resistance is an overwhelming serious difficulty globally. This necessitates the exploration of novel sources of antibiotics to overcome this challenge.\nAim of the study:\nBacterial Myxopyronin A production from various soil environments \nEgypt; as well as testing its antimicrobial activity in preclinical animal testing and randomized human clinical trials phases 1/2.\nType of the study:\nScreening experimental study.\nMethodology:\nDifferent soil environments in Egypt were screened for the growth of bacterial isolates producing Myxopyronin A as an antimicrobial agent. Purification of Myxopyronin A was performed via reversed-phase HPLC. Paper disc diffusion assay, as well as the Broth dilution technique, were exploited to assess the invitro antimicrobial and minimum inhibitory concentration( MIC) of the test antibiotic. Furthermore, in vivo antimicrobial spectrum, adverse drug reactions, and pharmacokinetics were detected during animal model testing stages and human randomized clinical trials phases 1/2.\nResults:\nFrom the culture supernatant of the Myxobacterium Myxococcus fulvus 124B02 which was the predominant soil bacterial isolate grown on the Casein yeast peptone plate, Myxopyronin A was produced. The test antibiotic blocked the growth of many Gram +ve bacteria with MICs less than 100 mcg/ ml. In contrast, it inhibited the growth of a few Gram -ve bacteria such as Escherichia coli at MICs greater than 100 mcg/ ml.  On the other hand, Eukaryotic cells such as fungal and human cells were not affected.  Prokaryotic DNA-dependant-RNA polymerase( RNLP) was noticed to be inhibited via the test antibiotic suggesting its bactericidal action. The maximum concentration was 7-8 mcg/ ml at a maximum time of 2 hours when 600 mg dose was orally administered in randomized human clinical trials phases 1/2, and T1/2 reached 2.5 hours following first-order kinetics of elimination. The duration of its action was nearly 12 hours after oral administration. Rare toxicity was detected during preclinical and randomized human clinical trials phases 1/2 in the form of mild diarrhea and cholestatic jaundice in less than 5 % of experimental candidates. \nConclusion:\nThe present study was promising due to the bactericidal antibiotic Myxopyronin A production from Myxococcus fulvus 124B02 isolated from different soil environments in Egypt.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67c057cca720919d3200db7059686dab5b0bce00684916f50e759ecedbe4cd99","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
