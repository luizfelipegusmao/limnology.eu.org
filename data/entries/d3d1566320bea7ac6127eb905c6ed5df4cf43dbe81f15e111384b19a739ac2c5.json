{"title":"Influence of Local Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium to Photothermally Induced Acoustic Response of Complex Systems","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1105/v1","date":1715854687000,"content":"In this paper, the time-resolved model of photoacoustic signal for samples with a complex inner structure is derived including local non-equilibrium of structural elements with multiple degrees of freedom, i.e. structural entropy of the system. The local non-equilibrium is taken into account through the fractional operator. By analyzing the model for two types of time-dependent excitation, a very short pulse and a very long pulse, it is shown that the rates of non-equilibrium relaxations in complex samples can be measured by applying the derived model and time-domain measurements. Limitations of the model and further directions of its development are discussed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3d1566320bea7ac6127eb905c6ed5df4cf43dbe81f15e111384b19a739ac2c5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
