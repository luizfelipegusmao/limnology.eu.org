The eDNA concentration in experimental tanks without fish decreased exponentially, with a higher rate of decline observed under higher water temperature conditions. When a fish was introduced into a tank, the eDNA concentration was positively correlated with the length and weight of the fish.</p>","author":"Shoichiro Yamamoto","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"845a9091f4f6b827a7325085452c557af7e40f388696defddac777e17dd02cfb","category":"Environment"}
