However, observational limitations in obtaining high-resolution, real-time data on O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have led to a scarcity of research on O<sub>3</sub> formation sensitivity and mechanisms. Online measurements for O<sub>3</sub>, nitrogen oxides (NO<span>x</span>), and VOCs were made on the mountainside of Mount Tai (∼550 m a.s.l.) in China during the summer of 2022 and were compared with the data from a ground-level site. The Master Chemical Mechanism (V3.3.1) was used to uncover a positive correlation between NO<span>x</span> and photochemical reaction rates on the mountainside, marking it as a NO<span>x</span>-limited regime in contrast to the VOC-limited regime identified at surface. On the mountainside, lower NO levels limited hydroxyl radicals (OH) recycling reactions, resulting in earlier O<sub>3</sub> peaks and higher concentrations of hydroperoxy radicals (HO<sub>2</sub>) and organic peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>). The arrival of fresh air masses rich in NO accelerated OH radical cycling, enhanced atmospheric oxidization, and significantly impacted surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations though vertical transport. Moreover, NO<span>x</span> reduction scenario simulations show that when considering vertical transport, the peak O<sub>3</sub> production rate at the surface is lower due to differences in O<sub>3</sub> formation sensitivity vertically. This study highlights the significant sensitivity of O<sub>3</sub> formation to NO within the BL, underscoring the potential impact of vertical in situ O<sub>3</sub> formation above the ground on surface-level O<sub>3</sub> concentrations through vertical exchange, particularly in cities with mountainous terrain.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"a54e2f65d3b21917d0d012ff510432e57dcbdd59245614969f1c3526c322e3e7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
