{"title":"Protocol for the crowdsourced image-based morbidity hotspot surveillance for neglected tropical diseases (CIMS-NTDs)","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303179","date":1715349600000,"content":"<p>by Uchechukwu Madukaku Chukwuocha, Christopher Sule Oyamienlen, Ayoola Oluwaseun Bosede, Ikechukwu Nosike Dozie</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Efficient NTDs elimination strategies require effective surveillance and targeted interventions. Traditional methods are costly and time-consuming, often failing to cover entire populations in case of movement restrictions. To address these challenges, a morbidity image-based surveillance system is being developed. This innovative approach which leverages the smartphone technology aims at simultaneous surveillance of multiple NTDs, enhancing cost-efficiency, reliability, and community involvement, particularly in areas with movement constraints. Moreover, it holds promise for post-elimination surveillance.</p> Methodology <p>The pilot of this method will be conducted across three states in southern Nigeria. It will target people affected by Neglected Tropical Diseases and members of their communities. The new surveillance method will be introduced to target communities in the selected states through community stakeholderâ€™s advocacy meetings and awareness campaigns. The pilot which is set to span eighteen months, entails sensitizing NTDs-affected individuals and community members using signposts, posters, and handbills, to capture photos of NTDs manifestations upon notice using smartphones. These images, along with pertinent demographic information, will be transmitted to a dedicated server through WhatsApp or Telegram accounts. The received images will be reviewed and organized at backend and then forwarded to a panel of experts for identification and annotation to specific NTDs. Data generated, along with geocoordinate information, will be used to create NTDs morbidity hotspot maps using ArcGIS. Accompanying metadata will be used to generate geographic and demographic distributions of various NTDs identified. To protect privacy, people will be encouraged to send manifestation photos of the affected body part only without any identifiable features.</p> Evaluation protocol <p>NTDs prevalence data obtained using conventional surveillance methods from both the pilot and selected control states during the pilot period will be compared with data from the CIMS-NTDs method to determine its effectiveness.</p> Expected results and conclusion <p>It is expected that an effective, privacy-conscious, population inclusive new method for NTDs surveillance, with the potential to yield real-time data for the identification of morbidity hotspots and distribution patterns of NTDs will be established. The results will provide insights into the effectiveness of the new surveillance method in comparison to traditional approaches, potentially advancing NTDs elimination strategies.</p>","author":"Uchechukwu Madukaku Chukwuocha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"c58dd73ac119f5f764bb4e05e0e9e8f71e78309de7cb51565f13b102177f2cb9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
