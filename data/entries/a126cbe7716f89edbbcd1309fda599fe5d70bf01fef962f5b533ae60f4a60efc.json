{"title":"Advancing neogene-quaternary reservoir characterization in offshore Nile Delta, Egypt: high-resolution seismic insights and 3D modeling for new prospect identification","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12665-024-11846-1","date":1728086400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>This study presents a comprehensive characterization of the Neogene-Quaternary formations within the offshore Temsah gas field, which is approximately 65 km NNW of Port Said offshore the Nile Delta Basin. By integrating seismic and well log data, we constructed a detailed static reservoir model to address the complex geological structures and evaluate hydrocarbon potential. The Temsah offshore gas field has a complex geological structure characterized by numerous normal faults aligned in the two fault systems one northeast-southwest and another northwest-southeast trending. The predominance of clastic rocks and petroleum system setting in the Nile Delta Basin make this location favourable for hydrocarbon accumulations. Utilizing data from four wells and twenty-nine seismic lines, an in-depth interpretation was conducted to overcome the challenge of precise seismic feature delineation. Static reservoir model incorporates detailed three-dimensional visualizations of sandstones and shale layers, with a particular focus on the Upper Sandstone of Kafr El-Sheikh and Sidi Salem formations. Detailed three-dimensional model illustrated the structural impact on the studied reservoirs. Shale volume, water saturation property distribution grids complemented a constructed 3D model depicting the spatial distribution of rock facies and petrophysical parameters within the Temsah gas field. The integrated approach facilitated the identification and evaluation of three hydrocarbon prospect locations with estimated Gas Initially In Place (GIIP) ranging from approximately 2,856,782 Billion Cubic Feet [BCF] to 5,332,660 [BCF]. These findings underscore the substantial potential for advancing field development in the Temsah gas field.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"a126cbe7716f89edbbcd1309fda599fe5d70bf01fef962f5b533ae60f4a60efc","category":"Environment"}
