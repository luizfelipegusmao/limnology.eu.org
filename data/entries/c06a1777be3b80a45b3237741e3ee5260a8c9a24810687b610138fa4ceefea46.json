Bariatric/metabolic surgeries, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), provide an avenue for exploring the potential key factors involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis since these surgeries have shown promising results in improving glycemic control among patients with severe type 2 diabetes (T2D). For the first time, a markedly altered population of serum proteins in patients after LSG was discovered and analyzed through proteomics. Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) was revealed to be increased dramatically in diabetic obese patients following LSG, and a similar effect was observed in patients after RYGB surgery. Moreover, recombinant apoA-IV protein treatment was proven to enhance insulin secretion in isolated human islets. These results showed that apoA-IV may play a crucial role in glycemic control in humans, potentially through enhancing insulin secretion in human islets. ApoA-IV was further shown to enhance energy expenditure and improve glucose tolerance in diabetic rodents, through stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells, partially via Gαs-coupled GPCR/cAMP (G protein-coupled receptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signaling. Furthermore, T55−121, truncated peptide 55−121 of apoA-IV, was discovered to mediate the function of apoA-IV. These collective findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between apoA-IV and glycemic control, highlighting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in managing and improving glucose regulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Life Metabolism Current Issue","siteHash":"d3cf61b7d69b232b580c1102d6441106867080e8dca2814adef0cc08b7e63ed3","entryHash":"c06a1777be3b80a45b3237741e3ee5260a8c9a24810687b610138fa4ceefea46","category":"Environment"}
