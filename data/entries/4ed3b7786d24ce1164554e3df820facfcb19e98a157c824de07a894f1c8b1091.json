{"title":"The Protective Role of Intermedin in Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury: Enhancing Peritubular Capillary Endothelial Cell Adhesion and Integrity through the cAMP/Rac1 Pathway","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1905/v1","date":1724750306000,"content":"Background: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) is a common complication in hospital-acquired renal conditions, yet its pathogenesis remains unclear and effective treatments are limited. Intermedin (IMD), a peptide related to the calcitonin gene, exhibits vasodilatory and endothelial barrier-stabilizing effects via the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). However, the potential of IMD in mitigating CIAKI has not been thoroughly investigated.\nAims: This study aimed to delineate the protective role of IMD in CIAKI through both in vitro and in vivo models, with a particular focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms, specifically the cAMP/Rac1 signaling pathway.\nMethods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with iohexol to simulate kidney injury in vitro. The protective effects of IMD were evaluated using the CCK8 assay, flow cytometry, ELISA, and western blotting. A CIAKI rat model was developed to assess renal peritubular capillary endothelial cell injury and renal function using a range of techniques, including histopathology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy.\nResults: In vitro, IMD significantly enhanced HUVEC viability and mitigated iohexol-induced toxicity by preserving intercellular adhesion junctions and activating the cAMP/Rac1 pathway. The protective effects of IMD were attenuated by Rac1 inhibition. In vivo, CIAKI caused considerable damage to peritubular capillary endothelial cell junctions, leading to impaired renal function. IMD treatment markedly improved renal function, an effect that was abolished by Rac1 inhibition.\nConclusion: IMD protects against renal injury in CIAKI by activating the cAMP/Rac1 pathway, thereby preserving the integrity of peritubular capillary endothelial cells and mitigating acute renal injury induced by contrast media. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of IMD in CIAKI and emphasize the critical role of the cAMP/Rac1 pathway in renal protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ed3b7786d24ce1164554e3df820facfcb19e98a157c824de07a894f1c8b1091","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
