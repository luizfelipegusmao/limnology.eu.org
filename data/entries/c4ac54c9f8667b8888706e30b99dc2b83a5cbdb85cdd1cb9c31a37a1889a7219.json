{"title":"Determination of the Hubble Constant and Sound Horizon from DESI Year 1 and DES Year 6 BAO Measurements and Low Redshift Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.2125/v1","date":1717144538000,"content":"We perform new measurements of the expansion rate and the sound horizon at the end of the baryon decoupling and derive constraints on cosmic key parameters in the framework of the ΛCDM model, flat wCDM model, the ΛCDM+ΩK model and the phenomenological emergent dark energy (PEDE) model. We keep rd and H0 completely free and use the recent dark energy spectroscopic instrument (DESI) Year 1 and dark energy survey (DES) Year 6 BAO measurements in the effective redshift range 0.3&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;2.33 combined with the compressed form of the Pantheon sample of Type Ia supernovae, the latest 33 observational H(z) measurements based on the differential age method, and the recent H0 measurement from SH0ES 2022 as an additional Gaussian prior. Combining BAO data with the observational H(z) measurements, and the Pantheon SNe Ia data, we get H0=69.65±1.07 km s−1 Mpc−1, rd=147.71±2.18 Mpc in ΛCDM model, H0=70.06±1.07 km s−1 Mpc−1, rd=147.39±2.50 Mpc in PEDE model. The spatial curvature is Ωk=0.025±0.026 and the dark energy equation of state is w=−1.016±0.056, consistent with a cosmological constant. We apply the Akaike information and the Bayesian information criterion test to compare the four models, and see that PEDE model performs better.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c4ac54c9f8667b8888706e30b99dc2b83a5cbdb85cdd1cb9c31a37a1889a7219","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
