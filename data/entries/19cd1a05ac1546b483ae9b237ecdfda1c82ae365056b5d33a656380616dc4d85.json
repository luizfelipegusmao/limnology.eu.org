{"title":"Suppression of Nitrogen Deposition on Global Forest Soil CH4 Uptake Depends on Nitrogen Status","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GB008098?af=R","date":1719990000000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is the second most important atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) and forest soils are a significant sink for atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>. Uptake of CH<sub>4</sub> by global forest soils is affected by nitrogen (N) deposition; clarifying the effect of N deposition helps to reduce uncertainties of the global CH<sub>4</sub> budget. However, it remains an unsolved puzzle why N input stimulates soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake in some forests while suppressing it in others. Combining previous findings and data from N addition experiments conducted in global forests, we proposed and tested a “stimulating-suppressing-weakened effect” (“three stages”) hypothesis on the changing responses of soil CH<sub>4</sub> flux (<i>R</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>CH4</i>\n</sub>) to N input. Specifically, we calculated the response factors (<i>f</i>) of <i>R</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>CH4</i>\n</sub> to N input for N-limited and N-saturated forests across biomes; the phased changes in <i>f</i> values supported our hypothesis. We also estimated the global forest soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake budget to be approximately 11.2 Tg yr<sup>−1</sup>. CH<sub>4</sub> uptake hotspots were predominantly located in temperate forests. Furthermore, we quantified that the current level of N deposition reduced global forest soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake by ∼3%. This suppression effect was more pronounced in temperate forests than in tropical or boreal forests, likely due to differences in N status. The proposed “three stages” hypothesis in this study generalizes the diverse effects of N input on <i>R</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>CH4</i>\n</sub>, which could help improve experimental design. Additionally, our findings imply that by regulating N pollution and reducing N deposition, soil CH<sub>4</sub> uptake can be significantly increased in the N-saturated forests in tropical and temperate biomes.</p>","author":"Xiaoyu Cen, \nNianpeng He, \nMingxu Li, \nLi Xu, \nXueying Yu, \nWeixiang Cai, \nXin Li, \nKlaus Butterbach‐Bahl","siteTitle":"Wiley: Global Biogeochemical Cycles: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2d4e750daa5e386ca7dda0c54cc50454a723cbd123b964bfed1d56a4712b632","entryHash":"19cd1a05ac1546b483ae9b237ecdfda1c82ae365056b5d33a656380616dc4d85","category":"Environment"}
