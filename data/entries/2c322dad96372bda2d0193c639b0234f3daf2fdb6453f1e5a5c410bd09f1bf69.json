{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Mixed Reality and PowerPoint in Education: Tailoring Learning Approaches to Cognitive Profiles","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0776/v1","date":1718173749000,"content":"The term immersive technology refers to various types of technologies and perspectives that are constantly changing and developing. It can be used for different purposes and domains such as: education, healthcare, entertainment, arts, and engineering. This research paper aims to examine which training method is more effective between the traditional approach, using PowerPoint and the immersive technology approach, through mixed reality using a HoloLens 2 device. The experiment involves comparing two groups of students who received different training methods: the first group saw a PowerPoint slide with an image of the human muscular system, while the second group saw a 3D hologram of the human body that showed the same muscle groups as in PowerPoint. The researchers wanted to test whether mixed reality devices could enhance students' cognitive functions and to investigate if the IQ of the participants had any influence in the effectiveness of the teaching method. The main finding of this study is that the instructions given with mixed reality technology, via the Microsoft HoloLens 2 device, are more appropriate for participants who have an IQ score below 100 points. For the other participants, with an IQ score above 100 points, the PowerPoint support was more suitable.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2c322dad96372bda2d0193c639b0234f3daf2fdb6453f1e5a5c410bd09f1bf69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
