{"title":"A KATP Channel Theory of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1135/v1","date":1723727183000,"content":"I present the first complete theory of ADHD. ADHD occurs when the organism adapts to try to maintain higher glucose levels than normal. The main mechanism via which this is done is by faster opening of KATP channels, mainly Kir6.2/SUR1, which increases the cell's intrinsic \\xtblty. I show that this induces all of the symptoms of ADHD. The optimal treatment for ADHD already exists, since drugs of the sulfonylurea family close KATP channels and have been used for safely treating people for dozens of years.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f8483f0af6d8b5bf844b51a3a8c3e8367caa79613d99a51c43cfd10961b6a2d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
