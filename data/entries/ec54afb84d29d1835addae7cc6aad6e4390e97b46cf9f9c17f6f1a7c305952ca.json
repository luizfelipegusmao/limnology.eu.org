The reconstructed images are information-rich and exhibit high axial and diffraction-limited transverse resolutions [<a href=\"#ozae044.393-B1\">1</a>]. In in-line holography, both object and reference travel along the same line and are interfered at the image plane to generate a hologram of the object [<a href=\"#ozae044.393-B2\">2</a>]. Its advantages include simplicity, high resolution, and large depth of field. However, the primary drawback associated with this technique is the undesirable noise terms as the twin-image artifact, making it a major challenge in reconstructing the object. Both virtual and real images share the same line of sight. So, when focusing on one of these images, it appears superimposed with an out-of-focus image of the other. These limitations are avoided through the off-axis arrangement.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ec54afb84d29d1835addae7cc6aad6e4390e97b46cf9f9c17f6f1a7c305952ca","category":"Environment"}
