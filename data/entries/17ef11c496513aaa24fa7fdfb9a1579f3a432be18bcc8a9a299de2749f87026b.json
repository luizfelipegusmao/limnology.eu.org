{"title":"ConfluentFUCCI for fully-automated analysis of cell-cycle progression in a highly dense collective of migrating cells","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305491","date":1719410400000,"content":"<p>by Leo Goldstien, Yael Lavi, Lior Atia</p>\r\n\r\nUnderstanding mechanisms underlying various physiological and pathological processes often requires accurate and fully automated analysis of dense cell populations that collectively migrate. In such multicellular systems, there is a rising interest in the relations between biophysical and cell cycle progression aspects. A seminal tool that led to a leap in real-time study of cell cycle is the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). Here, we introduce ConfluentFUCCI, an open-source graphical user interface-based framework that is designed, unlike previous tools, for fully automated analysis of cell cycle progression, cellular dynamics, and cellular morphology, in highly dense migrating cell collectives. We integrated into ConfluentFUCCIâ€™s pipeline state-of-the-art tools such as Cellpose, TrackMate, and Napari, some of which incorporate deep learning, and we wrap the entire tool into an isolated computational environment termed container. This provides an easy installation and workflow that is independent of any specific operation system. ConfluentFUCCI offers accurate nuclear segmentation and tracking using FUCCI tags, enabling comprehensive investigation of cell cycle progression at both the tissue and single-cell levels. We compare ConfluentFUCCI to the most recent relevant tool, showcasing its accuracy and efficiency in handling large datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of ConfluentFUCCI to monitor cell cycle transitions, dynamics, and morphology within densely packed epithelial cell populations, enabling insights into mechanotransductive regulation of cell cycle progression. The presented tool provides a robust approach for investigating cell cycle-related phenomena in complex biological systems, offering potential applications in cancer research and other fields.","author":"Leo Goldstien","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"17ef11c496513aaa24fa7fdfb9a1579f3a432be18bcc8a9a299de2749f87026b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
