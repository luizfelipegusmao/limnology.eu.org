While survival rates for breast cancer patients are typically favorable, the emergence of regional metastases markedly diminishes survival prospects. Detecting metastases and comprehending their molecular underpinnings are crucial for tailoring effective treatments and improving patient survival outcomes.</p> Methods <p>Various artificial intelligence methods and techniques were employed in this study to achieve accurate outcomes. Initially, the data was organized and underwent hold-out cross-validation, data cleaning, and normalization. Subsequently, feature selection was conducted using ANOVA and binary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). During the analysis phase, the discriminative power of the selected features was evaluated using machine learning classification algorithms. Finally, the selected features were considered, and the SHAP algorithm was utilized to identify the most significant features for enhancing the decoding of dominant molecular mechanisms in lymph node metastases.</p> Results <p>In this study, five main steps were followed for the analysis of mRNA expression data: reading, preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and SHAP algorithm. The RF classifier utilized the candidate mRNAs to differentiate between negative and positive categories with an accuracy of 61% and an AUC of 0.6. During the SHAP process, intriguing relationships between the selected mRNAs and positive/negative lymph node status were discovered. The results indicate that GDF5, BAHCC1, LCN2, FGF14-AS2, and IDH2 are among the top five most impactful mRNAs based on their SHAP values.</p> Conclusion <p>The prominent identified mRNAs including GDF5, BAHCC1, LCN2, FGF14-AS2, and IDH2, are implicated in lymph node metastasis. This study holds promise in elucidating a thorough insight into key candidate genes that could significantly impact the early detection and tailored therapeutic strategies for lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer.</p>","author":"Sepideh Zununi Vahed","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"2dc9956445af13eab1f2e7722a18e806d2f0f0425e46c8e96abde3e4a003c85f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
