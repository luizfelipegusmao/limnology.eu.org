{"title":"Unveiling the Significance of LysE in Survival and Virulence of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: A Comprehensive Review reveals it as a potential Drug Target, Diagnostic Marker, and a Vaccine Candidate","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1084/v1","date":1710821535000,"content":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health threat, necessitating innovative strategies for control and prevention. This comprehensive review explores the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lysine Exporter (LysE) gene, unveiling its multifaceted roles and potential uses in controlling and preventing tuberculosis (TB). As a pivotal player in eliminating excess L-lysine and L-arginine, LysE contributes to the survival and virulence of M. tuberculosis. This review synthesizes findings from different electronic databases and includes 13 studies focused on the LysE of M. tuberculosis. The research unveils that LysE can be a potential drug target, a diagnostic marker for TB, and a promising candidate for vaccine development. The absence of LysE in the widely used BCG vaccine underscores its uniqueness and positions it as a novel area for TB prevention. In conclusion, this review underscores the significance of LysE in TB pathogenesis and its potential as a drug target, diagnostic marker, and vaccine candidate. The multifaceted nature of LysE positions it at the forefront of innovative approaches to combat TB, calling for sustained research efforts to harness its full potential in the global fight against this infectious disease.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"94e4bbb8f255cd6f8cddf5079c987138b195953696f155297e5ea6237cef2145","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
