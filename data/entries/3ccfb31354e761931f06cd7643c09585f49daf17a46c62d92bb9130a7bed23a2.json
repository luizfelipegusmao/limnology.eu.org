{"title":"Optimal Position of Fixed crane and Dynamic Transport Truck Parking in Precast Building Construction Project","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1121/v1","date":1710847569000,"content":"Efficient fixed crane position analysis is critical in precast buildings construction to               maximize lifting efficiency for precast elements. The primary objective is to minimize the travel distances of fixed cranes, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and cost control. This involves strategically reducing the distances between the transport truck parking, where elements are stored, the fixed crane, and the construction installation point. Despite its significance, existing studies often overlook the dynamic movement efficiency of transport trucks, particularly when dealing with multiple transport trucks and various models of fixed cranes, rendering the opti-mization of this scenario a challenging NP-hard problem susceptible to combinatorial explosion. This study presents a novel mathematical model leveraging the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model aims to solve optimal model and position of fixed cranes, along with identifying ideal positions for transport truck parking. The study's methodology is validated and demonstrated through a project case study. Comparative analyses between the proposed model and the original planning underscore a noteworthy 6% reduction in both duration and costs when lifting elements directly from transport trucks, as opposed to establishing an on-site stock yard. Furthermore, the developed GA exhibits a substantial improvement in final solutions, achieving a remarkable 30% reduction in both operational duration and costs. This research contributes valuable insights into fixed crane position analysis of precast building construction, providing foundation for enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the industry.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3ccfb31354e761931f06cd7643c09585f49daf17a46c62d92bb9130a7bed23a2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
