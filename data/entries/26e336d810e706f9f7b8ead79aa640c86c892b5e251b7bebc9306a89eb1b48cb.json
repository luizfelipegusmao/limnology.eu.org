{"title":"The Effect of Carboxymethyl Cellulose on Gene Expression Related with Apoptosis, Cold Shock, Motility and Reactive Oxygen Species of Cryopreserved Dog Sperm","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1572/v1","date":1721379205000,"content":"Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) can act as a nonpermeating cryoprotectant, reducing the toxici-ty of glycerol. The dog spermatozoa were diluted and frozen in freezing extender supplemented with 0 (control), 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 % (w/v) CMC. Post-thaw, the sperm kinematic parameters (CASA), viability (SYBR-14/PI), and acrosome integrity (FITC-PSA) were evaluated. The expres-sion of genes related to apoptosis (BCL2, BAX, and ANAXA), motility (BACTIN), cold shock proteins (YBX3), and ROS (CAT, ROMO1, and SMOX) was evaluated using qPCR. The total mo-tility was higher in the 0.1 % CMC group compared to the other groups (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"26e336d810e706f9f7b8ead79aa640c86c892b5e251b7bebc9306a89eb1b48cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
