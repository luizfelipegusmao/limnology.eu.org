In reciprocal space, the Bragg pattern still possesses long-range translation periodicity, while the disorder diffracts as diffuse scattering around the Bragg peaks. There sometimes persist local correlations of those non-repeating variations, which endows the diffuse scattering with anisotropy in reciprocal space and is defined as “correlated disorder” [<a href=\"#ozae044.754-B2\">2</a>]. Over the past few decades, correlated disorder has been harnessed to achieve emergent phenomena and advanced functionalities that are inaccessible in well-ordered systems [<a href=\"#ozae044.754-B3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.754-B4\">4</a>]. Therefore, revealing the evolution of correlated disorder under external stimuli is critical for understanding the disorder-related properties.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"8352886b86a9eb19751eeae1a1d0d5ae26d504e03b31888ccd7ae6d7a86fbb7c","category":"Environment"}
