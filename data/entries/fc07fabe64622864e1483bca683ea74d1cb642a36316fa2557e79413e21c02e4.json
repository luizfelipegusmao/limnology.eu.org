{"title":"Immune Response to Mosquito Allergens Is Associated with Cross-Reactive Bee Venom Components: The Importance of Cross-Reactive Carbohydrate Determinants (CCDs) in the Bee-Mosquito Syndrome.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1783/v1","date":1711634247000,"content":"Mosquitoes are a family of the order Diptera, which includes more than 3500\nspecies. Two groups\nable to suck human blood and transmit diseases: the anophelines and the\nculicines comprise several genera such as Culex, Aedes and Aedes communis (Ac).\nPrevious study has demonstrated a significant relationship between Ac sensitization\nand either extract or single bee venom components suggesting a “bee-mosquito\nsyndrome” occurrence. It is well known that CCD can interference with the measurement of quantitative IgE results. Hence, it has been hypnotized that the presence of sIgE to CCD could have a role in the Bee-Mosquito syndrome.\nMethod\nSerum from 21 different Mosquito and Ape melifera allergic individuals were\ncombined with extracts of Mosquito (in house) and Apis melifera. SDS-PAGE\nand Immunoblot (IB) were carried out without and with with CCD-Inhibitor.\n\nResults\nThe data would\nsuggest IgE binding to common bands between Culex male, Culex female and\nAedes species mosquitos of approximate molecular weight ~21kDa, ~35kDa,\n~40kDa and ~55kDa. Whilst IgE binding has been observed to protein bands from\nthe Apis melifera extract, these bands do not align with any present in the\nmosquito extracts.\nThe use of a CCD-Inhibitor results in differences in IgE binding. Specifically, bands that were previously observed in the Apis melifera venom sample without use of CCD-Inhibitor at 40kDa and 90kDa are no longer observed when CCD-Inhibitor is used. Two bands of the Apis melifera venom remain present between 15-20kDa.\nNo major differences in banding pattern were observed for the mosquito samples with or without CCD-Inhibitor, although the blot appears cleaner with less background when CCD-Inhibitor is used.\nConclusion\nFurther experiments have to be done to determine whether the reactive bands\nfrom Apis melifera are unrelated proteins or whether the proteins are related\nhomologues of varying molecular weight.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fc07fabe64622864e1483bca683ea74d1cb642a36316fa2557e79413e21c02e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
