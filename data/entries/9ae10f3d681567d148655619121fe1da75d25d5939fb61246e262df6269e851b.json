{"title":"The Impact of the Information Use Environments (IUEs) and Information\nBehavior of People Living with Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) on Participatory Diagnosis and Treatment Programming","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2209/v1","date":1722244257000,"content":"This study examined how Information Use Environments (IUEs) influence the information behavior of people living with neglected tropical diseases (PLWNTDs) and how this affects their participation in diagnosis and treatment programs. The author demonstrated that local information use environments (IUEs) significantly impacted the information behavior of people living with neglected tropical diseases (PLWNTDs'), which can be harnessed to improve their involvement in diagnosis and treatment programs. The author compared user-centered and program-centered approaches within common IUEs in remote and impoverished areas, finding that NTDs persist due to a disconnect between program organizers and the affected individualsâ€™ information use environments (IUEs). Data was sourced from published papers, and OpenAI (ChatGPT) was used to generate list of local sources (IUEs) in affected remote communities. The findings indicated that understanding local IUEs can help program organizers enhance participation rates of individuals with NTDs in diagnosis and treatment initiatives.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9ae10f3d681567d148655619121fe1da75d25d5939fb61246e262df6269e851b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
