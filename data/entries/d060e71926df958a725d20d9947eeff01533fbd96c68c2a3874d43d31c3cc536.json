{"title":"Zircons from Eclogite-Associated Rocks of the Marun-Keu Complex, the Polar Urals: Trace Elements and U-pb Dating","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0415/v1","date":1717721271000,"content":"The Marun-Keu complex plays a significant role in understanding the geological evolution of the Ural orogen; however, it remains poorly understood. This study aims to provide insights into the complex's age, protolith composition, rock formation conditions, and its position in the region's history. The zircons from the host granitic gneisses are characterized by magmatic cores with an age of 470 Ma and metamorphic rims with an age of approximately 370 Ma. We suggest that the metamorphic rims were formed during eclogite metamorphism and that the metagranitoids hosting the eclogites experienced eclogite metamorphism simultaneously with the basic and ultrabasic rocks that are common in this area. Heterogeneous zircons were also isolated from the selvage of a pegmatite vein, in which four domains are distinguished, two to three of which can be identified within single grains, as follows: 1) igneous cores with an age of approximately 470 Ma and the geochemical characteristics of zircon crystallized in basic rocks; 2) zircons recrystallized during eclogite metamorphism with geochemical characteristics intermediate between those of the magmatic cores and true eclogitic zircon; 3) pegmatitic zircon, exhibiting the most sharply differentiated REE spectra of all four domains, characterized by a prominent positive Ce anomaly and a weakly expressed negative Eu anomaly; and 4) eclogitic zircon, observed in the form of veins and rims, superimposed in relation to the other three domains. The age of the latter three domains is within the error range and is estimated to be approximately 370 Ma. This indicates that the processes of eclogite metamorphism and the formation of pegmatites occurred at approximately the same time in the studied area.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d060e71926df958a725d20d9947eeff01533fbd96c68c2a3874d43d31c3cc536","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
