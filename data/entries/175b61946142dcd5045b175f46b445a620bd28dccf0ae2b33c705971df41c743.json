{"title":"Protein Nanoparticles as Viral Vaccine Platforms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0610/v1","date":1715326404000,"content":"Vaccines are one of the most effective medical interventions, playing a pivotal role in treating infectious diseases. Although traditional vaccines comprising of killed, inactivated, or live attenuated pathogens have resulted in protective immune responses, negative consequences of their administration have been well-appreciated. Modern vaccines have evolved to contain purified antigenic proteins, epitopes, or antigen-encoding mRNAs, rendering them relatively safe. However, reduced humoral and cellular responses pose major challenges to modern vaccine platforms. Protein nanoparticle (PNP)-based vaccines have garnered substantial interest in recent years for their ability to present repetitive array of antigens for improving immunogenicity and enhancing protective responses. Discovery and characterization of naturally occurring PNPs from various living organisms such as bacteria, archaea, viruses, insects, and eukaryotes, as well as computationally designed structures and approaches to link antigens to the PNPs have paved the way for unprecedented advances in the field of vaccine technology. In this review, we focus on some of the widely used naturally occurring and optimally designed PNPs for their suitability as promising vaccine platforms for displaying native-like antigens from viral pathogens for protective immune responses. Such platforms hold great promise in combating emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and enhancing vaccine efficacy and safety.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"175b61946142dcd5045b175f46b445a620bd28dccf0ae2b33c705971df41c743","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
