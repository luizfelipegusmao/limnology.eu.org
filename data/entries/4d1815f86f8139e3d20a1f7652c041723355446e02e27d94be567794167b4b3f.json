{"title":"Field Test of the MiniRadMeter Gamma and Neutron Detector for the EU Project CLEANDEM","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0028/v1","date":1725260045000,"content":"In the framework of the H2020 CLEANDEM project a small robotic vehicle was equipped with a series of different sensors, developed for the preliminary inspection of areas possibly contaminated by radiation. Such unmanned inspection allows to identify dangerous locations prior to the possible start of human operations. One of the developed devices, named MiniRadMeter, is a compact, low-cost sensor to perform gamma and neutron radiation field mapping of the environment. The MiniRadMeter was successfully tested in a simulated field mission with four \"hidden\" radioactive sources and a neutron generator. In this work we describe the test procedure and the results, also supported by the outcome of dedicated Monte Carlo simulations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4d1815f86f8139e3d20a1f7652c041723355446e02e27d94be567794167b4b3f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
