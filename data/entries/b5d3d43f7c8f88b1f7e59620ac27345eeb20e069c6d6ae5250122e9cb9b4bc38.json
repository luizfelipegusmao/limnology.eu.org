{"title":"Outcome assessment of different reward stimuli in Internet gaming disorder by event-related potentials","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307717","date":1721829600000,"content":"<p>by Mengyue Zhang, Chenyue Zhao, Ziyu Mao, Meng Zhang, Xiaoli Xing</p>\r\n\r\nAn imbalance in sensitivity to different types of reward stimuli may be an important cause of addiction that is mainly manifested in high sensitivity to addictive substance rewards and blunting of natural rewards. However, contradictions remain in the research results on the sensitivity of individuals with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) to different reward stimuli. Based on participantsâ€™ neural responses to win and loss feedback (in door task), the event-related potential (ERP) technique was used to investigate the effects of different types of reward stimuli on the assessment of reward-processing outcomes in individuals with IGD. The results showed that in the gain condition, the FB-P3 amplitude induced by game stimuli in the IGD group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the FN amplitude induced by money stimuli was significantly lower than that in the control group. However, the FB-P3 and FN amplitudes induced by food were not significantly different from those in the control group. In the loss condition, there were no between-group differences in the FB-P3 and FN amplitudes evoked by the three reward stimuli. This indicates that the IGD group showed increased hedonic responses to game stimuli and decreased hedonic responses to money but no differences in hedonic responses to food during the reward assessment phase. Therefore, heightened sensitivity to game rewards and diminished sensitivity to monetary rewards during outcome assessment may play a crucial role in the development of IGD.","author":"Mengyue Zhang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b5d3d43f7c8f88b1f7e59620ac27345eeb20e069c6d6ae5250122e9cb9b4bc38","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
