{"title":"Use of Social Media in Disaster Management: Challenges and Strategies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1740/v1","date":1711606365000,"content":"Studies on social media (SM) and disaster management (DM) have mainly focused on the adap-tation, application and use of SM in each stage of DM. With the widespread availability and use of SM, the effective utilisation of SM in DM is impeded by various challenges, but not yet com-prehensively researched. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the challenges, as well as the strategies to overcome the challenges and categorises them into a classified model. The study adopts a systematic literature review to present and analyse the challenges and strategies for us-ing SM in DM. Utilising prominent databases, 72 publications were carefully selected and ana-lysed qualitatively using content analysis. The findings revealed four key challenges to its users: spread of misinformation; insufficient human resources to manage SM use; lack of trust in infor-mation and authorities; and, poor information quality and content of messages. The study identi-fied several strategies to overcome challenges, which can be classified into three sectors of the SM community: individuals, organisations, and SM companies. These findings contribute to enhanc-ing the effective utilisation of SM in DM by community practitioners. Furthermore, this study provides insight into the current status of knowledge and identifies the research gaps around SM in DM for future research.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7da249bb8b5134cdda2b36d2734526781b1cc59fbbecb2aa8060e66f923ee613","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
