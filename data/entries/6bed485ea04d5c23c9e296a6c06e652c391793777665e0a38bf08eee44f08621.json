{"title":"Feeding limestone buffer to limit-fed dairy steers fed a high inclusion rate of distiller grains","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae130/7745659?rss=1","date":1724976000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The study objective was to evaluate dietary limestone buffer inclusion rates for impacting nutrient digestibility and excretion when growing dairy cattle are fed high distiller grains with solubles (DDGS) limit-fed ration. The hypothesis was that feeding more limestone buffer would offset a low rumen pH when feeding a high DDGS inclusion rate. Five ruminally cannulated Holstein and Brown Swiss steers were used in a crossover design having 2-wk periods to evaluate high and low buffer inclusion rates when limit-fed. Treatments were similar in ingredient composition being: 1) 40% DDGS at 0.80% high CaCO<sub>3</sub> buffer inclusion (<strong>HIGH</strong>) and 2) 40% DDGS with 0.25% low CaCO<sub>3</sub> buffer inclusion (<strong>LOW)</strong> with the remaining ration consisting of grass hay with minerals and vitamins. Rations were limit-fed at 2.50% of body weight (<strong>BW</strong>) using Calan feeding doors with steers being weighed every 2 wk with ration amounts adjusted accordingly. Rumen fluid was collected via the ruminal cannula at the start and end of each period for pH, ammonia-<span>n</span>, and volatile fatty acid (VFA)s. Fecal grab samples were collected at the end of each period for measurement of total-tract nutrient digestibility. There were no treatment-by-period interactions (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) for any of the growth parameters measured. Gains in frame growth parameters were similar (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) for steers fed both rations. BWs and gains were similar (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) for steers fed both rations. Steers fed the LOW ration demonstrated a numeric improvement in average daily gain combined with a tendency (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.06) for lower dry matter intake resulting in an improved (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) feed efficiency (gain:feed) compared with steers fed the HIGH ration. Steers fed HIGH demonstrated greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.01) ruminal ammonia-N and isovalerate concentrations compared with steers fed the LOW buffer ration. Steers fed both buffer inclusion rates were similar (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) for ruminal pH and remaining VFAs concentrations. Steers fed both buffer inclusion rates were similar (<span>P</span> &gt; 0.10) in DM and organic matter digestibilities. Limit-feeding a high DDGS inclusion rate ratio combined with a low buffer inclusion rate improved feed efficiency while maintaining growth performance. The study hypothesis was rejected in that feed efficiency can be enhanced when feeding a high DDGS ration by feeding a low calcium carbonate buffer.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"6bed485ea04d5c23c9e296a6c06e652c391793777665e0a38bf08eee44f08621","category":"Environment"}
