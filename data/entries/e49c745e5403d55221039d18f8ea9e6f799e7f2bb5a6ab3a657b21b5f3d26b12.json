{"title":"Southern South American Long-Distance Pollen Dispersal and Its Relationship with Atmospheric Circulation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2423/v1","date":1722320681000,"content":"This paper addresses the study of synoptic-scale meteorological conditions that favor long-range pollen transport in southern South America combining airborne pollen counts, modeled three-dimensional backward trajectories, and synoptic and surface meteorological data. Alnus pollen transport trajectories indicate origins predominantly in Montane forests of the Yungas between 1500 and 2800 m altitude. The South American Low-Level Jet is the main meteorological feature that explains 64\\% of the detected pollen arrival at the target site. Podocarpus and Nothofagus pollen instead are linked primarily to the widespread Subantartic forests in southern Patagonia. Their transport patterns are consistent with previous studies which show an association with synoptic patterns related to cold front passages carrying pollen in the free atmosphere (27% for Nothofagus and 25% for Podocarpus). These results show the significance of understanding long-distance pollen transport for disciplines such as climate change reconstruction and agriculture, emphasizing the need for further research to refine atmospheric circulation models and refine interpretations of past vegetation and climate dynamics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e49c745e5403d55221039d18f8ea9e6f799e7f2bb5a6ab3a657b21b5f3d26b12","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
