The former results in chirality, and the latter in electric polarization [<a href=\"#ozae044.693-B1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ozae044.693-B2\">2</a>]. A strong coupling between these two order parameters opens up the prospect of switching chirality with an applied electric field, thus making ferrochiral materials an attractive class of multiferroics.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f0acf6bc99fc4094603760cf2315753dde2279f5a8da98d0285cb5b7716207b5","category":"Environment"}
