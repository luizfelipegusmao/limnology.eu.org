It is an innovative, and rapidly growing technology to produce custom anatomical models and medical conditions models for medical teaching, surgical planning, and patient education. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of 3D printing in creating a superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm model based on CT scans for endovascular training.</p> Methods <p>A case of a left superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm was selected, and the 3D model was created using DICOM files imported into Materialise Mimics 22.0 and Materialise 3-Matic software, then printed using vat polymerization technology. Two 3D-printed models were created, and a series of comparisons were conducted between the 3D segmented images from CT scans and these two 3D-printed models. Ten comparisons involving internal diameters and angles of the specific anatomical location were measured.</p> Results <p>The study found that the absolute mean difference in diameter between the 3D segmented images and the 3D printed models was 0.179±0.145 mm and 0.216±0.143mm, respectively, with no significant difference between the two sets of models. Additionally, the absolute mean difference in angle was 0.99±0.65° and 1.00±0.91°, respectively, and the absolute mean difference in angle between the two sets of data was not significant. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed a high correlation in dimension measurements between the 3D-printed models and segmented images. Furthermore, the accuracy of a 3D-printed femoral pseudoaneurysm model was further tested through the simulation of a superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm coiling procedure using the Philips Azurion7 in the angiography room.</p> Conclusions <p>3D printing is a reliable technique for producing a high accuracy 3D anatomical model that closely resemble a patient’s anatomy based on CT images. Additionally, 3D printing is a feasible and viable option for use in endovascular training and medical education. In general, 3D printing is an encouraging technology with diverse possibilities in medicine, including surgical planning, medical education, and medical device advancement.</p>","author":"Suat Yee Lee","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"d5d25b3936e89e4b9dfc3d8fa0529dc5d74f6210b63f67f92085606be31a04a9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
