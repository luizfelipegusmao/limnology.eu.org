To assess progress toward a genome-scale Opisthokonta phylogeny, we conducted the most taxon rich phylogenomic analysis using sets of genes inferred with different orthology inference methods and established the geological timeline of Opisthokonta diversification. We also conducted sensitivity analysis by subsampling genes or taxa from the full data matrix based on filtering criteria previously shown to improve phylogenomic inference. We found that approximately 85% of internal branches were congruent across data matrices and the approaches used. Notably, the use of different orthology inference methods was a substantial contributor to the observed incongruence: analyses using the same set of orthologs showed high congruence of 97% to 98%, whereas different sets of orthologs resulted in somewhat lower congruence (87% to 91%). Examination of unicellular Holozoa relationships suggests that the instability observed across varying gene sets may stem from weak phylogenetic signals. Our results provide a comprehensive Opisthokonta phylogenomic framework that will be useful for illuminating ancient evolutionary episodes concerning the origin and diversification of the 2 major eukaryotic kingdoms and emphasize the importance of investigating effects of orthology inference on phylogenetic analyses to resolve ancient divergences.","author":"Hongyue Liu","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"ad01516748df5f46743b56e183a3155e637fac3cf1b02dcc738cd5b5cb9904cd","category":"Environment"}
