The study triangulated data from structured surveys and in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of individuals living with HIV, healthcare professionals, and experts in public health and social work, using a mixed-methods approach. The structured surveys provided specific data points, while the in-depth interviews and participant observations yielded rich, contextual insights. The results revealed a need for more personalized skincare solutions for individuals living with HIV, challenges in accessing dermatological care, and concerns regarding the efficacy of existing treatments. The integrated analysis of quantitative and qualitative data provided a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing skincare solutions for this population. Conclusions drawn from the study emphasize the importance of tailored skincare interventions, improved access to dermatological care, and the need for collaborative efforts between healthcare providers and individuals living with HIV. Future research directions include longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effectiveness of personalized skincare solutions and the exploration of innovative interventions integrating dermatological care and social support for individuals living with HIV.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d48c4ff45792e2992b850d7620d59dbb89f3748cd93121e62571137dd1a2897","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
