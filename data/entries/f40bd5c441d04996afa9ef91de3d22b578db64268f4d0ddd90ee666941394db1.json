{"title":"Transmission Electron Microscopy Characterization of Deformation Features in Refractory High Entropy Alloys","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.656/7719619?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are single phase body-centered cubic (BCC) alloys desired for their high temperature properties, but many are often brittle at room temperature. RHEAs based on Group IV and V elements (IV-V-RHEAs) remain ductile down to liquid nitrogen temperatures [<a href=\"#ozae044.656-B1\">1</a>]. RHEAs are typically designed to be equiatomic compositions, but equiatomic IV-V-RHEAs are unstable in the BCC phase. Zhang et al. [<a href=\"#ozae044.656-B2\">2</a>] developed a thermodynamically stable non-equiatomic RHEA with nominal composition Nb0.45Ta0.25Ti0.15Hf0.15 (at%) (NTTH). NTTH samples tested via compact-tension demonstrate one of the toughest bcc refractory alloys in the literature. Deformation is accompanied by twinning and the formation of low-angle tilt boundaries known as kink bands [<a href=\"#ozae044.656-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.656-B3\">3</a>]. Kink bands have been observed previously in tension and compression of Group IV-rich RHEAs [<a href=\"#ozae044.656-B1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.656-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.656-B4\">4-7</a>]. However, the role played by kink bands in elevating toughness is not yet established.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"f40bd5c441d04996afa9ef91de3d22b578db64268f4d0ddd90ee666941394db1","category":"Environment"}
