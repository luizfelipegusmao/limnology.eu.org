{"title":"Effect of Stocking Density on the Growth of the Endangered Amazonian Fish Hypancistrus zebra (Siluriformes: Loricariidae)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.4256?af=R","date":1727071994000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Stocking density has a significant influence on animal homeostasis, and so is a crucial factor in the management of organisms in captivity and an important role in ex situ conservation of endangered species. <i>Hypancistrus zebra</i> is an endemic fish species from the Xingu River, Brazil—considered Critically Endangered since the early 2000s due to fishing pressure and, more recently, due to habitat changes resulting from the construction of the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Dam. The implementation of appropriate management in captivity is of utmost importance for its conservation, particularly in enhancing ex situ breeding techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the growth of juvenile <i>H. zebra</i> in aquaria with three different stocking density levels. The juveniles were distributed between three treatments, each with three replicates. We found no correlation between biomass and aquarium volume. The highest correlation coefficients were found between growth rates and densities related to the number of individuals per shelter area. Mortality rate was directly related to the initial number of fish in the aquariums, with larger populations showing higher mortality rates. The treatment with lower stocking density displayed the highest growth rate, while the treatment with higher density had the lowest growth rate, with a 23.38% difference between them.</p>","author":"Fábio José Torres de Barros, \nIsadora Ribeiro da Silva Lobato Bahia, \nThaís Pereira Nascimento, \nMayllon C. de S.
