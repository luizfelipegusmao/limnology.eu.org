Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) can be isolated from different tissues and have the immunomodulatory capacity to regulate local articular joint environment. This translational study aims to compare the cartilage restoration from MSCs from the synovial membrane (SM) and dental pulp (DP), by tissue engineered treatment in a Good Manufacturing Practices. \nMaterials and Methods: A controlled experimental study in fourteen miniature pigs was performed, using scaffold-free Tissue Engineering Construct (TEC) from DP and SM MSCs, with 6 months follow-up. Total thickness cartilage defects were performed in both posterior knees. The defect was left empty on one side, and the other received TEC from DP (n=7) or from SM (n=7). MRI assessed morphology with the MOCART scoring system. T2 mapping assessed water and collagen fiber composition. Histology evaluated cartilage repair using the ICRS-2 score. \nResults: The mean MOCART value in the untreated group was 46.2 ± 13.4, while the group treated with TEC from SM was 65.7 ± 15.5 (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2e54400df9fb9fe7dd7436f7a7a6007f2f279ac39e9731a1011b094ec03eac5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
