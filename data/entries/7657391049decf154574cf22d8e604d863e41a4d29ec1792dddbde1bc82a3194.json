{"title":"Unveiling the Anticarcinogenic Potential of Inula racemosa Hook. f. Root Extract Against DMBA‐Induced Mammary Tumour in Sprague Dawley Rats","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tox.24419?af=R","date":1726827201000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>The Himalayan plant <i>Inula racemosa</i> has medicinal properties and can be used to prevent or treat cancer. This is because it contains certain chemicals that are known to fight cancer cells with few or no side effects. <i>I. racemosa</i> has been used for this purpose for many years in traditional medicine and has shown promising results. The present study was crafted to explore the suppressive impacts on cellular proliferation of the root extract derived from <i>I. racemosa</i> via in vivo experimentation. <i>I. racemosa</i> (IR) root extract was tested at three different doses (100, 250, and 500 mg/Kg BW) for 18 weeks to assess its anti-neoplastic activity against mammary tumors in female rats. The assessment included various parameters such as hematological and biochemical indices, tumor parameters, oxidative stress analysis, gross and histopathological lesion determination, Masson's trichrome staining, immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, MMP-9, and VEGF in mammary gland tissues, and molecular docking. The chemopreventive action of IR root extract was demonstrated by the inhibition of tumor parameters (tumor size and tumor volume), minimum changes in the liver (ALT, AST, and ALP) and kidney enzymes (BUN and creatinine), declined lipid peroxidation activity, decline gross, and histological changes in mammary gland tumors, reduced expression of KI-67, MMP-9, and VEGF and maximum binding affinity of isoalantolactone with VEGF through molecular docking. The study suggests that the active constituents (isoalantolactone and alantolactone) of <i>I. racemosa</i> roots have anti-neoplastic activity against mammary tumors, making them a valuable therapeutic regimen for the future.</p>","author":"Ankita Jaikaria, \nRakesh Kumar, \nR. K.
