{"title":"Clustering Visual Similar Objects for Enhanced Synthetic Image Data for Object Detection","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1793/v1","date":1724648952000,"content":"Object detection often struggles with accurately identifying visually similar parts, a challenge commonly faced in industrial applications. To address this issue, we propose a clustering methodology based on the visual similarity of 3D object models. This approach is particularly effective when integrated with synthetic image generation, as both processes rely on 3D models. In a case study, we observed a 22 % increase in classification performance on a validation dataset when training an object detector on visually similar groups rather than on all classes, suggesting the potential of our method as a baseline for a multi-stage classification scheme.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2b99ddf8ec610b3260900a23e629e0247e8f4f1852f788fbe6402d343b399e2e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
