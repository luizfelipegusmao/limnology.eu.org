{"title":"Investigating the impact of Spatio-Temporal Variations of Water Column Optical Properties on Satellite-Derived Bathymetry Estimates in the Eastern Mediterranean","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1545/v1","date":1729494696000,"content":"Bathymetric data is crucial for benthic monitoring in coastal areas but is traditionally obtained through costly and geographically limited acoustic methods. This study uses Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) in the Eastern Mediterranean, focusing on the Cretan Sea in Greece. It explores how variations in water column optical properties affect SDB models over four years (2019-2022) using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The research covers two areas with contrasting features: Chania Gulf and the open waters around Chrissi Island. Three methodologies were tested: band-ratio, linear-logarithmic, and an inherent optical properties linear model. Significant spatio-temporal variations in SDB models were found due to seasonal changes in water column properties, such as temperature and suspended organic materials. Linear optical properties-based methods performed best, achieving a mean RMSE close to 1 meter, slightly outperforming the ratio-based method. The logarithmic method was less effective, with RMSE values ranging from 1.3 to 1.5 meters. A preliminary Kalman Filter (KF) analysis increased RMSE to the decimeter level. This study demonstrates the impact of water column optical properties on SDB models. It highlights the value of SDB for cost-effective, high-resolution coastal mapping in complex coastlines like those in Greece.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"074561bd6f65e5cbb00e5fa0c95691ea6da1080e3d7792b4ba89713ac238c21f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
