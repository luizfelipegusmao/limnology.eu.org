{"title":"Genetic relationships between and within some Malawian cichlid genera","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15848?af=R","date":1719281609000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Genetic relationships were examined for a total of 90 individuals of 90 species or species var. from 13 genera of Malawian cichlids based on the sequences of an amplified 991-bp fragment of the mtDNA control region (mtDNA-CR). In the network analysis, no exclusive clades were made by all the members of any genera in this study. However, congeneric clades were observed by genera <i>Buccochromis</i>, <i>Copadichromis</i>, <i>Protomelas</i>, and <i>Sciaenochromis</i>, whereas no congeneric clades were observed by genera <i>Mylochromis</i>, <i>Nimbochromis</i>, and <i>Otopharynx</i>. In non-mbuna, an <i>Aulonocara–Lethrinops</i> group was divided into two groups, and the mean genetic distance of the larger group was much lower from mbuna than from other non-mbuna. Overall mean genetic distance within a genus was generally low in mbuna, whereas it was relatively high in non-mbuna. In the genetic tree of each genus, two or more large clades were observed, and some clades, such as those of <i>Aulonocara hansbaenschi</i> and <i>Aulonocara nyassae</i> in genus <i>Aulonocara</i>, <i>Lethrinops micrentodon</i> and <i>Lethrinops</i> sp. “gold harbor” in <i>Lethrinops</i>, and <i>Otopharynx ovatus</i> and <i>Otopharynx brooksi</i> in <i>Otopharynx</i>, were very deeply differentiated. Besides, a mbuna species, <i>Pseudotropheus crabro</i>, was extremely deeply differentiated from other members of this genus. These results suggest a widespread morphological convergence across the taxa in parallel with deep genetic differentiation in the long evolutionary story and some possibility of generation of the species of <i>Aulonocara</i>–<i>Lethrinops</i> group by hybridization of small non-mbuna and mbuna species. Furthermore, taxonomical reexamination is necessary based on a strong support by genetic connection.</p>","author":"Shaharior Hashem, \nKoichiro Kawai, \nTetsuyasu Kushida, \nErika Hamaoka, \nPatrick Senam Kofi Fatsi, \nHidetoshi Saito","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Biology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"bfc1ed2d932ada5ee9516152bf3d31ffc68bde2c213c37054bc19369ce2744a8","entryHash":"07d5ca5244ceb8339056ab54380f0518a61afaf0633d1c5b1aa0972f1e494ca8","category":"Environment"}
