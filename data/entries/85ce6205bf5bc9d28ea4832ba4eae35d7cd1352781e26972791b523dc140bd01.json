Mshana</p>\r\nBackground <p>Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still a major public health problem. In response to the World Health Organization (WHO), Tanzania implemented immunization and treatment to achieve the eradication of HBV infection by 2030. To achieve this goal, frequent updates of demographic data, antiviral therapy eligibility, and uptake are essential. We therefore evaluated demographic data, antiviral therapy eligibility, and uptake among chronically HBV-infected patients attending at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC), Tanzania.</p> Methods <p>A cross-sectional study enrolled 196 chronic HBV patients from April 23, 2023, to October 10, 2023, at BMC, where 100 and 96 patients were retrospectively and prospectively enrolled, respectively. Study’s ethical clearance and permission were observed by the Catholic University of Health and Allied Sciences/Bugando Medical Centre research ethics and review committee and the Bugando Medical Centre management respectively. For all patients, socio-demographic data and whole blood samples were obtained. Full blood picture, alanine and aspartate amino transferases, and HBV viral load parameters were determined. Aspartate-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and Fibrosis Four (FIB-4) scores were calculated according to their respective formulas. Therapy eligibility and uptake were evaluated according to the 2015 WHO HBV prevention, treatment, and care guidelines. The data were summarized and analysed using STATA version 15.</p> Results <p>The median age for all patients was 39 [IQR: 32–47.5] years. Nearly all study patients, 99% (194/196), were older than 20 years old, with significant male dominance (73.5% [144/196] versus 26.5% [52/196]; p&lt;0.0001). Anti-HBV antiviral therapy eligibility was 22.4%, while uptake was 6.8% (3/4), which was significantly lower than the WHO expectation of 80% (p &lt;0.0001).</p> Conclusion <p>Almost all chronically HBV-infected patients attending at BMC were older than 20 years old and were significantly dominated by males. Antiviral therapy uptake was remarkably lower than expected by the WHO towards combating HBV infection by 2030.</p>","author":"Mathias Mlewa","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"85ce6205bf5bc9d28ea4832ba4eae35d7cd1352781e26972791b523dc140bd01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
