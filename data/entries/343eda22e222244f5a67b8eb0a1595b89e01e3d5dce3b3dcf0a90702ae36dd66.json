{"title":"Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase -Producing and Multidrug Resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. From the Human-Animal-Environment Interface on Cattle Farms in Burkina Faso","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0580/v1","date":1728381161000,"content":"Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing and multidrug resistant Enterobacterales pose a major threat to both human and animal health. This study assessed the prevalence of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) and Klebsiella spp. (ESBL-K) in cattle farms in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, using a One Health approach. From May 2021 to September 2022, cattle faeces, farmersâ€™ stools, their drinking water and farm soil samples were collected from semi-intensive and traditional farms. ESBL-selective medium was used to obtain resistant isolates, which were further characterized using biochemical tests. An-timicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc dif-fusion method. ESBL-Ec and/or ESBL-K were detected in 188 of 322 samples (58.0%). The prevalence of ESBL-Ec isolates was 42.2% (136/322) and ESBL-K isolates 24.5% (79/322). Notably, 156 of the 188 ESBL isolates (83.0%) exhibited multidrug resistance. The highest resistance rates were observed against tetracy-cline and cotrimoxazole. Importantly, no isolates showed resistance to mero-penem, which was used to test for carbapenem resistance. This study highlights the presence of ESBL-Ec and ESBL-K among humans, animals and the envi-ronment of the cattle farms. Good hygiene and biosafety practices are essential to limit the potential spread of multidrug resistant bacteria between different inter-faces on farms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"343eda22e222244f5a67b8eb0a1595b89e01e3d5dce3b3dcf0a90702ae36dd66","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
