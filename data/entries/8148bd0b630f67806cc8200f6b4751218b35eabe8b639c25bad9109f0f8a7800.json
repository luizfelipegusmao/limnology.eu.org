{"title":"Design of a Reverse Processing Network for Sub-Optimal Fruit in a Retail Store Using an Milp Model","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1592/v1","date":1711458851000,"content":"Modernizing the retail sector is essential to societal progress toward creating a smart city. The retail sector is crucial to the development of a smart city because of its adaptability and capacity for innovation. However, due to their perishability, supermarkets throw away a lot of fruits and vegetables. This article discusses the design of a sub-optimal process for processing sorted fruits using a reverse logistics approach, demonstrating how productivity can be increased despite constraints on processing capacity. This paper presents the results of a case study conducted in a Qatari supermarket that offers a variety of regular fruit processing techniques. In order to maximize output and cut down on waste, this project aimed to develop a reverse logistics system for imperfect fruit.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8148bd0b630f67806cc8200f6b4751218b35eabe8b639c25bad9109f0f8a7800","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
