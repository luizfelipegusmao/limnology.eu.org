Trade-offs, depicting negative covariances between individuals' life history traits, can arise from genetic constraints, or from a finite amount of resources that each individual has to allocate in a zero-sum game between somatic and reproductive functions. While theory predicts that trade-offs are ubiquitous, empirical studies have often failed to detect such negative covariances in wild populations.\n\nOne way to improve the detection of trade-offs is by accounting for the environmental context, as trade-off expression may depend on environmental conditions. However, current methodologies usually search for fixed covariances between traits, thereby ignoring their context dependence.\n\nHere, we present a hierarchical multivariate ‘covariance reaction norm’ model, adapted from Martin (2023), to help detect context dependence in the expression of life-history trade-offs using demographic data. The method allows continuous variation in the phenotypic correlation between traits. We validate the model on simulated data for both intraindividual and intergenerational trade-offs.\n\nWe then apply it to empirical datasets of yellow-bellied marmots (<i>Marmota flaviventer</i>) and Soay sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>) as a proof-of-concept showing that new insights can be gained by applying our methodology, such as detecting trade-offs only in specific environments.\n\nWe discuss its potential for application to many of the existing long-term demographic datasets and how it could improve our understanding of trade-off expression in particular, and life history theory in general.\n</p>","author":"Louis Bliard, \nJordan S.
