{"title":"Towards comparable quality-assured Azure Kinect body tracking results in a study setting—Influence of light","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308416","date":1723212000000,"content":"<p>by Linda Büker, Michel Hackbarth, Vincent Quinten, Andreas Hein, Sandra Hellmers</p>\r\n\r\nQuality assurance in research helps to ensure reliability and comparable results within a study. This includes reliable measurement equipment and data-processing. The Azure Kinect DK is a popular sensor used in studies with human subjects that tracks numerous joint positions with the Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK. Prior experiments in literature indicate that light might influence the results of the body tracking. As similar light conditions are not always given in study protocols, the impact needs to be analyzed to ensure comparable results. We ran two experiments, one with four different light conditions and one with repeated measures of similar light conditions, and compared the results by calculating the random error of depth measurement, the mean distance error of the detected joint positions, and the distance between left and right ankle. The results showed that recordings with similar light conditions produce comparable results, with a maximum difference in the median value of mean distance error of 0.06 mm, while different light conditions result in inconsistent outcomes with a difference in the median value of mean distance error of up to 0.35 mm. Therefore, light might have an influence on the Azure Kinect and its body tracking. Especially additional infrared light appears to have a negative impact on the results. Therefore, we recommend recording various videos in a study under similar light conditions whenever possible, and avoiding additional sources of infrared light.","author":"Linda Büker","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"5fbdfc01473c51b023090998b96dc5446f8565271de6d9d4950b21d5b7e619a6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
