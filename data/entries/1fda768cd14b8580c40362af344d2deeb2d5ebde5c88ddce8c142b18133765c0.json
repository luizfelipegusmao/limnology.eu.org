{"title":"133 Effect of feeding two different feed additives (Prime Force and Optipartum C+) on finishing cattle performance and carcass characteristics","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/339/7757075?rss=1","date":1726185600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>A feedlot study was conducted to evaluate the effect of two feed additives, Prime Force (Furst-McNess Company, Rockford, IL) and Optipartum C+ (AB Vista, Plantation, FL), on finishing cattle performance and carcass characteristics. In this experiment, steers [n = 320; 390 ± 9.5 kg of body weight (BW)] were used and four treatments were evaluated in a total of 32 pens, with 10 steers per pen and 80 steers per treatment. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial and included a control diet with no additives; a diet containing Prime Force targeted at 68 g/steer daily; a diet containing Optipartum C+, targeted at 20 g/steer daily; and a diet containing a combination of both products (68 g/steer Prime Force and 20 g/steer Optipartum C+). Cattle were fed for 151 d, but treatments were imposed the last 67 d before slaughter (i.e., fed control diet to all cattle until d 84). Performance is for the total 151-d feeding period. No interaction between feed additives was observed for performance or carcass traits (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.41), therefore main effects are presented. Feeding Prime Force increased final BW (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.04) when compared with cattle not fed Prime Force. A tendency was observed for greater adjusted final BW (<span>P</span> = 0.06) and ADG (<span>P</span> = 0.08) for cattle fed Prime Force compared with cattle fed no Prime Force. Cattle fed Prime Force had numerically greater intake (<span>P</span> = 0.11) than cattle fed no Prime Force, therefore gain to feed (G:F) was not impacted (<span>P</span> = 0.54). Ribeye area and fat depth were not different (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.17) for cattle fed Prime Force versus cattle that had no Prime Force added to the diet, but marbling was numerically improved (<span>P</span> = 0.11) due to Prime Force. Carcass-adjusted final BW (<span>P</span> = 0.11) was numerically greater for cattle fed Optipartum C+ and ADG tended (<span>P</span> = 0.09) to be greater for cattle fed Optipartum C+ compared with cattle fed no Optipartum C+. Dry matter intake was not different (<span>P</span> = 0.54) for cattle fed Optipartum C+ versus cattle with no Optipartum C+ in the diet, therefore G:F was numerically improved (<span>P</span> = 0.13) by the increase in ADG for cattle fed Optipartum C+. Ribeye area, fat, and marbling were not different (<span>P</span> ≥ 0.30) between cattle fed Optipartum C+ and those that did not receive Optipartum C+ in the diet. Incidence of liver abscesses was not affected by feeding either additive (<span>P</span> = 0.40). Based on results from this study, adding Prime Force to a finishing diet tended to improve BW and ADG compared with cattle not fed Prime Force. Feeding Optipartum C+ tended to increase ADG and improve G:F due to equal DMI when compared with diets with no Optipartum C+ added.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"1fda768cd14b8580c40362af344d2deeb2d5ebde5c88ddce8c142b18133765c0","category":"Environment"}
