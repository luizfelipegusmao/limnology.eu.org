{"title":"74 Effect of grazing native warm season grasses on parasitism and growth in weaned Katahdin lambs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_1/95/7618005?rss=1","date":1709337600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Parasitism in lambs during the post-weaning period has effects on growth, survival, and sheep enterprise profitability. Opportunities to minimize exposure to infective larvae during this period may reduce clinical effects and improve lamb performance. Native warm season grasses (NWSG) offer increased growth during summer months and taller plants that allow grazing at greater heights. The objective here was to evaluate NWSG as a forage for post-weaning development of lambs in spring lambing, forage-based systems. Over 2 yr, Katahdin lambs (Yr 1, n = 30; Yr 2, n = 31) were managed at a producer farm in the piedmont region of North Carolina. Beginning 2 wk post-weaning, lambs were randomly assigned to graze on either NWSG (Big Bluestem and Indiangrass) or cool season grass (CSG, Kentucky 31 Tall Fescue base) pasture. Lambs were continuously grazed for 70 d in Yr 1 and 55 d in Yr 2. Fecal egg count (FEC), FAMACHA score, and body weight (BW) were measured every two weeks. Lambs were dewormed at FAMACHA â‰¥ 3. Forage analysis was conducted at the start and end of the grazing period. Statistical analysis were performance using the PROC Mixed procedure of SAS. Lambs in each group were raised in similar litter sizes and sire and sex were evenly distributed between groups. Fecal egg count and growth estimated breeding values (EBV) were similar between NWSG and CSG groups. In Yr 1 and 2, no differences were observed in FEC between grazing groups (P &gt; 0.05). However, FEC did increase in both groups throughout the grazing period (P &lt; 0.05). In Yr 1, no differences were observed in total BW gain (P = 0.74). However, in Yr 2, lambs grazing CSG had greater total BW gain than the NWSG group (P &lt; 0.05). In both years, there were no differences in the percentage of lambs requiring deworming (Yr 1, P = 0.36; Yr 2, P = 0.47) but lambs requiring treatment had greater FEC EBVs (P &lt; 0.05). Nutrient quality of NWSG pasture was reduced compared with CSG pastures. Total digestible nutrients and crude protein were less in NWSG compared with CSG pastures (Yr 2: 61.5% vs. 63.9% and 8.9% vs. 13.6%, respectively) and neutral detergent fiber was greater (Yr 2: 74.1% vs. 65.2%, respectively) resulting in decreased nutrient availability for NWSG group. While NWSG may provide additional biomass for summer grazing, rapid maturity rates may limit nutrient availability for lambs resulting in decreased growth performance despite similar levels of parasitism. Lamb FEC EBV may have a role in parasite resistance and deworming requirements regardless of forage type. Thus, genetics must be considered along with grazing management as part of an integrated parasite management plan.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"9e72544acd60cc66f72c70e126bf373f04e0172a758275f855cd36e9558c216b","category":"Environment"}
