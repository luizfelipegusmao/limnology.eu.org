{"title":"Innovative Assessment Methods: The Role of Augmented Reality in the Educational Process","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1599/v1","date":1726979760000,"content":"ABSTRACT: This paper explores Augmented Reality (AR) as an innovative active methodology for student assessment in the Higher Education Authority of Arcoverde, proposing an alternative to the traditional assessment model. It investigates how AR can transform the educational process, making assessments more interactive, engaging and effective. The study focuses on three main issues: the impact of AR on student motivation and engagement, its effectiveness in improving content comprehension and retention, and the challenges and limitations of its implementation as an assessment method. Employing dialectical methods, action research and literature reviews, this research documents a 34% increase in studentsâ€™ content comprehension and a 47% increase in their participation in practical activities. These findings suggest that, despite the technical and curricular integration challenges, AR not only improves assessment methodologies, but also enhances learning, promoting a more dynamic and interactive environment. The overall objective is to demonstrate the ability of AR to replace conventional approaches with a more innovative and efficient practice, highlighting the importance of this technology in advancing pedagogical practices and improving student performance. This study sheds light on the relevance of AR in the educational field, encouraging its adoption to enrich the learning and assessment experience.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"459c8241d48023f755edb796d39bccd26218217d889406d8b572303b35825d1c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
