Process-based models (PBMs) are typically used to simulate water quality modeling. In watershed modeling utilizing PBMs, it is crucial to effectively reflect the actual watershed conditions by appropriately setting the model parameters. However, parameter calibration and validation are time-consuming processes with inherent uncertainties. Addressing these challenges, this research aims to address various challenges encountered in the calibration and validation processes of PBMs. To achieve this, the development of a hybrid model, combining uncalibrated PBMs with data-driven models (DDMs) such as deep learning algorithms is proposed. This hybrid model is intended to enhance watershed modeling by integrating the strengths of both PBMs and DDMs. The hybrid model is constructed by coupling an uncalibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). SWAT, a representative PBM, is constructed using geographical information and 5-year observed data from the Yeongsan River Watershed. The output variables of the uncalibrated SWAT, such as streamflow, suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), as well as observed precipitation for the day and previous day, are used as training data for the deep learning model to predict the TP load. For the comparison, the conventional SWAT model is calibrated and validated to predict the TP load. The results revealed that TP load simulated by the hybrid model predicted the observed TP better than that predicted by the calibrated SWAT model. Also, the hybrid model reflects seasonal variations in the TP load, including peak events. Remarkably, when applied to other sub-basins without specific training, the hybrid model consistently outperformed the calibrated SWAT model. In conclusion, application of the SWAT-LSTM hybrid model could be a useful tool for decreasing uncertainties in model calibration and improving the overall predictive performance in watershed modeling.</p>\n<h2>Practitioner points</h2>\n<p>\nWe aimed to enhance process-based models for watershed water-quality modeling.\nThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Long Short-Term Memory hybrid model's predicted and total phosphorus (TP) matched the observed TP.\nIt exhibited superior predictive performance when applied to other sub-basins.\nThe hybrid model will overcome the constraints of conventional modeling.\nIt will also enable more effective and efficient modeling.\n</p>","author":"Dae Seong Jeong, \nHeewon Jeong, \nJin Hwi Kim, \nJoon Ha Kim, \nYongeun Park","siteTitle":"Wiley: Water Environment Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"915ff976ef111e955885693934e4a6d064cfcc3acd138e9208be8bcd5ab4fe77","entryHash":"97b2b07a634b45529e967f8a9357c51bc39ff87d3fd03d5436a1d114e5818b09","category":"Environment"}
