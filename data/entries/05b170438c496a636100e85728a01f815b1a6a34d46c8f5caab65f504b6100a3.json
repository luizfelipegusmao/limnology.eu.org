{"title":"Unlocking Phytate with Phytase: A Meta-Analytic View of Meat-type Chicken Muscle Growth and Bone Mineralization Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0546/v1","date":1718004481000,"content":"The inclusion of exogenous phytase in broiler P and Ca deficient diets in response to heightened concerns over excessive P excretion into the environment over the years has remarkably been documented. However, responses among these studies have been inconsistent because of the several factors affecting P utilization. For this reason, a systematic review with meta-analysis of results from forty-one studies published from 2000 to February 2024 was evaluated to: 1) quantitatively summarize the size of phytase effect on growth performance, bone strength, and mineralization in broilers fed P and Ca deficient basal diets and 2) estimate and explore the heterogeneity of the effect sizes of outcomes using sub-group and meta-regression analyses. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s SYRCLE Risk of Bias checklists for animal studies. Additionally, applying the random-effects models, Hedges’ g effect size of supplementation with phytase was calculated using the R software to determine the standardized mean difference (SMD) at a 95% confidence interval. Sub-group analysis and meta-regression further explored heterogeneity (PSMD ≤ 0.05, I2 &gt; 50%, n ≥ 10). The meta-analysis showed that supplemental phytase increases ADFI and BWG and reduces FCR at each time point of growth (&lt; 0.0001). Additionally, phytase supplementation consistently increased tibia ash, P and Ca, and bone strength (&lt; 0.0001) of broilers fed P and Ca deficient diets. Results of the subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed that age and strain of broiler, dietary P source, and duration of phytase exposure significantly influence the effect size of phytase on growth and bone parameters. In conclusion, phytase can attenuate the effect of reducing dietary available phosphorus and calcium and improve ADFI, BWG, and reduced FCR, especially when added to starter diets. It further enhances bone ash, bone mineralization, and bone-breaking strength of broilers, even though the effects of bone ash and strength can be maximized in the starter phase of growth. However, the effect sizes of phytase were related to the age and strain of the broiler, dietary P source, and duration of phytase exposure rather than the dosage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05b170438c496a636100e85728a01f815b1a6a34d46c8f5caab65f504b6100a3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
