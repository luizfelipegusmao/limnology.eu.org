{"title":"The Confluence Analysis Program: A User-Friendly Tool for Automated Cell Confluence Measurement and Visualization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0786/v1","date":1723451042000,"content":"Measuring cell confluence in high-throughput screening of pharmaceutics, cell culture monitoring, cancer research, and industrial applications requires quantitative and standardizable measures to minimize subjective observations and increase throughput1-12 . Over the past half-century, non-invasive specialized programs have been created to quantitatively assess cell confluence, and some software tools exist to meet these needs1,4,5,6,7,8,9 . However, many of these tools are expensive, computationally-demanding, or inaccessible to non-experts1,6. With the assistance of generative artificial intelligence, we have developed the Confluence Analysis Program (CAP), a modern tool designed to be precise, interactive, and user-friendly. CAP is written entirely in Python and runs in any command-line interface (CLI), including Terminal (OS) and Command Prompt (Windows). In addition to fetching all necessary external libraries automatically and prompting drag-and-drop image retrieval, CAP features live visual comparison of cell mass identification to the original image assay. Our results demonstrate robust performance of CAP on fluorescent micrographs of varying confluences ranging from low to high. CAP is provided as a free resource, accessible in the Supplementary Materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3b44ebf1c3794ff4b095046cd0fcf26fd0a089e7a8f69d135dab1e5b38fdc452","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
