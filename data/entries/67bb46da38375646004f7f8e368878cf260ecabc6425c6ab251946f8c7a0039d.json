{"title":"Perceptions of Cancer through the Ages &ndash; from Hippocratic Oncology to Precision Cancer Medicine","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0508/v1","date":1725608386000,"content":"The unravelling of the human genome created new perceptions on the origin and evolution of diseases and for cancer in particular, it established the notion that neoplasia has been a companion of life since its ap-pearance on earth.\nIt is not surprising that neoplasms, in various forms, develop in numerous species of animals and even in plants. Unmistakable accounts of cancer with clinical features as are understood today, begin in the 5th c. B.C. The principles and practice of the Hippocratic and Galenic tradition dominated cancer care virtually into the 20th century. Advanced sequencing technologies at the dawn of the 21st century, generate new ther-apeutic opportunities with immunotherapy, oncolytic virotherapy and gene transfer, the latter especially in cases of hereditary cancer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67bb46da38375646004f7f8e368878cf260ecabc6425c6ab251946f8c7a0039d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
