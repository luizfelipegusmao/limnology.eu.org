{"title":"The noise: a silent threat to the recovery of patients in Neonatal Intensive Care Units","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0237/v1","date":1719959026000,"content":"The architectural configuration of the space plays a crucial role in the acoustics of Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). The design of the environment, the materials used in construction, and the organisation of noise sources within the room significantly influence the noise levels present in these critical areas. For this research, noise levels found in two hospitals, with different architectural configurations and sizes but similar construction materials, have been analyzed. Data were recorded at 1-second intervals over a period of more than 24 hours. The data collected in these hospitals confirm the magnitude of the noise problem in NICUs, highlighting the urgent need to address it effectively to ensure an appropriate and safe environment for the recovery of neonates. Good architectural planning can help mitigate noise, while poor configuration can exacerbate acoustic problems, negatively affecting both patients and healthcare staff. It is crucial to involve architects, acoustic engineers, and healthcare staff in the design and renovation of NICUs to create spaces that not only meet medical needs but also consider the auditory well-being of neonates.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6c78e9180449bedd3aca63d1271023c91a0b6a1875323c3dd99e72085769eb9a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
