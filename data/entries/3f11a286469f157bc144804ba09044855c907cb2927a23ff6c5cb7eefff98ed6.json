{"title":"ROS as Signaling Molecules to Initiate the Process of Plant Acclimatization to Abiotic Stress","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0564/v1","date":1728442669000,"content":"During their life cycle, plants constantly respond to environmental changes. Abiotic stressors affect the photosynthetic and respiratory processes of plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during aerobic metabolism and play an important role as regulatory mediators in signaling processes, activating the plant's protective response to abiotic stress and restoring \"oxidation-reduction homeostasis\". Cells develop normally if the rates of ROS production and the ability to neutralize them are balanced. To implement oxidation-reduction signaling, this balance must be disrupted either by an increase in ROS concentration or a decrease in the activity of one or more antioxidant systems. Under abiotic stress, plants accumulate excessive amounts of ROS and if the ROS content exceeds the threshold amount dangerous for living organisms, it can lead to damage to all major cellular components. Adaptive resistance of plants to abiotic stressors depends on a set of mechanisms of adaptation to them. The accumulation of ROS in the cell depends on the type of abiotic stress, the strength of its impact on the plant, the duration of its impact and the recovery period. The aim of this review is to provide a general understanding of the processes occurring during ROS homeostasis in plants, oxidation-reduction processes in cellular compartments in response to abiotic stress and the participation of ROS in signaling processes activating adaptation processes to abiotic stress.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3f11a286469f157bc144804ba09044855c907cb2927a23ff6c5cb7eefff98ed6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
