{"title":"A Starch- and Sucrose-Reduced Diet Has Similar Efficiency as Low FODMAP in IBS. A Randomized Non-Inferiority Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0460/v1","date":1723028235000,"content":"A diet with low content of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) are established treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), with well-documented efficiency. A starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) has shown similar promising effects. This randomized, non-inferiority study aimed to test SSRD against low FODMAP and compare the responder rates to a 4-week dietary intervention of either diet. 155 IBS patients were randomized to SSRD (n=77) or low FODMAP (n=78) for 4 weeks, with a follow-up 5 months later without food restrictions. The questionnaires Rome IV, IBS-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), and visual analog scale for IBS (VAS-IBS) were completed at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks and 6 months. Weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressures were measured. Comparisons were made within the groups and between changes in the two groups. There were no differences between groups at baseline. The responding rate (RR=∆Total IBS-SSS ≥−50) of SSRD was non-inferior compared with low FODMAPs at week 2 (79.2% vs. 73.1%;p=0.661;95% confidence interval (CI)=-20-7.2) and week 4 (79.2% vs. 78.2%;p=1.000;95%CI=-14-12), with borderline-significance at follow-up (36.4% vs. 42.3%;p=0.252;95%CI=-9.4-21). All gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms were equally improved (p&lt;0.001 in most variables). SSRD rendered greater reductions in weight (p=0.006), body mass index (BMI) (p=0.005), and sugar craving (p=0.05), whereas waist circumference and blood pressure were equally decreased. Weight and BMI were regained at follow-up. In the SSRD group, responders at 6 months still had lowered weight (-0.7 (-2.5-0.1) vs. 0.2 (-0.7-2.2) kg; p=0.005) and BMI (-0.25 (-0.85-0.03) vs. 0.07 (-0.35-0.77) kg/m2; p=0.009) compared with baseline in contrast to non-responders. Those who had tested both diets preferred SSRD (p=0.032). A 4-week SSRD intervention was non-inferior to low FODMAP regarding effects on gastrointestinal and extraintestinal IBS symptoms. Reductions of weight, BMI, and sugar craving were most pronounced following SSRD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a74f2e84c946f4e63521ff881a847d6ee47c9b13a2013572305343d16284590e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
