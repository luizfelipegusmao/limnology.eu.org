{"title":"Changes and Functions of CX3CL1 in Viral Infection and Associated Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1199/v1","date":1710926469000,"content":"CX3CL1, also named fractalkine or neurotactin, the only known member of the CX3C chemokine family that can chemoattract several immune cells. CX3CL1 exists in both membrane-anchored and soluble forms, each mediating distinct biological activities. CX3CL1 signals are transmitted through its unique receptor, CX3CR1, primarily expressed in microglia of central nervous system (CNS). In the CNS, CX3CL1 acts as a regulator of microglia activation in response to brain disorders or inflammation. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the roles of CX3CL1 in regulating cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and host immune response in viral infection. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the changes and function of CX3CL1 in various viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, to highlight the emerging roles of CX3CL1 in viral infection and the associated diseases.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6ad9db4ea01d97b67a9601c27c1e16e46b738b89b27590d8a07207bc1295e7c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
