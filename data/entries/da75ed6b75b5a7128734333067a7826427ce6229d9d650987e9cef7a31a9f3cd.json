This was the first MVD outbreak in the country. We describe the epidemiological characteristics of MVD cases and contacts.</p> Methods <p>The Ministry of Health activated an outbreak response team. Outbreak investigation methods were applied to cases identified through MVD standard case definitions and confirmed through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). All identified case contacts were added into the contact listing form and followed up in-person daily for any signs or symptoms for 21 days. Data collected from various forms was managed and analyzed using Excel and QGIS software for mapping.</p> Results <p>A total of nine MVD cases were reported with eight laboratory-confirmed and one probable. Two of the reported cases were frontline healthcare workers and seven were family related members. Cases were children and adults between 1â€“59 years of age with a median age of 34 years. Six were males. Six cases died equivalent to a case fatality rate (CFR) of 66.7%. A total of 212 individuals were identified as contacts and two (2) became cases. The outbreak was localized in two geo-administrative wards (Maruku and Kanyangereko) of Bukoba District Council.</p> Conclusion <p>Transmission during this outbreak occurred among family members and healthcare workers who provided care to the cases. The delay in detection aggravated the spread and possibly the consequent fatality but once confirmed the swift response stemmed further transmission containing the disease at the epicenter wards. The outbreak lasted for 72 days but as the origin is still unknown, further research is required to explore the source of this outbreak.</p>","author":"Vida Mmbaga","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"da75ed6b75b5a7128734333067a7826427ce6229d9d650987e9cef7a31a9f3cd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
