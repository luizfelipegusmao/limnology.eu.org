{"title":"Integration of AI in the Banking Sector","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1254/v1","date":1726546579000,"content":"The modern world is gradually moving towards a global civilisation that is automated and propelled by technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a highly advanced technology that has been acknowledged as a major innovation. The incorporation of this technology into the banking sector has enhanced operational procedures in relation to customer satisfaction, virtual assistance, and risk reduction. This machine is employed to streamline activities and improve how decisions are made in this sector. This study investigates the potential benefits and challenges of implementing artificial intelligence in the banking sector. The methodology ensures a comprehensive understanding of the implementation of artificial intelligence in banking by showcasing its effectiveness, precision, and efficiency, as well as the opportunities it presents. The study data were collected from secondary sources, such as recent publications that demonstrate applications of artificial intelligence from five different banks, as well as the examination of industry reports. The main findings of this study demonstrate the substantial improvement of administrative operations through AI-driven technology, which effectively automates activities that include inputting data and handling information. As a result, the frequency of mistakes caused by people has reduced, leading to a 30% decrease in operational expenditures for all evaluated institutions. However, the banking industry admits the challenges it encounters, such as issues with confidentiality and a scarcity of skilled employees. In the financial services industry, the integration of artificial intelligence into the banking sector is perceived as an advantageous chance instead of a harmful danger, with a greater potential for beneficial impact.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f25c8d820c009740023566f56705fd3f24a598a535d622e47d44c56e4910acde","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
