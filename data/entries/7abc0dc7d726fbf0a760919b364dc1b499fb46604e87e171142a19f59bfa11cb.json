We aimed to assess the impact of pre-existing tumor-related inflammation on Covid-19 outcomes in patients with cancer and to elucidate the role of circulating neutrophil subpopulations.\n\nMethods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of 524 patients with cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection, assessing the relationship between clinical outcomes and circulating inflammatory biomarkers collected before and during Covid-19 infection. Additionally, a unicenter prospective cohort provided data for an exploratory analysis, assessing the immunophenotype of circulating neutrophils and inflammatory cytokines. The primary endpoints were 30-day mortality and severity of Covid-19 disease.\n\nResults: Prior to Covid-19, 25% of patients with cancer exhibited elevated dNLR, which increase to 55% at the time of Covid-19 diagnosis. We developed the FLARE score, incorporating both tumor and infection-induced inflammation, which categorized patients into four prognostic groups. The poor prognostic group had a 30-day mortality rate of 68%, significantly higher than the 23% in the favorable group (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7abc0dc7d726fbf0a760919b364dc1b499fb46604e87e171142a19f59bfa11cb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
