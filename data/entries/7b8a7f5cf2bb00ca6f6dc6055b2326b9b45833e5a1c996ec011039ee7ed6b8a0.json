{"title":"Assessment of Adipocyte Transduction Using Different AAV Capsid Variants","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0199/v1","date":1722834718000,"content":"Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are widely used as viral vectors for gene delivery in mammalian cells. We focused on the efficacy of transduction of AAV 2/5, 2/6, 2/8 and 2/9 expressing GFP in 3T3-L1 murine preadipocyte cells by live imaging microscopy using IncuCyte S3 and flow cytom-etry. Three transduction modes were assessed: AAV transduction in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells with or without further differentiation into mature adipocyte-like cells and injection of AAVs in differ-entiated adipocyte-like cells. AAV2/6 demonstrated the highest transduction efficiency in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, as it was 1.5–2-fold more effective than AAV2/5, and AAV2/8 in the range of viral concentrations from 2×104 to 1,6×105 VG/cell. AAV2/5 and AAV2/8 showed transduction effi-ciencies similar to each other. The expression of GFP under the CMV promoter remained stable for up to 20 days. The induction of 3T3-L1 differentiation in three days after AAV transduction did not alter the GFP expression level, and AAV2/6 showed the best transduction efficiency. AAV2/6 demonstrated the ability to transduce mature adipocytes. These results were confirmed by in vivo studies on C57BL6 mice AAV2/6 had the highest transducing activity on both inguinal and inter-scapular adipose tissue. Thus, AAV2/6 has demonstrated higher transduction efficacy compared to AAV2/5, AAV2/8 and AAV2/9 both in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipose tissue in vivo, which proves its usability along with AAV8 and AAV9 for gene delivery to adipocytes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b8a7f5cf2bb00ca6f6dc6055b2326b9b45833e5a1c996ec011039ee7ed6b8a0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
