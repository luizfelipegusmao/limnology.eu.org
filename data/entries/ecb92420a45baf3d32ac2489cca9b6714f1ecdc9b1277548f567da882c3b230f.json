{"title":"Inducing Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor to Investigate Tissue Regeneration and Stimulation of Early Angiogenesis in Axolotl Salamanders","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.426/7719691?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is described as a potent angiogenic factor essential for vascular endothelial cell growth. VEGF is produced by a myriad of cell types such as tumor cells, macrophages, and platelets. After production, VEGF works to regulate vital bodily processes by forming new blood vessels. These new blood vessels in combination with the VEGF signaling pathway ultimately play a fundamental role in bone formation, hematopoiesis, wound healing, and development [<a href=\"#ozae044.426-B1\">1</a>]. In biological systems, the formation of new blood vessels, also referred to as angiogenesis, is very important for development and growth. Studies show that even tumor growth is limited by blood vessel supply. Without proper angiogenesis, avascular solid tumors remain small and asymptomatic [<a href=\"#ozae044.426-B2\">2</a>]. Interestingly, in some cases, angiogenesis appears to be less critical, perhaps even detrimental during early tissue regeneration. Although this seems to be the case for early regeneration, as time goes on, angiogenesis is required for complete appendage replacement in regenerative species [<a href=\"#ozae044.426-B3\">3-5</a>]. Mescher (1996) hypothesized that a transient avascular period is essential for epimorphic tissue regeneration [<a href=\"#ozae044.426-B6\">6</a>]. We sought to test this hypothesis by artificially inducing VEGF to possibly stimulate early angiogenesis. The drug GS4012 is a potent inducer of VEGF and VEGF-driven vessel formation. It has been widely used as a pro-angiogenic compound in zebrafish, but little information is known of its role in animals that can regenerate more extensively [<a href=\"#ozae044.426-B7\">7</a>]. Axolotl salamanders, also known as <span>Ambystoma mexicanum</span>, have extensive regenerative capacities, including regrowth of entire appendages. Our goal was to expose axolotls to GS4012 and assess how early angiogenesis and regeneration may be affected. Light microscopy on anesthetized live animals allowed us to trace the regrowth of individual animals over the regenerative period.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ecb92420a45baf3d32ac2489cca9b6714f1ecdc9b1277548f567da882c3b230f","category":"Environment"}
