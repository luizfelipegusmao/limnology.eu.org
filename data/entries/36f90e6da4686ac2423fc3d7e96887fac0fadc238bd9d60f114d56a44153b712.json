As it is unclear whether corrosion products induce cell damage, we focused on cell culture models of the organ of Corti cell line (HEI-OC1), rat spiral ganglion cells (SGC) and rat organ of Corti explant (OC<sub>ex</sub>) cultivated from neonatal rat cochleae to characterize the cytotoxicity of sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) (Na<sub>2</sub>(PtCl<sub>6</sub>)). The oxidative activity in HEI-OC1 cells decreased with increasing Na<sub>2</sub>(PtCl<sub>6</sub>) concentrations between 8 and 16 ng/μl, and live cell staining with Calcein acetoxymethyl/Ethidium homodimer III revealed an increasing number of cells with disrupted membranes. Ultrastructural evidence of mitophagy followed by necroptosis was detected. Additionally, exposure of the SGC to 15–35 ng/μl Na<sub>2</sub>(PtCl<sub>6</sub>) dose-dependently reduced neuronal survival and neuritogenesis, as determined by neurofilament antigen staining. In parallel, staining glial cells and fibroblasts with specific antibodies confirmed the dose-dependent induction of cell death by Na<sub>2</sub>(PtCl<sub>6</sub>). Exposure of the OC<sub>ex</sub> to 25–45 ng/μl Na<sub>2</sub>(PtCl<sub>6</sub>) resulted in severe concentration-dependent hair cell loss. Our data show for the first time that Na<sub>2</sub>(PtCl<sub>6</sub>) induces cell death in a concentration-dependent manner in inner ear cell types and tissues.","author":"Elisabeth Berger","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"36f90e6da4686ac2423fc3d7e96887fac0fadc238bd9d60f114d56a44153b712","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
