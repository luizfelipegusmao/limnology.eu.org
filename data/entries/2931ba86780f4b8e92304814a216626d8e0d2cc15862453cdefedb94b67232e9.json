{"title":"Effective Removal of Microplastics Particles from Wastewater using Bio-Substrates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0751/v1","date":1710320940000,"content":"The rapid increasing rate of soil and water bodies pollution is the main anthropogenic effect caused by the mismanagement of post-consumer plastics. This research evaluated the effectiveness of cattail (Typha Latifolia) fibers (CFs) as bio-adsorbents of microplastic particles (MPPs) from wastewater. The effect of the adsorption environment composition on the adsorption rate was investigated. Batch tests were conducted to evaluate the “spontaneous” adsorption of MPs onto CFs. Five MPPs materials (PVC, PP, LDPE, HDPE, and Nylon 6) were evaluated. An industrial wastewater (PW) and Type II Distilled Water (DW) were employed as adsorption environments. The batch tests results show that CFs are effective in removing MPPs from DW and PW. However, higher removal percentage of MPPs were obtained in PW, ranging from 89% to 100% for PVC, PP, LDPE, and HDPE; while the adsorption of Nylon 6 increased to 29.9%, a removal increased of 50%. These observations indicate that hydrophobic interactions drive the “spontaneous and instantaneous” adsorption process and that adjusting the adsorption environment effectively enhances the MPPs removal rate. This research demonstrates the important role that bio-substrates can play in reducing the environmental pollution as efficient, sustainable, low cost, and reliable adsorbents for the removal of MPPs from wastewaters.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2931ba86780f4b8e92304814a216626d8e0d2cc15862453cdefedb94b67232e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
