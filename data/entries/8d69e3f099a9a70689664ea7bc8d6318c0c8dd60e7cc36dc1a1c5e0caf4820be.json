{"title":"Molecular Pathogenesis of Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Strokes: Background and Therapeutic Approaches","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1239/v1","date":1713441634000,"content":"Stroke represents one of the neurological diseases most responsible for death and permanent disability in the world. Different factors, such as thrombus, emboli and atherosclerosis, take part in the intricate pathophysiology of stroke. Comprehending the molecular processes involved in this mechanism is crucial to developing new, specific and efficient treatments. Some common mechanisms are excitotoxicity and calcium overload, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are critical in pathophysiology and recovery after cerebral ischaemia. ncRNAs, particularly microRNAs, and the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential for angiogenesis and neuroprotection, and they have been suggested to be therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic tools in cerebrovascular diseases, including stroke. This review summarizes the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and delves into the function of miRNAs in the development of brain damage. Furthermore, we will analyze new perspectives on treatment based on molecular mechanisms in addition to traditional stroke therapies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8d69e3f099a9a70689664ea7bc8d6318c0c8dd60e7cc36dc1a1c5e0caf4820be","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
