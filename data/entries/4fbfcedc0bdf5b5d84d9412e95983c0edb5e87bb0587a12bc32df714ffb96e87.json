{"title":"Unpacking the Challenges of Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability: Perspectives from Industry Practitioners","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0644/v1","date":1718081879000,"content":"Supply chain transparency and traceability have become increasingly important in today's globalized and interconnected business environment. This qualitative research explores the challenges and perspectives of industry practitioners regarding supply chain transparency and traceability. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with a diverse group of supply chain professionals, the study identifies key themes including difficulties in achieving visibility beyond immediate suppliers, data fragmentation and inconsistency, barriers to technology adoption, regulatory compliance, cultural and organizational factors, impacts on supplier relationships, and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and sustainability goals. The findings highlight the complex nature of these challenges and the need for collaborative, multi-stakeholder approaches to address them effectively. Despite the challenges, the study also reveals the potential benefits of transparency and traceability for enhancing supply chain resilience, sustainability, and stakeholder trust. Moving forward, companies must leverage technological innovations, establish clear communication channels with suppliers, navigate regulatory complexities, and foster a culture of transparency and accountability within their organizations. Future research should focus on practical strategies for implementing transparency and traceability initiatives, as well as evaluating their impact on supply chain performance and sustainability outcomes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4fbfcedc0bdf5b5d84d9412e95983c0edb5e87bb0587a12bc32df714ffb96e87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
