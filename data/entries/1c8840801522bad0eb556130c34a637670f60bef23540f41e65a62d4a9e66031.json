This work utilizes methods created using MIPAR, an image analysis software, on coating cross-sectional images. The current analysis aims to characterize the coating evolution of the inter-diffusional alloy layer and Al-Si-Fe inter-metallic phases which develop during austenitizing. The data obtained from quantifying the area fraction and the thickness of the multiple phases was utilized to develop a hot-stamping processing model for Al-Si coated 22MnB5 steel.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"1c8840801522bad0eb556130c34a637670f60bef23540f41e65a62d4a9e66031","category":"Environment"}
