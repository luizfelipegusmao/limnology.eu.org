{"title":"First observation of a skate egg case nursery in the Ross Sea","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15688?af=R","date":1716279641000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Areas of importance to Southern Ocean skates are poorly defined. Here, we identify a deepwater skate egg case nursery in a discrete location at ~460 m depth off Cape Adare in the Southern Ocean. This is the first confirmed observation of a skate nursery area in the Ross Sea and only the second observation for the Southern Ocean. The morphology and size of the egg cases were consistent with the genus <i>Bathyraja</i> and most likely belong to the <i>Bathyraja</i> sp. (cf. <i>eatonii</i>). The nursery occurs within the “no take” General Protection Zone of the Ross Sea region marine protected area, where commercial fishing is prohibited.</p>","author":"Brittany Finucci, \nCaroline Chin, \nHelen L.
