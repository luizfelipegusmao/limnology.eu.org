{"title":"Formulation of Hesperidin‐Loaded In‐situ Gel for Ocular Drug Delivery: A Comprehensive Study","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.13407?af=R","date":1708588800000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most common eye disorders. Different drugs are used for its treatment. Hesperidin is an active substance isolated from <i>Citrus sinensis</i> L. (Rutaceae) fruit peels, with known anti-inflammatory activity but low solubility, it was complexed with cyclodextrin and encapsulated <i>in-situ</i> gel to extend the eye duration.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>The optimized formulation comprised 1% hesperidin, 1.5% hydroxyethyl cellulose, and 16% poloxamer 407. The viscosity at 25°C was 492±82, at 35°C was 8875±248, pH was 7.01±0.03, gelation temperature was 34±1.3°C, and gelation time was 33±1.2 seconds. <i>In vitro</i> release exhibited 66% release within the initial two hours with a burst effect. With LOX inhibition test, it was determined that hesperidin showed activity at high doses on leukotyrens seen in the body in allergic diseases. In cell culture studies, the hesperidin cyclodextrin complex loaded <i>in-situ</i> gel (Poloxamer 16%, HEC 1.5%) (BRN9-CD) enhanced cell viability compared to the hesperidin solution. It was determined that BRN9-CD did not cause any irritation in the ocular tissues in the Draize test.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The findings of this study demonstrate the promising potential of the <i>in-situ</i> gel formulation of hesperidin in terms of ease of application and residence time on the ocular surface. Due to its notable LOX inhibition activity and positive outcomes in the <i>in vivo</i> Draize test, it holds promise for incorporation into pharmaceutical formulations.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
