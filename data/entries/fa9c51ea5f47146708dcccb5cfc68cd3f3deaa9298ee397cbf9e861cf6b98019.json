{"title":"Another Perspective on the Relativistic Expression of Energy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0384/v1","date":1712238307000,"content":"The article aims to present an alternative perspective on the relativistic expression of energy. This perspective is based on the virtual use of a Dempster mass spectrometer. In this spectrometer, it is possible to simulate Alfred Bucherer's experiment and conclude, using Lienard's relativistic equation, that the classical expression of energy predicted by Special Relativity is a more complete expression than the one presented by high school and college physics textbooks.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fa9c51ea5f47146708dcccb5cfc68cd3f3deaa9298ee397cbf9e861cf6b98019","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
