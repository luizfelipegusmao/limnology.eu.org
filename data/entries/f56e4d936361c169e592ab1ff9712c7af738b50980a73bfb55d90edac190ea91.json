{"title":"Therapeutic Potential of a Dietary Intervention with the Combination of Butyrate, Trehalose, Piceid, and Biochanin a on a Neuropsychiatric Disorder in Mice","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0077/v1","date":1727786713000,"content":"Neuropsychiatric disorders are worldwide public-health concern. Schizophrenia is one of the well-known neuropsychiatric disorders, which may affect millions globally. Maternal immune activation might be one of the key factor for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Previously, a mouse model of neuropsychiatric disorders has originally been made, in which poly-I:C, sodium dextran sulfate (DSS) and Îº-carrageenan (CGN) were used for the maternal immune activation of mice. In the neuropsychiatric disorder mice, a significant link between biochemical changes of p62 and/or GLAST in the mouse brain and the alteration of experimental behaviors. Therefore, potential therapeutic study has been achieved for the development of effective treatment against neuropsychiatric disorders with using butyric acid, trehalose, piceid, and biochanin A. As a result, some of the combination with these orally available molecules could be effective for the improvement of behavioral alterations as well as biochemical changes of p62 and/or GLAST in the mouse brain. Importantly, the correlation between behavioral score and p62/GLAST protein expression has been again recognized. The significant correlation between pathological behavior and the biochemical alterations would contribute to develop further innovative therapeutics for vaious psychiatric disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f56e4d936361c169e592ab1ff9712c7af738b50980a73bfb55d90edac190ea91","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
