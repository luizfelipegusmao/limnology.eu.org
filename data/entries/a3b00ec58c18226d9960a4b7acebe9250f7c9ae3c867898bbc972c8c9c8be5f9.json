Data from the third iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA) were used to evaluate the organization of structures and services for the provision of AKI care in world countries and ISN regions. An international survey of key stakeholders (clinicians, policymakers, and patient advocates) from countries affiliated with the ISN was conducted from July to September 2022 to assess structures and services for AKI care across countries. Main findings of the study show that overall, 167 countries or jurisdictions participated in the survey, representing 97.4% of the worldâ€™s population. Only 4% of countries had an AKI detection program based on national policy or guideline, and 50% of these countries used a reactive approach for AKI identification (i.e., cases managed as identified through clinical practice). Only 19% of national governments recognized AKI as a healthcare priority. Almost all countries (98% of the countries surveyed) reported capacity to provide acute hemodialysis (HD) for AKI, but in 31% of countries, peritoneal dialysis (PD) was unavailable for AKI. About half of all countries (44% of countries surveyed) provided acute dialysis (HD or PD) via public funding, but funding availability varied across ISN regions, including less than a quarter of countries in Oceania and South East Asia (17%) and Africa (24%) and highest availability in Western Europe (91%). Availability increased with the increasing country income level. Initiatives have been developed to propose and promote optimal care for AKI (including the ISN 0-by-25 initiative), but capacity for optimal AKI care remains low, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Concerted efforts by the global community are required to close these gaps, to improve AKI outcomes across the world.","author":"Marina Wainstein","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"a3b00ec58c18226d9960a4b7acebe9250f7c9ae3c867898bbc972c8c9c8be5f9","category":"Environment"}
