{"title":"Perception and Barriers to Improved Charcoal Cookstove Adoption in Wereta, Ethiopia","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0381/v1","date":1717721263000,"content":"The global energy crisis is a significant issue, particularly in developing countries like Ethiopia, where traditional fuels such as wood and charcoal are predominantly used to meet energy demands in urban and rural areas. Despite Ethiopia's substantial charcoal production, the use of inefficient charcoal cookstoves exacerbates fuel consumption, forest degradation, and environmental damage. To address this, various improved charcoal cookstoves (ICS) have been introduced in urban and semi-urban communities in Wereta Town, located in the Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia. This study aims to evaluate household perceptions and identify barriers to the adoption of ICS in the Wereta district. The assessment involved a survey of 308 households using a structured cross-sectional method and analyzed five types of improved cookstoves: clay stoves, insulated clay cylinder stoves, non-insulated rocket stoves, insulated rocket stoves, and non-insulated cylindrical stoves. The study employed various socio-economic variables and utilized both cross-tabulation frequency factors and linear regression statistical analysis through SPSS 20 to identify factors influencing the adoption of ICS. The linear regression results indicated that marital status, income level, family size, and age significantly impact ICS adoption (p-value &lt; 0.05), while the place of cooking, educational level, household decision-making, and the role of societal stakeholders showed no significant impact. This suggests that ICS adoption is primarily influenced by household income levels and family size.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"211a65c127e902f07ab3e39ec7d12e688180d11a946bcb28a496d2e5290e428e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
