{"title":"Machine Learning-Driven Calibration of Traffic Models based on a Real-time Video Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1799/v1","date":1714294736000,"content":"Accurate traffic simulation models play a crucial role in developing intelligent transport systems that offer timely traffic information to users and efficient traffic management. However, calibrating these models to represent real-world traffic conditions accurately poses a significant challenge due to the dynamic nature of traffic flow and the limitations of traditional calibration methods. This article introduces a machine learning-based approach to calibrate macroscopic traffic simulation models using real-time traffic video stream data. By leveraging computer vision technologies to extract key traffic parameters from video streams, the approach demonstrated a notable improvement in aligning the generated data from the calibrated simulation model with car sensor data, achieving an average improvement of over 50% compared to the uncalibrated macroscopic model. Moreover, there was a substantial reduction in data drift for the machine learning model integrated into the virtual transport space using vehicle-to-everything technology, resulting in a more than fourfold decrease in the average absolute error of the model.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"dc88b11f42c43375e6380bd4dc558ee0f7a7d5e85f540a5c7dfd4f1b06c912d5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
