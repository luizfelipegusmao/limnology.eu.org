{"title":"Multiple Postures and Behaviors Recognition Method for Horse Based on Se-SlowFast Network","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0016/v1","date":1725260524000,"content":"The sleeping and grazing behaviors of horses play a crucial role in their health and welfare. In the horse industry, with the prevalent trend of individual single-stall farming in stable, accurately identifying various behaviors of horses within stables is imperative. This study has established a spatio-temporal dataset for horse postures and behaviors, proposed an algorithm utilizing a SE-SlowFast network with an enhanced loss function. This algorithm achieves automatic recognition of multiple postures and behaviors of horse simultaneously. The model developed in this study demonstrates high accuracy in identifying three postures within the stable: Standing, Crouching, and Lying, achieving respective accuracies of 92.73%, 91.87%, and 92.58%. Additionally, it accurately recognizes two behaviors: Sleeping and Grazing, achieving best accuracies of 93.56% and 98.77%. The overall best accuracy of the model is 93.9%. Experiments on video recognition confirm that the suggested model recognizes horse video data accurately. This study marks the first time computer vision technology has been used in the horse farming industry, achieving non-intrusive recognition of multiple horse postures and behaviors. This study provides valuable data support for livestock managers to evaluate the health conditions of horses, enhances the welfare of horses in stables, and contributes to the advancement of modern horse husbandry practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bf2fa968ada5d18a4707327014b1b6a02bd403437fadbfce4084fd6f894b27c4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
