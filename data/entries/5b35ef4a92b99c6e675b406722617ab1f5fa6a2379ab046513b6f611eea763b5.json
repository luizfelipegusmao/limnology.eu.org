{"title":"Environmental Filters Structure Cushion Bogs&rsquo; Floristic Composition along the Southern South American Latitudinal Gradient","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1329/v1","date":1716304893000,"content":"In southern South America, zonal flora, defined by macroclimatic conditions, is strongly influenced by an aridity filter near 29°S. Cushion bogs, high-altitude wetlands along the Andes, display homogeneous flora with cushion species dominance, contrasting with zonal vegetation. Despite being influenced by microclimatic conditions, these ecosystems experience varied environmental effects. This study identifies environmental filters affecting bog communities along a broad-scale latitudinal gradient from 15°S to 42°S.\nWe analyzed 420 bogs and 284 species across three macroclimatic regions with distinct summer, winter, and transitional arid rainfall regimes. Using variance partitioning and membership-based regionalization models, we examined the impacts of climatic, edaphic, and spatial variables on beta diversity. We also assessed species' niche overlap and the influence of environmental filters on the communities' phylogenetic diversity.\nResults show that species turnover and niche overlap vary with macroclimatic differences, delineating three distinct regions. Notably, phylogenetic clustering in the driest part of the gradient (23°S —24°S) highlights the impact of the environmental filter. Aridity and temperature variations at a broad scale serve as environmental filters shaping the composition of bog communities across southern South America.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5b35ef4a92b99c6e675b406722617ab1f5fa6a2379ab046513b6f611eea763b5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
