{"title":"Thermodynamical Metrics in General Relativity Theory","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0972/v1","date":1710754453000,"content":"We demonstrate that multiple well-known metrics, such as the Schwarzschild metric and the extremal solution of the Reissner-Nordstr Ìˆom metric, can be expressed in what we will call thermodynamic form. These formulations appear to be valid for all Rs = ct growing black holes and, therefore, also within the framework of Rh = ct growing black hole cosmology. However, the metrics can also be applied to non-black hole gravitational objects as long as one calculates the CMB and Hawking temperature of the hypothetical black hole from the gravitational mass.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cbc262bcb9031b6552dbc45929e5df46d2a2674cd4f3e4b383a8e3495146108a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
