{"title":"Resonance and beat perception of ballroom dancers: An EEG study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312302","date":1729519200000,"content":"<p>by Xuru Wang, Chenglin Zhou, Xinhong Jin</p>\r\nPurpose <p>The ability to synchronize the perceptual and motor systems is important for full motor coordination and the core determinant of motor skill performance. Dance-related training has been found to effectively improve sensorimotor synchronization, however, the underlying characteristics behind these improvements still warrant further exploration. This study was conducted to investigate the behavioral and neuroactivity characteristics of ballroom dancers relative to those of non-dancers.</p> Participants and methods <p>Thirty-two dancers (19.8 ± 1.8 years old) and 31 non-dancers (22.6 ± 3.1 years old) were recruited to perform a finger-tapping task in synchrony with audiovisual beat stimuli at two intervals: 400 and 800 ms, while simultaneously recording EEG data. Behavioral and neural activity data were recorded during the task.</p> Results <p>The dancers employed a predictive strategy when synchronizing with the beat. EEG recordings revealed stronger brain resonance with external rhythmic stimuli, indicating heightened neural resonance compared to non-dancers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The task was more challenging with an 800-ms beat interval, as observed through both behavioral metrics and corresponding neural signatures in the EEG data, leading to poorer synchronization performance and necessitating a greater allocation of attentional resources (<i>ps</i> &lt; 0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>When performing the finger-tapping task involving audiovisual beats, the beat interval was the primary factor influencing movement synchronization, neural activity and attentional resource allocation. Although no significant behavioral differences were observed between dancers and non-dancers, dancers have enhanced neural resonance in response to rhythmic stimuli. Further research using more ecologically valid tasks and stimuli may better capture the full extent of dancers’ synchronization abilities.</p>","author":"Xuru Wang","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"97fbbe19f6227385a0d05c628d336341dbe2d213b54db25a6e3e99d894fd2b6f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
