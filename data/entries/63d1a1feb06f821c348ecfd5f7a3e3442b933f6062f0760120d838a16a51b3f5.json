{"title":"Modelling and Validation of the Derna Dam Break Event","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1298/v1","date":1711096715000,"content":"The catastrophic failure of two dams in Libya in the night of 10th and 11th September 2023, resulted in a significant amount of water and debris destroying a large part of the city of Derna, which is located downstream of the two dams. The flood caused more than 6000 fatalities and the dis-placement of thousands of people from the city. The dams failed due to heavy rainfall caused by the Medicane Daniel, resulting in intense precipitation and the dams overspilling after reaching full capacity. This paper analyses the consequences of the dam breach by modelling the flow discharge and the flooding of the city of Derna. The analysis compares the computed quantities with the findings of the post-event satellite image analysis from UNOSAT and Copernicus, the field reports, and information gathered from the social media through AI detection. The results allows to better understand the dynamics of the dam breach, its initial parameters and an assessment of the accu-racy of the results.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"63d1a1feb06f821c348ecfd5f7a3e3442b933f6062f0760120d838a16a51b3f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
