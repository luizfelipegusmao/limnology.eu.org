{"title":"Exploring urban water‚Äêenergy nexus: A case study of thermal power plants in Raichur and Ballari districts in Karnataka","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-8947.12507?af=R","date":1718780400000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The paper provides a coupled framework of the water-energy nexus for the water-stressed Indian cities, weaving together multiple interlinked facets, such as the demand for drinking water, water withdrawal patterns, water-related challenges in Thermal Power Stations (TPSs), and the benefits of using treated wastewater in TPSs. An integrated approach is suggested for maximizing the benefits of wastewater reclamation, while reducing the environmental impacts of inefficient water usage, specifically in TPSs, the largest water users in the industrial sector. This is particularly important for a developing country like India that faces declining water availability due to a growing population without commensurate increases in water-use efficiency. Currently, India is the third largest electricity generator in the world, with coal-fired TPSs accounting for more than 78% of the total generation (1715 TWh in 2021). This presents a case for an integrated approach to reduce freshwater consumption in TPSs located in the proximity of cities by using treated wastewater from sewage treatment plants (STPs). The integrated approach for utilizing wastewater in TPSs is a promising tail-pipe initiative that can address multiple targets under the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 in conjunction with other interlinked Goals and their targets. The findings highlight that the suggested sustainable water management practices would lead to enhanced availability of potable water for the city dwellers, thereby addressing multiple targets under SDG 6 along with a few other consequential dimensions including affordable electricity.</p>","author":"Sherin S.
