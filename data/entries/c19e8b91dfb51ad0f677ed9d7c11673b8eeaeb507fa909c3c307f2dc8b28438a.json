{"title":"Carbon Capture Advancements in Metal-Organic Frameworks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0685/v1","date":1723198709000,"content":"Global growth and sustainability highly depend upon the output of industries, corporations, governments, and non-governmental organisations requiring comprehensive energy transition in the face of a worldwide crisis demanding carbon neutralisation. The carbon neutralisation challenges required for energy transition could be overcome by detailed surveying, recording and the analysis of the carbon dioxide emissions. It is crucial to study innovative materials like metal-organic frameworks for their transdisciplinary applications towards carbon capture to have a sustainable strategy to capture harmful emissions. In addition, the CO2 solubility, adsorption and absorption capacity, and several reinforcing characteristics and factors for carbon dioxide capture using MOFs are discussed in detail. Further, for various multidisciplinary applications towards commercialisation, MOFs solubility, adsorption and absorption parameters were considered. Moreover, the essential organic qualities of MOFs and their organo-derivatives are considerably elaborated. Overall, to align with the current sustainable development goals, it is significant that carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced along with its capture in a scientific manner. Relevant projections for carbon capture through MOFs have been reviewed industrially and universally in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c19e8b91dfb51ad0f677ed9d7c11673b8eeaeb507fa909c3c307f2dc8b28438a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
