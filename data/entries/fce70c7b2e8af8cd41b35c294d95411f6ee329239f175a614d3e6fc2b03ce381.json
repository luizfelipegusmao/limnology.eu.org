{"title":"Structural Investigation of the Interaction Between a GC-376 Based Peptidomimetic PROTAC and the Viral Main Protease of Coxsackievirus B3 to Explore the Applicability of a Broad-Spectrum Antiviral PROTAC","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1449/v1","date":1721214769000,"content":"The conservation of the main protease in viral genomes, combined with the absence of a homologous protease in humans, makes this enzyme family an ideal target for developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with minimal host toxicity. GC-376, a peptidomimetic 3CL protease inhibitor, has shown significant efficacy against coronaviruses. Recently, a GC-376-based PROTAC was developed to target and induce the proteosome-mediated degradation of the dimeric SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro protein. Extending this approach, the current study investigates the application of the GC-376 PROTAC to the 3CPro protease of Enteroviruses, specifically characterizing its interaction with CVB3 3CPro through X-ray crystallography, NMR and biophysical techniques. The present structural data show that there are some changes between the binding of CVB3 3CPro and SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro, but the overall similarity is strong. The most notable variation is the orientation of the phenylmethyl ester of GC-376 with the S4 subsite of the proteases. This is linked to the flexibility of the protein structure around the region of the catalytic triad shown by our NMR data. Other structural variations include distinct ligand interactions in subsites S1 and S2, influenced by the presence of Glu71 in CVB3 3CPro. Despite these differences, the GC-376 PROTAC fits well within the binding sites of both proteases, demonstrating its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fce70c7b2e8af8cd41b35c294d95411f6ee329239f175a614d3e6fc2b03ce381","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
