A deeper molecular understanding of these interactions could be a potent antidote to societal concerns of genetic determinism for human behavior, but this requires a paradigm that extends beyond traditional genome-wide association study (GWAS).\r\n\r\nThis Perspective suggests that a deeper understanding of genotype by environment interactions at the molecular level could be a potent antidote to societal concerns of genetic determinism. Developing this idea for human social and behavioral genomics will require a paradigm that extends beyond traditional GWAS.","author":"Gene E.
