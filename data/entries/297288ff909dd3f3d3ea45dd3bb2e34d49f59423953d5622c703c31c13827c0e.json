{"title":"Approach to Interstitial Pneumonia and COPD Using Functional Nutritional Food &ldquo;Platinum-Palladium&rdquo; in Japan. -in Relation to Improvement Examples and Research Examples-","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0125/v1","date":1727859457000,"content":"Interstitial pneumonia is a general term for diseases in which inflammation occurs mainly in the interstitium of the lung. It is also pointed out that interstitial pneumonia reduces alveolar function and makes it difficult to take in oxygen through inspiration, causing symptoms such as dyspnea and coughing, which may eventually lead to respiratory failure. It is At present, there is no effective treatment and only conservative treatment exists. This time, we report that the therapeutic effect was confirmed in patients with interstitial pneumonia who took platinum palladium. In this case, improvement tendencies were observed in patients with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but improvement tendencies were also observed in many other lung diseases. In order to explore the mechanism, AMPK was measured at the in vitro level, and blood KL-6 and hydrogen peroxide levels in the patient were measured at the in vivo level. AMPK values were significantly elevated by more than 800%, KL-6 and hydrogen peroxide levels were also significantly decreased by drinking platinum palladium. Platinum palladium exhibits a strong antioxidant effect and is the only substance in the world that can approach all four types of active oxygen. In addition, when it was actually administered to patients, there were cases of dramatic improvement, and it was confirmed that KL-6, a parameter of lung function, decreased in 16 out of 32 patients, and furthermore, oxygen inhalation was completed. patients were also seen. Although the number of cases is expected to increase in the future, the substance is expected to be effective as a drug, although it is currently classified as a soft drink.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"297288ff909dd3f3d3ea45dd3bb2e34d49f59423953d5622c703c31c13827c0e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
