{"title":"Recognition and Development of Sustainable Parameters for the Industrialization of Specialty Coffees","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1306/v1","date":1711418826000,"content":"The objective of this work was to evaluate the roast time, weight loss and quality of coffee grain at four different roasting degrees, aiming to recognize and develop sustainable patterns to industrialize specialty coffees. Coffee (Coffea arabica L.), from eight producers, with scores between 80 and 83 from SCA classification, were used. Samples of 300 g were roasted in a cylindric rotative roaster, until the grains reached four different roasting profiles (Agtron scale 22.36, #33.64, #40.05, #59.92). Afterwards, analysis of roasting time, gas pressure, weight loss, and sensorial grades were accomplished. It was observed that samples roasted at #22.36 led to significant differences, regarding roasting time and weight loss. Furthermore, there is a significant difference at the sensorial grades of the coffee beverage. Comparing the roast degree #40.05 (standard used for specialty coffee) with the roast degree #22.36 (most used for commodities coffee), the first one has a gas consumption of 0.34 kg per coffee kg, whilst the second presented a gas consumption of 0.41 kg per coffee kg. Thus, from gas consumption, roast degree # 40.05 is the more sustainable option, along with the remaining parameters analyzed.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9b1d9a95466bdf2b659e7ae5f27b0f178752c00718690e47b743d9f61a4ac543","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
