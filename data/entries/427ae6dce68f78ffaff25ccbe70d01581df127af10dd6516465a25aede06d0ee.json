{"title":"PSIV-22 Use of a mixture of olive pomace extract, a palatability enhancer and tributyrin as feed additive on the recovery of unweaned dairy beef calves with pneumonia at farm arrival","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/102/Supplement_3/463/7757530?rss=1","date":1726272000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Pneumonia is the main health issue that farmers have to fight when calves arrive at the rearing farm after marketing and transportation. Calves with pneumonia have a low intake impairing the recovery at arrival. The use of additives to enhance intake and immunity at arrival could be a strategy to minimize those negative effects. A total of 36 calves [body weight (BW) = 71.3 ± 2.83 kg] with pneumonia (ultrasound lung score ≥ 3) arriving at a commercial farm after marketing and transportation were used to evaluate the effect of a mixture of feed additives (FA) comprising a palatability enhancer, standardized olive pomace extract and tributyrin on performance in calves fed 2 L of MR twice daily at 12.5% and ad libitum concentrate feed. Calves were allocated in 4 pens and distributed in 2 treatments (2 pens/treatment); calves fed a concentrate feed without FA since the beginning of the study (arrival to the rearing farm after transport) until weaning (CT; n = 18); calves fed a concentrate feed containing the mixture of FA (CM; n = 18) from arrival until weaning. Calf BW and pen intake were recorded weekly. On d 21 of the study, calves were partially weaned and only milk replacer was offered in the morning, and on d 28 all calves were completely weaned. The study lasted 35 d. Data were analyzed with a mixed-effects model. Final BW of CM calves (95.9 ± 1.29 kg) tended to be greater (<span>P</span> = 0.08) compared with BW of CT calves (92.7 ± 1.29 kg). The CM calves tended (<span>P</span> = 0.06) to have greater ADG than CT calves (0.70 ± 0.037 kg/d and 0.61 ± 0.037 kg/d, respectively). However, a greater sample size may be necessary to observe differences in average concentrate intake measured by pen between treatments (0.82 ± 0.033 kg/d and 0.87 ± 0.033 kg/d for CT and CM, respectively). These results highlight the potential of using a mixture of feed additives with olive pomace extract, palatability enhancers, and tributyrin on the performance recovery of calves with pneumonia on arrival at the rearing farm.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"e0a9c8db33f44d0a010c49c2ee87259ddd1875917af2bbb2b4ca0cd095c0aaf6","entryHash":"427ae6dce68f78ffaff25ccbe70d01581df127af10dd6516465a25aede06d0ee","category":"Environment"}
