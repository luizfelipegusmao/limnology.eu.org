These moths have genetically determined white (WW, Wy) and yellow (yy) hindwings that are linked to mating success and fitness, with heterozygotes (Wy) having an advantage. We hypothesized that attractiveness and reproductive success are correlated, with Wy females being more attractive than the other two genotypes which could contribute to maintaining the polymorphism.\n\nFemale attractiveness was tested by baiting traps with females of the three colour genotypes both in low- (i.e. field set-up) and in high-population density (i.e. large enclosure set-up). Male's ability to reach females was correlated to their own colour genotype and antennal morphology (length, area and lamellae count).\n\nContrary to our prediction, morph-related reproductive success and attractiveness were not correlated. Heavier Wy females attracted a lower proportion of males compared to WW and yy females. Specifically, an increase in weight corresponded to a decreased Wy but increased yy female attractiveness. yy females were generally more attractive than others likely due to earlier pheromone release. In males, lamellae count and genetic colour morph were linked to the male's ability to locate females. Furthermore, male traits affected their ability to reach females in a context-specific way. Males with denser antennae (i.e. higher lamellae count) and white males reached the females faster than yellows in the enclosure, while yellow males located females faster than whites in the field.\n\nOur results indicate that higher yy female attractiveness was likely affected by the combined effect of early pheromone release, female weight and higher population density. Males' searching success was affected by morph-specific behavioural strategies and local population density. Ultimately, the combined effect of genotype-related pheromone signalling strategies of females together with environment-dependent male behaviour affect male response and potentially contribute to maintaining variation in fitness-related traits.\n</p>","author":"Chiara De Pasqual, \nEetu Selenius, \nEmily Burdfield‐Steel, \nJohanna Mappes","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"c3f73d6ddf8d7850053dcf09bd891fa6b9228f4be87241f297f7f1f4076d6c78","category":"Environment"}
