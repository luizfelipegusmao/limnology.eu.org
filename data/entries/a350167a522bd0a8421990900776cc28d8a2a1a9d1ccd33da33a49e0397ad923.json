In recent years, this technique has evolved to increase the microscope field of view and imaging throughput resulting in the generation of huge amounts of data in the range of hundreds of Gigabytes to Terabytes per specimen [<a href=\"#ozae044.216-B2\">2</a>]. Consequently, this surge in data volumes presents challenges related to storage, data organization, image processing, analysis, metadata management, and visualization.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a350167a522bd0a8421990900776cc28d8a2a1a9d1ccd33da33a49e0397ad923","category":"Environment"}
