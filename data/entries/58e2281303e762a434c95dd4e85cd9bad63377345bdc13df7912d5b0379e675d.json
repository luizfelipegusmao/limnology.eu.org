Complementary information can be obtained from the two techniques, making correlative FLIM/Raman of significant interest. In FLIM, an excitation pulse stimulates sample fluorescence, and the time taken for the fluorescence to reach the detector (fluorescence lifetime) is measured. This means that the technique is fast, and it can therefore provide an effective precursor to Raman spectroscopy.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"58e2281303e762a434c95dd4e85cd9bad63377345bdc13df7912d5b0379e675d","category":"Environment"}
