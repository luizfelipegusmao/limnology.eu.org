{"title":"Assessing the Impact of Geospatial Susceptibility on the Rural Agricultural Landscapes of Village Settlements in Southwestern Nigeria","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0104/v1","date":1725289329000,"content":"A theoretical framework for agricultural landscape pattern transitions in rural areas is proposed to fill the gap of current research with an empirical study in the Alabata farm settlement in Ogun State, Southwest Nigeria. Adopting the use of ArcGIS 10.8 and Surfer 27.3 to calculate the surface area and volume of the ground surface degraded and exposed to harsh weather conditions due to both natural and man-made anthropogenic activities causing runoffs and continuous soil erosion, which has affected agricultural production and sent some of the farmers packing and abandoning their farmlands. The farm settlement within the total sampled frame area of 1.50 kmÂ² covers a total distance of 5.11 km. The sample frame was divided into 36 frames with similar ecological terrain and soil types, which fell into either identified soil types 1 and 2. The study completed a questionnaire onsite using three major criteria. Only 23 farmers responded positively to the few questions with farmers either living on the farm or working as hired laborers on-site at the visit. The transition characteristics of agricultural landscape patterns as represented in abandoned land, and orchards are analyzed from a local perspective.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"046fc50df7f24fbd4ec922aef026cafcb94bbc4ef70b05c1ab36912c7378a69e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
