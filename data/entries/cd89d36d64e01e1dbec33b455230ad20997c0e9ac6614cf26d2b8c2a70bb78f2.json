{"title":"Digital Twins and Intrusion Detection Systems: A Synergistic Approach to Securing Smart Cities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0792/v1","date":1725954518000,"content":"In this research, we investigate the integration of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with a Digital Twin (DT) to enhance the cybersecurity of physical devices in cyber-physical systems. Using Eclipse Ditto as the DT platform and Snort as the IDS, we developed a near-realistic test environment that included a Raspberry Pi as the physical device and a Kali Linux virtual machine to perform common cyberattacks such as Hping3 flood attacks and NMAP reconnaissance scans. The results demonstrated that the IDS effectively detected Hping3-based flood attacks but showed limitations in identifying NMAP scans, suggesting areas for IDS configuration improvements. Furthermore, the study uncovered significant system resource impacts, including high CPU usage during SYN and ACK flood attacks and persistent memory usage after NMAP scans, highlighting the need for enhanced recovery mechanisms. This research presents a novel approach by coupling a Digital Twin with an IDS, enabling real-time monitoring and providing a dual perspective on both system performance and security. The integration offers a holistic method for identifying vulnerabilities and understanding resource impacts during cyberattacks. The work contributes new insights into the use of Digital Twins for cybersecurity and paves the way for further research into automated defense mechanisms, real-world validation of the proposed model, and the incorporation of additional attack scenarios. The results suggest that this combined approach holds significant promise for enhancing the security and resilience of IoT devices and other cyber-physical systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cd89d36d64e01e1dbec33b455230ad20997c0e9ac6614cf26d2b8c2a70bb78f2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
