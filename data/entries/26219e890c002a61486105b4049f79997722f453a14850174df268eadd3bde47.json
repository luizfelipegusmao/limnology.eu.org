{"title":"Milky Disease: A Review of Discovery, Pathogens, and Detection Methods in Crabs","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/6664037?af=R","date":1697526000000,"content":"<p>As an important economic crustacean in China, the crab has been a popular focus in aquaculture in recent years due to its high production and economic value. The epidemic of milky disease has severely damaged the crab farming industry, resulting in heavy economic losses and hindering the sustainable development of high-quality crab farming. The disease is characterized by severe emulsification of all tissues and the presence of large amounts of opaque, milky fluid in the body, with a high infection rate and high mortality. Determining the cause of the disease, its life cycle, transmission routes, and detection methods will help to provide direction for the prevention and control of crab milky disease. This article aims to review the discovery, main pathogens, and pathologies of milky disease, along with the currently established detection methods. We have also attempt to classify the control measures for the prevention and control of milky disease in crabs.</p>","author":"Yabing Tan, \nSihan Zhou, \nXinyi Cen, \nXinran Wang, \nYingying Zhao, \nYingdong Li, \nHua Wei, \nXiaodong Li, \nCarlos Rosas","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"26219e890c002a61486105b4049f79997722f453a14850174df268eadd3bde47","category":"Environment"}
