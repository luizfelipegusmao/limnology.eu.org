{"title":"Periodontitis and pre-eclampsia among pregnant women in Rwanda: A case-control study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312103","date":1728914400000,"content":"<p>by Agnes Gatarayiha, Joseph Ntaganira, Zoe Brookes, Léon Mutesa, Anders Gustafsson, Stephen Rulisa</p>\r\nIntroduction <p>Several studies have indicated that the presence of periodontitis during pregnancy could increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, thereby negatively influencing pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and child. Notably, despite the high prevalence of both periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Rwanda, there exists a crucial evidence gap concerning the precise relationship between periodontitis and pre-eclampsia.</p> Objectives <p>The aim of this study was to assess the association between periodontitis and pre-eclampsia amongst pregnant women in Rwanda.</p> Methods and materials <p>Employing an unmatched 1:2 case-control design, we studied 52 pre-eclamptic and 104 non-pre-eclamptic pregnant women aged ≥18 years at two referral hospitals in Rwanda. Pre-eclampsia was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation and proteinuria of ≥300mL in 24 hours of urine collection. Periodontitis was defined as the presence of two or more teeth with one or more sites with a pocket depth ≥ 4mm and clinical attachment loss &gt;3 mm at the same site, assessed through clinical attachment loss measurement. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to estimate Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence interval.</p> Results <p>The prevalence of periodontitis was significantly higher among women with pre-eclampsia, compared to pregnant women without pre-eclampsia, at 90.4% and 55.8%, respectively (p&lt; 0.001). Pregnant Women with periodontitis were 3.85 times more likely to develop pre-eclampsia after controlling for relevant confounders (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 3.85, 95%CI = 1.14–12.97, p&lt;0.05).</p> Conclusion <p>This study results indicates that periodontitis is significantly associated with pre-eclampsia among pregnant women in Rwanda. These findings suggest that future research should explore whether enhancing periodontal health during pregnancy could contribute to reducing pre-eclampsia in this specific population.</p>","author":"Agnes Gatarayiha","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dbde9a4c9be951d612b3296d07168a32cdb4259f65d90f27f9e0993d56b2965f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
