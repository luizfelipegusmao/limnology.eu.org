{"title":"Marine recreational fishery trends in total catch, catch per unit effort, and release rates in Delaware during 1981–2021","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fme.12742?af=R","date":1727275433000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The impact of recreational fisheries on marine ecosystems is often overshadowed by commercial fisheries, although recreational fishing harvest can be substantial, especially for species that are either overfished or experiencing overfishing. Delaware is a small coastal state with ~1,000,000 residents and nearly 272,000 resident and non-resident anglers. We used publicly available data for Delaware's recreational fisheries during 1981–2021 to determine the nine most caught fish species and to evaluate trends in total numbers caught, harvested, released, and catch per unit effort (CPUE). The top nine most frequently captured fish by recreational anglers were Summer Flounder (<i>Paralichthys dentatus</i>), Atlantic Croaker (<i>Micropogonias undulatus</i>), Bluefish (<i>Pomatomus saltatrix</i>), Black Sea Bass (<i>Centropristis striata</i>), Weakfish (<i>Cynoscion regalis</i>), White Perch (<i>Morone americana</i>), Tautog (<i>Tautoga onitis</i>), Striped Bass (<i>Morone saxatilis</i>), and Spot (<i>Leiostomus xanthurus</i>). The proportion of fish released increased through time for all nine species, suggesting that the recreational fishery in Delaware is transitioning from a harvest-oriented to a catch-and-release-oriented fishery. Observations of higher release rates in recreational fisheries of Delaware are consistent with the findings elsewhere in the world for freshwater and marine systems.</p>","author":"Nicholas Whaley, \nJulia Fontana, \nMatthew Hicks, \nBenjamin Paul Marsaly, \nTimothy Smoot, \nSerena Bandlow, \nAaron Carlisle, \nEdward Hale","siteTitle":"Wiley: Fisheries Management and Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"2b1b3fff230d9382f58e34a4967fc2d5f8d98012b5e160c81a8e044227f32245","entryHash":"c18dc2572dce93a38866c7ed8f46b50e69bdc1e09900507cc69242470979b131","category":"Environment"}
