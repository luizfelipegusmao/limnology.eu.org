{"title":"Comparative Performance Assessment between Incompressible and Compressible Solvers to Simulate a Cavitating Wake","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0094/v1","date":1722521307000,"content":"The cavitating wake behind a wedge has been simulated employing both incompressible and compressible solvers with the purpose of comparing their performance. To develop the compressible solver, the ZGB cavitation model for incompressible flows has been modified to consider the compressibility effects. First, the equations of state for the vapor and liquid phases have been implemented. Then, a pressure limit and absorbing boundary conditions have been set to prevent a non-physical pressure field. To test the developed compressible solver, a series of verification tests have been conducted comprising a 1D sod cavitating tube and the cavitating vortex shedding behind a circular body at laminar flow conditions. After that, the incompressible and the validated compressible solvers have been applied to simulate the cavitating wake behind a wedge. The obtained results show similar predictions with the two solvers in terms of pressure, vortex shedding frequency and instantaneous and average vapor volume fraction profiles. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the components of the fluid force fluctuations on the body at the lowest frequencies, as predicted by both solvers, are indistinguishable. However, the higher frequency fluctuations of the forces tend to be better resolved and amplified when the compressibility is considered. Overall, both flow solvers have provided comparable cavitation phenomena, yielding results well aligned with experimental observations.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53500e7180ce2f60bb8da922eb83a9d3fb9dd1f6313563f37a99d3be1b14d669","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
