{"title":"Elastic Modulus Measurement at High Temperatures for Miniature Ceramic Samples using Laser Micro-Machining and Thermal Mechanical Analyzer","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1511/v1","date":1724232689000,"content":"In this paper, we demonstrate a method of measuring the flexural elastic modulus of ceramics at an intermediate (~millimeter) scale, at high temperatures. We used a picosecond laser to precisely cut micro-beams from the location of interest in a bulk ceramic. They had a cross-section of approximately 100 μm × 300 μm, and a length of ~1 cm. They were then tested in a thermal-mechanical analyzer at room temperature, 500°C, 800°C, and 1100°C using the four-point flexural testing method. We compared the elastic moduli of high-purity Al2O3 and AlN measured by our method with the reported values in the literature and found that the difference was less than 5% for both materials. This paper provides a new and accurate method of characterizing the high-temperature elastic modulus of miniature samples extracted from representative/selected areas of bulk materials.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b82136fb04233e7dc527363789489064851691a8c2020f65aa8fe93753226b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
