{"title":"HIGH PLOIDY2-mediated SUMOylation of transcription factor ARR1 controls two-component signaling in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/9/3521/7685856?rss=1","date":1717113600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cytokinins regulate plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stresses such as cold via phosphorelay from cytokinin receptors to the ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs (ARRs). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of type-B ARR transcriptional activity in Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) remain unclear. Here, we show that the E3 SUMO ligase HIGH PLOIDY2 SUMOylates ARR1, a type-B ARR, at K236, triggering its activation. Cold- or cytokinin-induced phosphorylation of ARR1 at D89 is crucial for its interaction with HPY2. Lysine 236 is critical for ARR1's transactivation without compromising its DNA-binding ability, while D89 is crucial for ARR1's binding to target gene promoters. Cytokinin enhances ARR1's chromatin binding, but cold does not. ARR1 K236 plays a critical role in promoting histone H3 acetylation in response to both cytokinin and cold without affecting chromatin binding. The K236R mutation in ARR1 reduces target gene expression and alters cytokinin and cold response phenotypes. This study unveils a mechanism of ARR1 activation wherein phosphorylated ARR1 interacts with HPY2 and binds to chromatin in response to cytokinin. Cold triggers a phosphorelay targeting chromatin-bound ARR1. HPY2 then catalyzes ARR1 SUMOylation at K236, enhancing histone H3 acetylation and leading to transcriptional activation of ARR1 in response to both cold and cytokinin.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"7f41ba660336effbdcc5516596833e630ec74e70c8b9c66b5fc2222d591ead1f","category":"Environment"}
