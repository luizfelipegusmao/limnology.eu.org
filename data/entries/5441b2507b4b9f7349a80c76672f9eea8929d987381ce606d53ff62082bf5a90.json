{"title":"Decoding Chinese Murals: Material Characterization of ‘Ming Dynasty’ Paintings in Western Collections","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.061/7719501?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>This paper delves into the material characterization of Chinese polychrome mural fragments in several collections, including the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) and the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. While these murals are painted in styles that evoke examples of the Ming dynasty, recent curatorial research raised questions about their attribution to this period. In many cases, they were collected in the early 20th century, and their provenance records are incomplete. As part of an influx of Asian artworks into Western collections during this period, these murals attest to the tastes of Western buyers and the art export market at the time. Accessioned in prestigious museums, cultural historians may refer to these works in their teaching and scholarship. Further, references to these mural fragments have bolstered Ming dynasty attributions of similar pieces on the art market in recent decades.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"5441b2507b4b9f7349a80c76672f9eea8929d987381ce606d53ff62082bf5a90","category":"Environment"}
