{"title":"US agency obstructs LGBTQ+ equity in science | Science","link":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado5636","date":1712840460000,"content":"The US National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) regularly conducts national surveys of the US-based PhD- and college-educated populations. These surveys monitor who receives degrees or is working in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and what disparities exist based on sex, race, disability, first-generation status, or income background. Because the official statistics generated by the surveys directly inform national policies and fuel data-driven solutions, the questions they include determine which marginalized groups are made visible and which groups are overlooked. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) are less represented than statistically expected (1) and face disproportionate career barriers and workplace harassment in STEM (2). NCSESâ€™s omission of questions on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) prevents policy-makers from addressing these challenges.","author":"","siteTitle":"Science","siteHash":"08244134beaa7712a45a99601e5e0d25fd23f6384c4a65e503ee732006dc374e","entryHash":"a72e1dc3af42eeacc5f943146739f0518621f6dcfee3a30e6b3a4f4e742df46b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
