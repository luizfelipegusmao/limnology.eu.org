{"title":"An expeditious and facile method of amyloid beta (1–42) purification","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307213","date":1720706400000,"content":"<p>by Md. Aminul Haque, Il Seon Park</p>\r\n\r\nFor the study of amyloid beta (Aβ) associated toxicity which is supposed to be the main pathological agent in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it is important to secure Aβ peptide with appropriate biological activity. However, commercial and synthetic Aβ often have some pitfalls like less cell toxicity, prompt aggregation and excess price, using recombinant technology, these issues can be resolved though the method also suffered from some problems such as low yield, aggregation and prolong time to purify. Thus, we previously developed an easy, economic and convenient method for Aβ42 purification using highly expressed GroES-Ubiquitin-Aβ42 fusion protein. The method was efficient, but further development was performed to improve the procedure and increase the yield. Focus was on the isolation of the fusion protein (GroES-Ubiquitin) from Aβ42 peptide. After a series of systematic testing with several chemicals, we found that methanol could precipitate efficiently the fusion protein, while the Aβ peptide was recovered in the supernatant. By this method, Aβ peptide was easily purified without tedious chromatographic steps which are main obstacles to purify the peptide in the previous method. This method yielded ~20 mg highly pure Aβ42 peptide from 1-liter bacterial culture. Different biophysical characterizations and bioactivity assays indicate that the peptide purified using this method was competitive with others which have been previously reported whereas considering the simplicity, final yield and time of purification, this method is the optimal solution.","author":"Md.
