In our study, we will explore the mechanisms of exosomes from different sources on lung cancer. We isolated CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from venous blood and tumor tissues of lung cancer patients, and isolated exosomes. MiR-2682 was high expression in CD8<sup>+</sup>T-derived exosomes, and lncRNA-FOXD3-AS1 was upregulated in CAF-derived exosomes. Online bioinformatics database analysis showed that RNA Binding Motif Protein 39 (RBM39) was identified as the target of miR-2682, and eukaryotic translation initiation factors 3B (EIF3B) was identified as the RNA binding protein of FOXD3-AS1. CD8<sup>+</sup>T-derived exosomes inhibited the growth of A549 cells and promoted apoptosis, while miR-2682 inhibits reversed these effects of CD8<sup>+</sup>T-derived exosomes. CAF-derived exosomes promoted the growth of A549 cells and inhibited apoptosis, while FOXD3-AS1 siRNA reversed the effect of CAF-derived exosomes. Mechanism studies have found that miR-2682 inhibits the growth of lung cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of RBM39. FOXD3-AS1 promoted the growth of lung cancer cells by binding to EIF3B. In vivo experiments showed that CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell-derived exosome miR-2682 inhibited lung cancer tumor formation, while CAF-derived exosome FOXD3-AS1 promoted lung cancer tumor formation. This study provides mechanistic insights into the role of miR-2682 and FOXD3-AS1 in lung cancer progression and provides new strategies for lung cancer treatment.</p>","author":"Guangxian Mao, \nJixian Liu","siteTitle":"Wiley: Environmental Toxicology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"3e19664e1b03dbc2a34b78954cb357c115e887427c6329aabe3978a05669aef6","entryHash":"706e078d7b81e4b6ec18525ac38e1a843162eeb9f734eb09e85696cc4e6ad65d","category":"Environment"}
