Clinical research on TGD health is limited by a lack of standardization on how to best identify these individuals. The objective of this retrospective cohort analysis was to accurately identify and describe TGD adults and their use of gender-affirming care from 2003â€“2023 in a healthcare system in Utah, United States. International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 and 10 codes and surgical procedure codes, along with sexual orientation and gender identity data were used to develop a dataset of 4,587 TGD adults. During this time frame, 2,985 adults received gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) and/or gender-affirming surgery (GAS) within one healthcare system. There was no significant difference in race or ethnicity between TGD adults who received GAHT and/or GAS compared to TGD adults who did not receive such care. TGD adults who received GAHT and/or GAS were more likely to have commercial insurance coverage, and adults from rural communities were underrepresented. Patients seeking estradiol-based GAHT tended to be older than those seeking testosterone-based GAHT. The first GAS occurred in 2013, and uptake of GAS have doubled since 2018. This study provides a methodology to identify and examine TGD patients in other health systems and offers insights into emerging trends and access to gender-affirming care.","author":"Tiffany F.
