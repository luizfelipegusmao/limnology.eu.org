{"title":"Modeling A Western Lifestyle in Mice: A Novel Approach to Eradicating Aerobic Spore-Forming Bacteria from the Colonic Microbiome and Assessing Long Term Clinical Outcomes.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1185/v1","date":1723776235000,"content":"Introduction: The environmentally acquired aerobic spore-forming (EAS-Fs) bacteria that are ubiquitous in nature (e.g. soil) are transient colonisers of the mammalian gastro-intestinal tract. Without regular exposure, their numbers quickly diminish. These species of bacteria have been suggested to be essential to the normal functioning of metabolic and immunogenic health. The modern Western lifestyle restricts exposure to these EAS-Fs, possibly explaining part of the pathogenesis of many Western diseases. To date, the only animal studies that address specific microbiome modelling are based around germ-free animals. We have designed a new animal model that specifically restricts exposure to environmental sources of bacteria.\nMethodology: A new protocol, termed Super Clean, that involves housing mice in autoclaved individually ventilated cages (IVCs), with autoclaved food / water, and strict ascetic handling practice was first experimentally validated. The quantification of EAS-Fs was assessed by heat-treating faecal samples and measuring colony forming units (CFUs). This was then compared to mice in standard-conditions. Mice were housed in their respective groups from birth until 18 months. Stool samples were taken throughout the experiment to assess for abundance in transiently acquired environmental bacteria. Clinical, biochemical, histological, and gene expression markers were analysed for diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (the “diseases of the West”). \nResults: Our results show that stringent adherence to the Super Clean protocol produces a significantly decreased abundance of aerobic spore-forming Bacillota after 21 days. This microbiomic shift was correlated with significantly increased levels of obesity and impaired glucose metabolism. There was no evidence of colitis, liver disease or hypercholesterolaemia. \nConclusion: This new murine model successfully isolates EAS-Fs, and has the potential utility for future research allowing for the investigation into the clinical impact living in relative hygienic conditions","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"12ebe0023ecdc3201bb34d27bf8d9ef7ff22418fed26d2d8eb5a76f805d0f24b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
