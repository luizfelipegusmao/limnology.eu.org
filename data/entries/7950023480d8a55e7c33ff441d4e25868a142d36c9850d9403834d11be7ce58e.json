{"title":"WSPoly-SAM: Weakly-Supervised and Self-Guided Fine-Tuning of SAM for Colonoscopy Polyp Segmentation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0389/v1","date":1715083137000,"content":"Ensuring precise segmentation of colorectal polyps holds critical importance in the early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, existing deep learning-based segmentation methods are fully-supervised, requiring extensive precise manual pixel-level annotation data, which leads to high annotation costs. Additionally, it remains challenging to train large-scale segmentation models when confronted with limited colonoscopy data. To address these issues, we introduce the general segmentation foundation modelâ€”Segment Anything Model (SAM) into the field of medical image segmentation. Fine-tuning the foundation model is an effective approach to tackle sample scarcity. However, current SAM fine-tuning techniques still rely on precise annotations. To overcome this limitation, we propose WSPoly-SAM, a novel weakly-supervised approach for colonoscopy polyp segmentation. WSPoly-SAM utilizes weak annotations to guide SAM in generating segmentation masks, which are then treated as pseudo-labels to guide the fine-tuning of SAM, thereby reducing the dependence on precise annotations data. To improve the reliability and accuracy of pseudo-labels, we have designed a series of enhancement strategies to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and mitigate the negative impact of low-quality pseudo-labels. Experimental results on five medical image datasets demonstrate that WSPoly-SAM outperforms current fully-supervised mainstream polyp segmentation networks on the Kvasir-SEG, ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS datasets. Furthermore, by using different amounts of training data in weakly-supervised and fully-supervised experiments, it is found that weakly-supervised fine-tuning can save 70% to 73% of annotation time costs compared to fully-supervised fine-tuning. This study provides a new perspective on the combination of weakly-supervised learning and SAM models, significantly reducing annotation time and offering insights for further development in the field of colonoscopy polyp segmentation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7950023480d8a55e7c33ff441d4e25868a142d36c9850d9403834d11be7ce58e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
