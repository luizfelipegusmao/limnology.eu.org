The study examines key challenges, strategies, and perceived benefits associated with sustainable procurement across diverse industries. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled participants renowned for their expertise in procurement and sustainability. Thematic analysis revealed that while regulatory compliance, supplier engagement, and cost considerations pose significant challenges, strategies such as collaborative partnerships, embedding sustainability criteria into procurement contracts, and leveraging technology are pivotal in promoting sustainable procurement. Participants highlighted benefits including enhanced brand reputation, improved operational efficiencies, and strengthened stakeholder trust. Leadership commitment and organizational culture emerged as critical drivers of successful sustainable procurement initiatives, influencing employee engagement and organizational resilience. Looking forward, emerging trends such as circular economy principles and the integration of sustainability into corporate strategies are identified as transformative for future procurement practices. The study underscores the strategic importance of sustainability in enhancing organizational resilience, mitigating risks, and creating long-term economic, environmental, and social value. By addressing challenges, leveraging effective strategies, and embracing emerging trends, organizations can position themselves as leaders in sustainable procurement, contributing positively to global sustainability goals and gaining competitive advantage.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"75ce18827bf966a185fff2c68059c392c872c57fd0748c8cb231cfe18220cf78","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
