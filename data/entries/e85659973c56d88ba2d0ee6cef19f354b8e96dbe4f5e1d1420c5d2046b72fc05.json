{"title":"Reassessing Information in Understanding the Temporality of Consciousness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0188/v1","date":1717551446000,"content":"This paper delves into the concept of information within the context of conscious systems, emphasizing the pivotal role of entropy as a fundamental aspect in comprehending consciousness. Drawing on insights from Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and information theory, the argument posits that consciousness entails dynamic information processing, distinct from the static storage and retrieval model employed by modern computers. The intrinsic dynamics of neural systems are explored, illuminating how they integrate incoming stimuli into a unified state of subjective experience, thereby shaping conscious awareness. By considering entropy as a temporal and qualitative value, its significance in reducing uncertainty and facilitating adaptability in conscious systems is underscored. Through a series of principles, the intricate relationship between entropy, neural dynamics, and consciousness is elucidated. This analysis suggests the necessity of rethinking traditional notions of information when applied to conscious systems, highlighting the dynamic nature of consciousness and its interaction with the environment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e85659973c56d88ba2d0ee6cef19f354b8e96dbe4f5e1d1420c5d2046b72fc05","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
