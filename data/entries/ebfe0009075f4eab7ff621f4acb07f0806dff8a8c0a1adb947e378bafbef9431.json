Meanwhile, these experiments still experience multifold challenges in terms of debatable electron beam effects on the samples, loss of spatial resolution due to motion blurring and the presence of a liquid environment, and a lack of three-dimensional (3D) molecular-level information. Our previous work [<a href=\"#ozae044.807-B2\">2</a>] showed that the membrane protein dynamics observed in graphene liquid cells (GLCs) are validated as the generic transformations occurred when immersed in a liquid environment, through comparisons with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Biophysics-based analysis was performed to extract the biomechanical properties such as the bending modulus and effective interfacial tension of the protein-liquid assemblies.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"ebfe0009075f4eab7ff621f4acb07f0806dff8a8c0a1adb947e378bafbef9431","category":"Environment"}
