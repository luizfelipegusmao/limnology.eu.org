{"title":"Conformational Transitions and Allosteric Modulation in a Heteromeric Glycine Receptor","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/doi/10.1093/mam/ozae044.366/7720472?rss=1","date":1721779200000,"content":"<span>Glycine receptors (GlyR) are chloride-conducting ion channel within the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family [<a href=\"#ozae044.366-B1\">1</a>]. GlyR are found at spinal cord synapses and their activation typically leads to neuronal hyperpolarization of motor or sensory neurons. GlyR are assembled from five homologous subunits of two varieties, either GlyRα genes (α1-4) or the sole GlyRβ. Functional homomeric GlyR is composed of only α subunits. However, synaptic GlyR is heteromeric as only the β subunit interacts with gephryin, a synaptic scaffold protein [<a href=\"#ozae044.366-B2\">2</a>]. Prior to recent cryo-EM studies, the stoichiometry and arrangment of the heteromeric complex was unknown. Using single-particle cryo-EM our group and others found that heteromeric GlyR is predominantly composed of four α subunits and one β subunit [<a href=\"#ozae044.366-B3\">3-5</a>]. In addition, our study examines heteromeric GlyR pharmacological properties by presenting cryo-EM structures in the presence of an agonist (1 mM glycine, 3.2 angstrom), antagonist (100 uM strychnine, 3.0 angstrom) and agonist plus a positive allosteric modulator (1 mM glycine and 20 uM ivermectin, 3.0 angstrom). We find that subunit heterogeneity has little impact at the canonical binding site, but a significant impact on the ivermectin transmembrane allosteric site.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"dcce96379b37328044e3a81d6a7d6baaae917956b913bb325d3c3cf5f646973c","category":"Environment"}
