{"title":"The Romea Strata Route Between History and Heritage. A Spiritual, Diverse, and Interreligious Project from the Baltics to Rome","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1648/v1","date":1729578083000,"content":"This article is dedicated to critically appraising the current knowledge and advancements in rediscovering a thematic religious and cultural route that traverses European continental territories, from the Baltic regions to Rome, known as Romea Strata. This spiritual, diverse, and interreligious project combines two approaches: the historical and heritage fashioners. The article assesses secondary sources that clarify a scientific background, discussing the historicity of Romea Strataâ€™s direction from Tallinn to Rome, through European capitals and minor localities. Mobility in space motivated by culture and faith is a human phenomenon. Historical knowledge of this phenomenon constitutes an important theme for understanding the different potentials of intercultural dialogue, as a strong awareness of the heritage capabilities motivates communities to collaborate on a sustainable development project.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8f5fd87a8cb7232c506ca9e79c85088507583041f8fe03bee9317c651f9cf98c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
