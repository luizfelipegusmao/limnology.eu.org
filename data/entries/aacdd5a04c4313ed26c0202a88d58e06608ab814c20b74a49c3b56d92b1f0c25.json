{"title":"Dynamic Wind Turbines clustering according to SCADA signals shapes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0351/v1","date":1715072808000,"content":"In this work, we explore the ability to dynamically group the Wind Turbine (WT) of a Wind Farm (WF) based on the behaviour of some of their Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) signals to detect the turbines that exhibit abnormal behaviour. We centre this study on a small WF of five WTs. We use the fact that the same signals from different turbines in the same WF coherently evolve temporally in a time domain, describing very similar waveforms. In this contribution, we use averaged signals from the SCADA system and omit maximums, minimums and standard deviations, focusing mainly on velocities and other slowly varying signals. For the temporal analysis, sliding windows of different temporal durations and overlapings are explored. The capability to automatically identify WTs whose signals differ from the groupâ€™s behaviour can alert and program preventive maintenance operations on such WTs before a major breakdown occurs.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"aacdd5a04c4313ed26c0202a88d58e06608ab814c20b74a49c3b56d92b1f0c25","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
