{"title":"Ion-induced cloud modulation through new particle formation and runaway cloud condensation nuclei production","link":"https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/doi/10.1093/oxfclm/kgae018/7755049?rss=1","date":1726012800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cloud formation in the Pi Convectionâ€“Cloud Chamber is achieved via ionization in humid conditions, without the injection of aerosol particles to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Abundant ions, turbulence, and supersaturated water vapor combine to produce new particles, which grow to become CCN sized and eventually are activated to form clouds. Coupling between the new particle formation and cloud droplets causes predator-prey type oscillations in aerosol and droplet concentrations under turbulent conditions. Leading terms are identified in the budgets for Aitken and accumulation mode aerosols and for cloud droplets. The cloud coupling is proposed to be a result of cloud-induced runaway CCN production through aerosol scavenging. The experiments suggest potential applications to marine cloud brightening, in which ions rather than sea-salt aerosols are generated.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Oxford Open Climate Change Current Issue","siteHash":"00d34e28b1e6fdd64576c95b4b9bf33bcd15bb32fadd247b4a29ecaac9c1ad73","entryHash":"7ed4ff3aad40d5a19ad9477a8354f110bb45bbb636b33f51462b446d7894ea17","category":"Environment"}
