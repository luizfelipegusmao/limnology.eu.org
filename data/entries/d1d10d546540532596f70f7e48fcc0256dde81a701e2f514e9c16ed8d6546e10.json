{"title":"Integrating a Machine Learning-Driven Fraud Detection System Based on a Risk Management Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1756/v1","date":1719352269000,"content":"This article explores the application of machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on ensemble methods like Random Forests, for detecting fraudulent activities in digital financial transactions. Highlighting the evolution from traditional statistical approaches to modern machine learning models, it underscores the effectiveness of Random Forests in handling the inherent challenges of imbalanced datasets typical in fraud detection scenarios. Using a Kaggle dataset of credit card transactions, the study optimizes Random Forest parameters through rigorous parameter tuning, achieving significant improvements in model performance metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC). The findings underscore the critical role of machine learning in enhancing fraud detection capabilities, emphasizing the ongoing evolution and future potential of these methodologies in financial risk management.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d1d10d546540532596f70f7e48fcc0256dde81a701e2f514e9c16ed8d6546e10","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
