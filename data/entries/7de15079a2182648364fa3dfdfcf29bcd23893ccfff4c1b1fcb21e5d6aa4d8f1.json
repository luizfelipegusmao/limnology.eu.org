{"title":"Using Museum collections to assess the impact of industrialization on mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>) calcification","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301874","date":1713362400000,"content":"<p>by Leanne A. Melbourne, Nathalie F. Goodkin</p>\r\n\r\n<i>Mytilus edulis</i> is a commercially and ecologically important species found along the east coast of the United States. Ecologically, <i>M</i>. <i>edulis</i> improves water quality through filtration feeding and provides habitat formation and coastal protection through reef formation. Like many marine calcifiers, ocean warming, and acidification are a growing threat to these organismsâ€”impacting their morphology and function. Museum collections are useful in assessing long-term environmental impacts on organisms in a natural multi-stressor environment, where acclimation and adaptation can be considered. Using the American Museum of Natural History collections ranging from the early 1900s until now, we show that shell porosity changes through time. Shells collected today are significantly more porous than shells collected in the 1960s and, at some sites, than shells collected from the early 1900s. The disparity between porosity changes matches well with the warming that occurred over the last 130 years in the north Atlantic suggesting that warming is causing porosity changes. However, more work is required to discern local environmental impacts and to fully identify porosity drivers. Since, porosity is known to affect structural integrity, porosity increasing through time could have negative consequences for mussel reef structural integrity and hence habitat formation and storm defenses.","author":"Leanne A.
