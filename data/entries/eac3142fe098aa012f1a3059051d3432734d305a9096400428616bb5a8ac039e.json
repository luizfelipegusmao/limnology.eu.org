{"title":"Tracking Detectors in Nuclear Physics: An Overview","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1881/v1","date":1719404319000,"content":"Advances in accelerator technology have enabled the use of exotic and intense radioactive ion beams. Enhancements to tracking detectors are necessary to accommodate increased particle rates. Recent advancements in digital electronics have led to the construction or planning of next-generation detectors. To conduct kinematically complete measurements, it is essential to track and detect all particles produced as a result of the reaction. Furthermore, the need for high-precision physics experiments has led to significant developments in the detector field. In recent years, highly efficient and highly granular tracking detectors have been developed. These detectors significantly enhance the physics programme at dedicated facilities.Â An overview of the charged-particle tracking detectors in low-energy nuclear physics will be given.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eac3142fe098aa012f1a3059051d3432734d305a9096400428616bb5a8ac039e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
