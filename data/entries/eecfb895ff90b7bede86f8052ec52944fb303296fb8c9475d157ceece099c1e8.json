{"title":"Metabolic Risk Factors and Survival in Patients with Glioblastoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0546/v1","date":1725634116000,"content":"Background\nThe metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing various systemic cancers. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients is unknown. Further, there have been contradictory reports about how the metabolic syndrome affects clinical outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the metabolic syndrome is associ-ated with increased prevalence of glioblastoma and worsened survival outcomes. \nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study examines seventy-three patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild type glioblastoma as it provides for a relatively homogeneous population to examine. Patient characteristics, vital signs, lab results, tumor molecular markers, and overall survival were analyzed. Patients with the metabolic syndrome and individual risk factors were identified and survival outcomes were examined.\nResults \nOur results demonstrate that there is a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in our cohort of patients with glioblastoma than the general population (41% vs 33%). We also demonstrate that after correction for confounding variables, the metabolic syndrome is not significantly asso-ciated with overall survival (p = 0.1). When analyzing individual metabolic risk factors, we demonstrate that there is a significant association between the accumulation of metabolic risk factors and decreased survival (p = 0.03), and hyperglycemia emerges as a significant independent risk factor for decreased survival (p = 0.05). \nConclusion\nThese results suggest that metabolic risk factors can affect survival in patients with glioblastoma, which can have significant implications for clinical practice. These findings need to be further ex-plored through further clinical and mechanistic studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eecfb895ff90b7bede86f8052ec52944fb303296fb8c9475d157ceece099c1e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
