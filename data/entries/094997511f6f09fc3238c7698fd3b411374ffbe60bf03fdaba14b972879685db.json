{"title":"Relationship between Dynamic Balance and Physical Characteristics of Elite Lifesaving Athletes","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1866/v1","date":1719405831000,"content":"Balance is important in lifesaving competitions. We aimed to investigate the relationship between dynamic balance and physical function in elite lifesavers by measuring the foot muscle cross-sectional area, ankle joint muscle strength, toe grasp strength, plantar superficial sensation, and dynamic balance. In this observational study, we measured the foot muscle cross-sectional area, ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, external flexion, isometric muscle strength, toe grasp strength, and superficial foot sensation of 15 adult lifesavers (12 males). The results showed that toe grasp strength and ankle plantar flexion isometric muscle strength are particularly important for the dynamic balance function of elite lifesavers working on sandy surfaces. Sand training improves intrinsic muscle training and dynamic balance function. However, high training intensity may cause a decrease in plantar surface sensation, which needs to be verified with sand training interventions in the future.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"094997511f6f09fc3238c7698fd3b411374ffbe60bf03fdaba14b972879685db","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
