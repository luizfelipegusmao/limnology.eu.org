{"title":"Efficacy and safety of concurrent immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and single-arm meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304941","date":1718200800000,"content":"<p>by Ran Cui, Yun Li, Xinlin Yu, Chun Wei, Ou Jiang</p>\r\nBackground <p>The recent usage of immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy has improved survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, determining the most effective therapy combination remains a topic of debate. Research suggests immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) post-chemoradiotherapy enhance survival, but the impact of concurrent ICIs during chemoradiotherapy on rapid disease progression is unclear. This meta-analysis aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of concurrent ICIs with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</p> Methods <p>We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for relevant studies, extracting data on overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs).</p> Results <p>The analysis included ten studies with 490 participants. Stage III NSCLC ORR was 81.8%, while Stage IV ORR was 39.9%. One-year PFS and OS for Stage III were 68.2% and 82.6%, compared to 27.9% and 72.2% for Stage IV. Common adverse events included anemia (46.6%), nausea (47.6%), rash (36.4%), and radiation pneumonitis (36.3%).</p> Conclusions <p>Our meta-analysis shows concurrent ICIs with chemoradiotherapy are effective and safe in advanced NSCLC, particularly in stage III patients at risk of progression before starting ICIs after chemoradiotherapy. The findings support further phase III trials. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023493685) and is detailed on the NIHR HTA programme website.</p>","author":"Ran Cui","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"6d81e475e0a8737383c92321cb4863b7062677a646bbbbd70cdccc86260403b3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
