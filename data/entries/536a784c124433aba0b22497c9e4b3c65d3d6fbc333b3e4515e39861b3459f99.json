{"title":"Systematic analysis of ocular features and responses of cultured spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor)","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13959?af=R","date":1720633956000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A better understanding of unique anatomical and functional features of the visual systems of teleost fish could provide key knowledge on how these systems influence the health and survival of these animals in both wild and culture environments. We took a systematic approach to assess some of the visual systems of spotted wolffish (<i>Anarhichas minor</i>), a species of increasing importance in North Atlantic aquaculture initiatives. The lumpfish (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>) was included in these studies in a comparative manner to provide reference. Histology, light and electron microscopy were used to study the spatial distribution and occurrence of cone photoreceptor cells and the nature of the retinal tissues, while immunohistochemistry was used to explore the expression patterns of two photoreceptor markers, XAP-1 and XAP-2, in both species. A marine bacterial infection paradigm in lumpfish was used to assess how hostâ€“pathogen responses might impact the expression of these photoreceptor markers in these animals. We define a basic photoreceptor mosaic and present an ultrastructural to macroscopic geographical configuration of the retinal pigment tissues in both animals. Photoreceptor markers XAP-1 and XAP-2 have novel distribution patterns in spotted wolffish and lumpfish retinas, and exogenous pathogenic influences can affect the normal expression pattern of XAP-1 in lumpfish. Live tank-side ophthalmoscopy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) revealed that normal cultured spotted wolffish display novel variations in the shape of the retinal tissue. These two complementary imaging findings suggest that spotted wolffish harbour unique ocular features not yet described in marine teleosts and that visual function might involve specific retinal tissue shape dynamics in these animals. Finally, extensive endogenous biofluorescence is present in the retinal tissues of both animals, which raises questions about how these animals might use retinal tissue in novel ways for visual perception and/or communication. This work advances fundamental knowledge on the visual systems of two economically important but now threatened North Atlantic teleosts and provides a basic foundation for further research on the visual systems of these animals in health versus disease settings. This work could also be useful for understanding and optimizing the health and welfare of lumpfish and spotted wolffish in aquaculture towards a one health or integrative perspective.</p>","author":"Lauren Murphy, \nRebecca Kwabiah, \nAyla Rouah, \nRyan Wade, \nThomas Osmond, \nDenise Tucker, \nDanny Boyce, \nJoseph Vance, \nTrung Cao, \nVimbai I.
