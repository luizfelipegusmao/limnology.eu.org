Zr oxidation can compromise the integrity of cladding by diminishing mechanical strength and ductility, thereby increasing the likelihood of failure and constraining operational lifespan. Oxidation induces stress redistribution and strain anisotropy in the metal substrate. Effective strain mapping techniques for oxidation reactions could benefit strain distribution/localization observation and further propel the elucidation of zirconium oxidation mechanisms, which currently lack consensus in the scientific community.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"a967ca3a95418603da92915b7f77f8b3ede2118299f4d8a637ab2548a242421d","category":"Environment"}
