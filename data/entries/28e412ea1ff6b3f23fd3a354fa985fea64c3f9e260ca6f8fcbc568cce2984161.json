{"title":"Modulation of cell differentiation and growth underlies the shift from bud protection to light capture in cauline leaves","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/1214/7728161?rss=1","date":1722902400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant organs have evolved into diverse shapes for specialized functions despite emerging as simple protrusions at the shoot apex. Cauline leaves serve as photosynthetic organs and protective structures for emerging floral buds. However, the growth patterns underlying this dual function remain unknown. Here, we investigate the developmental dynamics shaping Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>) cauline leaves underlying their functional diversification from other laminar organs. We show that cauline leaves display a significant delay in overall elongation compared with rosette leaves. Using live imaging, we reveal that their functional divergence hinges on early modulation of the timing of cell differentiation and cellular growth rates. In contrast to rosette leaves and sepals, cell differentiation is delayed in cauline leaves, fostering extended proliferation, prolonged morphogenetic activity, and growth redistribution within the organ. Notably, cauline leaf growth is transiently suppressed during the early stages, keeping the leaf small and unfolded during the initiation of the first flowers. Our findings highlight the unique developmental timing of cauline leaves, underlying their shift from an early protective role to a later photosynthetic function.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"28e412ea1ff6b3f23fd3a354fa985fea64c3f9e260ca6f8fcbc568cce2984161","category":"Environment"}
