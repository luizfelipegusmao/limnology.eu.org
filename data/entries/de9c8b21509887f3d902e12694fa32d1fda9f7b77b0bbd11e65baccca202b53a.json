{"title":"The RPT2aâ€“MET1 axis regulates TERMINAL FLOWER1 to control inflorescence meristem indeterminacy in Arabidopsis","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/5/1718/7289452?rss=1","date":1696464000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Plant inflorescence architecture is determined by inflorescence meristem (IM) activity and controlled by genetic mechanisms associated with environmental factors. In Arabidopsis (<span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span>), <span>TERMINAL FLOWER1</span> (<span>TFL1</span>) is expressed in the IM and is required to maintain indeterminate growth, whereas <span>LEAFY</span> (<span>LFY</span>) is expressed in the floral meristems (FMs) formed at the periphery of the IM and is required to activate determinate floral development. Here, we address how Arabidopsis indeterminate inflorescence growth is determined. We show that the 26S proteasome subunit REGULATORY PARTICLE AAA-ATPASE 2a (RPT2a) is required to maintain the indeterminate inflorescence architecture in Arabidopsis. <span>rpt2a</span> mutants display reduced <span>TFL1</span> expression levels and ectopic <span>LFY</span> expression in the IM and develop a determinate zigzag-shaped inflorescence. We further found that RPT2a promotes DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 degradation, leading to DNA hypomethylation upstream of <span>TFL1</span> and high <span>TFL1</span> expression levels in the wild-type IM. Overall, our work reveals that proteolytic input into the epigenetic regulation of <span>TFL1</span> expression directs inflorescence architecture in Arabidopsis, adding an additional layer to stem cell regulation.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"de9c8b21509887f3d902e12694fa32d1fda9f7b77b0bbd11e65baccca202b53a","category":"Environment"}
