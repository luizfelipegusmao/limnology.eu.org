{"title":"Classification Scheme for the Three-Points Dubins Problem","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0932/v1","date":1723551870000,"content":"This paper proposes an optimal path type classification scheme for the three-point Dubins problem. It allows to directly extract the shortest path type from a Dubins set, evaluating only the relative initial and final configurations with the via point position using a suitable partition of the Cartesian plane. Two alternative approaches are proposed to address the problem: an analytical approach and a heuristic one. The latter was revealed to be much faster from a computational point of view. The proposed classification logic makes the path planning for the three-point Dubins problem much more effective and suitable for real-time applications. Numerical examples are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed strategy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9f94ef56dbe6512ffebc386fea2bfcda9fe2956f35c4c80e2f8f0b0610af40b1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
