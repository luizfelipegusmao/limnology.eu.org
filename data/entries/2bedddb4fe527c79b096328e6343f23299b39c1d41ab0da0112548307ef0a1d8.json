{"title":"Student Confidence in Clinical Competence during Dental Education.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0555/v1","date":1712572345000,"content":"Background: Dental education blends theoretical and practical training to prepare students for independent patient care. This study examines the confidence levels of dental students in Ume√• regarding independent performance of general dentistry tasks, and whether this confidence changes after clinical training. \nMethods: Surveys were conducted before and after a summer clinical internship, with s\ttudents rating their comfort levels on a scale from 0 to 10 for various procedures. \nResults: Results from 64 initial surveys and 54 follow-up surveys showed no significant difference in confidence before and after the internship. However, confidence levels varied based on whether students had practiced specific tasks during the internship. Students felt least confident in managing acute dental trauma and treating cavities in young children, while they were most confident in tasks like obtaining radiographic surveys and debriding periodontally compromised dentition. Tooth extraction and dental fillings were the most practiced procedures during the internship. \nConclusions: The study concludes that the internship between the ninth and tenth semesters does not notably boost students' confidence in specific dental procedures, possibly due to the short duration of the training. Further exploration, including input from clinical supervisors, is suggested to optimize clinical training in dental education.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2bedddb4fe527c79b096328e6343f23299b39c1d41ab0da0112548307ef0a1d8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
