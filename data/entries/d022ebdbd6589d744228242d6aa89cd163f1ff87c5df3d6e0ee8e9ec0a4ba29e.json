{"title":"LUX ARRHYTHMO links CBF pathway and jasmonic acid metabolism to regulate cold tolerance of tea plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/2/961/7693637?rss=1","date":1718323200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Cold stress declines the quality and yield of tea, yet the molecular basis underlying cold tolerance of tea plants (<span>Camellia sinensis</span>) remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a circadian rhythm component LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) that potentially regulates cold tolerance of tea plants through a genome-wide association study and transcriptomic analysis. The expression of <span>CsLUX</span> phased with sunrise and sunset and was strongly induced by cold stress. Genetic assays indicated that CsLUX is a positive regulator of freezing tolerance in tea plants. <span>CsLUX</span> was directly activated by CsCBF1 and repressed the expression level of <span>CsLOX2</span>, which regulates the cold tolerance of tea plants through dynamically modulating jasmonic acid content. Furthermore, we showed that the CsLUXâ€“CsJAZ1 complex attenuated the physical interaction of CsJAZ1 with CsICE1, liberating CsICE1 with transcriptional activities to withstand cold stress. Notably, a single-nucleotide variation of C-to-A in the coding region of <span>CsLUX</span> was functionally validated as the potential elite haplotype for cold response, which provided valuable molecular markers for future cold resistance breeding in tea plants.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"d022ebdbd6589d744228242d6aa89cd163f1ff87c5df3d6e0ee8e9ec0a4ba29e","category":"Environment"}
