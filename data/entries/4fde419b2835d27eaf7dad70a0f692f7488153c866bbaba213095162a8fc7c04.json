{"title":"Examining Management and Employees’ Perceptions of Occupational Heat Exposure and the Effectiveness of a Heat Stress Prevention Intervention on Safety and Well-Being among Natural Gas Construction Workers: A Qualitative Field-Based Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1410/v1","date":1724137555000,"content":"Background: Numerous risk factors have been recognized as significant contributors to outdoor workers' heat stress and the risk of heat-related conditions, impacting their health, well-being, and productivity. However, the specific effects of these factors on construction workers' safety, health, and well-being remain under-researched. With climate change increasing temperatures, assessing heat stress among construction workers is imperative. Objective: To identify the barriers and facilitators influencing the safety of natural gas construction workers and evaluate an implemented heat stress intervention. Methods: In the summer of 2023, two semi-structured interviews and six focus groups were conducted with twenty-one stakeholders at a Texas natural gas construction site. Results: Key facilitators include employee preparedness, use of employer-provided resources, hydration logs, and real-time communication tools. Contrarily, the barriers include daily work schedules, access to dehydrating beverages, and generational differences with the non-implementation of mandatory rest breaks. The heat stress program was perceived as effective, surpassing recommended guidelines. Conclusion: To advance construction workers’ safety, health, and well-being, both employee involvement and employer management are needed, along with no-cost accessible resources. Additionally, implementing a required routine rest break and comprehensive heat stress education, particularly for older workers, will significantly promote safety and safe work practices in hot environments.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4fde419b2835d27eaf7dad70a0f692f7488153c866bbaba213095162a8fc7c04","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
