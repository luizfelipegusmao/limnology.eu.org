{"title":"Antioxidant Activity and UHPLC-MS/MS Characterization of Polyphenol and Nicotine Content of Nicotiana glauca Leaf Extracts: A Comparative Study of Conventional and Deep Eutectic Solvent Extraction Methods","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1288/v1","date":1718807502000,"content":"The leaves of Nicotiana glauca (Solanaceae) plant, are known for its major cause of health concern. This study investigated the antioxidant activity and polyphenols composition of aerial parts of N.glauca collected from its wild habitat in Jordan, using Methanol-Conventional (MC) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) extraction methods in addition to nicotine content determination using UHPLC. The results have shown that the MC extract contains fewer total phenols and flavonoid content than the DES extract at ratio of 90% (0.1194 ±0.009 and 0.311± 0.020 mg/mL equivalent to gallic acid) and (0.01084±0.005 and 0.928 ± 0.09 mg/mL equivalent to rutin), respectively.  Moreover, the study showed that the MC extract contains 635.07 ppm nicotine compared to the DES extraction method, which contains 1194.91 ppm. Both the MC and the DES extracts exhibited weak antioxidant activities with the highest was 33%inhibition equivalent to ascorbic acid was found for DES at (90%) ratio. The UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of variations in the detected compounds between the two extraction methods used. This study found that en-vironmentally friendly DES extraction of N. glauca produced higher phenol and flavonoid content than MC method, highlighting green chemistry methods' superior efficiency and environmental benefits for extracting valuable phytoconstituents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bc3ed868d4748fc1f4ff78e6c660838588c44073d5d4026a1cdcb21c15df7b8c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
