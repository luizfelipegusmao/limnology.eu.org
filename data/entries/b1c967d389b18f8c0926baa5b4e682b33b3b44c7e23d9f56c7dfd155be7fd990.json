{"title":"Variance in multi-blade induced lightning overvoltages among different wind farm topologies","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308449","date":1725544800000,"content":"<p>by Fady Wadie, Ali Saeed Almuflih, Z.

However, this topic is highly important to be investigated to allow the usage of the most reliable topology against lightning strikes. For such reason, the paper investigates this point with consideration of most damaging cases as lightning strikes to multi-blades. The testing used ATP software for four main topologies, radial, single-sided ring SSR, double sided ring and star topology. The features defining the similarities in response and the variance range between these topologies were recorded and analyzed. The multi-blade strikes gave an expected increase of 15% to 100% in the injected overvoltage to the grid for all topologies. The star topology showed the most reliable performance by allowing the least injected overvoltage to the grid. The percentage of reduction in the magnitude of the injected overvoltages reached 50.78%, 66.07% and 89.04% for SSR, DSR and star topology respectively with respect to radial topology. Recommendation was provided for design engineers to consider star topology during design phase in terms of more reliable lightning protection.","author":"Fady Wadie","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"b1c967d389b18f8c0926baa5b4e682b33b3b44c7e23d9f56c7dfd155be7fd990","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
