{"title":"The faecal microbiome of the Pacific banana slug, Ariolimax columbianus, displays seasonal variation","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/doi/10.1093/mollus/eyae007/7642599?rss=1","date":1712620800000,"content":"<span><div>ABSTRACT</div>The Pacific banana slug, <span>Ariolimax columbianus</span>, is the largest land mollusc in North America and occurs in forests ranging from northwestern California to Alaska. We explored the microbial community found within the faeces of 24 slugs from the Oregon Coast Range. Twenty-four slugs were collected in 2019, 12 in the spring and 12 in the fall. These two time points were selected to investigate the composition of microbial populations in wild-caught slugs, also in response to seasonal changes in available plants as food sources. Results from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing indicate that the most prevalent phyla detected from <span>A. columbianus</span> were Proteobacteria (66%) and Bacteriodetes (16%), similar to previous observations from six other species/genera of terrestrial gastropods (Stylommatophora). The most abundant operational taxonomic units across all specimens were <span>Enterobacter</span> sp., <span>Pseudomonas</span> sp. and <span>Flavobacterium</span> sp. Significant seasonal variation was observed for several species of Flavobacteriales, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, with the majority showing higher abundance in fall. In contrast to <span>Cornu aspersum</span> (previously <span>Helix aspersa</span>, parapatric with <span>A. columbianus</span>) and <span>Geomaculus maculosus, A. columbianus</span> harbours very low levels of <span>Buttiauxella</span> (0.35%). These findings raise questions about the origin, specificity and selection of specific bacteria as components of the intestinal microbiome of terrestrial gastropods.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Molluscan Studies Current Issue","siteHash":"50e5bd74f9c9bc6ffdefd16d0eef1528d858cc544080b551025ae62157896b1d","entryHash":"cd5689ec731d12b63a994191d22ee0f2fe92881115a7198e64585dbafe0a303e","category":"Environment"}
