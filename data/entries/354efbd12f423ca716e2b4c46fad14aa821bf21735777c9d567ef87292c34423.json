{"title":"Impact of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields on Skeletal Muscle of Sedentary Adult Mice: A Pilot Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0378/v1","date":1722918053000,"content":"Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) are ubiquitous in industrial-11 ized environments due to the continuous use of electrical devices. Our previous studies demon-12 strated ELF-EMF affects muscle cells by modulating oxidative stress and enhancing myo-genesis. 13 This pilot study investigated these effects on skeletal muscles of sedentary adult mice, assessing 14 physiological responses to ELF-EMF exposure and potential modulation by antioxidant supplemen-15 tation. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ELF-EMF (0.1 or 1.0 mT) 1 hour/day up to 5 weeks, and 16 fed a standard diet without or with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Results showed transient increases in 17 muscle strength (after 2-weeksâ€™ exposure at 1.0 mT), potentially linked to muscle fiber recruitment 18 and activation, revealed by higher PAX7 and MyH expression levels. After ELF-EMF exposure, ox-19 idative status assessment revealed transient increases in expression levels of SOD1 and catalase en-20 zymes, in total antioxidant capacity and in protein carbonyl levels, marker of oxidative damage. 21 These effects were partially reduced by NAC. In conclusion, ELF-EMF exposure affects skeletal 22 muscle physiology and NAC supplementation partially mitigates these effects, highlighting the 23 complex interactions between ELF-EMF and antioxidant pathways in vivo. Further investigations 24 on ELF-EMF as a therapeutic modality for muscle health are necessary.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"354efbd12f423ca716e2b4c46fad14aa821bf21735777c9d567ef87292c34423","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
