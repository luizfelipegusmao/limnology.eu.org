{"title":"Development of an HPLC Method through the QbD Approach for the Quantification of Honokiol and Metformin Hydrochloride – Method Validation and Pharmaceutical Applications on Oral Dosage Forms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0542/v1","date":1720498084000,"content":"For quantitative determination of honokiol (HNK) and metformin hydrochloride (M-HCl) by HPLC from formulations and from dissolution studies, a QbD approach using three factors - three levels design was implemented to optimize the chromatographic conditions. To study the impact of each variable on the peak area of both compounds and retention time of last compound eluted, the 3D response surface plots were developed. HNK and M-HCl were separated on a Thermoscientific ODS Hypersyl TM (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column mantained at 30 C, using 0.02 M acetate buffer (pH = 3) / methanol (15 / 85, v / v) as mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injected volume was 20 L, and the detection wavelengths were 256 nm for HNK and 236 nm for M-HCl. The validation of proposed method showed a linearity range of 4 – 1200 μg/mL for M-HCl (r2 = 0.9992) and 1 – 300 μg/mL for HNK (r2 = 0.9998), good precision (RSD &amp;lt; 2% for both HNK and M-HCl, in intra- and inter-day studies) and accuracy (mean recovery = 100.09% in the range 99.80 – 100.43% for M-HCl and mean recovery = 100.12% in the range 99.70 – 100.38% for HNK). The environmentally friendly nature of the method was confirmed by the evaluation of the method’s greenness. The proposed method was applied for the determination of HNK and M-HCl from oral dosage forms and in dissolution studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"978d121e1b2a105f75a341495fefb99ca69ac3696365136fb6bd87548ed1359e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
