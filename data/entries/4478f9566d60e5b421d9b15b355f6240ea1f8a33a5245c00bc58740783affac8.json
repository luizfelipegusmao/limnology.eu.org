{"title":"Combustion Characteristics, Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Peanut Shell for Its Bioenergy Valorization","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1576/v1","date":1713940128000,"content":"To realize the utilization of peanut shell, this study investigates the combustion behavior, chemical kinetics, and thermodynamic parameters of peanut shell using TGA under atmospheric air. Results indicate that increasing the heating rate leads to higher ignition, burnout, and peak temperatures, as observed in the TG/DTG curves shifting to the right. Analysis of combustion performance parameters suggest that higher heating rates can enhance combustion performances. Kinetic analysis using two model-free methods, KAS and FWO, shows that the activation energy (Eα) ranges from 93.30 to 109.65 kJ/mol for FWO and 89.72 to 103.88 kJ/mol for KAS. The data fit well with coefficient of determination values (R2) close to 1. Pre-exponential factors using FWO range from 2.19×106 to 8.06×107 s–1, and for KAS range from9.72×105 to 2.25×107 s–1. Thermodynamic analysis indicates a low-energy barrier (≤ ±6 kJ/mol) between activation energy and enthalpy changes, suggesting easy reaction initiation. Furthermore, variations in enthalpy (ΔH), Gibbs free energy (ΔG), and entropy (ΔS) upon conversion (α) suggest that peanut shell combustion is endothermic and non-spontaneous, with the generation of more homogeneous or well-ordered products as combustion progresses. These findings offer a theoretical basis and data support for the further utilization of agricultural biomass.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4478f9566d60e5b421d9b15b355f6240ea1f8a33a5245c00bc58740783affac8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
