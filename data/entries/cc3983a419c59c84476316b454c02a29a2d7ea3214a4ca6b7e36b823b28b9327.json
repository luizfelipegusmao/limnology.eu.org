{"title":"MedTech start-ups: A comprehensive scoping review of current research trends and future directions","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307959","date":1722952800000,"content":"<p>by Olga Kalinowska-Beszczyńska, Katarzyna Prędkiewicz</p>\r\n\r\nMedical start-ups (MedTech) significantly contribute to the development and commercialization of innovative healthcare solutions, driving advancements in technology, enhancing treatment effectiveness, and supporting public health. This study explores the main themes and concepts related to MedTech start-ups, examines the research methods used, and identifies major gaps in the literature. A scoping literature review was performed by searching the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for publications from 2012 to 2023, focusing on MedTech start-ups in titles, abstracts, and keywords. References were analyzed using the Bibliometrix package in R, and a coupling network analysis was conducted, visualizing results on a Coupling Map to identify key research themes and gaps. The research identified 480 unique articles on MedTech start-ups. After removing duplicates and following a PRISMA-based assessment, 79 articles were included in the review. The studies predominantly focused on organizations, including start-ups and Venture Capital funds (46%). Most articles (60%) used qualitative methods, 25% employed mixed methods, and 15% used quantitative methods. Geographically, 63% of articles focused on a single country, primarily the USA (35%), followed by Iran, Sweden, Switzerland, China, and Japan (2–4% each). Coupling analysis identified five topic clusters: crowdfunding for medical research, innovation in medical technology, new product development, digital start-ups, and the venture capital industry. This review highlights the significant role of MedTech start-ups in advancing healthcare innovations despite challenges like regulatory hurdles and high capital requirements. The literature emphasizes the importance of collaboration among universities, industry, and government for successful commercialization. The geographic concentration in the USA indicates a need for more inclusive research. Crowdfunding and venture capital emerge as crucial funding sources, suggesting strategies to mitigate risks and enhance innovation success.","author":"Olga Kalinowska-Beszczyńska","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"cc3983a419c59c84476316b454c02a29a2d7ea3214a4ca6b7e36b823b28b9327","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
