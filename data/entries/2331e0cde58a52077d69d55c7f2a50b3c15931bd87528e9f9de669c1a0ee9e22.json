{"title":"The Relationship Between Oxidative Stress and Infertility due to Antihypertensive Drugs in Rattus Norvegicus","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1890/v1","date":1729739961000,"content":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of these drugs on reproductive function in Rattus norvegicuss and to show the role of oxidative stress in possible reproductive dysfunction. Rattus norvegicuss were selected as experimental animals and were divided into healthy (control group), Clonidine (CL), Rilmenidine (RLD), Methyldopa (MTL), Amlodipine (ALD) and Ramipril (RML) groups. Using blood obtained from rattus norvegicuss, serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; The high-temperature thiobarbituric acid. Was based on the spectrophotometric measurement of the adsorption of the pink colored complex formed by MDA at a wavelength of 532 nm. Total glutathione (tGSH) levels were determined by spectrophotometer.According to the study, the increase in MDA levels was not statistically significant in CL and RLD groups when compared with the control group. MDA was significantly increased in methyldopa, amlodipine and Ramipril groups. While total glutathione levels were only close to the control group in the CL group; RLD, MTL, ALD and RML groups showed statistically significant decrease. While CL and RLD did not cause infertility, infertility was observed in the groups treated with MTL-ALD-RML. Thus, it was found that MTL, ALD and RML, antihypertensive drugs, which were the aim of the study, had different effects on infertility and it was found that the use of such drugs decreased fertility due to increasing oxidative stress and decreasing antioxidant levels.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2331e0cde58a52077d69d55c7f2a50b3c15931bd87528e9f9de669c1a0ee9e22","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
