We introduce the combination of application program interface (API) with large language models (LLMs) to address these limitations [<a href=\"#ozae044.160-B1\">1</a>]. We use AEcroscoPy [<a href=\"#ozae044.160-B2\">2</a>]—a cross platform Python application program interface (API) for automating microscopy experiments with enhanced efficiency, scope, effectiveness, and reproducibility of experiments—to demonstrate the synergy of human expertise, AI efficiency, and API automation for accelerating scientific discovery.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"d3d3aae77e864ce85ccf50f1ee468b47915fd56eb4d00c0db69b4ec21b832303","category":"Environment"}
