{"title":"Robot-assisted Augmented Reality (AR)-guided Surgical Navigation for Periacetabular Osteotomy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0576/v1","date":1718020224000,"content":"Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is an effective approach for surgical treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). However, due to the complex anatomical structure around the hip and limited field of view (FoV) during the surgery, it is challenging for surgeons to perform a PAO surgery. To solve this challenge, we propose a robot-assisted augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation system for PAO. The system mainly consists of a robot arm, an optical tracker, and a Microsoft HoloLens 2 which is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD). For AR guidance, we propose an optical marker-based virtual-physical registration method to estimate a transformation from the optical tracker coordinate system (COS) to the virtual space COS, such that virtual models can be superimposed on the corresponding physical counterparts. Furthermore, to guide the osteotomy, the developed system automatically aligns the bone saw with osteotomy planes planned in preoperative images, and then provides surgeons with not only robot assistance but also AR guidance. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to evaluate both virtual-physical registration accuracy and osteotomy accuracy of the developed navigation system. The proposed virtual-physical registration method achieved an average mean absolute distance error (mADE) of 1.96 ± 0.43 mm. The developed system achieved an average distance deviation of 0.82 ± 0.17 mm and an average angular deviation of 3.77 ± 0.85 . Experimental results demonstrated high virtual-physical registration accuracy. The sub-millimeter distance deviation demonstrated the osteotomy accuracy of the proposed system.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3dcc1dcf931c705b21d57db2e7c5796bcae743198cfbad9076c6f3eae45dc162","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
