{"title":"Global Exponential Stability of Impulsive Delayed Neural Networks with Parameter Uncertainties and Reaction-Diffusion Terms","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0539/v1","date":1720178481000,"content":"In this paper we study a class of impulsive delayed neural networks with parameter uncertainties and reaction-diffusion terms. Using the properties of M-matrices and some inequality techniques, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the global exponential stability of the given system. The results obtained are presented by simple algebraic inequalities, which are certainly more concise than previous methods. Finally, the validity and usefulness of our results are illustrated by arithmetic examples.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ec7c84949ed900204347b85023ccce18e9f9d364134fe9fe3e330f4cb36eac3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
