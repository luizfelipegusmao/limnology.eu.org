{"title":"Indirect Detection of Degradation-Resistant Compounds on Groundwaters Forward-facing to Current Consumerism and Climate Change","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1199/v1","date":1729009072000,"content":"To address the complex challenges posed by climate change and its effects on surface environments, subsoil, and groundwater, evaluating the impacts of Degradation-Resistant Organic Compounds (DROCs), such as fats and oils, is crucial. Increasing variability in temperature and precipitation has exacerbated DROC dispersal, particularly near open dumps and poorly managed landfills. As a global pollution issue, DROC’s pervasive and persistent nature requires urgent attention. This study aims to develop and implement effective strategies to detect and describe the stages of DROC decomposition. Identifying sites where DROCs are trapped and their dispersion can facilitate planning remediation efforts and mitigating adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. The study focuses on evaluating DROCs’ annual spatiotemporal distribution, improving waste management practices, monitoring the subsoil, and implementing remediation strategies. DROCs persist through various stages in groundwater, making effective detection methodologies essential. Continuous monitoring, subsoil characterization, and diverse climatic observations are necessary, especially in areas with improper landfill selection. Poor waste management contributes significantly to DROC pollution, exacerbated by current consumerism and increasing waste. The research highlights the importance of improving waste management practices and judiciously selecting landfill sites to prevent further degradation. Apparent resistivity variations in the subsoil, linked to DROC dispersal, are analyzed to map affected areas and understand propagation under different environmental conditions. New tools and methodologies aim to enhance DROC monitoring and remediation strategies. Adopting sustainable waste management practices and carefully selecting disposal sites is essential to mitigating DROC’s impacts, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and protecting environmental and public health. Addressing risks associated with excessive consumption, inadequate waste management, and poor landfill selection is crucial for restoring ecosystem resilience and environmental protection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8bc819cabf03a01d6b909e93e4e3133118d38c12c48de2b7b6cd483db27fd5f6","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
