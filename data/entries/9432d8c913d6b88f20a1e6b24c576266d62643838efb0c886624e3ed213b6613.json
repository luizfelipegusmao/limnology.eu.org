{"title":"Insight into Romanian Wild-Grown Heracleum sphondylium: Development of a New Phytocarrier Based on Silver Nanoparticles with Antioxidant, Antimicrobial and Cytotoxicity Potential","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1706/v1","date":1724717533000,"content":"Background: Heracleum sphondylium, a medicinal plant used in Romanian ethnopharmacology, proved to have a remarkable biological activity. The escalating concerns surrounding antimicrobial resistance led to a special attention to new efficient antimicrobial agents based on medicinal plants and nanotechnology. We report the preparation of a novel, simple phytocarrier that harnesses the bioactive properties of H. sphondylium and silver nanoparticles (HS-Ag system). Methods: The H. sphondylium low-metabolic profile was determined through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization–quadrupole time-of-flight–mass spectrometry. The morphostructural properties of the innovative phytocarrier were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using total phenolic content, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro assays. The antimicrobial activity screening against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli was conducted using the agar well diffusion method. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay estimated the in vitro potential cytotoxicity on normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. Results: A total of 88 biomolecules were detected, such as terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, iridoids, amino acids, phytosterols, fatty acids. HS-Ag phytocarrier heightened efficacy in suppressing the growth of all tested bacterial strains compared to H. sphondylium and exhibited a significant inhibition of HeLa cell viability. Conclusions: The new HS-Ag phytocarrier system holds promise for a wide range of medical applications. The data confirms the capacity to augment pertinent theoretical understanding in the innovative field of antimicrobial agents.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9432d8c913d6b88f20a1e6b24c576266d62643838efb0c886624e3ed213b6613","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
