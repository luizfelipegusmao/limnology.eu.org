{"title":"The Role and Impact of Myelination in the Adult Brain: Cognitive Functions, Neurological Health, Brain Efficiency, and Comparisons to Deep Learning Perceptrons","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0317/v1","date":1722918701000,"content":"Myelination, the process of forming a myelin sheath around nerve fibers, is critical not only during early development but also throughout adulthood. This article explores the multifaceted impacts of myelination on the adult brain, highlighting its importance in cognitive functions, neurological health, and overall brain efficiency. In adults, efficient myelination enhances information processing speed, supports memory consolidation, and contributes to cognitive reserve, potentially delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Myelination ensures synchronized neural activity and energy-efficient brain function, playing a key role in complex cognitive tasks and coordination. Despite a slower rate of plasticity compared to early development, the adult brain retains the ability to adapt and learn, with myelination facilitating these processes. This article also draws parallels between myelination in the brain and learning curves in deep learning Perceptrons, emphasizing how reduced stimulation and experience can significantly slow down cognitive and learning processes. Additionally, the clinical implications of myelination are discussed, including its role in multiple sclerosis and age-related cognitive decline, along with strategies to maintain and enhance myelin health through lifestyle choices and emerging pharmacological interventions. Understanding the ongoing significance of myelination in the adult brain, and its comparison to artificial neural networks, is crucial for developing interventions to support cognitive health and mitigate neurological disorders.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"67c2d25f573470fc002e915645f18d93d45fcd0c8392d12ce48adaaaed55ab72","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
