{"title":"Experimental nerve block study on painful withdrawal reflex responses in humans","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309048","date":1723816800000,"content":"<p>by Oumie Thorell, David Mahns, Jan Otto, Jaquette Liljencrantz, Mats Svantesson, Håkan Olausson, Saad Nagi</p>\r\n\r\nThe nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) is a protective limb withdrawal response triggered by painful stimuli, used to assess spinal nociceptive excitability. Conventionally, the NWR is understood as having two reflex responses: a short-latency Aβ-mediated response, considered tactile, and a longer-latency Aδ-mediated response, considered nociceptive. However, nociceptors with conduction velocities similar to Aβ tactile afferents have been identified in human skin. In this study, we investigated the effect of a preferential conduction block of Aβ fibers on pain perception and NWR signaling evoked by intradermal electrical stimulation in healthy participants. We recorded a total of 198 NWR responses in the intact condition, and no dual reflex responses occurred within our latency bandwidth (50–150 ms). The current required to elicit the NWR was higher than the perceptual pain threshold, indicating that NWR did not occur before pain was felt. In the block condition, when the Aβ-mediated tuning fork sensation was lost while Aδ-mediated nonpainful cooling was still detectable (albeit reduced), we observed that the reflex was abolished. Further, short-latency electrical pain intensity at pre-block thresholds was greatly reduced, with any residual pain sensation having a longer latency. Although electrical pain was unaffected at suprathreshold current, the reflex could not be evoked despite a two-fold increase in the pre-block current and a five-fold increase in the pre-block pulse duration. These observations lend support to the possible involvement of Aβ-fiber inputs in pain and reflex signaling.","author":"Oumie Thorell","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"792191395318bcc6a6bf40a83232cb71b0d6a3feec1ad49e337a7899a52bff88","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
