Long et al. (2024) used historical (1989–1994) and contemporary (2017–2020) samples to quantify the stability of a Panamanian hybrid zone between golden-collared manakins (<span>Manacus vitellinus</span>) and white-collared manakins (<span>M. candei</span>). Their analyses revealed a spatially stable hybrid zone, except for one trait, belly plumage coloration, which has introgressed into the distribution of the white-collared manakin. This finding suggests possible sexual selection for this trait.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Evolution Current Issue","siteHash":"a2040112c8b98efe6d76767c53ee42b7ea8ce26086ad99269623cfcce66a3405","entryHash":"ee8121389372f45d8d8b68330d0f3e961337475d8f38ad2b28a9841a3f358fef","category":"Environment"}
