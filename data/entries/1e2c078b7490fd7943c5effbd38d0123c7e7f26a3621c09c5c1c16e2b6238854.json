{"title":"Prevalence of Malocclusions Among Schoolchildren from Southwestern Romania","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0322/v2","date":1710310074000,"content":"Malocclusions have a continuously increasing prevalence from a generation to another as a result of climate changes, soil, atmosphere and water pollution. All of these aspects have unfavorable consequences on the nutritional scheme. Thus, nutrition together with other etiopathogenic factors contribute to complex alterations in the somatic development of the entire organism and, implicitly, of the cephalic extremity. The study included 4147 children from randomly selected schools from Vâlcea County, Romania. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of malocclusions in schoolchildren from Vâlcea County, Romania, according to the three main classes of malocclusions (according to Angle’s classification), age groups (from 6 to 10 years old and from 11 to 14 years old), gender (male and female) and place of origin (rural and urban). It is also aimed to compare the results obtained with similar ones from the specialized literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e2c078b7490fd7943c5effbd38d0123c7e7f26a3621c09c5c1c16e2b6238854","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
