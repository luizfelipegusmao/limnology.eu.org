{"title":"Insights from Clinical Trials: Evidence-Based Recommendations for Induction Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Transplant-Eligible Multiple Myeloma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0994/v1","date":1723612397000,"content":"Multiple Myeloma (MM), is a hematological malignancy and poses significant therapeutic challenges. This review synthesizes evidence from pivotal clinical trials to guide induction treatment for transplant-eligible (TE), newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients. Emphasizing the evolution from three-drug to four-drug induction therapies, we highlight the integration of monoclonal antibodies, particularly CD38 recombinant monoclonal antibody agents, into treatment regimens. Our analysis includes a comprehensive literature review of research from major databases and conferences conducted between 2010 and 2024, culminating in the detailed evaluation of 47 studies. \nThe findings underscore the superiority of quadruple regimens in TE NDMM, notably those incorporating daratumumab, in achieving superior responses including progression-free survival (PFS), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, overall response rate (ORR), and overall survival (OS) when compared to triple-drug regimens. As treatment regimens evolve with additional agents, the improved outcomes with treatment-related adverse events should be carefully balanced.  This review advocates for a paradigm shift towards quadruple induction therapies for TE NDMM, offers a detailed insight into the current landscape of MM treatment, and reinforces a new standard of care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6ff2ca959fbdee6afcaa86c7374a6e2d335a6bd18b5b09828ae2bf1b28006195","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
