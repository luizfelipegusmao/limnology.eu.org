{"title":"Sensory Mechanisms of Parent-Offspring Recognition in Fishes, Amphibians, and Reptiles","link":"https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/6/1168/7230366?rss=1","date":1690156800000,"content":"<span><div>Synopsis</div>Parental care is important for offspring survival and success. Recognition of offspring by parents is critical to ensure parents direct care behaviors at related offspring and minimize energy lost by caring for unrelated young. Offspring recognition of parents prevents possible aggressive interactions between young and unrelated adults and allows offspring to direct begging behaviors toward the correct adult. Despite its importance and widespread nature, much of the current research has focused on a small range of species, particularly mammals and birds. We review the existing literature on the sensory mechanisms of parent-offspring recognition in fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. Within these groups, there is diversity in the presence and strategies for parent-offspring recognition. Future studies should continue to identify these mechanisms, as well as the neural and endocrine underpinnings in non-model organisms to expand our knowledge of this behavior and inform our understanding of the evolution of parent-offspring recognition.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Integrative and Comparative Biology Current Issue","siteHash":"715dd1b0fb4f45600bceadb227e9b7fdf8bd9d1d7a2fd3d5e0399d2c1f410646","entryHash":"394ceeb49c217ec63ed8e5c50e539343762c32d8a0d6745bc8d94810dd4b6b20","category":"Environment"}
