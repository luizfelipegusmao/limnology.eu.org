{"title":"Leveraging Chatbots for Effective Educational Administration: A Systematic Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0238/v1","date":1728264450000,"content":"Educational institutions are increasingly utilizing chatbots to enhance communication and streamline administrative tasks, including answering frequently asked questions (FAQs). Serving as the first review about employing chatbots in educational administration, this systematic review explores the potential of chatbots to improve educational administration. While research on chatbots in education has primarily focused on their role in learning, their application for administrative tasks remains underexplored. This gap necessitates a systematic investigation of how chatbots are utilized and implemented to streamline administrative processes. Following the PRISMA framework, this review analyzes 54 studies to address five key areas: functionalities performed, data employed, technologies used, evaluation methods, and future development challenges. The review reveals a critical need for a comprehensive framework for developing administrative chatbots that are specifically tailored to educational institutions. This review underscores the importance of such a framework in addressing identified gaps in the literature and in incorporating generative AI into educational administrative tasks management. The review also highlights a noticeable lack of research in this domain, including the potential of generative AI, like ChatGPT, to improve administrative efficiency. Furthermore, the study discusses the potential impact, practical applications of administrative chatbots in education and future research directions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"53a86234abb217d7ff4dce077a62b481be54ce65d9d6bd5c761349fb0e7264de","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
