{"title":"A Socio-Spatial Turning: New Dynamics in Philosophy of Education with Chinese Characteristics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0447/v1","date":1722942304000,"content":"Every country has a different philosophy of education, which in contemporary China manifests itself in ideological guidance at all levels and in all types of schools. China's education has entered a new era, but ideological and political education is still needed in schools and colleges, and its core interest is to cultivate newcomers of the times who can take on the important task of national rejuvenation; in other words, the education sector has to ensure the sustainability of the cultivation of talents as well as the sustainability of socialist development. In this context, ideological and political education has initiated a triple spatial shift, i.e., from classroom space to cyberspace, from physical space to virtual space, and from campus space to social space. The triple spatial transfer has a profound historical logic, which is the inevitable process of the continuous development of ideological and political education itself, and the historical convergence of the Party's proposition, people's expectation and social development in this era. The requirements of the external situation, the needs of internal development, and the needs of the political task constitute the direct reality of the triple spatial transformation. The future direction of the spatial transformation of ideological and political education will be reflected in the intersection of subject and space, the collision of individuality and commonality, and the fusion of unity and diversity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7b09d591af22bde4a1d646d695c28b959a15e5b87e0160fcc1e63320a724854e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
