{"title":"A Situation Analysis of the Capacity of Laboratories in Zambia to Conduct Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1822/v1","date":1716883190000,"content":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health problem exacerbated by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics and an inadequate capacity of laboratories to conduct AMR surveillance. This study assessed the capacity of laboratories in seven faith-based hospitals to conduct bacteriology, AMR testing and surveillance in Zambia. This multi-facility, cross-sectional exploratory study was conducted from February 2024 to April 2024. We collected and analysed data using the self-scoring Laboratory Assessment of Antibiotic Resistance Testing Capacity (LAARC) tool. This study found an overall score of 39%, indicating a low capacity of laboratories to conduct AMR surveillance. The highest capacity score was 47%, while the lowest was 25%. Only one hospital had full capacity (100%) to utilise a Laboratory Information System (LIS). Three hospitals had good capacity to perform data management with scores of 83%, 85%, and 95%. Only one hospital had full capacity (100%) to process specimens, and only one hospital had good safety requirements for a microbiology laboratory, with a score of 89%. This study demonstrates that all the assessed hospitals have a low capacity to conduct AMR surveillance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to strengthen the microbiology capacity of laboratories to enhance surveillance in faith-based hospitals in Zambia.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e09af596ba9ccf83748565dd990698addb30f591111f65d4e5143037fb01b1a4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
