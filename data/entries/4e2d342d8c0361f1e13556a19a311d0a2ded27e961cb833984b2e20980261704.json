{"title":"High-Resolution Iodine-enhanced Micro-Computed Tomography of Intact Human Hearts for Detailed Coronary Microvasculature Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0282/v1","date":1717664280000,"content":"Current Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) protocols for microvasculature analysis often necessitate organ dissection and non-clearable contrast agents. We describe a non-destructive technique for achieving high-resolution images of the human coronary microvasculature.\nFormalin-fixed human hearts were cannulated using venogram catheters designed for balloon occlusion. Catheters were anchored at the aortic root. Hearts were placed in sealable, radiolucent containers filled with insulating polyurethane foam. Iodine potassium iodide (IKI, Lugol's solution;6.3% Potassium Iodide, 4.1% Iodide) was injected into the coronary arteries. Contrast distribution was monitored using a North Star Imaging X3000 Micro-CT scanner with low-radiation settings, followed by high-radiation scans (3600 rad, 60 kV, 900 mA).\nWe successfully imaged two intact human hearts with chronic total coronary occlusions of the right coronary artery. The scans enabled detailed analysis of the vasa vasorum surrounding stenosed and occluded segments. After imaging, both hearts were cleared of iodine and excess polyurethane foam and then returned to their initial formalin-fixed state for indefinite storage.\nConclusions:\nThis method allows for the non-destructive, high-resolution micro-CT imaging of coronary microvasculature in intact human hearts, paving the way for 3D microvascular reconstruction in a macrovascular context.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4e2d342d8c0361f1e13556a19a311d0a2ded27e961cb833984b2e20980261704","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
