{"title":"The application of the analysis framework for compound extreme event dependencies in China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.93?af=R","date":1722310793000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The escalation of compound extreme events has resulted in noteworthy economic and property losses. Recognizing the intricate interconnections among these events has become imperative. To tackle this challenge, we have formulated a comprehensive framework for the systematic analysis of their dependencies. This framework consists of three steps. (1) Define extreme events using Mahalanobis distance thresholds. (2) Represent dependencies among multiple extreme events through a point process-based method. (3) Verify dependencies with residual tail coefficients, determining the final dependency structure. Applying this framework to assess the extreme dependence of precipitation on wind speed and temperature in China, revealed four distinct dependency structures. In northern, Jianghuai, and southern China, precipitation heavily relies on wind speed, while temperatures maintain relative independence. In northeastern and northwestern China, precipitation exhibits relative independence, yet a notable dependence exists between temperatures and wind speed. In southwestern China, precipitation strongly depends on temperature, while wind speed remains relatively independent. The Qinghaiâ€“Tibet Plateau region displays a significant dependence relationship among precipitation, wind speed, and temperature, with weaker dependence between extreme wind speed and temperature. This framework is instrumental for analyzing dependencies among extreme values in compound events.</p>","author":"Haokun Wei, \nXichao Gao, \nJie Feng, \nZhiyong Yang","siteTitle":"Wiley: River: Table of Contents","siteHash":"0b74d58d2572beb2996093d38ec1aeffad4d7646e8152f056f56cbe7cdd98b36","entryHash":"be19a04e6b77824a5176956bca4dac15ffc27327ab1f78ed0bc337d38bd7ecc6","category":"Environment"}
