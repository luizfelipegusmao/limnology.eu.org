Nevertheless, the effect of distance on metacommunity structure remains little studied. We examine how plant-pollinator community structure changes across geographical distances at a regional scale and disentangle its underlying local and regional processes.\n\nWe use a multilayer network to represent linked plant-pollinator communities as a metacommunity in the Canary Islands. We used modularity (i.e. the extent to which the community is partitioned into groups of densely interacting species) to quantify distance decay in structure across space. In multilayer modularity, the same species can belong to different modules in different communities, and modules can span communities. This enabled quantifying how similarity in module composition varied with distance between islands. We developed three null models, each controlling for a separate component of the multilayer network, to disentangle the role of species turnover, interaction rewiring and local factors in driving distance decay in structure.\n\nWe found a pattern of distance decay in structure, indicating that islands tended to share fewer modules with increasing distance. Species turnover (but not interaction rewiring) was the primary regional process triggering distance decay in structure. Local interaction structure also played an essential role in determining the structure similarity of communities at a regional scale. Therefore, local factors that determine species interactions occurring at a local scale drive distance decay in structure at a regional scale.\n\nOur work highlights the interplay between local and regional processes underlying community structure. The methodology, and specifically the null models, we developed provides a general framework for linking communities in space and testing different hypotheses regarding the factors generating spatial structure.\n</p>","author":"Agustin Vitali, \nMaya Goldstein, \nMatan Markfeld, \nShai Pilosof","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Animal Ecology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"f972b3d77fac21002287eba655b32ce98ce44eaf7af59ef5bf44597986b2c27f","entryHash":"75c2b9238f890eefaa7196a8077b2fa387fe0f73d2d36e1744c12b30f90afb59","category":"Environment"}
