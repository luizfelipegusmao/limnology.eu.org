{"title":"Myval Transcatheter Heart Valve: The Future of Transcatheter Valve Replacement and Significance in Current Timeline","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0199/v1","date":1727873349000,"content":"The Myval is a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) devel-oped by Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd. that has innovative operator-friendly de-sign which aids to improve deliverability and features precise deployment. Vari-ous clinical studies demonstrate its effectiveness and safety, making it a promis-ing choice in valvular interventions. Myval has been successfully utilized as a transcatheter aortic valve implanta-tion (TAVI) device in cases with conduction disturbances, bicuspid aortic valve anatomy, non-calcified aortic regurgitation, dysfunctional stenosed right ventric-ular outflow tract (RVOT) conduits, pulmonary valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, Vave-in-valve and Valve-in-ring implantation procedures. Myvalâ€™s diverse sizes are also of key importance in complex cases of large and complex annuli anatomy. Further long-term studies are needed to consolidate these results. \nIts introduction signifies a significant advancement in cardiology, aiming to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life. In the present review, we provide an update on new-generation Myval THVs and review the available clinical data published till date with an emphasis on diverse use in specific clinical scenarios.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9813550aea77d97d333d7f0ebe31d0a641f114e93fa27ef90b144e8eef4e7ca7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
