Previous studies have yielded mixed results regarding the plantsâ€™ adaptive mechanisms for thriving in new environments, and particularly, little is known about how the phenotypic plasticity of growth and defense-related traits may facilitate plant invasion. This study addressed these uncertainties by employing the aggressive weed <span>Reynoutria japonica</span> as a study model. We examined the differences in growth, defense-related traits and biomass allocation between <span>R. japonica</span> populations from native and introduced ranges grown in two common gardens with distinct climate conditions. Our results demonstrated that while the introduced populations did not exhibit increases in height and total dry mass, nor reductions in leaf defense levels, their investment in leaf production was significantly higher compared to the native populations. Additionally, introduced populations displayed greater phenotypic plasticity in clonal ramet but less phenotypic plasticity in biomass production than native populations across varying environments. These findings highlight the roles of phenotypic plasticity and specific trait adaptations, such as clonality, in the successful invasion of <span>R. japonica</span>. This study has important implications for managing invasive plant species under changing environmental conditions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Plant Ecology Current Issue","siteHash":"532f26bf1ba0f166bd6491390ce5cd237faca477af455cac49d2509f7b38d556","entryHash":"84cfe9ffbed3de69708ce10ec2d9339e96cc23f32034a8ec96d6491a81420218","category":"Environment"}
