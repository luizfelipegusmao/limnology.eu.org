Diagnosis is particularly challenging where multiple <i>Plasmodium</i> species are endemic, and where <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum hrp2</i>/<i>3</i> deletions are frequent. The Noul miLab is a fully automated portable digital microscope that prepares a blood film from a droplet of blood, followed by staining and detection of parasites by an algorithm. Infected red blood cells are displayed on the screen of the instrument. Time-to-result is approximately 20 minutes, with less than two minutes hands-on time. We evaluated the miLab among 659 suspected malaria patients in Gondar, Ethiopia, where <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>vivax</i> are endemic, and the frequency of <i>hrp2</i>/<i>3</i> deletions is high, and 991 patients in Ghana, where <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> transmission is intense. Across both countries combined, the sensitivity of the miLab for <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> was 94.3% at densities &gt;200 parasites/μL by qPCR, and 83% at densities &gt;20 parasites/μL. The miLab was more sensitive than local microscopy, and comparable to RDT. In Ethiopia, the miLab diagnosed 51/52 (98.1%) of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> infections with <i>hrp2</i> deletion at densities &gt;20 parasites/μL. Specificity of the miLab was 94.0%. For <i>P</i>. <i>vivax</i> diagnosis in Ethiopia, the sensitivity of the miLab was 97.0% at densities &gt;200 parasites/μL (RDT: 76.8%, microscopy: 67.0%), 93.9% at densities &gt;20 parasites/μL, and specificity was 97.6%. In Ethiopia, where <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>vivax</i> were frequent, the miLab assigned the wrong species to 15/195 mono-infections at densities &gt;20 parasites/μL by qPCR, and identified only 5/18 mixed-species infections correctly. In conclusion, the miLab was more sensitive than microscopy and thus is a valuable addition to the toolkit for malaria diagnosis, particularly for areas with high frequencies of <i>hrp2</i>/<i>3</i> deletions.","author":"Yalemwork Ewnetu","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"61b1fcf2e05fdb8dc2058acfe5de98d972333c3abf3c91782b918a7244d449d5","category":"Environment"}
