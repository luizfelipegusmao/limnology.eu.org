{"title":"Daily and Weekly &ldquo;High Doses&rdquo; of Cholecalciferol for the Prevention and Treatment of Vitamin D Deficiency for Obese or Multi-morbidity and Multi-treatment Patients Requiring Multi-drugs &ndash; a Narrative Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1527/v1","date":1721350316000,"content":"Abstract. Daily vitamin D supplementation using higher than normal dosing (up to the upper limit, UL) and intermittent (once or twice per week) dosing were studied in patients with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Using a PubMed database an adequate search for published randomized control trials and other studies was done and results were analyzed. This review provides overview of use of 7000 IU daily, 30,000 IU per week or twice weekly and 50,000 IU weekly of vitamin D on rapid restore of 25(OH)D concentrations to at least 30 ng/mL in different groups of patients at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. The above mention dosing should be considered in adults with obesity or multi-diseased patients on requiring multi-treatment with the use of several drugs, including drugs affecting vitamin D metabolism. The simple schedule for 7000 IU/day, 30,000 IU/week or twice weekly or 50,000 IU/week, all for 6-8 weeks of use by patients representing the increased risk of vitamin D deficiency were provided for consideration. It appeared that higher daily doses or intermittent doses suggested above are effective, safe and responsive for patientâ€™s preferences.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d7cd2f3677d3ba9cd350b2886f8c9bd66134592e4493fd428abbdc9cc17d47f5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
