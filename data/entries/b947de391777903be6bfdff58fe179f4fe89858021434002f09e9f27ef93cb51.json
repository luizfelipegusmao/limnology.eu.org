{"title":"Prostate Cancer Knowledge, Beliefs, and Screening Uptake among Black Survivors: A Qualitative Exploration at a Tertiary Hospital, Limpopo Province, South Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1019/v1","date":1723602930000,"content":"Men of African ancestry suffer disproportionately from prostate cancer (PCa) than other racial groups in South Africa. Equally concerning is that black South African men generally present later with higher stage and grade of the disease than their non-black counterparts. Despite this, South African black men continue to have little uptake in PCa screening behaviors. The objective of the study was to explore knowledge and beliefs of PCa among black South African survivors. A sample of 20 prostate cancer survivors, with ages ranging from 67 to 85 years (meanage = 76yrs; SD = 5.3) were selected through purposive sampling and requested to participate in the study. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews, and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). The findings demonstrated that black South African men had poor knowledge of PCa and that this may create an unfortunate system that preclude this population group from taking part in life-saving PCa screening services. The results highlight a need to elevate knowledge and awareness of PCa among black South African men and ultimately enhance screening practices.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b947de391777903be6bfdff58fe179f4fe89858021434002f09e9f27ef93cb51","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
