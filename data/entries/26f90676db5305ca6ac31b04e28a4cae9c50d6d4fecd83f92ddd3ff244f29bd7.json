This process constitutes a crucial aspect of tropospheric chemistry and has attracted growing research interest, particularly in understanding the mechanisms governing nighttime reactions between phenols and nitrogen oxides. In this study, we present new findings concerning the rapid dark reactions between phenols containing electron-donating groups and inorganic nitrite in acidic aqueous solutions with pH levels &lt;3.5. This reaction generates a substantial amount of nitroso- and nitro-substituted phenolic compounds, known for their light-absorbing properties and toxicity. In experiments utilizing various substituted phenols, we demonstrate that their reaction rates with nitrite depend on the electron cloud density of the benzene ring, indicative of an electrophilic substitution reaction mechanism. Control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the nitrosonium ion (NO<sup>+</sup>) is the reactive nitrogen species responsible for undergoing electrophilic reactions with phenolate anions, leading to the formation of nitroso-substituted phenolic compounds. These compounds then undergo partial oxidation to form nitro-substituted phenols through reactions with nitrous acid (HONO) or other oxidants like oxygen. Our findings unveil a novel mechanism for swift atmospheric nitrosation and nitration reactions that occur within acidic cloud droplets or aerosol water, providing valuable insights into the rapid nocturnal formation of nitrogen-containing organic compounds with significant implications for climate dynamics and human health.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"PNAS Nexus Current Issue","siteHash":"fea58439d6cc2c0ccad3ee11497de51870b6a2407c2235f665cca3245ef20ac2","entryHash":"26f90676db5305ca6ac31b04e28a4cae9c50d6d4fecd83f92ddd3ff244f29bd7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
