{"title":"Rethinking Human and Machine Intelligence under Determinism","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.0876/v4","date":1720140590000,"content":"This paper proposes a metaphysical framework for distinguishing between human and machine intelligence. It posits two identical deterministic worlds -- one comprising a human agent and the other a machine agent. These agents exhibit different information processing mechanisms despite their apparent sameness in a causal sense. Providing a conceptual modeling of their difference, this paper resolves what it calls “the vantage point problem” – namely, how to justify an omniscient perspective through which a determinist asserts determinism from within the supposedly deterministic universe.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0ffacf4375dedd56ad51646dbed63f6be8fcc105404002811baff1403190d63","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
