{"title":"Antibacterial Evaluation of Croton grewioides Baill Essential Oil on Beta-Lactam and Aminoglycoside Antibiotics","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1514/v1","date":1724222390000,"content":"Croton grewioides Baill., a species native to the Caatinga, popularly known as canela de cunhã, is used in traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases such as diarrhea, gastritis and stomach ulcers. This study aimed to identify the chemical composition of the essential oil of C. grewioides (OECG) and evaluate its antibacterial and antibiotic-modulating activities against both standard and multidrug-resistant bacteria. To analyze the compounds, present in the oil, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC/FID) techniques were used. In the bacteriological tests, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was obtained using the broth microdilution technique. The modulating effect of the essential oil was determined by calculating the subinhibitory concentration followed by serial microdilution of the antibiotics. The MIC reduction factor (FRC) was calculated and its data expressed as a percentage. Analysis of the chemical composition identified the presence of the major compound estragole with a relative abundance of 50.34%. The MIC values obtained demonstrated efficacy in K. pneumoniae isolated from urine with MIC values of 512 µg/mL. OECG potentiated the effects of all antibiotics tested on S. aureus ATCC 29213, K. pneumoniae Carbapnemase, E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 strains with their FRC of 97.65 %, 99.80 %, 99.85 % and 99.88 %, respectively. Thus, the essential oil of C. growioides presents synergistic effects when combined with the tested antibiotics, in addition to acting in the fight against bacterial resistance to antibiotics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9051c6dc63a45fba1a3a20f81e5f654d07daa4d6565671a52e76f8de2946d0d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
