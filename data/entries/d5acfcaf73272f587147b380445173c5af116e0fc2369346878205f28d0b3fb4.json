{"title":"Clean Energy and Carbon Emissions in Mexico&rsquo;s Electric Power Sector: Past Performance and Current Trend","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1084/v1","date":1728913431000,"content":"The concept of clean energy was introduced by the Mexican authorities as part of the wholesale electricity market with the objectives of both measuring the progress in decarbonization and fostering emission-free and low-emission technologies. In the present work, the evolution of clean energy production for the period 2017-2023, corresponding to seven full years of operation of the electricity market, was analyzed and compared to official targets. Emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) was calculated from fuel consumption statistics. The consistency between electricity generation and fuel consumption data has been assessed. The projected short-term evolution of electricity generation and GHG emissions through 2026, locked in by decisions in the recent past, is modeled and discussed. The extent to which official clean energy figures can be considered a predictor for emissions from the power sector is discussed as well. The results are believed to be a relevant contribution for the assessment of Mexicoâ€™s progress with its national and international climate change mitigation goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d5acfcaf73272f587147b380445173c5af116e0fc2369346878205f28d0b3fb4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
