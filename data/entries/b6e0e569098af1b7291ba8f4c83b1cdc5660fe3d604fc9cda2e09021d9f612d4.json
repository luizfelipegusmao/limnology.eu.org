The challenges of highly variable climatic conditions and water scarcity in the semi-arid savannas of southern Africa drive trees to exhibit different water use strategies.\n\nAn additional challenge for savanna trees arises from the browsing of large mammals, and its potential impact on transpiration has largely been overlooked.\n\nTo assess water use strategies and the impact of browsing on transpiration in three common savanna woody species (<i>Colophospermum mopane</i>, <i>Catophractes alexandri</i>, <i>Senegalia mellifera</i>), we conducted an extensive field experiment in a wildlife reserve in Namibia. We established a browsing gradient ranging from 0% to 100% leaf removal to disentangle complex relationships, and we measured sap flow representing whole-tree transpiration, stomatal conductance as a proxy for leaf level transpiration, and environmental factors including soil moisture, solar radiation, air temperature and air humidity.\n\nWe discovered a unimodal relationship between browsing intensity and sap flow, consistent across all species, and peaking at low to moderate browsing levels equivalent to approximately 30% leaf removal. This universal pattern is remarkable since we found water use strategies to differ among species: <i>Colophospermum mopane</i> and <i>C. alexandri</i> exhibit a water-saving behaviour to reduce water loss under unfavourable conditions while <i>S. mellifera</i> demonstrates water-spending characteristics.\n\nThe deviation from a negative linear effect of browsing does not meet the functional expectation when browsing is translated into a simple leaf area reduction. Instead, it can be attributed to stomatal adjustments that partially compensate for transpiratory surface loss. We propose that this conceptual mechanism can be generalised to other woody species and various ecosystems. In addition, common transpiration models relying solely on leaf area indices and abiotic factors can be improved by including a non-linear relationship to reproduce the effect of browsing accurately.\n\nOur findings highlight the role of herbivores in shaping the connection between the Earth's spheres and improve our understanding of ecohydrological and vegetation dynamics in Southern African savannas.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/01/05/hungry-herbivores-and-thirsty-plants-how-do-elephants-giraffes-and-colleagues-affect-tree-water-use/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"T.
