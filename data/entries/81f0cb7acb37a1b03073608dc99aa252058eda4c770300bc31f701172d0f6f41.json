{"title":"Multiple sclerosis and abnormal spermatozoa: A bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization study","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308815","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Bo Li, Lingang Zhang, Qi Li, Jianhua Zhang, Wei Wang, Jianwen Quan</p>\r\nObjective <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and previous observational epidemiological studies have suggested an association between MS and male infertility; male infertility due to sperm abnormalities may result from a number of aetiological factors, such as genetics, autoimmune factors, etc., and there are currently no studies to assess whether MS is associated with sperm abnormalities in men. Therefore, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal relationship between MS and abnormal spermatozoa.</p> Methods <p>In this study, independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) were identified by mining public genome-wide association study repositories and used as instrumental variables to explore causality. The causal effect of MS on sperm abnormalities was systematically assessed using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) techniques, and various analytical models such as inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO were implemented to dissect the association. In addition, a wide range of sensitivity tests, including Cochran’s Q test to detect heterogeneity, MR-Egger intercept analysis to assess bias, leave-one-out to test model robustness, and funnel plot analysis to detect potential publication bias, were implemented to ensure the robustness and reliability of the causal inference results.</p> Results <p>There was a significant causal relationship between MS and abnormal sperm (OR 1.090, 95% CI [1.017–1.168], p = 0.014); The accuracy and robustness of the results were confirmed by sensitivity analysis.</p> Conclusion <p>Here we show that there appears to be a causal relationship between multiple sclerosis and abnormal spermatozoa. MS as a chronic disease has a higher risk of concomitant sperm abnormalities in its male patients, and reproductive and fertility issues in men with MS should receive special attention from clinicians.</p>","author":"Bo Li","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"81f0cb7acb37a1b03073608dc99aa252058eda4c770300bc31f701172d0f6f41","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
