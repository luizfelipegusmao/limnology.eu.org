{"title":"Enhancing Multisensory Virtual Reality Environments through Olfactory Stimuli for autobiographical memory retrieval","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1001/v1","date":1721052185000,"content":"This paper examines the use of multisensory virtual reality (VR) as a novel approach in psychological therapy for autobiographical memory retrieval with benefits for cognitive enhancement, stress reduction etc. The research in this paper was done under Romanian Arut Research Grant no. 27/09/10/2023 ”Intelligent VR system for treating autobiographical/episodic memory deficits\".  By simulating realistic multisensory experiences, VR technology offers an immersive environment that surpasses traditional therapeutic methods in effectiveness. Previous studies demonstrate improved outcomes in treating various psychological conditions (affective disorders and PTSD, specific phobias and age-related cognitive decline). Technological advancements in VR, such as olfactory integration cand contribute to the realism and therapeutic potential of these environments, the integration of various physical stimuli with VR holds promising potential psychological therapies and highlighting the need for further interdisciplinary research. In this pilot study we tested the efficacy of a new system for triggering autobiographical memory retrieval. For this we used images combined with odors in a congruent manner and offering participants the chance to interact with the VR environment by using 2 virtual hands. We evaluated the efficacy of this system using qualitative methods with emphasis on the evaluation of the emotions associated with memory recollection and the ease of triggering memories. All participants in our pilot study experienced intense emotions related to childhood or adolescence and the pleasant feelings they had during the experiment persisted even after it ended. This is an advancement to what exists currently and original research elements for our paper.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1ad2f472c6bc39b98efa97429d36f7ca4fbe19583b6847b3fb6a79f940db71ba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
