{"title":"Structure based screening and molecular docking with dynamic simulation of natural secondary metabolites to target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of five different retroviruses","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0307615","date":1722866400000,"content":"<p>by Muhammad Azeem, Ghulam Mustafa, Sibtain Ahmed, Amna Mushtaq, Muhammad Arshad, Muhammad Usama, Muhammad Farooq</p>\r\n\r\nViral diseases pose a serious global health threat due to their rapid transmission and widespread impact. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) participates in the synthesis, transcription, and replication of viral RNA in host. The current study investigates the antiviral potential of secondary metabolites particularly those derived from bacteria, fungi, and plants to develop novel medicines. Using a virtual screening approach that combines molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we aimed to discover compounds with strong interactions with RdRp of five different retroviruses. The top five compounds were selected for each viral RdRp based on their docking scores, binding patterns, molecular interactions, and drug-likeness properties. The molecular docking study uncovered several metabolites with antiviral activity against RdRp. For instance, cytochalasin Z8 had the lowest docking score of –8.9 (kcal/mol) against RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, aspulvinone D (–9.2 kcal/mol) against HIV-1, talaromyolide D (–9.9 kcal/mol) for hepatitis C, aspulvinone D (–9.9 kcal/mol) against Ebola and talaromyolide D also maintained the lowest docking score of –9.2 kcal/mol against RdRp enzyme of dengue virus. These compounds showed remarkable antiviral potential comparable to standard drug (remdesivir –7.4 kcal/mol) approved to target RdRp and possess no significant toxicity. The molecular dynamics simulation confirmed that the best selected ligands were firmly bound to their respective target proteins for a simulation time of 200 ns. The identified lead compounds possess distinctive pharmacological characteristics, making them potential candidates for repurposing as antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Further experimental evaluation and investigation are recommended to ascertain their efficacy and potential.","author":"Muhammad Azeem","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"e5ef0c5a37d9b92026b72d04d78ec6854a7eb65bc415adfd68469811333231fd","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
