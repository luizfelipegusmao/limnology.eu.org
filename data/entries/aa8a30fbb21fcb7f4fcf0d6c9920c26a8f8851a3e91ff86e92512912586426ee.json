{"title":"Competition between brown stink bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and corn earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in field corn","link":"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/53/5/860/7706424?rss=1","date":1720051200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Interspecific competition is an important ecological concept which can play a major role in insect population dynamics. In the southeastern United States, a complex of stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), primarily the brown stink bug, <span>Euschistus servus</span> (Say), and corn earworm, <span>Helicoverpa zea</span> (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), are the 2 most common pests of field corn, <span>Zea mays</span> L. (Poales: Poaceae). Stink bugs have the greatest potential for economic injury during the late stages of vegetative corn development when feeding can result in deformed or “banana-shaped” ears and reduced grain yield. Corn earworm moths lay eggs on corn silks during the first stages of reproductive development. A 2-year field study was conducted to determine the impact of feeding by the brown stink bug during late-vegetative stages on subsequent corn earworm oviposition, larval infestations, and grain yield. Brown stink bug feeding prior to tasseling caused deformed ears and reduced overall grain yield by up to 92%. Across all trials, varying levels of brown stink bug density and injury reduced the number of corn earworm larvae by 29–100% and larval feeding by 46–85%. Averaged across brown stink bug densities, later planted corn experienced a 9-fold increase in number of corn earworm larvae. This is the first study demonstrating a competitive interaction between these major pests in a field corn setting, and these results have potential implications for insect resistance management.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Entomology Current Issue","siteHash":"cd31a9dedc650c44bfe34759a4460ac84326db14be1c0b158778f764b538baf2","entryHash":"aa8a30fbb21fcb7f4fcf0d6c9920c26a8f8851a3e91ff86e92512912586426ee","category":"Environment"}
