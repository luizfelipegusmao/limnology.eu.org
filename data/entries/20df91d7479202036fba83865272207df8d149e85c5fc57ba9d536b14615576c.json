{"title":"Detecting Reinforced Concrete Rebars Using Ground Penetrating Radars","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0804/v1","date":1710405871000,"content":"A new algorithm is developed in this study to automatically detect reinforced concrete structures' rebar locations and diameters using the ground penetrating radar technique. The method approximates the hyperbolic signatures using two-way travel time and bi-quadratic equations. The study includes formulating electromagnetic wave speed in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. The algorithm was used in a computer code to provide an automated analysis of ground-penetrating radar data collected from a pre-planned survey grid. Two RC slabs were fabricated and tested to validate the proposed method. The proposed method is efficient in signal processing and accurately and reliably determining the rebar information.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"20df91d7479202036fba83865272207df8d149e85c5fc57ba9d536b14615576c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
