{"title":"Effects of Salinity on Physicochemical Properties, Flavor Compounds, and Bacterial Communities in Broad Bean Paste-Meju Fermentation","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0090/v1","date":1717415493000,"content":"Broad bean paste (BBP) is a traditional fermented soy food, and its high salt content not only prolongs the fermentation time but also threatens human health. In this study, three BBP-meju with different salt concentrations were prepared, and the effects of varying salinity on the fermentation process were comprehensively compared. The results showed that salt-reduced fermentation contributed to the accumulation of amino acid nitrogen, reducing sugars, free amino acids, and organic acids. Alcohols, esters, aldehydes, and acids were the main volatile flavor compounds in BBP-meju, and the highest total volatile flavor compounds were found in medium-salt meju. Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Aspergillus, and Mortierella were the dominant microbial communities during fermentation, and there were also three opportunistic pathogens, Enterobacter, Pantoea, and Brevundimonas, respectively. According to Spearman correlation analysis, Wickerhamomyces, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Mortierella all showed highly significant positive correlations with â‰¥3 key flavor compounds, which may be the core functional flora. Furthermore, the dominant microbial genera worked synergistically to promote the formation of high-quality flavor compounds and inhibit the production of off-flavors during salt-reduced fermentation. This study provides a theoretical reference for the quality and safety control of low-salt fermented soy foods.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"19c6bfe9c9d11db42a69b5aefdd2b173ee42835cdab2fa02de570cd4b18f88ed","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
