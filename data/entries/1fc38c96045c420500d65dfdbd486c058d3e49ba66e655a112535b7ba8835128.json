{"title":"Hydrogen and CO Over-Equilibria in Catalytic Reactions of Methane Reforming","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1159/v1","date":1726474103000,"content":"Hydrogen and carbon monoxide over-equilibria have been found computationally in kinetic dependencies of methane reforming catalytic reactions (steam and dry reforming) using conditions of the conservatively perturbed equilibrium (CPE) phenomenon, i.e. at the initial equilibrium concentration of hydrogen or carbon monoxide.  The influence of pressure, temperature, flow rate and composition of the initial mixture on the position of the CPE point (the extremum point) was investigated in a wide domain of parameters. It is demonstrated that the CPE phenomenon significantly increases the product concentration (H2 and CO) at the reactor length which is significantly less than the reactor length required to reach the equilibrium. The CPE-point was interpreted as the “turning point” in kinetic behavior.  Recommendations on the temperature and pressure regimes are different from the traditional ones related to the Le Chatelier’s law. Obtained results provide valuable information on optimal reaction conditions for complex reversible chemical transformations, offering potential applications in chemical engineering processes.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1fc38c96045c420500d65dfdbd486c058d3e49ba66e655a112535b7ba8835128","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
