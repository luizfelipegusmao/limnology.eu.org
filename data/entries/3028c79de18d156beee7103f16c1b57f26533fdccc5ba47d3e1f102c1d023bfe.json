{"title":"Exploring the Role of Communication Asset Mapping (CAM) as a Strategy to Promote Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment Information Within African American Communities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0910/v1","date":1726133275000,"content":"Objective: African Americans (AA) carry the largest burden for almost every type of cancer in the US and are also more likely to die from cancer. Approximately 10% of cancers can be explained by a hereditary factor and detected earlier. Many AA however have inequitable access to hereditary cancer risk assessment (HCRA) tools and information, further exacerbating cancer disparities. Innovative communication strategies to promote community-based HCRA information have promise to bridge AA to optimal primary cancer screening. The current pilot study followed a participatory process where researchers engaged with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to explore how Communication Asset Mapping could assist Lay Health Advisors with dissemination of evidence-based HCRA information within AA faith communities. Methods: The research team and CAB conducted exploratory community group discussions with residents (N=21) guided by Communication Infrastructure Theory, and a community-engaged mapping process to inform the development of a Communication Asset Mapping (CAM) dissemination strategy. Results: Themes included: (1) Optimal locations (e.g. community centers) within identified networks (specified neighborhood networks) should have representatives who are trusted ambassadors to assist with  HCRA information dissemination; (2) Trusted community member voices should fully represent the trusted network; and (3) Well-known and frequented geographic locations should be a true representation of participantsâ€™ neighborhoods for creating a robust health information network concerning HCRA. Conclusion: CAB and community residents appreciated the engagement process however, felt the impact was limited due to missing community voices within their neighborhoods to identify  communication assets within the network for optimal HCRA information dissemination. CAM therefore is an important public health strategy in identification of trusted networks.  The strategy was  also helpful in pinpointing people  who are critical communicators of emerging health information akin to HCRA.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3028c79de18d156beee7103f16c1b57f26533fdccc5ba47d3e1f102c1d023bfe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
