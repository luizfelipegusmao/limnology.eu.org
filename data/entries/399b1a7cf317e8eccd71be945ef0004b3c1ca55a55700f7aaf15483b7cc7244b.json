Methods: A total of 210 individuals, including 96 children with insulin resistance and 114 children without insulin resistance, aged 6-18 years, who were admitted to the Pediatric Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic at Medicine Hospital, Istanbul Atlas University were included in our study. Result: NLR, PLR, SII and MHR were significantly higher in patients with insulin resistance compared to those without. Fasting insulin, PAI, HOMA-IR, HOMA-ÔÅ¢ were significantly higher and QUICKI was significantly lower in patients with insulin resistance compared to those without insulin resistance. NLR, SII and MHR were lower in normal vitamin D groups than the others were (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"399b1a7cf317e8eccd71be945ef0004b3c1ca55a55700f7aaf15483b7cc7244b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
