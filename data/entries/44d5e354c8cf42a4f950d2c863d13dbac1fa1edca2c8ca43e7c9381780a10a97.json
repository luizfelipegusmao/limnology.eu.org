{"title":"What about Land Uses in Mobility Hub Planning?","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0244/v1","date":1725418302000,"content":"Mobility hubs (MHs), where various transport modes converge, are increasingly being implemented as a key policy strategy to promote sustainable travel behavior. The existing literature is rich with proposals for various types of MHs and their suitable siting locations. However, studies comparing the role of land use patterns on the performance of different types of MHs are scarce. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing transit patronage and active mode share as performance indicators of MHs. It compares the effects of land use patterns on the performance of different types of MHs classified by the nature of transport integration (e.g., train-tram-bus, train-tram, and train-bus) in different contexts (e.g., city center and suburb) in the Greater Melbourne Area, Australia. Results show that MHs, irrespective of their type, significantly enhance the use of both transit and active transport services compared to a unimodal train station, with maximum usage observed in a train-tram-bus hub, followed by train-tram and train-bus hubs. However, the underlying land use patterns significantly affect their performance. While the size of commercial land use consistently and positively influences transit patronage across MH types, certain land use patterns (e.g., intersection density, cultural centers, care facilities) exert their influence in specific types of MHs. These findings suggest that MH typologies should be designed in tandem with supportive land uses to maximize sustainable travel behavior.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"44d5e354c8cf42a4f950d2c863d13dbac1fa1edca2c8ca43e7c9381780a10a97","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
