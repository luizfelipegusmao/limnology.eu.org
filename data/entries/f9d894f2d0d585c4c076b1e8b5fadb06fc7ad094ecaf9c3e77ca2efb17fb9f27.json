{"title":"Protective Role of Interleukin-37 via Ferroptosis in Cardiovascular Diseases","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2521/v1","date":1722414263000,"content":"Ferroptosis and dysregulation of iron metabolism are increasingly recognized as contributors to the onset and development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, heart failure, and cardiovascular manifestations of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). In-flammation plays a central role in these conditions, prompting exploration into the inflammatory and immunoregulatory molecular mechanisms un-derlying ferroptosis and its contribution to CVD progression. In particular, emerging evidence suggests that interleukin (IL)-37 is a protective cytokine capable of activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, suppressing macrophage ferroptosis, and activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway to attenuate atherosclerosis progression in murine models. Despite this, a comprehensive review detailing IL-37 and its protective role against ferroptosis in CVD is absent in the current literature. Thus, this review consolidates the current state of knowledge on IL-37, summarizing its regulatory functions and modulation of ferroptosis in diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, aneurysm, stroke, and other CVD. We also discuss experimental approaches and propose that tar-geting IL-37 to regulate ferroptosis holds promise as a therapeutic strategy in preventing and treating diverse CVD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9d894f2d0d585c4c076b1e8b5fadb06fc7ad094ecaf9c3e77ca2efb17fb9f27","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
