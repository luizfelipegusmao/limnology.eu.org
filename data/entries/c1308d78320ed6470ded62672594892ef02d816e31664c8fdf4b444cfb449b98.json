{"title":"Unveiling the Inner Structure of Micrometric Hollow Polymeric Fibers Using Synchrotron X-Ray Nanotomography","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/1/14/7517673?rss=1","date":1705017600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>In this study, a novel application of synchrotron X-ray nanotomography based on high-resolution full-field transmission X-ray microscopy for characterizing the structure and morphology of micrometric hollow polymeric fibers is presented. By employing postimage analysis using an open-source software such as Tomviz and ImageJ, various key parameters in fiber morphology, including diameter, wall thickness, wall thickness distribution, pore size, porosity, and surface roughness, were assessed. Electrospun polycaprolactone fibers with micrometric diameters and submicrometric features with induced porosity via gas dissolution foaming were used to this aim. The acquired synchrotron X-ray nanotomography data were analyzed using two approaches: 3D tomographic reconstruction and 2D radiographic projection-based analysis. The results of the combination of both approaches demonstrate unique capabilities of this technique, not achievable by other available techniques, allowing for a full characterization of the internal and external morphology and structure of the fibers as well as to obtain valuable qualitative insights into the overall fiber structure.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"c1308d78320ed6470ded62672594892ef02d816e31664c8fdf4b444cfb449b98","category":"Environment"}
