Through OMIM and GeneCards to collect oxidative stress targets from database, and intersect with drug targets to obtain drug disease intersection targets; Construct a PPI network diagram using the STRING database. Perform GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on intersection targets through the DAVID platform. Lead acetate (PbAc) exposure was used to establish a lead poisoning cell model, and intracellular ROS levels, ALB, AKT1, and Caspase-3 levels were measured.<div>Results</div>A total of 288 targets of gastrodin action, 638 targets related to oxidative stress, and 62 drug disease intersection targets were obtained, among which core targets such as ALB, AKT1, CASP3 may be closely related to oxidative stress. KEGG pathway analysis showed that gastrodin antioxidant stress mainly involved in lipid, cancer pathway and other signaling pathways. The results of the cell experiment showed that 50 Î¼M is the optimal effective concentration for PbAc induced ROS production in PC12 cells. Gastrodin significantly increased the ROS content of PC12 cells treated with PbAc, Upregulation of ALB expression and downregulation of AKT1 and CASP3 expression.<div>Conclusions</div>Gastrodin may alleviate PbAc-induced ROS in PC12 cells, indicating potential protective effects against oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Toxicology Research Current Issue","siteHash":"b4c183320fbed6120c93a640e0e7a17777c96543a048ebef2a2041a7da93a66a","entryHash":"c627970c77f4386e4121b5162b476b62eb669d612cf0b54a7e2152cbe1d83de5","category":"Environment"}
