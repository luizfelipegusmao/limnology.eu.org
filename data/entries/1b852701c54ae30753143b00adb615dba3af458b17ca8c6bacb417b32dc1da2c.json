{"title":"Green Web Meter: Structuring and Implementing a Real-Time Digital Sustainability Monitoring System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2076/v1","date":1721911853000,"content":"The central aim of this paper is to present the Green Web Meter software which is designed to support the measurement of digital sustainability performance of websites and web apps, as well as providing sound based analytic tools for improving their overall quality. We analyzed scientific literature and specifically selected three quality assessment models (E-S Qual, Sitequal, Webqual 4.0) which we used as a starting point for identifying the most crucial aspects for the monitoring activities. A consistent set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) suitable for automated tracking has been provided. We finally developed model-based software able to deliver solutions for real-time website performance analysis and reports. We structured the model to offer accurate references for digital sustainability reporting by aggregating the KPIs into an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework and computing a comprehensive score for its pillars.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1b852701c54ae30753143b00adb615dba3af458b17ca8c6bacb417b32dc1da2c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
