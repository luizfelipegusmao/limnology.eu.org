{"title":"Development of a GIS-based Autonomous Soil Drilling Robot for Efficient Tree Cultivation and Orchard Planting","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0396/v1","date":1715247048000,"content":"A typical orchard's mechanical operation consists of three or four stages: lining, digging for plantation, moving the seedling from nurseries to the farm, moving the seedling to the planting hole, and planting the seedling in the hole. However, the digging the planting hole is the most time-consuming operation. In fruit orchards, robots' usage is increasingly becoming more prevalent to increase operational efficiency. They offer practical and effective services to both industry and people, whether they are assigned to plant trees, reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, or carry heavy loads to relieve staff. Robots can operate for extended periods of time and can highly adept at repetitive tasks like planting many trees. The present study aims to identify the locations for planting trees in orchards using geographic information systems (GIS), to develop an autonomous drilling machine and use the developed robot to open planting holes. The agricultural mobile robot is a four wheeled nonholonomic robot with differential steering and forwarding capability to stable target positions. The drilling system, which is a y-axis shifter driven by a DC motor with reducer includes an auger with a 2.1 HP gasoline engine. SOLIDWORKS software was used for designing and drawing of the mobile robot and drilling system. The Microsoft Visual Basic.NET programming language was used to create the robot navigation system and drilling mechanism software. The cross-track error (XTE), which determines the distances between the actual and desired holes positions, was utilized to analyze the steering accuracy of the mobile robot to the drilling spots. Consequently, the average of the arithmetic means was determined to be 4.35 cm, and the standard deviation was 1.73 cm. This figure indicates that the suggested system is effective for drilling plant holes in orchards.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5a18747b41de06c9da93ed3ac61c9421a29e32c7f6eff646ee688a8d1cd7de77","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
