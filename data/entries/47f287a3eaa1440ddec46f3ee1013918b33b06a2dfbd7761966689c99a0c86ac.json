Although the interactions of lipids with integral and peripheral membrane proteins are crucial for their localization, activity, and function, how proteins bind lipids is still far from being thoroughly explored. Describing and characterizing these dynamic protein–lipid interactions is thus essential to understanding the membrane-associated processes. Here we review the current range of experimental techniques employed to study plant protein–lipid interactions, integrating various methods. We summarize the principles, advantages, and limitations of classical <span>in vitro</span> biochemical approaches, including protein–lipid overlays and various liposome binding assays, and complement them with <span>in vivo</span> microscopic techniques centered around the use of genetically encoded lipid sensors and pharmacological or genetic membrane lipid manipulation tools. We also highlight several emerging techniques still awaiting their advancement into plant membrane research and emphasize the need to use complementary experimental strategies as key for elucidating the mechanistic roles of protein–lipid interactions in plant cell biology.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"47f287a3eaa1440ddec46f3ee1013918b33b06a2dfbd7761966689c99a0c86ac","category":"Environment"}
