{"title":"Predictability of intelligence and age from structural connectomes","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301599","date":1711980000000,"content":"<p>by Sebastian J. Kopetzky, Yong Li, Marcus Kaiser, Markus Butz-Ostendorf, for the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative </p>\r\n\r\nIn this study, structural images of 1048 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study and 94 from ADNI-3 study were processed by an in-house tractography pipeline and analyzed together with pre-processed data of the same subjects from braingraph.org. Whole brain structural connectome features were used to build a simple correlation-based regression machine learning model to predict intelligence and age of healthy subjects. Our results showed that different forms of intelligence as well as age are predictable to a certain degree from diffusion tensor imaging detecting anatomical fiber tracts in the living human brain. Though we did not identify significant differences in the prediction capability for the investigated features depending on the imaging feature extraction method, we did find that crystallized intelligence was consistently better predictable than fluid intelligence from structural connectivity data through all datasets. Our findings suggest a practical and scalable processing and analysis framework to explore broader research topics employing brain MR imaging.","author":"Sebastian J.
