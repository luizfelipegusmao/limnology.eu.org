{"title":"Impact of Hydroxyapatite on Gelatin/Oxidized Alginate 3D-Printed Cryogel Scaffolds","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0572/v1","date":1718015512000,"content":"Fabrication of scaffolds via 3D printing is a promising approach for tissue engineering. In this study, we combined 3D printing with cryogenic crosslinking to create biocompatible gela-tin/oxidized alginate (Gel/OxAlg) scaffolds with large pore sizes, beneficial for bone tissue re-generation. To enhance the osteogenic effects and mechanical properties of these scaffolds, we evaluated the impact of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on the rheological characteristics of the 2.86% (1:1) Gel/OxAlg ink. We investigated the morphological and mechanical properties of scaffolds with low, 5% and high 10% HAp content, as well as the resulting bio and osteogenic effects. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a reduction in pore sizes from 160-180 µm (HAp-free) to 120-140 µm for both HAp-containing scaffolds. Increased stability and higher Young’s moduli were measured for 5% and 10% HAp (18 and 21 kPa, respectively) compared to 11 kPa for HAp-free constructs. Biological assessments with mesenchymal stem cells indicated excellent cytocompati-bility and osteogenic differentiation in all scaffolds, with high degree of mineralization in HAp-containing constructs. Scaffolds with 5% HAp exhibit improved mechanical characteristics and shape fidelity, demonstrate positive osteogenic impact, and enhance bone tissue formation. Increasing the HAp content to 10% did not show any advantages in osteogenesis, offering a minor increase in mechanical strength at the cost of significantly compromised shape fidelity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5e371d26ded1a9b5cb48f34157c2057bbce08c4c1beca1f26b1ad835bfe4ba1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
