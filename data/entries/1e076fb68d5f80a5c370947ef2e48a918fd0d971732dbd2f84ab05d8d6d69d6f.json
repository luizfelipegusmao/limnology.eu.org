{"title":"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Machine Learning on Coral Trace Element Paleothermometers for Sea Surface Temperature Reconstruction","link":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024PA004885?af=R","date":1727693296000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>This research introduces a novel approach to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) by developing a universal coral thermometer using machine learning (ML) algorithms on monthly resolved <i>Porites</i> coral proxies and SST data. A total of 1,202 data sets from 19 corals, covering SSTs ranging from 21.5 to 31.5째C, with proxies including Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, Li/Mg, U/Ca, and B/Ca ratios were analyzed. The data were divided into four sub-datasets by regional and taxon constraints. An exhaustive analysis was conducted, training 1,612 models using various proxy combinations and ML strategies to assess the impact of the non-SST effect on the universality of ML models. The results indicated that the non-SST effect is more significantly attributed to regional variations than to taxon differences, underscoring the importance of regional factors in <i>Porites</i> coral proxy-based SST reconstructions. Sr/Ca and Li/Mg proxies were identified as the most indicative of SST, showing clearer relationships with temperature than other proxies. Non-linear approaches achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 0.90째C, which further decreased to 0.72째C upon incorporating specific regional and taxon constraints. In an independent test set focusing exclusively on Li/Mg and Sr/Ca proxies, the tree-based algorithms particularly excelled, achieving an average RMSE improvement of at least 0.52째C over the Universal Multi-Trace Element Calibration Scheme and the Li/Mg empirical equation. This research underscores the potential of applying ML to coral-based SST reconstructions, especially highlighting the effectiveness of tree-based algorithms and the suitability of Sr/Ca and Li/Mg proxies for accurate temperature estimations.</p>","author":"Yuxuan Wei, \nWenfeng Deng, \nXuefei Chen, \nGangjian Wei","siteTitle":"Wiley: Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"69a881e15689378344e2f544f17d899603864e0695b4208841b63784555058e2","entryHash":"1e076fb68d5f80a5c370947ef2e48a918fd0d971732dbd2f84ab05d8d6d69d6f","category":"Environment"}
