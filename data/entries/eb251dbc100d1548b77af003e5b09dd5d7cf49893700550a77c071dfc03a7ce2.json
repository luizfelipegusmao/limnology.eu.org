{"title":"Method of AI-Based Precipitation Estimation by Using FY-4B Satellite Data","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1289/v1","date":1724054591000,"content":"A smart precipitation estimation method based on FY-4B meteorological satellite data (FY-4B_AI) is proposed in this paper. This method spatiotemporally matches 125 features derived from multi-temporal and multi-channels of FY-4B satellite data with the precipitation at stations. Then a precipitation model using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm is constructed. Comparative results between FY-4B_AI and GPM/IMERG-L products for over 450 million station cases throughout 2023 shows that: 1)  FY-4B_AI is superior to GPM IMERG-L in the average absolute error, root mean square error, relative error, correlation coefficient, probability of detection and critical success index. While in the mean error and false alarm rate, FY-4B_AI is slightly inferior to GPM/IMERG-L. 2) Evaluation of strong weather event applications reveals that both FY-4B_AI and GPM/IMERG-L can accurately represent the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation, no matter in the southeast humid region or the northwest dry region. Notably, FY-4B_AI, due to its higher spatiotemporal resolution, provides a more detailed distribution of precipitation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eb251dbc100d1548b77af003e5b09dd5d7cf49893700550a77c071dfc03a7ce2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
