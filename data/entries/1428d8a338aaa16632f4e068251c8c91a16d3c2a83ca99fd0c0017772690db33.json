{"title":"Liquid Biopsy in the Clinical Management of Cancers","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1172/v1","date":1718703502000,"content":"Liquid biopsy, a non-invasive diagnosis that examines circulating tumor components in body fluids, is increasingly used in cancer management. An overview of relevant literature emphasizes the current state of liquid biopsy applications in cancer care. Liquid biopsy, particularly circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor RNAs (ctRNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles, and other cell-free nucleic acids, offers promising opportunities for early cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, monitoring, and disease assessment. The implementation of liquid biopsy in precision medicine has shown significant potential in various cancer types, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Advances in genomic and molecular technologies, such as next generation sequencing (NGS) and digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) have expanded the utility of liquid biopsy, enabling the detection of somatic variants and actionable genomic alterations in tumors. Liquid biopsy has also demonstrated utility in predicting treatment responses, monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD), and assessing tumor heterogeneity. Nevertheless, standardizing liquid biopsy techniques, interpreting results, and integrating them into clinical routine remain challenges. Despite these challenges, liquid biopsy has significant clinical implications in cancer management, offering a dynamic and non-invasive approach to understanding tumor biology and guiding personalized treatment strategies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1428d8a338aaa16632f4e068251c8c91a16d3c2a83ca99fd0c0017772690db33","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
