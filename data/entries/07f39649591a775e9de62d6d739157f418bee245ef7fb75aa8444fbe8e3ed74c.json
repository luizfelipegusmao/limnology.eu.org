Despite their importance, our mechanistic understanding of how LTPs function at the molecular level is still in its infancy, mostly due to the large number of existing LTPs and to the low degree of conservation at the sequence and structural level. In this work, we use molecular simulations to characterize a representative dataset of lipid transport domains (LTDs) of 12 LTPs that belong to 8 distinct families. We find that despite no sequence homology nor structural conservation, the conformational landscape of LTDs displays common features, characterized by the presence of at least 2 main conformations whose populations are modulated by the presence of the bound lipid. These conformational properties correlate with their mechanistic mode of action, allowing for the interpretation and design of experimental strategies to further dissect their mechanism. Our findings indicate the existence of a conserved, fold-independent mechanism of lipid transfer across LTPs of various families and offer a general framework for understanding their functional mechanism.","author":"Sriraksha Srinivasan","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"07f39649591a775e9de62d6d739157f418bee245ef7fb75aa8444fbe8e3ed74c","category":"Environment"}
