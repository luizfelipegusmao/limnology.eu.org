{"title":"Sustainability of Aqua-Feeds in Africa","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2286/v1","date":1722240804000,"content":"In recent decades, the aquaculture industry has experienced significant growth worldwide, surpassing other food production sectors. This review aims to explore the dynamics of aquafeed production, particularly the shift from conventional to local feed production in Africa, driven by cost-effectiveness and the availability of raw materials. The review examines various scientific publications on aquafeed, focusing on both conventional and novel feed formulations and their impact on aquaculture and the environment. Commonly used aquafeed ingredients among African farmers include cassava, maize gluten, groundnut oilcake, sunflower oilcake, soybean meal, kale, peas, garlic, shrimp wastes, and waste blood. Novel ingredients such as insect-based diets and micro-algae formulations are also explored. Aquafeed composition impacts aqua-waste, water quality, algae, oxygen demand, fish mortality, and eutrophication. The findings highlight the need to reorient feed formulation methods and ingredients to achieve a circular economy in Africa, promoting increased fish production at minimal costs, creating employment while supporting climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Ultimately, the aquafeed sector has the potential to grow sustainably through the adoption of feed alternatives that prioritise sustainable production and encourage beneficiation studies.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"eed81a1b58b4d73138a97ea42465779ffc7ec10e2d61bc33b37dfbae84564d01","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
