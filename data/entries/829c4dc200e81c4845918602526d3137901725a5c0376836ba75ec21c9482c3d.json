{"title":"Chef Dalle: Transforming Cooking with Multimodal AI","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0334/v1","date":1712203615000,"content":"In an era where dietary habits significantly impact health, technological interventions can offer personalized and accessible food choices. This paper introduces Chef Dalle, a recipe recommen-dation system that leverages multimodal human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques to pro-vide personalized cooking guidance. The application integrates voice-to-text conversion via Whisper, ingredient image recognition through GPT-Vision, and employs TF-IDF vectorization alongside cosine similarity for personalized recipe recommendations. These methods enable users to interact with the system using voice, text, or images, accommodating various dietary re-strictions and preferences. Furthermore, the utilization of DALL-E 3 for generating recipe images enhances user engagement. User feedback mechanisms allow for the refinement of future rec-ommendations, demonstrating the system's adaptability. Chef Dalle showcases potential appli-cations ranging from home kitchens to grocery stores and restaurant menu customization, ad-dresses accessibility, promoting healthier eating habits. This paper underscores the significance of multimodal HCI in enhancing culinary experiences, setting a precedent for future developments in the field.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"829c4dc200e81c4845918602526d3137901725a5c0376836ba75ec21c9482c3d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
