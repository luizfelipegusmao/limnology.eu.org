{"title":"Exploring IoT and Blockchain: A Comprehensive Survey on Security, Integration Strategies, Applications and Future Research Directions","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1193/v1","date":1726473769000,"content":"The emergence of the Internet of Things (loT) has led to remarkable advancements in various sectors such as urbanization, manufacturing, and healthcare, intending to enhance the quality of life and contribute to the world economy. However, by the conclusion of 2024, ti is projected that the global network of the Internet of Things (IoT) will encompass over 207billion interconnected devices. The immense data collected and exchanged are often stored in centralized servers, leading to vulnerabilities such as data breaches. Blockchain technology, originally developed for cryptocurrency\ntransactions, provides a possible solution for these challenges with its decentralized, immutable, and encrypted features. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion regarding the fusion of Blockchain technology and the loT, covering architectural alignment, application, security, and limitations. The contributions of this survey include an overview of Blockchain technology and its secure applications, the integration of Blockchain into IoT , an examination of suitable methods for Blockchain integration,and a taxonomy or security and limitations of loT and blockchain integration.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ddccb2d01c832c712f691f8b9d68e36ea4b4539e5df3e5ecb0a4dfc6f1959b8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
