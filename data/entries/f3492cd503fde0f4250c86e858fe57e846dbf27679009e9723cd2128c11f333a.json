{"title":"A Hypothesis: Covid-Induced Micro-clots Are Formed Only during Sero-Conversion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0855/v1","date":1712925374000,"content":"The severe and complex COVID-19 symptoms, often needing hospital care, occur suddenly, late in the virus replication stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospitalised patients have tissue damage due to micro-clots at multiple sites. Could long-covid, also clinically variable, be a milder form caused by “nano-clots”, too small to cause detectable tissue damage? The timing and suddenness of the onset of serious disease needs an explanation. A paper reported on the first 20 children needing urgent hospital care. No child had any symptoms prior to suddenly becoming seriously ill, only one had a positive PCR test but all had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. That finding indicated to me that this onset occurred at the moment of sero-conversion. An emerging viral moiety, the virion-IgG-antibody complex, has concentrations rapidly increasing, then decreasing. It is known that influenza-IgG-antibody-complex consists of many virions bound together by the antibody. It seems a reasonable step to propose that SARS-2, being a large virus and having many spike proteins, can form larger clumps of virus-IgG-antibody complexes than with influenza, the former being sufficiently large to initiate micro-clots.  Therefore, my hypotheses is that the SARS-CoV-2 virion-antibody complex initiates micro-clot formation. Either before or after sero-conversion, the complex will be at too low a concentration to initiate micro-clots. To be useful, a hypothesis should be testable, provide explanations and give predictions. My presentation will give examples. I like the way that several apparently separate pieces of a jig-saw puzzle have come together to form a single picture.
