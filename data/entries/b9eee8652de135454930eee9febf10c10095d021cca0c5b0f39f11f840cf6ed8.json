{"title":"Latest Insights and Progress in the Clinical Management of Elderly Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia: From Genetic Advancements to Targeted Treatments","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1677/v1","date":1719223442000,"content":"Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are heterogeneous hematologic cancers that occur prevalently in older patients as the result of a complex pathobiology. The clinical outcomes of older patients with AML, often unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, are generally disappointing. However, recent advances in understanding molecular pathogenesis and other biological mechanisms recognized in AML development and progression have changed the treatment approach, especially for this particularly vulnerable category of patients. Indeed, non-intensive biologically tailored approaches, such as combining venetoclax with hypomethylating agents, have changed the therapeutic paradigm in this field. Moreover, other promising compounds and treatment strategies are currently under advanced clinical development. This article delves into the latest biological understanding and therapeutic advances in the clinical management of older AML patients into new conceptual frameworks that progressively transform the clinical practice in this challenging setting.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b9eee8652de135454930eee9febf10c10095d021cca0c5b0f39f11f840cf6ed8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
