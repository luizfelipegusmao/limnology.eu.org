{"title":"Colorectal Cancer Pulmonary Metastasectomy: When, Why and How","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0936/v1","date":1710511469000,"content":"Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer in males and in females, representing 8% of estimated new cases and the third cause of cancer-related death in both sexes, accounting for 9% of cancer deaths in men and 8% in women. About 20% of patients diagnosed with CRC present metastatic disease. Although lung metachronous or synchronous metastatic spread without other involved sites has been reported in only a small proportion of patients, considering that this tumor is frequently diagnosed, the clinical approach to CRC pulmonary metastases represents a major issue for thoracic surgeons and CRC oncologists. Among patients diagnosed with pulmonary metastases from CRC, about 9 â€“ 12% are eligible for local treatments with radical intent, including surgical resection, SBRT and ablation therapy. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials among different local strategies, there is no definitive evidence about the optimal approach, although surgical resection is considered the most effective therapeutic option in this clinical scenario. Oncological achievement of primary radical resection, the biology of primary tumor and metastatic sites, disease free interval and or progression free survival are independent prognostic factors which make it possible to define a cohort of patients which might significantly benefit from pulmonary metastasectomy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2f1d7d896a4e7bf3b82cf8babbd62a8c36a75cf2d08bafbf47ea461d0d549adf","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
