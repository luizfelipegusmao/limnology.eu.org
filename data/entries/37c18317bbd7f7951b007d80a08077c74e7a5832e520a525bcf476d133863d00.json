{"title":"Factors Affecting Hospital Provision of Health-Promoting Services Transferred to Provincial Administration in Thailand","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1470/v1","date":1721285615000,"content":"Following the transfer of hospital services to provincial government oversight, it is essential to understand how such changes impact service quality and efficiency. This study, conducted from 1 March 2023 to 31 March 2024 at sub-district health-promoting hospitals in Thailand, aims to identify the factors affecting hospital service quality post-transfer and evaluate the role of profes-sional nurses in maintaining service standards under new governance. Utilizing a mixed-methods design based on the Global Fund-HSS framework (2012), which categorizes factors into accessibility, processes, productivity, and outcomes, we collected data from 340 nurses and 400 patients through structured questionnaires. These questionnaires were divided into seven sec-tions, capturing metrics such as the personal data of nurses, hospital service activities, and lead-ership qualities. We employed a Likert scale to gauge perceptions and expectations of service quality and conducted paired t-tests to compare performance metrics before and after the admin-istrative transfer. One-way ANOVA was used to assess variability among different service units, and binary logistic regression helped identify key determinants of service quality. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the attitudes and competencies of healthcare teams and the levels of service quality. Notably, service units transferred less than 50% exhibited mini-mal changes, indicating that the degree of transfer significantly impacts service outcomes. Despite these variations, the fundamental mission of promoting health remained consistent. The study emphasizes the critical role of nurses and recommends further research to identify additional factors that could improve service quality in transferred healthcare facilities, potentially contributing to enhanced healthcare delivery across restructured health systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"37c18317bbd7f7951b007d80a08077c74e7a5832e520a525bcf476d133863d00","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
