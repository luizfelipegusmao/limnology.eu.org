{"title":"“I was given PrEP, but had no privacy”: Mystery shopper perspectives of PrEP counseling for adolescent girls and young women in Kisumu County, Kenya","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309075","date":1724076000000,"content":"<p>by Melissa Vera, Helen Aketch, Caroline Omom, Felix Otieno, George Owiti, Joseph Sila, John Kinuthia, Kristin Beima-Sofie, Jillian Pintye, Valarie Kemunto, Eunita Akim, Grace John-Stewart, Pamela Kohler</p>\r\n\r\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is being scaled up to prevent HIV acquisition among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Eastern and Southern Africa. In a prior study more than one-third of AGYW ‘mystery shoppers’ stated they would not return to care based on interactions with health providers. We examined the experiences of AGYW in this study to identify main barriers to effective PrEP services. Unannounced patient actors (USP/‘mystery shoppers’) posed as AGYWs seeking PrEP using standardized scenarios 8 months after providers had received training to improve PrEP services. We conducted targeted debriefings using open-ended questions to assess PrEP service provision and counseling quality with USPs immediately following their visit. Debriefings were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis to explore why USPs reported either positive or negative encounters. We conducted 91 USP debriefings at 24 facilities and identified three primary influences on PrEP service experiences: 1) Privacy improved likelihood of continuing care, 2) respectful attitudes created a safe environment for USPs, and 3) patient-centered communication improved the experience and increased confidence for PrEP initiation among USPs. Privacy and provider attitudes were primary drivers that influenced decision-making around PrEP in USP debriefs. Access to privacy and improving provider attitudes is important for scale-up of PrEP to AGYW.","author":"Melissa Vera","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"fe77ed8d52eee814f526844bc5f017906de8aae75e8e12399fe5678d2a25b788","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
