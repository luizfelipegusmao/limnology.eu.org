{"title":"Initial Multi-Institutional Experience of Subxiphoid Robotic Thymectomy Using the Single-Port Robotic System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1036/v1","date":1720777938000,"content":"We previously reported our initial experience of subxiphoid single-port robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (SRATS) thymectomy using the single-port robotic surgical system (SPS). However, the potential benefits of this technique remain unknown. Thus, this study examined the multi-institutional experience of SRATS thymectomy and compared perioperative outcomes of this technique with those of subxiphoid single-port video-assisted thoracic surgery (SVATS) thymectomy. Data of patients who underwent subxiphoid SRATS and SVATS thymectomy performed by three thoracic surgeons at three institutions between September 2018 and May 2024 were retrospectively collected. In total, 110 patients were included, with 85 and 25 undergoing SRATS and SVATS thymectomy, respectively. No significant differences were noted in the total operative time (154.46±74.06 vs. 146.76±67.07 min, P=0.674) and conversion rate to median sternotomy (0% vs. 4 %, P=0.227) between the two groups. The SRATS group was associated with a lower conversion rate to multi-port surgery (2% vs. 20%, P=0.006), shorter chest tube drainage duration (1.40±0.94 vs. 2.00±1.29 days, P=0.001), and shorter postoperative hospital stay (2.87±1.26 vs. 5.08±5.20 days, P=0.007). Subxiphoid SRATS thymectomy using the SPS is feasible and can be a good alternative to conventional minimally invasive thymectomy. Further large-scale randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm its benefits.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"16d03c8eafd80ffaf4802af1f35b022371bec4a4b89cdebd357bff9610e1f5f7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
