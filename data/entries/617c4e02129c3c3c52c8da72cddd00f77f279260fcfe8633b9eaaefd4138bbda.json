{"title":"QRGB: App for QR Code Generation (3-in-1 Method), Additive Color Generation Method (RGB), Using Python Programming Code, to Increase Accumulated Information Density","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1384/v1","date":1721217226000,"content":"The present work titled QRGB consists of the development of a Python application for generating QR codes using the additive color generation method (RGB). This innovative method increases the information density stored in QR codes by using three color layers (red, green, and blue), each representing a different data set. QRGB offers an efficient and secure solution for storing and transmitting large amounts of information in limited spaces, significantly improving the capabilities of traditional black-and-white QR codes.By using three color layers (red, green, and blue), QRGB codes can store up to three times more information in the same space. This technique not only increases storage capacity but also enhances information security, making it more difficult to counterfeit or manipulate the code. The superposition of multiple data layers allows for redundancy implementation, increasing the code's robustness against damage or reading errors.QRGB codes are especially useful in applications that require the transmission of large amounts of data in limited spaces, such as in the packaging industry, digital business cards, and interactive advertising. Additionally, they have great potential in areas such as document and ticket security, where the authenticity and integrity of information are crucial.These points provide a solid foundation for understanding the innovation and advantages of colored QR codes (QRGB) compared to traditional QR codes, highlighting their applicability and potential in various sectors.The Python application developed for QRGB utilizes advanced color image processing techniques, applying models and methods to generate and decode QR codes using the RGB color system, thus enhancing information density and security through the innovative use of additive color layers.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"617c4e02129c3c3c52c8da72cddd00f77f279260fcfe8633b9eaaefd4138bbda","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
