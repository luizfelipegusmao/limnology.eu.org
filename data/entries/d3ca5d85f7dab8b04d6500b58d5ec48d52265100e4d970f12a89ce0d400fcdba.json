{"title":"Development of Homemade Indirect ELISA Kit for the Serological Detection of Antibodies Against Mycoplasma galisepticum in Chickens","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1790/v1","date":1729749391000,"content":"Mycoplasma galisepticum (MG) is one of the most significant pathogens of domestic poultry and turkeys, causing substantial economic losses, especially in the commercial poultry industry, resulting in reduced egg production and the condemnation of carcasses in Ethiopian abattoirs due to the lack of detection methods to design control strategies. The study was aimed to develop an in-house indirect ELISA kit that can detect antibodies against MG in chickens. Coated antigen was purified from a whole culture of M. galisepticum, and the protein content was estimated, followed by optimization of the antigen, serum, and conjugate dilutions. The kit was assessed with natural and experimentally prepared serum and compared with a commercial ELISA kit. This in-house indirect ELISA kit had a sensitivity of 93.7% and a specificity of 87.5% and showed no cross-reactivity with positive serum against other avian infections. The current ELISA kit is sensitive and specific and can be used for the detection of antibodies against MG in chickens.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d3ca5d85f7dab8b04d6500b58d5ec48d52265100e4d970f12a89ce0d400fcdba","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
