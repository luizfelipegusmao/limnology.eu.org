{"title":"An insurmountable obstacle: Experiences of Chinese women undergoing in vitro fertilization","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311660","date":1728309600000,"content":"<p>by Xunxun Ying, Yunxian Zhou, Yang Jin, Danhong Wu, Lingling Kong, Pingpei Dong, Xiuling Xu</p>\r\nObjective <p>This study aimed to explore the perceptions of women who have undergone unsuccessful in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, and to explore how treatment failure has impacted their lives and relationships, thereby enabling the public to understand the unique experiences of these women.</p> Design <p>A descriptive qualitative approach was employed, with purposive sampling used to recruit participants from the gynecological department of a traditional Chinese medicine clinic at a large tertiary hospital in Zhejiang province. Twelve women undergoing IVF treatment was involved in the study. Data were collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed verbatim. Conventional content analysis methods were used to analyze the data.</p> Results <p>Following analysis, three main categories emerged: 1) The Psychological Experience of Initial Miscarriage from IVF Treatment, 2) The Psychological Experience of Repeated Treatment Failure, and 3) Interpersonal experiences and challenges. Women experiencing initial failure from IVF treatment reported emotions such as surprise, doubt, sadness, disappointment, and embarrassment. They perceived the process as harder than expected, leading to unexpected daily life challenges and difficulties in achieving success. As unsuccessful attempts persisted, they endured psychological suffering and lived in the shadow of repeated treatment failures. Doubts, perplexity, and anxiety grew, making reproduction seem like an insurmountable obstacle in their lives. In their interpersonal experience, women often felt guilt toward family, faced social isolation, and found it challenging to discuss IVF openly everywhere. They encountered a lack of understanding from others but also found mutual sympathy and support among people who shared similar experiences.</p> Conclusions <p>The study provided an insight into the suffering of Chinese women undergoing IVF treatment, highlighting the challenges of overcoming treatment failures. The findings not only inform Chinese infertile women considering IVF treatment but also contribute to the development of more effective support services by healthcare providers.</p>","author":"Xunxun Ying","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"dc64521001eb03bc315a18b0f284504d0acc86ea25068dfd3e16ddc87f553bc5","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
