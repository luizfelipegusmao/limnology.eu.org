{"title":"Influence of particle size and origin of field peas on apparent ileal digestibility of starch and amino acids and standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids when fed to growing pigs","link":"https://academic.oup.com/tas/article/doi/10.1093/tas/txae008/7604894?rss=1","date":1707523200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The objective was to test the hypothesis that particle size and origin of field peas influence the apparent ileal digestibility (<strong>AID</strong>) of starch, crude protein (<strong>CP</strong>), and amino acids (<strong>AA</strong>) and the standardized ileal digestibility (<strong>SID</strong>) of AA. Three sources of field peas were procured. One source was from the United States and two sources were from Canada. The U.S. source and one of the sources from Canada (i.e., Canada 1) were each divided into two batches and ground to achieve a target particle size of 250 or 450 µm, whereas the other source from Canada (i.e., Canada 2) was only ground to a target particle size of 250 µm. Each batch of field peas was included in one diet as the only source of AA. An N-free diet was used to determine the basal endogenous losses of CP and AA. Six barrows (initial weight: 50.5 kg; SD = 3.7) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum were randomly allotted to a 6 × 6 Latin square design with six diets and six 7-d periods. Ileal digesta from pigs were collected for 2 d after 5 d of adaptation. Data were analyzed using a statistical model that included batch of field peas as the fixed effect and animal and period as the random effects. Contrast statements were used to analyze the effects of particle size, origin, and the interaction between particle size and origin. Results indicated that the AID of starch was increased by reducing the particle size in the U.S. source of field peas, but that was not the case for the Canada 1 source (interaction; <span>P</span> &lt; 0.001). Particle size did not influence the AID of CP or AA, but the Canada 2 source of field peas had greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05) AID of Trp, Ala, Cys, Gly, and Tyr than the field peas from the United States. The SID of CP and AA was also not affected by the particle size of field peas. The SID of CP and Trp was greater (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.05), and the SID of His, Ile, and Thr tended (<span>P</span> &lt; 0.10) to be greater in the Canada 2 source compared with the U.S. source, but no differences between the two Canada sources were observed. In conclusion, a few differences in SID of AA between field peas produced in the United States and peas produced in Canada were observed, but there was no effect on SID of AA of reducing the particle size of field peas from 450 to 250 µm, whereas the AID of starch increased by reducing the particle size only in the field peas from the United States.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Translational Animal Science Current Issue","siteHash":"8d61840e583a2175b88aabf652537e7d7651f335c062d8dd995327edd84f85e0","entryHash":"c1f6e7eef20d09c16c328bf86bd34ebf0b8c959c66f2689094d869bcc9ce003b","category":"Environment"}
