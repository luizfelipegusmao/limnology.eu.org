{"title":"The Utility of C-Reactive Protein, Procalcitonin, and Leukocyte Values in Predicting the Prognosis of Patients with Pneumosepsis and Septic Shock","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1007/v1","date":1723621253000,"content":"Background: The predictive value of changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin and leukocyte levels, which are commonly used in the diagnosis of infection in sepsis and septic shock, remains a topic of debate. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of changes in CRP, procalcitonin, and leukocyte counts on the prognosis of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of pneumosepsis and pneumonia-related septic shock, and to investigate whether any of these markers have a superior predictive value over the others in forecasting prognosis. Methods: The study analyzed the demographic data, Charlson Comorbidity Index score (CCIS), CURB-65 score (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, BP, age â‰¥ 65 years), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores of 230 patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumosepsis and pneumonia-related septic shock between April 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023. The levels of CRP, procalcitonin, and leukocytes were also recorded and analyzed to assess their impact on 1-month and 3-month mortality outcomes. Results: According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, low BMI, male gender, high CCIS, CURB-65, and APACHE-II scores were found to be significantly associated with both 1-month and 3-month mortality (p&lt;0.05). An elevated SOFA score was associated with 1-month mortality, while advanced age was related to 3-month mortality (p&lt;0.05). Although there was no significant relationship between the first-day levels of leukocytes, CRP, and PCT and mortality, their levels on the third day were observed to be at their highest in both 1-month and 3-month mortality cases (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, a concurrent increase in any two or all three of CRP, PCT, and leukocyte values was found to be higher in patients with 3-month mortality compared to those who survived (p=0.004). Discussion: Although PCT, CRP, and leukocyte values measured at the time of admission were not significantly associated with 1-month mortality in patients with pneumosepsis or pneumonia-related septic shock, the persistent elevation and concurrent increase of these values, along with male gender, advanced age, low BMI, and high CCIS, CURB-65, and APACHE-II scores, were found to be significantly associated with 3-month mortality.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1336d966ce732eb5699418fed2ac9fc7dbe2b1fc29c73dd3a503ff52906c12d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
