It is widely accepted that DNA methylation patterns can change in a context-dependent manner, including in response to changing environmental parameters. However, this phenomenon has not been analyzed in animal livestock yet, where it holds major potential for biomarker development. Building on the previous identification of population-specific DNA methylation in clonal marbled crayfish, we have now generated numerous base-resolution methylomes to analyze location-specific DNA methylation patterns. We also describe the time-dependent conversion of epigenetic signatures upon transfer from one environment to another. We further demonstrate production system-specific methylation signatures in shrimp, river-specific signatures in salmon and farm-specific signatures in chicken. Together, our findings provide a detailed resource for epigenetic variation in animal livestock and suggest the possibility for origin tracing of animal products by epigenetic fingerprinting.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Environmental Epigenetics Current Issue","siteHash":"5549213f473d96cee0cf7ca1db1da1a69239cc267977bfd813fd34781f2cddbb","entryHash":"21b9f5fe551a0f66db70b54f34f322ddc9f832a935977022d52afa12e8b4cbc4","category":"Environment"}
