{"title":"Application of Κ-Carrageenan for One-Pot Synthesis of Hybrids of Curcumin Natural with Iron and Copper: Stability Analysis and Application in Papilloscopy","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0766/v1","date":1728548466000,"content":"In this study, hybrid materials were synthesized incorporating curcumin, Cu²⁺ or Fe³⁺, and Kappa-carrageenan as a reducing agent to improve its stability, considering that curcumin has low thermal and solution stability, which limits its applications. Colorimetric analysis showed color changes in the hybrids, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy revealed band shifts in the hybrids, and infrared analysis indicated shifts in wavenumbers, suggesting changes in the vibrational state of curcumin after bonding with metal ions. These techniques confirmed the formation of the hybrid materials. Thermogravimetric and chromatographic analyses demonstrated greater thermal and solution stability for the hybrids compared to curcumin. Additionally, the hybrid composites effectively developed natural and sebaceous latent fingerprints with good clarity and contrast on glass surfaces. Both composites performed similarly to commercial gold powder. When applied to surfaces representative of forensic scenarios, the composites were versatile, revealing sufficient fingerprint details for human identification on both porous and non-porous surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy images showed greater clarity in sebaceous and natural fingerprints developed with the Fe composite compared to the Cu composite, due to minimal interaction of Fe with the glass surface.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4658e379a232940c763b3166c01f714c73e4c61ff377d01db766af42b51f1be4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
