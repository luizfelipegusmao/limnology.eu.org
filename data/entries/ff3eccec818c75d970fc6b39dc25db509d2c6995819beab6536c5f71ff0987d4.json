{"title":"The role of histone acetylation in transcriptional regulation and seed development","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/194/4/1962/7429008?rss=1","date":1700265600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Histone acetylation is highly conserved across eukaryotes and has been linked to gene activation since its discovery nearly 60 years ago. Over the past decades, histone acetylation has been evidenced to play crucial roles in plant development and response to various environmental cues. Emerging data indicate that histone acetylation is one of the defining features of “open chromatin,” while the role of histone acetylation in transcription remains controversial. In this review, we briefly describe the discovery of histone acetylation, the mechanism of histone acetylation regulating transcription in yeast and mammals, and summarize the research progress of plant histone acetylation. Furthermore, we also emphasize the effect of histone acetylation on seed development and its potential use in plant breeding. A comprehensive knowledge of histone acetylation might provide new and more flexible research perspectives to enhance crop yield and stress resistance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"ff3eccec818c75d970fc6b39dc25db509d2c6995819beab6536c5f71ff0987d4","category":"Environment"}
