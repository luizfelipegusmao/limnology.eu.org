{"title":"Local Structure Information Learning for Small Dataset Fine-Grained Visual Classification Based on Spatial Frequency Domain Fusion","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0630/v1","date":1725877159000,"content":"In small data set learning, obtaining a large number of training samples from the source class for transfer learning is a challenge for fine-grained visual classification. Based on the fact that fine-grained concepts can be learned with very few samples, we use very few labeled samples (for example, three) in each category. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing the subtle differences between fine-grained images, we propose a local structure information extraction method of SDFGVC based on spatial frequency features. The proposed learning module enhances the ability of the network to find significant regions and shows excellent performance in experiments on six datasets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4f935f08a2acbdf68605868786c6b5101c38eda23a2102118757921aa7344908","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
