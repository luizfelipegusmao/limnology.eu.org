They are crucial for metabolic regulation in cyanobacteria, but the key redox-regulated central processes remain to be determined. Physiological, metabolic, and transcriptomic characterization of a conditional mutant of the essential <span>Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803 thioredoxin <span>trxA</span> gene (STXA2) revealed that decreased TrxA levels alter cell morphology and induce a dormant-like state. Furthermore, TrxA depletion in the STXA2 strain inhibited protein synthesis and led to changes in amino acid pools and nitrogen/carbon reserve polymers, accompanied by oxidation of the elongation factor-Tu. Transcriptomic analysis of TrxA depletion in STXA2 revealed a robust transcriptional response. Downregulated genes formed a large cluster directly related to photosynthesis, ATP synthesis, and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In contrast, upregulated genes were grouped into different clusters related to respiratory electron transport, carotenoid biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and protein degradation, among others. These findings highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern cyanobacterial metabolism, where TrxA acts as a critical regulator that orchestrates the transition from anabolic to maintenance metabolism and regulates carbon and nitrogen balance.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"a70547ed98cb59fedfa98d8a957750c3244459fcfc3e737e5ba488aea51743a7","category":"Environment"}
