{"title":"Penman&ndash;Monteith Reference Evapotranspiration Estimation Models, Using Latitude&ndash;Temperature Data, in the State of Sinaloa, Mexico","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0308/v1","date":1717594100000,"content":"The goal of this study is to create regression models estimating the daily Penman–Monteith reference evapotranspiration (PMR) using latitude–temperature data for the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. Daily series of minimum–maximum temperature (1979–2017) were obtained from seven weather stations in Sinaloa. The reference evapotranspiration was calculated by the methods of Penman–Monteith using empirical equations (PMC), Hargreaves (HAC), and PMR. Prior to calculating PMC, the incident solar radiation (SR) was calculated. From the Acaponeta station (2005–2008, 2011–2013 and 2015–2017), all complete observed variables were obtained: mean temperature, incident solar radiation (SRg), average relative humidity and average wind speed at a height of 10 m. The data from the eight weather stations were provided by the National Meteorological Service and the National Water Commission. The daily observed Penman–Monteith reference evapotranspiration (PMO) was calculated. For validation, three simple linear regressions (SLR) were applied: SR vs SRg, PMC vs PMO and PMR vs PMO. hypothesis tests were applied to each SLR: Pearson correlation (Pr) vs critical Pearson correlation (Pcr). All rP were significantly different from zero (&amp;gt; |0.576|): SRg vs SR (Pr = 0.951), PMC vs PMO (Pr = 0.592), and PMR vs PMO (Pr = 0.625). This study provides new models that can motivate and support the design and implementation of intelligent irrigation in the state considered “the breadbasket of Mexico.”","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f6f7d3c51aa42b77a27cbc78ad2d1847c859e7435c2cfbc8a6c7d6266c337887","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
