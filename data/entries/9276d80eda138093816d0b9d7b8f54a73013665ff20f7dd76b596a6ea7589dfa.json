{"title":"Occurrence of Freshwater Stingrays in the Uatum&atilde; River Basin, Amazon Region: A Field Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0432/v1","date":1712307882000,"content":"The Amazon region has the most incredible diversity of freshwater stingrays; however, there are still places where information about this group is scarce. The present work aims to record the occurrence of freshwater stingrays in the Uatumã river basin, Amazonas, Brazil. For this, collections were carried out in three municipalities bathed by the Uatumã River, Presidente Figueiredo, Itapiranga and São Sebastião do Uatumã. The rays were collected through fishing using a hand net and, after capture, were identified through the pattern of the dorsal and ventral color of the disc, the absence or presence of the labial groove and the organization of the row of spines on the tail, too were also measured, weighed and sexed. In total, 69 specimens of Potamotrygonines were captured, 59 of which were from the genus Potamotrygon and ten individuals from the genus Paratrygon. The present study provides preliminary information on the characteristics of freshwater stingray species that may occur in the Uatumã River. Furthermore, new research is necessary to improve the identification of specimens to determine the diversity and elucidate aspects related to the biology of elasmobranchs in the Uatumã River Basin, Brazil.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9276d80eda138093816d0b9d7b8f54a73013665ff20f7dd76b596a6ea7589dfa","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
