{"title":"Investigation of Aluminium White Dross for Hydrogen Generation via Hydrolysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1503/v1","date":1713855478000,"content":"In this work various sample of primary aluminum dross were investigated for composition and evaluation of hydrogen generation via hydrolysis in low concentration alkali solution. Composi-tion revealed low to moderate aluminium content and hydrolysis reactions showed low hydrogen generation volumes per sample mass as well as purity, where composition plays substantial role in the hydrogen evolution, yet showing that there is possible place for dross use in hydrogen generation. It was revealed that some dross samples in addition to hydrogen also release methane via hydrolysis. Rection rate was obtained by the shrinking core model, written for spherical solid particles. Sample composition on hydrogen generation volume is compared to known literature.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7d8a40ccdb3fd6215a210e5f112df512945105a505b63e2e8c041238bc5cf7d3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
