{"title":"Second Victims among Austrian Nurses (SeViD-A2 Study)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1980/v1","date":1724838818000,"content":"Background: The Second Victim Phenomenon (SVP) significantly impacts the well-being of healthcare professionals and patient safety. While SVP has been explored in various healthcare settings, there is limited data on its prevalence and associated factors among nurses in Austria. This study investigates the prevalence, symptomatology, and preferred support measures for SVP among Austrian nurses. Methods: A nationwide, cross-sectional, anonymous online survey was conducted using the SeViD questionnaire (Second Victims in German-speaking Countries), which includes the Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10). Statistical analyses included binary logistic regression and multiple linear regression using the bootstrapping, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) method based on 5000 bootstrap samples. Results: 928 participants responded to the questionnaire. Among the respondents, 81.58% (744/912) identified as Second Victims (SVs). The primary cause of becoming a SV was aggressive behavior from patients or relatives. Females reported a higher symptom load than males, and higher agreeableness was linked to increased symptom severity. Notably, 92.47% of SVs who sought help preferred support from colleagues, and the most pronounced desire among participants was to process the event for better understanding. Conclusions: The prevalence of SVP among Austrian nurses is alarmingly high, with aggressive behavior identified as a significant trigger. The findings emphasize the necessity for tailored support strategies, including peer support and systematic organizational interventions to mitigate the impact of SVP on nurses and to improve overall patient care. Further research should focus on developing and implementing effective prevention and intervention programs for healthcare professionals in similar settings.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4ede8993e082b6f6d6aeb933a828ce7673da6db1a84dc68182014cd54456eb21","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
