{"title":"Synergizing Systems Thinking and Technology-Enhanced Learning Using the Flow Theory Framework","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0174/v1","date":1725341384000,"content":"In an era where digital technologies are integral to daily life, developing higher-order thinking skills with appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) support is crucial. The purpose of this study was to examine synergies of systems thinking and technology-enhanced learning from the perspective of flow theory. For that purpose, we surveyed more than 65 pre-service preschool teachers engaged in a design, technology, and engineering (DTE) course at the University of Ljubljana. Mapping of systems thinking revealed that pre-service preschool teachers needed support with regard to feedback and understanding the interrelationship dimen-sion of systems thinking. Predictive and mediation analyses yielded some interesting results. Those who participated in the ICT-enhanced DTE course showed higher cognitive and social engage-ment, which is correlated with better systems thinking, while their aesthetic engagement was lower. Experiencing a flow state during ICT activities positively influenced systems thinking, par-ticularly in terms of clear goals and autotelic experiences. Flow theory seems to be a solid and ap-propriate framework to use for studying synergies in technology-enhanced systems thinking for sustainable education. These findings underscore the importance of integrating systems thinking into curricula to enhance learning outcomes and prepare students for future challenges toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"df76802288f98d443325ea387a07b66bd0329d416f2045f627886f661707cfc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
