{"title":"Enhancing Supply Chain Efficiency with Time Series Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0983/v1","date":1726136973000,"content":"Accurate forecasting and efficient management of commodities are crucial for stakeholders in the industry, given the volatile nature of these markets. This study addresses these needs by leveraging advanced forecasting techniques and machine learning models to predict prices and enhance supply chain efficiency. TThe focus is on utilizing ARIMA, SARIMAX, and LSTM models to analyze historical trading data for commodities such as cocoa, coffee, and sugar sourced from Kaggleâ€™s comprehensive dataset. The research applies ARIMA and SARIMAX models to forecast price trends, overcoming initial challenges related to data index frequency and seasonality. LSTM models are employed for more nuanced demand forecasting, particularly for random-length lumber, demonstrating the model's capability to predict future market trends accurately. The study highlights significant improvements in prediction accuracy and supply chain management through meticulous feature engineering and model optimization, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the supply chain sector.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fe83d645e6e32e47fc2a9785caab0a8082243f8a2e3b02fda6dbfe4213b41bc0","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
