{"title":"The Original and A Saudi-Modified Screening Tools for The Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics: Diagnostic Accuracy cross-sectional Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1419/v1","date":1724160858000,"content":"Background: Malnutrition screening in hospitalized children is essential, and the STAMP is a val-idated tool for this purpose. The study aimed to modify STAMP for a Saudi context and assess the sensitivity and specificity of both the original and modified tools. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 307 hospitalized children, where both the original and Saudi-modified STAMP were applied. Anthropometric measurements were also recorded, and statistical analysis was used to assess the tools' validity. Results: The Saudi-modified STAMP identified a higher percentage of children at high risk of malnutrition compared to the original STAMP (91.6% vs. 62.9%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and agreement of the Saudi-modified STAMP compared to the original were 94.3%, 13.2%, 64.8%, 57.7%, 0.654, and 0.089, respectively. Conclusion: The Saudi-modified STAMP showed excellent sensitivity and varied negative predictive value, indicating its potential effectiveness in screening for malnutrition among hospitalized children compared to the original STAMP and using an-thropometric measurements as references.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"04a4eb2d0150e1a2c954c9579fc1a3e794fd59f92f96d9079d2792a74e13b82a","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
