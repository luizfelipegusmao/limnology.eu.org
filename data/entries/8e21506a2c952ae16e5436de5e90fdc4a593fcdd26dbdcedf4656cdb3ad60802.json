{"title":"Finite Element Analysis versus Empirical Modal Analysis of a Basketball Rim and Backboard","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0758/v1","date":1710313197000,"content":"The ANSYS 2024R1 student edition was used to create a finite element model of a basketball rim and backboard. This finite element model included the use of steel for the rim and its mount, a tempered glass backboard, and an aluminum frame behind the backboard. After a mesh was created, fixed support boundary conditions were applied to the four corners of the aluminum frame. The subsequently calculated mode shapes and frequencies were compared to empirical modal analysis previously done at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Four mode shapes and frequencies agreed rather well between the theoretical finite element analysis and previously published empirical modal analysis, specifically where the rim was vibrating in the vertical direction, which was the direction that the accelerometer was aligned for modal analysis. However, three mode shapes missed by the empirical modal analysis were found where the vibration of the rim was confined to the horizontal plane, which was orthogonal to the orientation of our accelerometer.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"8e21506a2c952ae16e5436de5e90fdc4a593fcdd26dbdcedf4656cdb3ad60802","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
