{"title":"A Comparative Literature Review of Patch Antennas and Dipole Antennas in Wireless Communication","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0456/v1","date":1720099363000,"content":"In the constantly growing field of wireless communication, antenna selection has a considerable influence on system performance, efficiency, and dependability. This paper gives a thorough comparison of patch antennas and dipole antennas, two of the most common forms used in wireless communication. Patch antennas are distinguished by their low profile, ease of production, and integration with microwave electronics, as opposed to dipole antennas, which have become known for their simplicity, omnidirectional emission patterns, and broad application. The discussion begins with an explanation of the basic concepts, design considerations, and operational characteristics of patch and dipole antennas. Key performance criteria including bandwidth, gain, radiation efficiency, polarization, and impedance matching are assessed using theoretical considerations and actual applications. Case studies from modern wireless applications, such as mobile communication, Wi-Fi networks, and Internet of Things devices, are used to demonstrate the strengths and limits of each antenna type in real-world circumstances.The comparative literature review additionally explores advanced strategies for improving the performance of patch and dipole antennas, such as the use of metamaterials, reconfigurable components, and new substrate materials. Comparative models and experimental findings illustrate the trade-offs between size, cost, and performance, assisting engineers and researchers in determining the best antenna type for certain applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1e593df0f2e4bfc670ce9d0110780d3d50b2c5db141d1bf607c5b633ead2be69","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
