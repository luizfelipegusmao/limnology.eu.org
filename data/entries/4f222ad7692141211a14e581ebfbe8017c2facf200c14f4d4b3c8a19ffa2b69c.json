{"title":"Physiological properties of Neoporphyra haitanensis conchocelis in response to different temperature","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.16067?af=R","date":1667394512000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Temperature is one of the major factors controlling the growth and development of <i>Pyropia</i>. Here, we set out to discover the most important changes arising at the growth rate, ultrastructure, lipids and low-molecular-weight carbohydrates of <i>Neoporphyra haitanensis</i> conchocelis under low temperature (12°C), mid-temperature (23°C) and high temperature (28°C). Results showed that lower growth rate was at 12°C, while the conchosporangia formed under 28°C. Thicker cell wall was under 28°C. Larger size of plastoglobuli exhibited under 12°C. Less total contents of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols, digalactosyldiacylglycerols, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols and phosphatidylinositols were under 12°C, while more total contents of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols and triglycerides were under 12°C. The ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols, monogalactosyldiacylglycerols, digalactosyldiacylglycerols, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols increased at 12°C and decreased at 28°C. The contents of floridoside and isofloridoside were more under 12 and 28°C than that under 23°C. Taken together, these findings indicated that temperature affected the physiological properties of <i>Neoporphyra haitanensis</i>.</p>","author":"Xiujuan Wang, \nDonghuan Fu, \nHui Zhu, \nPeng Zhang, \nYubo Wu, \nYanrong Li","siteTitle":"Wiley: Aquaculture Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"cda0a545b1dc6c99e9df3430a4cdd52070596f30f0a34f537ad0a3d28cdc2bfc","entryHash":"4f222ad7692141211a14e581ebfbe8017c2facf200c14f4d4b3c8a19ffa2b69c","category":"Environment"}
