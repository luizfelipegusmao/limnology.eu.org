{"title":"Advanced Delivery of Curcumin and Nicotinamide: Promising Solutions for Skin Infections and Melanoma","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1541/v1","date":1724233238000,"content":"Abstract\nRecently many medications are derived from natural substances that have a potential to fight diseases. These bioactive compounds such as curcumin (CUR) and nicotinamide (NIC) have an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activity and boosting the immune system. \nAim: This study aims to evaluate antibacterial and antimelanoma activity of CUR-NIC combination and their liposomal preparation. \nMethod: Activity of CUR-NIC was investigated against skin infection bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cytotoxicity assay for melanoma B16 cancer cell line using MTT and migration assays.\nResults:  The CUR and CUR-NIC (1:1) combination and showed an inhibition zone against S. aureus of 18±0.8 mm and MIC 31.25 µg/ml compared to 16 ±0.85 and 62.5 µg/ml, respectively. The cytotoxicity assay for melanoma B16 cancer cell line revealed that the of CUR and NIC combination synergistically reduced cell proliferation with (CI&lt; 1). Indeed, liposomal preparation showed cytotoxic effect of Lip-CUR (IC50= 31.4 ± 3.2), Lip-NIC (IC50=190 ± 7.3) and Lip-CUR-NIC (IC50 8.5 ± 0.3) while CUR showed IC50 of 9.8 ± 2.2µM and NIC (IC50 135.95 ±10.2 µM). \nConclusion: synergistic effect when curcumin and nicotinamide are combined, potentially offering a more effective cancer treatment strategy.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9471d5cff5b2bd9f0d24283bf5c65bea2e6b91b2759cbe230449e6bb2c89a2b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
