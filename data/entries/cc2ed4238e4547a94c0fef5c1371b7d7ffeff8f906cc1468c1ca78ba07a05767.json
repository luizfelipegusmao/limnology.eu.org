The congruence of three species delimitation analyses (mPTP, bGMYC and ASAP), nuclear DNA topology and morphological evidence resulted in nine operational taxonomic units in the genus <span>Iphisa</span>. Besides being recovered as monophyletic groups in mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenetic trees, these nine operational taxonomic units can be distinguished by external and hemipenial morphology. Finally, we propose a new taxonomic rearrangement of the genus, whereby we: (i) restrict <span>I. elegans</span> to north-east Amazonia in the Guiana Shield and southwards, west from the Purusâ€“Madeira interfluvium, on the right bank of the Amazon River; (ii) elevate <span>Iphisa elegans soinii</span> Dixon, 1974 to the specific level <span>Iphisa soinii</span> Dixon, 1974 comb. nov.; and (iii) name and describe five new species.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"cc2ed4238e4547a94c0fef5c1371b7d7ffeff8f906cc1468c1ca78ba07a05767","category":"Environment"}
