{"title":"An Innovation Management Approach for Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2004/v1","date":1721892553000,"content":"With more companies entering the realm of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL), and governments enacting policies to support the development of low-altitude economies, the commercial potential of eVTOL is being recognized by the public. However, true commercialization is still a long way off. This article analyzes the technologies, product features, potential markets, and government policies related to eVTOL, and constructs a four-stage, four-layer Policy-Technology Roadmap (P-TRM) model to guide the R&amp;D process of eVTOL. Then transform it into a system structural model, and the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used to identify several key nodes in the R&amp;D process. Utilizing the Technology Adoption Life Cycle (TALC) theory for interpretation and analysis, the article concludes by proposing strategies in product, technology, and policy support for how eVTOL can successfully cross the chasm. This preliminary analysis of the development path, key nodes, and necessary measures for crossing the chasm provides insights for the R&amp;D and commercialization of eVTOL.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"6b0f0a75335f5dc44ceb1a32a682d0aafc5a8837c3575a5df52b022632001697","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
