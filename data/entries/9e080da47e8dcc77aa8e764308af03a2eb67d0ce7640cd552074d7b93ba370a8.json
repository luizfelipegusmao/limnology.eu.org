I found that endangered native plant species have a dispersal ecology that is broadly comparable to that of non-native plants, which are known to frequently spread from managed green spaces. The key takeaway from this study for practitioners is that integrating at-risk native plant species into our green spaces could help to promote an essential aspect of species survival: dispersal.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>\n\nAmidst climate change, enhancing plant dispersal pathways is crucial for adapting ecosystems and preserving biodiversity. In our human-dominated landscapes, urban and rural green spaces, especially gardens, are promising conduits for plant dispersal. Non-native plants are known to benefit from these spaces, yet the potential benefits for at-risk native plants remain unclear.\n\nHere, I synthesized data on dispersal traits, comparing endangered native plants with non-endangered and non-native species in Germany. To make my analysis pertinent to understanding the potential role of gardens in aiding the dispersal of at-risk native plants, I further contrasted the dispersal ecology of garden-friendly endangered plants with non-native plants known to escape gardens. I analysed several traits including seed weight, terminal velocity, dispersal distance, germination rate, dispersal mode, seed structures and seedbank type.\n\nOverall, dispersal traits between native and non-native plants showed minor, but in some cases statistically significant differences. Endangered plants were more often wind-dispersed and more frequently had seed appendages conducive to a wider range of dispersal vectors. Conversely, non-native plants leaned more towards non-assisted local dispersal, heavier seeds and more persistent seed banks. Other traits were largely consistent across groups.\n\nThis research shows that endangered native plants possess a dispersal ecology similar to non-native species, which frequently spread from green spaces like gardens. Thus, integrating endangered flora into our green spaces could help to promote an essential aspect of species survival: dispersal.\n</p>","author":"Ingmar R.
