{"title":"Caregivers of People with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Potential Ally to Enhance Delivery of Nutrition Care","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0803/v1","date":1725959411000,"content":"Background/Objectives: Caregivers play an important role in supporting care recipients to navigate their health needs including adherence to dietary recommendations which are complex and multifaceted. The study aimed to i) describe the nutrition knowledge of caregivers of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and ii) explore caregivers’ perception of their role in providing healthy meals and nutrition support for care recipients. Methods: Caregivers (n=78) of people with stage 1-5 CKD or post-transplant were recruited from a single centre. A sequential mixed-methods approach was used. Nutrition knowledge was assessed with the revised General Nutrition Knowledge questionnaire. Theory informed semi-structured interviews in a sub-sample (n=12) explored caregiver perception. Results: Most caregivers were female (75.6%) caring for a male care recipient (87%; aged 74 (66;80) yrs.). Caregivers (75.6%) provided a meal ≥6 times/week to their care recipient and had moderate nutrition knowledge (66.1 (60.5; 73.9) %). Four themes emerged describing caregivers’ perception on meal provision and nutrition support including i) food literacy skills are valued, ii) social support is important, iii) caregivers’ sense of social responsibility, and iv) meal provision is complex and dynamic. Conclusions: Caregivers have moderate nutrition knowledge; they want to provide healthy meals and support to care recipients to adhere to dietary recommendations. Targeted, co-designed nutrition education programs for caregivers may enhance nutrition care delivery to people with CKD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"65b8a7ac0d33c15cd61c347e7d00351543e8746ffb3b25e819e36dc924e4daeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
