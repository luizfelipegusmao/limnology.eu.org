{"title":"Experience-Sharing as an Inclusive Travel Practice for Blind and Partially Sighted People","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0326/v1","date":1722869508000,"content":"Access to travel information is crucial for blind and partially sighted (BPS) people in travel planning. However, finding relevant information can be complex and challenging due to the unavailability of appropriate information and accessible information sources. To investigate this issue, a mixed-method study consisting of semi-structured interviews and co-design workshops was conducted to identify the needs of BPS people and the barriers BPS people experience due to the lack of access to such information. The findings provide insights into the information-seeking process and highlight the role of experience-sharing in cultivating a sense of agency, contribution, and interdependence. We contribute an accessible tourism ecosystem based on our findings to motivate research on technologies to support inclusive leisure travel for BPS people and to inform the design of inclusive tourism services.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"feb657c6f16289519c7d9e8794447fa0da73630e638307aa4dc3a4a17e50e9e4","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
