CSRO is typically characterized indirectly, using volume-averaged (e.g. X-ray/neutron scattering) or through projection (i.e. two-dimensional) microscopy techniques that fail to capture the complex, three-dimensional (3D) atomistic architectures. Quantitative assessment of CSRO and concrete structure-property relationships have remained so far unachievable. Fe-Al alloys, known for their lightweight nature and exceptional strength, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance, present ideal candidates for theoretical studies on ordering transformations. Undeformed Fe-Al alloys, particularly those with compositions near the boundary of the disorder-order transition, when annealed at e.g., 523 K and subsequently quenched, often exhibit an anomalous increase in electrical resistivity. This peculiar behavior is attributed to the K-state, initially identified in 1951 and commonly associated with D0<sub>3</sub>-CSRO (Fe<sub>3</sub>Al-like), marking the onset of long-range ordering reactions. Similar K-state behavior was observed in other Fe-X (X=Si, Ga, Cr) alloys. However, the underlying mechanisms of the K-state remain unclear, and the quantitative characterization of CSRO poses a significant challenge.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"7b92f69ee2433f65af1129664b967bfcb88ddb7fe9fa8b9ee9e9bef63b7cc131","category":"Environment"}
