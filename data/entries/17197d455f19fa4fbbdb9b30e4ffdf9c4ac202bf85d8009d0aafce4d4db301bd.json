{"title":"Seeing the Trees Without the Forest: What and How can Agroforestry and Urban Forestry Learn from Each Other?","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40725-024-00221-9","date":1722470400000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Purpose of Review</h3>\n                      <p>Agroforestry and urban forestry have evolved mainly as separate disciplines, although they share a long history of tree cultivation in man-made environments. Here, we review their common threads, exploring how trees in both systems interact with and shape their environments. We examine common themes and methodologies – ranging from tree growth dynamics to environmental stressors, ecosystem services provision, and questions of governance – and identify opportunities for synergies between these fields.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Recent Findings</h3>\n                      <p>We emphasize the potential of agroforestry and urban forestry for enhancing multifunctional landscapes. Geographical divides in research are evident, with agroforestry predominantly studied in the Global South and urban forestry receiving more attention in the Global North. However, significant research gaps provide avenues for collaboration, for instance, addressing challenges in capturing the monetary and socio-cultural value of ecosystem services and environmental justice considerations.</p>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                      <h3>Summary</h3>\n                      <p>In light of the growing need for integrated approaches in addressing contemporary challenges, from climate change mitigation and adaptation to community well-being, our review explores what these research fields can learn from each other and provides recommendations for fostering greater interdisciplinary dialogue and new avenues for collaborations in a meaningful and synergistic manner, aiming to advance policy, research, and practice in agroforestry and urban forestry.</p>\n                    </span>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Environment","siteHash":"64455e3c11ee7d19661e3f0c9bc69bdeacdb46a64041908256c3ac2895bbf514","entryHash":"17197d455f19fa4fbbdb9b30e4ffdf9c4ac202bf85d8009d0aafce4d4db301bd","category":"Environment"}
