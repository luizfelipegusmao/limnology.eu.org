{"title":"Adaptation of the Taiwan version of the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT-TW) and Its Association with Six-Month Mortality: A Multi-Center Validation Study in Older People","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2150/v1","date":1727432185000,"content":"The Supportive and Palliative Indicators Tool (SPICT) was developed for timely identifying patients who may benefit from supportive and palliative care for a better treatment review, care plan discussion, and end-of-life care. Although the SPICT has been validated in different languages and patients living in different settings, it has not been validated in patients receiving home-based medical care (HBMC), or in the context of using traditional Chinese characters. The present study aimed to validate the Taiwan version of SPICT (SPICT-TW) and to measure its ability to predict six-month mortality in patients who received HBMC in Taiwan. Seven HBMC agents (five clinics and two hospitals) participated in this validation study. We recruited 129 patients aged â‰¥50 years who had been consistently receiving HBMC for &amp;gt; two months. The results revealed that the SPICT-TW demonstrated similar reliability and validity compared to other language versions of SPICT. It may be an appropriate tool for healthcare professionals to timely detect the needs of palliative care in older people who received home healthcare. Furthermore, we found that a combination of four general indicators and one clinical indicator in SPCIT-TW has the best prediction ability at predicting six-month mortality in these HMBC recipients. This multicenter study validated the SPICT-TW among HBMC recipients in Taiwan. SPICT-TW demonstrated high reliability and validity and may be a practical tool for identifying older people at risk of dying within six months who would benefit from palliative care.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f3f82785b297b2aae73ea9a13a81b63e2ca925839abd3b3730ee1fead028b7e8","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
