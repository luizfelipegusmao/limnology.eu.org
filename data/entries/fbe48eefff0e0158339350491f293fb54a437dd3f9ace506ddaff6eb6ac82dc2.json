{"title":"Invasive Fungal Infections of the Head & Neck: A Tertiary Hospital Experience","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1808/v1","date":1716882642000,"content":"From the existing millions of fungal species only a few cause disease. In this study, we investigated invasive fungal infections in the head and neck over a 19-year period (2005 to 2024) at a large academic healthcare system. Among 413 cases, 336 were noninvasive, and 77 were invasive. The highest incidence of invasive infections occurred in the sinonasal cavities, with a 15-fold difference compared to other sites. Most infections affected adults over 40 years old. The most common organisms were Mucorales (51%), hyaline molds (29%), and Candida (11%). Risk factors included malignancy, transplant, diabetes, and illicit drug use. Mortality was high in patients with malignancy and/or transplant. Infections affecting the mandible were usually a complication of osteoradionecrosis and were associated with coinfection of Candida and Actinomyces. At other sites, infections were rare and were usually the result of penetrating injuries or immunosuppression. Treatment typically involved a combination of antifungals and surgical procedures.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"fbe48eefff0e0158339350491f293fb54a437dd3f9ace506ddaff6eb6ac82dc2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
