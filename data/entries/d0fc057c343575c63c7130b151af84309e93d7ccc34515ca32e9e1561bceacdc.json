{"title":"Exploring the Complex Interplay of Obesity, Allergic Diseases, and Sleep-Disordered Breathing In Children","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1806/v1","date":1711702205000,"content":"Furthermore, the nasal congestion typical of rhinitis can contribute to upper airway obstruction and sleep-disordered breathing. A vicious circle is created between asthma and sleep-disordered breathing: uncontrolled asthma and sleep-disordered breathing can worsen each other. In children with genetic obesity, despite alterations in the immune system, fewer allergies are found compared to the general population. The causes of this reduced allergenicity are unclear but probably involve genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. The study emphasizes the importance of jointly evaluating and managing allergies, obesity, and sleep-disordered breathing in children, considering their close interconnection.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d0fc057c343575c63c7130b151af84309e93d7ccc34515ca32e9e1561bceacdc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
