{"title":"In situ green synthesis of hybrid lead nanoparticles encased in phytochemicals for antimicrobial applications","link":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ep.14303?af=R","date":1709812904000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Previously, organic immobilization matrices were used, but this study demonstrates a novel approach by utilizing in situ-produced phytochemicals to encase the lead nanoparticles. The process involves reducing lead acetate with ingredients from <i>Peganum harmala</i> leaves to create a hydride-lead nanoparticle-phytochemical grid. To investigate the morphology and synthesis of the lead nanoparticles, a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic methods were employed. The available information indicates that the hybrid PbNPS exhibits an average nucleation site size of 14.60, indicating the presence of nanoparticles with relatively uniform sizes ranging from 12 to 19. Furthermore, the hybrid PbNPS displayed remarkable antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, with inhibition zones measuring 28 and 30.0 mm, respectively, when tested at a concentration of 200 μg/mL. This finding highlights two significant aspects of this research. First, the utilization of phytochemicals as a collector for the straightforward extraction of toxic lead from an aqueous medium represents a novel and innovative approach. Second, the extracted material exhibits promising antibacterial activity, presenting potential applications in the fight against bacterial infections.</p>","author":"N. E.
