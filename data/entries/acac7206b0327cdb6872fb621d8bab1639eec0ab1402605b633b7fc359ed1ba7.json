{"title":"Multifaceted Properties of Usnic Acid in Disrupting Cancer Hallmarks","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0022/v1","date":1725271831000,"content":"Cancer, a complex group of diseases marked by uncontrolled cell growth and invasive behavior, is characterized by distinct hallmarks acquired during tumor development. These hallmarks, first proposed by Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg in 2000, provide a framework for un-derstanding cancer's complexity. Targeting them is a key strategy in cancer therapy. It includes inhibiting abnormal signaling, reactivating growth suppressors, preventing invasion and me-tastasis, inhibiting angiogenesis, limiting replicative immortality, modulating the immune sys-tem, inducing apoptosis, addressing genome instability, and regulating cellular energetics. \nUsnic acid (UA) is a natural compound found in lichens that has been explored as a cytotoxic agent against cancer cells of different origins. Although the exact mechanisms remain incom-pletely understood, UA presents a promising compound for therapeutic intervention. Under-standing its impact on cancer hallmarks provides valuable insights into the potential of UA in developing targeted and multifaceted cancer therapies.\nThis article explores UA activity in the context of disrupting hallmarks in cancer cells of different origins based on articles that emphasize the molecular mechanisms of this activity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"acac7206b0327cdb6872fb621d8bab1639eec0ab1402605b633b7fc359ed1ba7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
