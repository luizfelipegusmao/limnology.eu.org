The study objective was to determine the association between specific anthropometric parameters and short-term chemotherapy-related complications and mortality. This was a hospital-based, prospective cohort study of children, age â‰¤12 years, with a new cancer diagnosis at the Paediatric Oncology Unit, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana. Socio-demographic information, cancer characteristics and anthropometric measurements were obtained at enrolment. Participants were followed up for twelve weeks from commencement of chemotherapy and selected treatment-related complications such as anaemia and thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions, prolonged neutropenia resulting in treatment delays, febrile neutropenia, mucositis and death were recorded. A total of 133 participants were recruited with a median age of 4.5 years. Eighty-one (60.9%) were diagnosed with solid tumours, 31 (23.3%) had leukaemias and 21 (15.8%) had lymphomas. Of the anthropometric parameters assessed, only arm anthropometry using upper arm muscle area (UAMA) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were associated with complications. Participants with wasting were more likely to develop anaemia and mucositis. However, the incidence of prolonged neutropenia was significantly higher among participants with average UAMA (p = 0.043) and low average UAMA (p = 0.049) compared to those with low UAMA. Risk of neutropenia was also significantly less among those with wasting by MUAC compared to those well-nourished (p = 0.045). Twenty-three participants (17.3%) died with a greater proportion (11/44; 25%) occurring in those who were wasted using MUAC. These findings underscore the need for nutritional surveillance at diagnosis and during chemotherapy, particularly where co-morbid disease is prevalent.","author":"Nihad Salifu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"14b9ad26f815a6377d18ff6628484cb4959ef5cbb153cd6cb21e1384504b9e9b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
