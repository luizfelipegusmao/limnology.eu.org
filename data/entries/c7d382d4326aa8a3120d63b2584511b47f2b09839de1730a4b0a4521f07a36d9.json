{"title":"The 2022 Extreme Heatwave in Shanghai, Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Valley: Combined Influences of Multiscale Variabilities","link":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00376-023-3007-8","date":1711929600000,"content":"<h3>Abstract</h3>\n                    <p>In the summer of 2022, China (especially the Yangtze River Valley, YRV) suffered its strongest heatwave (HW) event since 1961. In this study, we examined the influences of multiscale variabilities on the 2022 extreme HW in the lower reaches of the YRV, focusing on the city of Shanghai. We found that about 1/3 of the 2022 HW days in Shanghai can be attributed to the long-term warming trend of global warming. During mid-summer of 2022, an enhanced western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and anomalous double blockings over the Ural Mountains and Sea of Okhotsk, respectively, were associated with the persistently anomalous high pressure over the YRV, leading to the extreme HW. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation played a major role in the anomalous blocking pattern associated with the HW at the decadal time scale. Also, the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation may have contributed to regulating the formation of the double-blocking pattern. Anomalous warming of both the warm pool of the western Pacific and tropical North Atlantic at the interannual time scale may also have favored the persistency of the double blocking and the anomalously strong WPSH. At the subseasonal time scale, the anomalously frequent phases 2–5 of the canonical northward propagating variability of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation associated with the anomalous propagation of a weak Madden–Julian Oscillation suppressed the convection over the YRV and also contributed to the HW. Therefore, the 2022 extreme HW originated from multiscale forcing including both the climate warming trend and air-sea interaction at multiple time scales.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"SPRINGER Earth Sciences","siteHash":"166bc39ae9940063147ac151ace0074199efd889a447fa33929d8fa2ea20d31e","entryHash":"c7d382d4326aa8a3120d63b2584511b47f2b09839de1730a4b0a4521f07a36d9","category":"Environment"}
