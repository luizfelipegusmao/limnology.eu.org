Current tools for measuring proprioception lack consensus on their accuracy and validity; they also each have their own limitations, and, furthermore, present barriers to use for clinicians. We propose a new and reliable method for evaluating hip, knee, and ankle proprioception by utilizing a digital inclinometer app to measure joint position sense. The digital inclinometer app recorded the active joint position sense error after each of five trials for the hip and knee joint and ten trials for the ankle joint. To quantify the reliability of the digital inclinometer app, single-measurement and average-measurement intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) along with the associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for each joint’s position sense error across trials. Both the hip (ICC (2,k) = 0.849 (95% CI = [0.783–0.897])) and knee joint (ICC (2,k) = 0.837 (95% CI = [0.750–0.897])) were found to have moderate to good reliability when the middle three of five trials were analyzed. Unlike the hip and knee, moderate to good reliability for ankle proprioception (ICC (2,k) = 0.785 (95% CI = [0.539–0.893])) was only achieved with the middle eight of ten trials. The results of this study indicate that this digital inclinometer app is able to accurately record joint position sense at the hip, knee, and ankle when the appropriate number of trials are collected; thus, allowing this tool and methodology to be considered for use in both clinical and research environments to measure proprioception, and furthermore, quantify proprioceptive deficits.","author":"Sophia G.
