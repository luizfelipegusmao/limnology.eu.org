{"title":"Rhodotorula mucilaginosa Fungaemia in an Infected Biloma Patient Following a Traumatic Liver Injury","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1602/v1","date":1711460136000,"content":"Rhodotorula mucilaginosa fungaemia is rare and highly resistance to antifungal therapy. We herein report a case involving a 31-year-old male admitted after a high-velocity road traffic accident. He sustained a grade IV liver injury with right hepatic vein thrombosis, necessitated an urgent laparotomy. Post-operatively, repeated imaging of the abdomen revealed presence of biloma. Percutaneous subdiaphragmatic drainage was done but appeared ineffective, prompting second surgery for a urgent hemi-hepatectomy. Patient then was nursed in the intensive care unit (ICU) however during his stay in the ICU he became more sepsis evident by worsening ventilatory support and rise in septic parameters from the biochemistry parameters. Despite on intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and fluconazole, his septic parameters did not improve and a full septic workup was done and was found to be positive for Rhodotorula mucilaginosa from the blood cultures. After discussion with the infectious disease physicians and clinical microbiologist, it was decided to initiate a course of intravenous meropenem and amphotericin B based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, considering the patient's extended ICU stay and catheter use. Eventually, successful weaning off mechanical ventilation was discharge from ICU care. This case underscores the necessity of individualized approaches, combining timely imaging, appropriate drainage techniques, and tailored treatments to optimize outcomes for such intricate post-traumatic complications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b6799154a7835fe7e853e23c26e933b6920f33bd07866cd8e7f5686fd5fa2d9c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
