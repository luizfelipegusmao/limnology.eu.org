{"title":"First report of Metschnikowia bicuspidata infection in the oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense, de Haan) in China","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13936?af=R","date":1709221163000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>During breeding, some oriental river prawns (<i>Macrobrachium nipponense</i>, de Haan), an important aquaculture species in China, exhibit yellowish-brown body colouration, reduced appetite, and vitality. Diseased prawns revealed characteristic emulsifying disease signs, including whitened musculature, hepatopancreatic tissues, milky haemolymph, and non-coagulation. The present study investigated the causative agent of <i>M. nipponense</i> infection through isolation, histopathology, molecular sequencing, and infection experiments. The pathogenic strain exhibited distinctive white colonies on Bengal red medium, with microscopic examination confirming the presence of yeast cells. Histopathological analysis revealed prominent pathological alterations and yeast cell infiltration in muscles, hepatopancreas and gills. Additionally, 26S rDNA sequencing of the isolated yeast strain LNMN2022 revealed <i>Metschnikowia bicuspidata</i> (GenBank: OR518659) as the causative agent. This strain exhibited a 98.28% sequence homology with <i>M. bicuspidata</i> LNMB2021 (GenBank: OK094821) and 96.62% with <i>M. bicuspidata</i> LNES0119 (GenBank: OK073903). The pathogenicity test confirmed that <i>M. bicuspidata</i> elicited clinical signs in <i>M. nipponense</i> consistent with those observed in natural populations, and the median lethal concentration was determined to be 3.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/mL. This study establishes a foundation for further investigations into the host range and epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen <i>M. bicuspidata</i> in aquatic animals and provides an empirical basis for disease management in <i>M. nipponense</i>.</p>","author":"Yingyue Yu, \nSongyue You, \nChengcheng Feng, \nXiaodong Li, \nYuenan Xing, \nQingbiao Hu, \nJie Bao, \nHongbo Jiang","siteTitle":"Wiley: Journal of Fish Diseases: Table of Contents","siteHash":"522bae7a716dcc0a36dfec7d8f82102ddbcbd512e9a42d779409929aec07420a","entryHash":"fbdfca78871bedb6a55e97ff0f82ca8e69f43a858127366ef5e73f7b1802a3f6","category":"Environment"}
