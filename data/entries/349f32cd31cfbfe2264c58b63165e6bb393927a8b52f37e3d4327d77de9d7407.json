Our understanding of the significance of the non-visual functions of animal integumentary pigments, as well as how they interact with the visually related functions to shape animal visual systems, remains limited.\n\nFurthermore, due to their important roles in shaping species interactions and mediating interactions in the environment, animal colour traits are likely to be impacted by global change (e.g. increased temperatures, altered habitat quality and quantity, increased environmental stochasticity, pollutants and novel species assemblages).\n\nConsidering the effects of global change on both visual and non-visual functions is important for understanding whether the selection is acting directly on the pigment or on coloration. Since changing the trait distributions can then lead to changes in visual systems, we advocate for studies to consider all potential functions of integumentary pigments, both visual and non-visual functions and their interaction.\n\nTowards this goal, we first highlight common functions of pigments with a focus on non-visual functions across animal systems. Then we synthesize our current understanding of how global change can impact pigmentation and discuss factors that can modify the interactions between climate change and pigment function. Lastly, we discuss how changes in colour traits can impact visual systems and provide an example using amphibians and their responses to climate change as a model.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/08/28/animal-color-is-likely-to-be-impacted-by-global-change-in-more-ways-than-you-may-expect/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Beth A.
