However, data on the co-detection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses are limited in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa to inform evidence-based response and decision-making. We analyzed 4,989 patients’ data captured from the national severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance sites over 18 months period from January 01, 2021, to June 30, 2022. Laboratory specimens were collected from the patients and tested for viral respiratory pathogens by real-time, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the national influenza center. The median age of the patients was 14 years (IQR: 1–35 years), with a slight preponderance of them being at the age of 15 to less than 50 years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected among 459 (9.2%, 95% CI: 8.4–10.0) patients, and 64 (1.3%, 95% CI: 1.0–1.6) of SARS-CoV-2 were co-detected either with Influenza virus (54.7%) or RSV (32.8%) and 12.5% were detected with both of the viruses. A substantial proportion (54.7%) of SARS-CoV-2 co-detection with other respiratory viruses was identified among patients in the age group from 15 to less than 50 years. The multivariable analysis found that the odds of SARS-CoV-2 co-detection was higher among individuals with the age category of 20 to 39 years as compared to those less than 20 years old (AOR: 1.98, 95%CI:1.15–3.42) while the odds of SARS-CoV-2 co-detection was lower among cases from other regions of the country as compared to those from Addis Ababa (AOR:0.16 95%CI:0.07–0.34). Although the SARS-CoV-2 co-detection with other respiratory viral pathogens was minimal, the findings of this study underscore that it is critical to continuously monitor the co-infections to reduce transmission and improve patient outcomes, particularly among the youth and patients with ILI.","author":"Wolde Shure","siteTitle":"PLOS Global Public Health","siteHash":"68f201c31de345e71f5412928085f03739d747ad0de6373b46c0cd4b6cadb74e","entryHash":"4256fef1cd8b4bc88401242d7accc1c60c22d406dd5a70e324b9b8f5ac19a445","category":"Environment"}
