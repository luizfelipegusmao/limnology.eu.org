{"title":"Highly-Sensitive Measure of Complexity Captures Boolean Networks Regimes and Temporal Order More Optimally","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1569/v2","date":1721798676000,"content":"In this work, several random Boolean networks (RBN) are generated and analyzed from two characteristics: their time evolution diagram and their transition diagram. To do this, its randomness  is estimated using three measures, of which Algorithmic Complexity is the only one capable of both  a) revealing transitions towards the chaotic regime, and b) disclosing the algorithmic contribution  of certain states to the transition diagram and their relationship with the order they occupy in the temporal evolution of the respective RBN. The results obtained from both types of analysis are useful  for the introduction of both Algorithmic Complexity and Perturbation Analysis in the context of  Boolean networks, and their potential applications in regulatory network models.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"b0c47cb61d4efdbe87cef809a0cab099c619880f8e119c8b9fa3bf28762b11ce","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
