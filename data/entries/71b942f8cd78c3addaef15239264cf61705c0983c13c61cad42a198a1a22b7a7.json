{"title":"Non‐Linearity in Mean Annual Peak Flow Scaling With Upstream Basin Area: Insights From Percolation Theory","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eco.2709?af=R","date":1725345365000,"content":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>\n<p>Understanding how annual peak flow, Qp$$ {Q}_p $$, relates to upstream basin area, A$$ A $$, and their scaling have been one of the challenges in surface hydrology. Although a power-law scaling relationship (i.e., Qp∝Aα$$ {Q}_p\\propto {A}^{\\alpha } $$) has been widely applied in the literature, it is purely empirical, and due to its empiricism, the interpretation of its exponent, α$$ \\alpha $$, and its variations from one basin to another is not clear. In the literature, different values of α$$ \\alpha $$ have been reported for various datasets and drainage basins of different areas. Invoking concepts of percolation theory as well as self-affinity, we derived universal and non-universal scaling laws to theoretically link Qp$$ {Q}_p $$ to A$$ A $$. In the universal scaling, we related the exponent α$$ \\alpha $$ to the fractal dimensionality of percolation, Dx$$ {D}_x $$ (i.e., α=1+0.51−Dx$$ \\alpha =1+0.5\\left(1-{D}_x\\right) $$). In the non-universal scaling, in addition to Dx$$ {D}_x $$, the exponent α$$ \\alpha $$ was related to the Hurst exponent, H$$ H $$, characterizing the boundaries of the drainage basin (i.e., α=1+1−Dx/1+H$$ \\alpha =1+\\left(1-{D}_x\\right)/\\left(1+H\\right) $$). The Dx$$ {D}_x $$ depends on the dimensionality of the drainage system (e.g., two or three dimensions) and percolation class (e.g., random or invasion percolation). We demonstrated that the theoretical universal and non-universal bounds were in well agreement with experimental ranges of α$$ \\alpha $$ reported in the literature. More importantly, our theoretical framework revealed that greater α$$ \\alpha $$ values are theoretically expected when basins are more quasi two-dimensional, while smaller values when basins are mainly quasi three-dimensional. This is well consistent with the experimental data. We attributed it to the fact that small basins most probably display quasi-two-dimensional topography, while large basins quasi-three-dimensional topography.</p>","author":"Behzad Ghanbarian","siteTitle":"Wiley: Ecohydrology: Table of Contents","siteHash":"d4e136e5883a50f33ecc87d3538a4a44e073442841082fa59fe499953a06e418","entryHash":"71b942f8cd78c3addaef15239264cf61705c0983c13c61cad42a198a1a22b7a7","category":"Environment"}
