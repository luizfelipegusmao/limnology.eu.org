{"title":"Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence technology for elucidating disease pathophysiology.","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0350/v1","date":1722892678000,"content":"The utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biotechnology is widespread, addressing challenges such as elucidating disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic approaches. AI plays a critical role in tasks such as drug manufacturing, chemical analysis, RNA and DNA sequencing, and enzyme studies by automating processes and expediting data collection and analysis. AI has particularly transformed the analysis of omics data for researchers, providing tools to handle complex and multifaceted datasets effectively. Through AI, integrative analysis of multi-omics data can be conducted in efficient ways. This article discusses the application of multi-omics and AI technologies in studying various diseases related to infection (COVID-19), mutation (cancer), and senescence (alopecia) to understand their pathophysiology. The applications of AI were performed as the aspect of the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for each disease. We introduce AI-driven analysis of pathophysiology can overcome traditional limitations in pathology, with diverse features showing potential in defining the causes of diseases, and potentially enhancing primary omics data in the distinguish the subtype of diseases. In this context, integrated approaches using multi-omics data and AI technology could provide fresh biological insights by comprehending the molecular mechanism of diseases and is instrumental in advancing precision medicine. We anticipate that the rapidly advancing AI-based multi-omics data analysis will significantly contribute to promoting healthy longevity.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"82e987f67a29c4c0874624e64d2aad3c27be698f8f4aa1056f17fad67cf650ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
