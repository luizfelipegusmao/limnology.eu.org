This paper explores user behavior analysis in the context of big data, highlighting its pivotal role in driving innovation and strategic decision-making. We begin by discussing the importance of user behavior data and reviewing technological advancements such as machine learning, natural language processing, and data mining that enable deep insights into user behavior. Through a case study on linguistic analysis in livestreaming e-commerce, we demonstrate how text-mining techniques can correlate linguistic characteristics with sales performance, providing actionable marketing insights. We further explore the broader business applications, including personalized recommendations, user portraits, product design, and strategic decision-making. Technical and ethical challenges, such as data integration, privacy concerns, and algorithmic bias, are also addressed. The paper concludes with a discussion on future trends, such as AI and ML advancements, edge computing, IoT proliferation, and ethical AI frameworks, poised to shape user behavior analysis. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of user behavior data in enhancing business operations and user experiences, providing recommendations for future research focused on real-time analytics, privacy-preserving techniques, and ethical implications of data-driven decisions.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"32cb426bb161e6887e4b3131e3b2567b012b794321260d77c93ab399f8345c8b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
