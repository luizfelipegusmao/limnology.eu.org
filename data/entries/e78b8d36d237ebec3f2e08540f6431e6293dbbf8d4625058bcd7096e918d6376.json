Yu</p>\r\n\r\nThe <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) pathogen, the causative agent of the airborne infection tuberculosis (TB), harbors a number of mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) transporters. These membrane proteins can be separated into 2 distinct subclasses, where they perform important functional roles, and thus, are considered potential drug targets to combat TB. Previously, we reported both X-ray and cryo-EM structures of the MmpL3 transporter, providing high-resolution structural information for this subclass of the MmpL proteins. Currently, there is no structural information available for the subclass associated with MmpL4 and MmpL5, transporters that play a critical role in iron homeostasis of the bacterium. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the <i>M</i>. <i>smegmatis</i> MmpL4 and MmpL5 transporters to resolutions of 2.95 Å and 3.00 Å, respectively. These structures allow us to propose a plausible pathway for siderophore translocation via these 2 transporters, an essential step for iron acquisition that enables the survival and replication of the mycobacterium.","author":"Rakesh Maharjan","siteTitle":"PLOS Biology","siteHash":"63268de9c1fab91327fb48afeeb83afb4047c365a2f6807080f2b99ab35eb8c8","entryHash":"e78b8d36d237ebec3f2e08540f6431e6293dbbf8d4625058bcd7096e918d6376","category":"Environment"}
