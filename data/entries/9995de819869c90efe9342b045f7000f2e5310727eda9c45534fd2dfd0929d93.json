{"title":"Prognostic Value of KRAS Mutations in Relation to PDL1 Expression and Immunotherapy Treatment in Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients: A Greek Cohort Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.1559/v1","date":1711449101000,"content":"Background: Factors that could predict which patients will benefit from Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of KRAS biomarker in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in relation to clinical characteristics, treatment response and PDL1 expression. Patients and methods: The study included 100 patients with NSCLC who received immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy as 1st line treatment. In biopsy samples, the PDL1 biomarker expression rate and somatic mutations of KRAS gene were determined. Results: The mean age of the patients was 67 Â± 8 years. Patients were all male and 66% were found with adenocarcinoma whereas 34% with squamous cell carcinoma. The KRAS G12C mutation was found with the highest percentage (73%). In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with PDL1&amp;gt;49% in combination with a negative KRAS result had a median survival of 40 months compared to patients with a positive KRAS result (9 months, p&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, PDL1&amp;lt;49% and negative KRAS result had a median survival of 39 months compared to patients with a positive result (28 months, p&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusions: Our study suggests that the presence of KRAS mutations in advanced NSCLC patients has a poor prognostic value, regardless of their PDL1 expression values, after receiving immunotherapy as first-line treatment.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9995de819869c90efe9342b045f7000f2e5310727eda9c45534fd2dfd0929d93","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
