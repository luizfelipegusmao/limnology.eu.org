{"title":"Intervention Model to Improve Community Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior on Ecotourism Accessibility for People with Disabilities","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.2153/v2","date":1728067921000,"content":"This study aims to evaluate the impact of the Intervention Model on improving community knowledge, attitudes, and behavior related to ecotourism accessibility for people with disabilities in Ternate City, with a focus on addressing gaps in understanding and support through educational services and distribution of educational materials in the form of brochures with a participatory approach. The research design used a quasi-experiment involving 4,964 residents, where 287 participants were randomly selected through Cluster Random Sampling. Three tourist destinations were chosen as research locations, namely Sulamadaha Beach, Tolire Besar Lake, and Batu Angus Geotourism in Ternate City, North Maluku. The results showed that the intervention significantly improved community knowledge, attitudes, and behavior related to ecotourism accessibility, with a significance value (Sig. (2-tailed) of 0.000 &lt;Î± = 0.05) indicating a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group after community-based interventions were carried out. In conclusion, this model has been proven effective in improving community knowledge, attitudes, and behavior towards ecotourism accessibility and can be used as a reference for similar programs in other locations to improve ecotourism accessibility globally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"c496d9d191178ed0415d02dc9db3f448aeeb22f3a1e90cd48837e4a7228c6e3b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
