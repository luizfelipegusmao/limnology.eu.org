{"title":"Outcomes and Outlooks of Therapeutic Application of Modulators of Endogenous Cannabinoid System in Parkinson&#039;s Disease","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0037/v1","date":1717393186000,"content":"Recent studies have shown that the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) of the brain is essentially involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), influencing its symptoms by regulating the level of endogenous cannabinoids and altering the activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBR). Therefore, modulation of ECS with new drugs developed for this purpose may prove to be a promising strategy in the treatment of PD. However, fine regulation of ECS is quite a challenge due to the functional diversity of CBR in the basal ganglia. Our review analyses the effects of ECS modulators on experimental PD models and in patients with PD, as well as presents the outlooks for the development of new cannabinoid drugs for the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"2543a07f86502cfd4abe8388b50a4c6176f00b0c2cfd85a1d410039e2237a1d1","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
