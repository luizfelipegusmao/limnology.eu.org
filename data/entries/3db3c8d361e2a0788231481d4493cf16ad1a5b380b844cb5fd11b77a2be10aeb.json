{"title":"PEDRO: Privacy-Enhancing Decision suppoRt tOol","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1103/v1","date":1726471260000,"content":"Citizens face online privacy threats from social media, organisations and governments. Privacy-enhancing tools (PETs) can help people to preserve their privacy, but the uptake of these is limited. We developed a conceptual framework for privacy self-protection, using a classification framework of four distinct privacy threats and our own novel staged model of PET adoption requisites. Through an expert survey (N = 12) and a lay user survey (N = 500), we identified suitable PETs for non-expert users and identified potential barriers to PET adoption. Based on the studies and our theoretical framework, we then developed and implemented a PET decision support tool called PEDRO, and conducted expert evaluations (N = 10).","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3db3c8d361e2a0788231481d4493cf16ad1a5b380b844cb5fd11b77a2be10aeb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
