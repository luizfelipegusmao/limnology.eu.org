{"title":"Biogeography and phylogeny of the scavenging amphipod genus Valettietta (Amphipoda: Alicelloidea), with descriptions of two new species from the abyssal Pacific Ocean","link":"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/doi/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlae102/7735801?rss=1","date":1724025600000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div><span>Valettietta</span> Lincoln &amp; Thurston, 1983 (Amphipoda: Alicelloidea) is an infrequently sampled genus of scavenging amphipod, with a known bathymetric range from 17â€“5467 m encompassing a variety of habitats from anchialine caves to abyssal plains. Molecular systematics studies have uncovered cryptic speciation in specimens collected from the abyssal Pacific, highlighting uncertainty in the description of <span>Valettietta anacantha</span> (Birstein &amp; Vinogradov, 1963). Here, we apply an integrative taxonomic approach and describe two new species, <span>Valettietta trottarum</span> sp. nov. and <span>Valettietta synchlys</span> sp. nov., collected at abyssal depths in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean. Both species can be distinguished by characters of the gnathopods, uropod 3, and the inner plate of the maxilliped. Further, molecular phylogenetic analyses of two mitochondrial (16S rDNA and <span>COI</span>) and two nuclear (Histone 3 and 28S rRNA) regions found both new species to form well-supported clades and allowed us to re-identify previously published records based on genetic species delimitation. The biogeography of <span>Valettietta</span> is discussed in light of these re-evaluated records, and a new taxonomic key to the genus is provided. These new taxa highlight the strength of applying an integrated taxonomic approach to uncover biodiversity, which is critical in regions being explored for potential industrial purposes.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society Current Issue","siteHash":"60dddf4002fe346d902069d12617b89305afb00f9555e0dc9329b5ff91a03e42","entryHash":"a03d47da5c5dabfe4a5b9fa06052512dcfaa676c5a92f7247d4bfeefe41f7078","category":"Environment"}
