{"title":"Evaluation of DNA Mismatch Repair Proteins by Immunohistochemistry Using Two Antibodies","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0684/v1","date":1728464693000,"content":"Background: Determining the status of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and predicting prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer. This study evaluates a streamlined panel utilizing two antibodies for MMR protein assessment, aiming to enhance cost-effectiveness, reduce workload, and expedite result delivery. Methods: We re-classified patients with adenocarcinoma requiring MMR determination by evaluating only PMS2 and MSH6 proteins. The diagnostic performance of the proposed two-antibody panel was compared to the traditional four-antibody panel against a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay used as the reference standard. Results: A total of 404 cases were analyzed, with the predominant histological type being adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified. The most common histological grade was 2, and 60.9% of cases were in clinical stage II. Comparative analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the two-antibody and four-antibody panels. Sensitivity was 95.35% for the four-antibody panel versus 90.7% for the two-antibody panel; specificity was 98.74% versus 98.11%, respectively. Additionally, the positive predictive value was 95.35% for the four-antibody panel compared to 92.86% for the two-antibody panel, and negative predictive values were 98.74% versus 97.50%. The area under the curve was 0.970 for the four-antibody panel and 0.944 for the two-antibody panel (p=0.419). Conclusion: The analysis shows that determining MMR status using only two antibodies is as effective as employing a traditional four-antibody panel, providing a viable, cost-effective alternative for clinical practice.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"74698cd69c7146593442a4a95d25006cbb6c50a5e511b7988a917f0624b00a34","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
