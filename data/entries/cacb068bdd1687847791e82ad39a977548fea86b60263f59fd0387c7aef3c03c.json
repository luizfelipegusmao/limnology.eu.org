{"title":"Acute Thrombosis Induced by Drug-Coated Balloons Dilation in Neoatherosclerosis Plaque, Successfully Treated with a MicroNet-Covered Stent: A Case Report and Literature Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.1649/v3","date":1721859273000,"content":"Background The operator's ability in performing carotid stenting (CAS) has improved clinical outcomes. However, more than 3% of patients need to be treated again after CAS. Most of the cases requiring further intervention are affected by hyperplasia. The recommended procedure is the DEBalloon. On the other hand, the literature reports a small number of carotid neoatherosclerosis cases and is recommended to be treated using elective Micronet-covered stent. Discriminating between the two types of in-stent-restenosis ISR (hyperplasia or neoatherosclerosis) is critical for a positive outcome.Case summary We describe a case in which a patient treated with carotid stenting 8 years before, was diagnosed with ISR. Due to the development of neurological symptoms and progressive increases in Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) eight years following carotid stenting, a DEBalloon was used in a carotid in-stent-restenosis (ISR) standard procedure. About ten minutes after the procedure, the patient developed hemiplegia consistent with the treated carotid territory. The implantation of a MicroNet-covered stent excluded the thrombus and reverted symptoms with a normal MR control at 24 h. Conclusion This case illustrates that when in-stent stenosis evolves years after the stent implantation, neoatherosclerosis should be assessed, and a MicroNet-covered stent should be considered.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"cacb068bdd1687847791e82ad39a977548fea86b60263f59fd0387c7aef3c03c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
