{"title":"Fuzzy Logic based Energy Management Strategy for Hybrid Fuel Cell Electric Ship&#039;s Power and Propulsion System","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.1286/v1","date":1726565904000,"content":"The growing use of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) in hybrid propulsion systems, aimed at replacing traditional internal combustion engines and reducing greenhouse gas emis-sions. Effective power distribution between the fuel cell and the energy storage system (ESS) is crucial, which has led to a growing emphasis on developing energy management systems (EMS) to efficiently implement this integration. To address this goal, this study examines the performance of a fuzzy logic rule-based strategy for a hybrid fuel cell propulsion system in a small hydro-gen-powered passenger vessel. The primary objective is to optimize fuel efficiency, with particular attention to reducing hydrogen consumption. The analysis is carried out under typical operating conditions encountered during a river trip. Comparisons between the proposed strategy with other approaches —control-based, optimization-based and deterministic rule-based— are con-ducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Simulation results indicated that EMS based on fuzzy logic mechanisms was the most successful in reducing fuel consumption. The superior performance of this method stems from its ability to adaptively manage power distri-bution between the fuel cell and energy storage systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"05db63fd2f8e9a0752ff76005cd4e26f949f419333d74aa41b88b868c7ad6448","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
