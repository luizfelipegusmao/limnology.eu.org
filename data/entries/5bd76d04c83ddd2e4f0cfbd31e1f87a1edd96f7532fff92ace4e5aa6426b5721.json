{"title":"Plant age-dependent dynamics of annatto pigment (bixin) biosynthesis in Bixa orellana","link":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/75/5/1390/7425416?rss=1","date":1700179200000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Age affects the production of secondary metabolites, but how developmental cues regulate secondary metabolism remains poorly understood. The achiote tree (<span>Bixa orellana</span> L.) is a source of bixin, an apocarotenoid used in diverse industries worldwide. Understanding how age-dependent mechanisms control bixin biosynthesis is of great interest for plant biology and for economic reasons. Here we overexpressed miRNA156 (miR156) in <span>B. orellana</span> to comprehensively study the effects of the miR156–<span>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE</span> (<span>SPL</span>) module on age-dependent bixin biosynthesis in leaves. Overexpression of miR156 in annatto plants (miR156ox) reduced <span>BoSPL</span> transcript levels, impacted leaf ontogeny, lessened bixin production, and increased abscisic acid levels. Modulation of expression of <span>BoCCD4-4</span> and <span>BoCCD1</span>, key genes in carotenoid biosynthesis, was associated with diverting the carbon flux from bixin to abscisic acid in miR156ox leaves. Proteomic analyses revealed an overall low accumulation of most secondary metabolite-related enzymes in miR156ox leaves, suggesting that miR156-targeted <span>BoSPLs</span> may be required to activate several secondary metabolic pathways. Our findings suggest that the conserved BomiR156–<span>BoSPL</span> module is deployed to regulate leaf dynamics of bixin biosynthesis, and may create novel opportunities to fine-tune bixin output in <span>B. orellana</span> breeding programs.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Journal of Experimental Botany Current Issue","siteHash":"742c07dc7ba60f1337de1e3aa176bc14944549a55b7425c2e178eb413eed1e54","entryHash":"5bd76d04c83ddd2e4f0cfbd31e1f87a1edd96f7532fff92ace4e5aa6426b5721","category":"Environment"}
