{"title":"Strengthening Inclusive Local Participation Through Decentralized Party Organization: Insights from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) And All Progressive Congress (APC), 2015 &ndash;2023","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.1318/v1","date":1729131860000,"content":"This study investigates the relationship between decentralized party organization and inclusive local participation in decision-making processes within Nigeria's two leading political parties: the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), from 2015–2023. The study employed a multi-stage sampling technique to select 400 respondents, including national and local party leaders, assembly members, and grassroots members from the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. A total of 384 valid responses were retrieved, yielding a 96% response rate. Data was collected through questionnaires administered via Google Forms, and distributed through email and social media platforms, particularly WhatsApp. Regression and correlation analyses reveal a significant positive relationship between decentralized party structures and inclusive local participation (r = 0.820, p &lt; 0.05), with decentralized frameworks explaining 67.2% of the variance in inclusive local participation (R² = 0.672). However, regional disparities in the implementation of decentralization present challenges to its uniform effectiveness. This study emphasizes the importance of standardizing decentralization policies to enhance local decision-making, promote inclusiveness, and strengthen party institutionalization. The findings offer valuable insights for party leaders, policymakers, and researchers on how decentralization can promote internal democracy and foster stability within political parties.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"d37b8e9261de05d13990614da8117e00176bd514813f54a7d1fada9c0777e2f3","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
