{"title":"Effects of a Multifactorial Program with Case Management for Falls Prevention on Functional Outcomes in Community-Dwelling Older People: Randomized Clinical Study","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0163/v1","date":1714728168000,"content":"Abstract: Falls are among the top 10 causes of years lived with disability in people aged 75 and over. Preventive programs like case management (CM) are crucial. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of a multifactorial fall prevention program, based on CM, on physical performance, presence of pain and risk of falls and fractures in elderly people who have suffered falls. Methods: This is a randomized, single-blind clinical trial with parallel groups: intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) composed of 55 older people with a history of falls living in the community. All participants underwent an initial assessment via video call (containing anamnesis, Timed Up and Go test, Falls Risk Score, Short Physical Performance Battery and Clinical Frax). The IG underwent CM, the physical exercise protocol and the cognitive stimulation protocol. The CG was monitored through telephone calls and received general health and falls guidance. Results: No significant results were found in physical capacity, presence of pain, risk of falls and fractures between the intervention and control groups and between assessments. Conclusion: This program was not effective in improving functional performance, but it was important for characterizing pain and the probability of fracture in the next 10 years in this population.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ab23cc6895dea9e4e74164504ae8cce3beba380ca63e91b2177e268397fe1dc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
