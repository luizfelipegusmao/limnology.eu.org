This article gives a market overview of the carbon fiber producers relating to their used oxidations oven and of market of oxidations oven itself. All six industrially available oxidation oven types are described and an overview of the oven supplier is given. The analysis of the oxidation oven market shows that only three out of six oxidation oven technologies are used for large-volume production. CtE is currently the most widely used oven technology with approximately 55%. Since 2014, CF demand has been growing faster than the expansion of production capacities. A shortage is predicted within the next 5 years. In addition, the production capacities of existing CF lines have stagnated at an average of 1.5 kt*a<sup>−1</sup> since the last 10 years. To meet the increasing CF demand in the coming years, various options are available: (1) Increasing large-tow production, (2) Increasing process speed (3) Increasing the loading factor (4) Increasing with of oxidation oven.</p>","author":"Felix Pohlkemper, \nSimon Rolfes, \nMohamed Bouhrara, \nTim Röding, \nThomas Gries","siteTitle":"Wiley: Applied Research: Table of Contents","siteHash":"a2be93a8f95ba138c1b0e647d01be1a546d9d2dd729340bbfccb521bcdddc260","entryHash":"8450d83c8237ec9916ab17f953c801111690b3ecde529aa698290589c691474a","category":"Environment"}
