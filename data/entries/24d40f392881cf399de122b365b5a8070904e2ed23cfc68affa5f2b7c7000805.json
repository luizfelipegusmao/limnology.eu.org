To date, the technique has been utilized in a wide range of applications, from the detection of oxygen vacancies [<a href=\"#ozae044.906-B4\">4</a>] to the imaging of biological specimens [<a href=\"#ozae044.906-B5\">5</a>]. Nevertheless, the practical limit of EP is still not well-understood because it is impossible study the influence of all possible experimental conditions and reconstruction parameters. Previous works [<a href=\"#ozae044.906-B3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ozae044.906-B6\">6</a>] have attempted to search for the optimal experimental parameters (e.g., scan step size and probe aberrations) for low-dose ptychography by leveraging Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Processes (BO-GP) – a flexible black-box optimization framework that can automatically “explore” and “exploit” a parameter space with minimal assumptions about the data or sample. However, for more complex problems, BO-GP generally becomes less effective with increasing dimensionality and requires substantial computing resources for reconstructions.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"24d40f392881cf399de122b365b5a8070904e2ed23cfc68affa5f2b7c7000805","category":"Environment"}
