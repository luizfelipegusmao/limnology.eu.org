{"title":"The prognostic significance of additional localized treatment to primary lesion in patients undergoing hormone therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0304963","date":1718028000000,"content":"<p>by Yuta Yamada, Fumihiko Urabe, Shoji Kimura, Kosuke Iwatani, Naoki Kimura, Jun Miki, Takahiro Kimura, Haruki Kume</p>\r\nBackground <p>We aimed to compare the prognostic values of ‘localized treatment to the primary lesion (LT) plus hormone therapy (HT)’ versus ‘HT alone’ in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).</p> Methods <p>We conducted a systematic search through the databases of PubMed®, Web of Science®, and Cochrane library® in April 2023 based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. A pooled meta-analysis was performed to assess the prognostic differences between LT + HT and HT alone according to randomized and non-randomized controlled studies (RCTs and NRCTs, respectively).</p> Results <p>The search identified three RCTs and eight NRCTs. In RCTs, LT did not show prognostic benefits regarding biochemical-failure free rate nor overall survival (OS), although in patients with low tumor burdens, the LT + HT group showed better OS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54–0.86). In the NRCTs, the LT+HT group showed superior progression-free survival (hazard ratio (HR): 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21–0.87), cancer-specific survival (HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20–0.76), and OS (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.57–0.69) to the HT alone group. In addition, better OS was observed in the LT +HT group regardless of the type of treatment modality for LT; radical prostatectomy (HR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.39–0.69), radiotherapy (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.56–0.71) in NRCTs.</p> Conclusions <p>LT to the primary lesion in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer may provide prognostic benefits and especially in patients with low tumor burden.</p>","author":"Yuta Yamada","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"11d58d554d7b324ce8aeebe99223684d5693c9c8bec352d18727657b31f95b87","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
