{"title":"Structure, function, and assembly of PSI in thylakoid membranes of vascular plants","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/36/10/4080/7689652?rss=1","date":1717718400000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>The photosynthetic apparatus is formed by thylakoid membrane-embedded multiprotein complexes that carry out linear electron transport in oxygenic photosynthesis. The machinery is largely conserved from cyanobacteria to land plants, and structure and function of the protein complexes involved are relatively well studied. By contrast, how the machinery is assembled in thylakoid membranes remains poorly understood. The complexes participating in photosynthetic electron transfer are composed of many proteins, pigments, and redox-active cofactors, whose temporally and spatially highly coordinated incorporation is essential to build functional mature complexes. Several proteins, jointly referred to as assembly factors, engage in the biogenesis of these complexes to bring the components together in a step-wise manner, in the right order and time. In this review, we focus on the biogenesis of the terminal protein supercomplex of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, PSI, in vascular plants. We summarize our current knowledge of the assembly process and the factors involved and describe the challenges associated with resolving the assembly pathway in molecular detail.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"The Plant Cell Current Issue","siteHash":"79e412e6ce1f089d84dc121a8f42d56bd85cc8a0cd2445169b4ab961f78a7517","entryHash":"5e74f69ab082abf83e072828a91d69a5d588c993d2c25345b831380d06f48edb","category":"Environment"}
