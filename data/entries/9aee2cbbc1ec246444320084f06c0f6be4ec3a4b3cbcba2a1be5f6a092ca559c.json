{"title":"The whole community? Assessing FEMA’s inclusion of Tribal governments in hazard mitigation efforts","link":"https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000479","date":1724162400000,"content":"<p>by Evan C.

Errett</p>\r\n\r\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has long advocated for what it calls a “Whole Community approach” to disaster resilience and recovery. This philosophy holds that the priorities of all governmental, commercial, and interest groups should be considered, and their capabilities leveraged, in preparing for and responding to disasters. According to FEMA, federally recognized Tribal governments are part of the “Whole Community.” In this paper we use systematic content analysis techniques to examine policy documents derived from the Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant program to assess whether and how FEMA has taken the concrete policy steps necessary to include Tribal governments in the “Whole Community.” We find that while FEMA has expressed interest in a more equitable and accessible program that serves the needs of Tribal governments, it has taken few practical steps toward this goal.","author":"Evan C.
