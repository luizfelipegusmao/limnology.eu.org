From this perspective, particular emphasis is attracted to the development of “digital twins” for material systems [<a href=\"#ozae044.165-B1\">1</a>]. Digital twins not only model macroscopic behavior but also uncover the microscopic physical phenomena impacting them. This capability enables addressing the inverse problem and optimizing theoretical model parameters to yield desired macroscopic responses.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"0b1aa4da357e480540386bb8f7cb994fbbad1e7d56fb64e43c607d4582e315b7","category":"Environment"}
