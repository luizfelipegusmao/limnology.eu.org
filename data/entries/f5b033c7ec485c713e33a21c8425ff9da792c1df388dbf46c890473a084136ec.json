{"title":"Investigation of Toughening Mechanisms in Elastomeric PC Blends through Morphological and Mechanical Characterization at Small and Medium Strain Rates","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.0079/v1","date":1717636339000,"content":"Despite polycarbonate (PC) being a widely used engineering plastic, its notch and crack sensitivity pose challenges in critical applications. To address this, PC was blended with elastomeric polymers to explore the improvement in toughness. This study systematically investigates the toughening mechanisms of PC blended with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), copolyether ester elas-tomer (COPE), and ABS and styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) copolymer grafted with maleic anhydride (MA). The morphology and mechanical behavior were evaluated under qua-si-static and high-speed tensile tests and Charpy impact tests using optical, electronic, and atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The morphological analysis reveals cavitation and crazing phenomena for COPE and SEBS-g-MA systems, and mostly debonding for ABS, indicating an improvement in toughening. While the addition of ABS improves the PC plastic deformation, modifying ABS with maleic anhydride enhances the elastic modulus. Blending PC with SEBS-g-MA increases the strain at break, and the addition of COPE significantly improves the deformation behavior of PC (by around 115%). This comparative study provides valuable insights into the performance of different PC-elastomer blends under similar conditions, supporting the selection of appropriate materials for given applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f5b033c7ec485c713e33a21c8425ff9da792c1df388dbf46c890473a084136ec","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
