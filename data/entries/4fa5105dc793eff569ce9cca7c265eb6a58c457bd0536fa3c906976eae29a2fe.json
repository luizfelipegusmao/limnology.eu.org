{"title":"The Biology, Impact, and Management of Xyleborus Beetles: A Comprehensive Review","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0930/v1","date":1723552607000,"content":"Xyleborus beetles, a diverse group of ambrosia beetles, present significant challenges to forestry and agriculture due to their damaging burrowing behavior and symbiotic relationships with fungi. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biology, ecology, and management of Xyleborus. We explore the beetles' life cycle, reproductive strategies, habitat preferences, and feeding habits, emphasizing their ecological and economic impacts. Control and management strategies, including preventive measures, chemical and biological control, and integrated pest management (IPM), are critically evaluated. Recent advances in molecular genetics and behavioral studies offer insights into genetic diversity, population structure, and host selection mechanisms. Despite progress, managing Xyleborus effectively remains challenging. This review identifies future research needs and highlights innovative control methods, such as biopesticides and pheromone-based trapping systems.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"4fa5105dc793eff569ce9cca7c265eb6a58c457bd0536fa3c906976eae29a2fe","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
