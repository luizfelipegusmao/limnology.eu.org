{"title":"Theoretical Notions with Practical Applications regarding the Statistical Calculation of the Dental Burs Wear","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1382/v1","date":1724117977000,"content":"The paper presents theoretical notions with practical applications for establishing of one dental bur lifetime (durability and reliability based on the active part wear considering a series of statistical indicators. For the justification application of theoretical notions in practice, a conical-cylindrical dental bur was studied experimentally, to obtain a series of data in the work process, necessary for statistical calculation. The parameter taken into consideration in this paper is mass lost through the dental bur active part wear, tested. This is useful for the dental bur lifetime establishment and its extension or even optimization in operation. The loss of mass of the dental bur active part is analyzed in the work process by the results and experimental data obtained and validated by a numerical calculation statistical-mathematical. The numerical calculation approximates very well the mass lost through the wear at different rotation speeds and operation times, with those experimentally determined ones, based on which it was established lifetime. The results showed that the dental bur works with high yield in the first 20 hours of work, , after which it should be replaced with a new one.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e0245e68fd8941418e00a4162b144f08bf47b1bb1a6c7e26c8f9b7cc4925ba14","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
