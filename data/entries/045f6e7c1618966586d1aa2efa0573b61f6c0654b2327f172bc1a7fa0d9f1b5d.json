{"title":"How to Popularize Smartphones among Older Adults: A Narrative Review and New Perspectives","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.1157/v1","date":1723715906000,"content":"Information and Communication Technology (ICT) such as smartphones has been attracting attention to prevent elderly people from becoming isolated. For this reason, recent research has proposed training methods for acquiring smartphone functions. However, since the types of smartphone functions required vary from person to person, a one-size-fits-all method will not attract everyone's interest and the results will be limited. On the other hand, with a view to social implementation, it is necessary to clarify a method that is sufficiently effective in terms of cost and time. Previous research suggests that self-efficacy and social capital are the keys to acquiring smartphone skills among elderly people. Therefore, in this review, while looking back at previous research, we propose a study to demonstrate that by providing careful individual instruction by an experienced instructor to elderly people with little experience in smartphones, and then having them take turns teaching other participants after the instruction, their self-efficacy and social capital can be increased, and a positive spiral effect can be achieved to maximize the improvement of smartphone skills widely.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"045f6e7c1618966586d1aa2efa0573b61f6c0654b2327f172bc1a7fa0d9f1b5d","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
