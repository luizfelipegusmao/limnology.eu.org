{"title":"Transcription factor ZmEREB97 regulates nitrate uptake in maize (Zea mays) roots","link":"https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/196/1/535/7672931?rss=1","date":1715644800000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Maize (<span>Zea mays</span> L.) has very strong requirements for nitrogen. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulations of nitrogen uptake and translocation in this species are not fully understood. Here, we report that an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor ZmEREB97 functions as an important regulator in the N signaling network in maize. Predominantly expressed and accumulated in main root and lateral root primordia, ZmEREB97 rapidly responded to nitrate treatment. By overlapping the analyses of differentially expressed genes and conducting a DAP-seq assay, we identified 1,446 potential target genes of ZmEREB97. Among these, 764 genes were coregulated in 2 lines of <span>zmereb97</span> mutants. Loss of function of ZmEREB97 substantially weakened plant growth under both hydroponic and soil conditions. Physiological characterization of <span>zmereb97</span> mutant plants demonstrated that reduced biomass and grain yield were both associated with reduced nitrate influx, decreased nitrate content, and less N accumulation. We further demonstrated that ZmEREB97 directly targets and regulates the expression of 6 <span>ZmNRT</span> genes by binding to the GCC-box-related sequences in gene promoters. Collectively, these data suggest that ZmEREB97 is a major positive regulator of the nitrate response and that it plays an important role in optimizing nitrate uptake, offering a target for improvement of nitrogen use efficiency in crops.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Plant Physiology Current Issue","siteHash":"ae0dd91e0e34bd11f0967b3d022711a41fe204ab105b0105eff3839f731c5b5d","entryHash":"899f990d97396b5e42e8c71253effa199d3965ea9a64e53424c6256c48e1c1fa","category":"Environment"}
