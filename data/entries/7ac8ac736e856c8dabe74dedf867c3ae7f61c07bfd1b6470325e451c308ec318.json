{"title":"Salinity Fronts in the South Atlantic","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0975/v1","date":1710753531000,"content":"Seasonal climatology of salinity fronts in the South Atlantic has been created from satellite SMOS sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements, 2011-2019, processed at the Barcelona Expert Center of Remote Sensing (BEC) and provided as high-resolution (1/20°) SSS data. The SSS fronts are identified with narrow zones of enhanced horizontal gradient magnitude (GM) of SSS computed with the Belkin-O’Reilly algorithm. Seasonal climatologies are generated for large-scale open-ocean SSS fronts and for low-salinity regions maintained by the Rio de la Plata discharge, Magellan Strait outflow, Congo River discharge, and Benguela upwelling. To facilitate feature recognition in satellite imagery, the salinity gradient has been log-transformed, which improved visual contrast of gradient maps, revealing new features. A 2000-km-long triangular area in the eastern tropical-subtropical Atlantic is filled with regular quasi-meridional mesoscale striations that form a giant ripple field with a 100-km wave length extending from Africa toward the NE Brazil. South of the Tropical Front, within the subtropical high-salinity pool, a trans-ocean quasi-zonal narrow linear belt of SSS maximum is documented. The Smax belt shifts north-south seasonally while retaining its well-defined linear morphology, which is suggestive of a mechanism that maintains this feature. In the SW Atlantic, the Rio de la Plata plume expands in winter (June-July), reaching across the South Brazilian Bight, up to Cabo Frio (23°S) and beyond. The Plata estuarine front moves in and out seasonally. Farther south, the Magellan Strait outflow expands northward in winter up to 39-40°S to nearly join the Plata outflow. In the SE Atlantic, the Congo River plume spreads radially from the river mouth, with the spreading direction varying seasonally and interannually. The plume is often bordered from the south by a quasi-zonal front along 6°S. The diluted Congo River water spreads southward seasonally down to the thermal Angola-Benguela Front at 16°S. The Benguela upwelling is delineated by a meridional front, which extends north alongshore up to 20°S, where the low-salinity Benguela upwelling water meets the high-salinity tropical water (“Angola water”) to form a salinity front, which is separate from the thermal Angola-Benguela Front at 16°S. The Angola water thus forms a wedge between the low-salinity waters of the Congo River outflow in the north and Benguela upwelling in the south. This high-salinity wedge is bordered by salinity fronts that migrate north-south seasonally.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7ac8ac736e856c8dabe74dedf867c3ae7f61c07bfd1b6470325e451c308ec318","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
