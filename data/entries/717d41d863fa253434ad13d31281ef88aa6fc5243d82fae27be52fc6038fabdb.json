{"title":"Social mechanisms for integrating community cats into community governance in urban China","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308120","date":1723644000000,"content":"<p>by Di Wu, Jintu Gu</p>\r\n\r\nThe presence of community cats roaming freely in urban spaces has caused considerable controversy. This is because the management and care of community cats have yet to become part of urban community governance. This research analyzes the process and mechanism of integrating community cats into urban community governance from the interaction between community cats and urban residents. Data were collected through participatory observation and unstructured interviews. Drawing upon the analytical framework of ’Norms, Trust, and Networks’ derived from social capital theory, this research reveals that social norms and trust activate the social capital of the community, fostering a social network with ’community cats’ at its core. More importantly, this social network extends the scope of care from the community cat to other members of the community. This research defines this mechanism as ’care extension.’ This not only fosters a neighborly relationship between residents and community cats that goes beyond mere ecological interactions, but also helps foster a compassionate and harmonious multi-species urban community.","author":"Di Wu","siteTitle":"PLOS ONE","siteHash":"e9ab556ceb1e4ea76e897a5fa4f394f0bb75c2c2f3d5b0f4766ff77b4a262ac1","entryHash":"717d41d863fa253434ad13d31281ef88aa6fc5243d82fae27be52fc6038fabdb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
