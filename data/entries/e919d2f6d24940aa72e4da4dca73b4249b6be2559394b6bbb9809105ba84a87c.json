{"title":"Effectiveness and Tolerability of Anti-Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide Therapy for Migraines and Other Chronic Headaches in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Retrospective Study in the USA","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0405/v1","date":1722933704000,"content":"This retrospective study assesses the efficacy and tolerability of anti-CGRP therapy in adolescents and young adults (ages 12-21) with migraines and chronic daily headaches unresponsive to standard treatments. Migraines severely affect school performance, self-esteem, psychological well-being, and cognitive health in this demographic, who are also sensitive to the side effects of conventional medications often prescribed off-label and face high insurance denial rates. Medication overuse, including analgesics, triptans, and NSAIDs, is prevalent due to treatment failures. Elevated plasma CGRP levels during migraines suggest that anti-CGRP therapies, which have shown success in adults, might benefit this age group. Over three years, patients at a specialized headache center were evaluated for the impact of anti-CGRP treatments, including monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) and small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (ubrogepant, rimegepant, atogepant), either alone or in combination with OnabotulinumtoxinA. The study found significant improvements in migraine management, especially among older adolescents, with reduced rescue medication use and emergency visits. Longer treatment courses and combination therapy with traditional medications were more effective than monotherapy, reducing migraine intensity and frequency. Adverse effects were minimal, and no significant medication interactions were noted. Anti-CGRP therapy demonstrates substantial potential in improving outcomes for this age group with chronic and episodic migraines","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"e919d2f6d24940aa72e4da4dca73b4249b6be2559394b6bbb9809105ba84a87c","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
