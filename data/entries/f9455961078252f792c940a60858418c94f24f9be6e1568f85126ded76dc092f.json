{"title":"Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in HIVPositive and HIV-Negative Patients with Lymphoma: A Propensity Score Matched Comparative Analysis","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202408.0537/v1","date":1723112075000,"content":"Treatment of HIV-associated lymphoma (HIV-Ly) with autologous stem cell  transplantation (ASCT) has shown a surprisingly low relapse rate in several series. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of HIV-Ly and lymphomas of the general population receiving ASCT. We compared two series of consecutive HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients, based on a 1:1 propensity score analysis, matching for age, sex, histology, disease status and prior therapies. We identified 44 patients in both groups. All HIV-positive patients received combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). With a median follow-up of 51 months, PFS was significantly higher in HIV-positive patients (4-years PFS 81% and 51%, in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients, respectively, p=0.027). Four-year OS was 81% for HIV-positive and 67% in HIV-negative patients (p=0.15). The relapse rate was significantly higher in HIV-negative patients (36% vs 23%) (p=0.04). Our results clearly show that ASCT is an effective curative option for HIV-Ly, with better PFS and lower relapse rate compared to uninfected patients. A favourable effect of ASCT on HIV infection and immune system recovery, potential off-target effects of cART or other yet unknown factors may account for this observation.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"f9455961078252f792c940a60858418c94f24f9be6e1568f85126ded76dc092f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
