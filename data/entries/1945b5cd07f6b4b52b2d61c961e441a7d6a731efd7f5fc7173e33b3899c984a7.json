{"title":"The Role of CyberKnife Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Recurrent Cranial Medulloblastomas across Pediatric and Adult Populations","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.0277/v1","date":1712146368000,"content":"Background and Objectives:\nMedulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. In recent decades, the therapeutic landscape has undergone significant changes, with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) emerging as a promising treatment for recurrent cases. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the long-term efficacy and safety of SRS in recurrent medulloblastomas across both pediatric and adult patients at a single institution.\nMethods:\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological records of patients who underwent CyberKnife SRS for recurrent cranial medulloblastomas at our institution between 1998 and 2023. Follow-up data were available for 15 medulloblastomas in 10 patients. The cohort comprised 8 pediatric patients (ages 3-18) and 2 adult patients (ages 19-75). Median age at the time of SRS was 13 years, median tumor volume accounted for 1.9 cc, median biologically equivalent dose (BED) was 126 Gy, and single-fraction equivalent dose (SFED) was 18 Gy. The SRS was administered at 75% of the median isodose line.\nResults:\nFollowing a median follow-up of 39 months (range: 6-78), 53.3% of the medulloblastomas progressed, 13.3% regressed, and 33.3% remained stable. The 3-year local tumor control (LTC) rate for all medulloblastomas was 65%, with lower rates observed in the adult cohort (50%) and higher rates in pediatric patients (67%). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 70%, with significantly higher rates in pediatric patients (75%) compared to adult patients (50%). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS)  rate was 58.3%, with higher rates in pediatric patients (60%) compared to adult patients (50%). Two pediatric patients developed radiation-induced edema, while two adult patients experienced radiation necrosis at the latest follow-up, with both adult patients passing away.\nConclusion:\nOur study provides a complex perspective on the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife SRS in treating recurrent cranial medulloblastomas across pediatric and adult populations. The rarity of adverse radiation events (ARE) underscores the safety profile of SRS, reinforcing its role in enhancing treatment outcomes. The intricacies of symptomatic outcomes, intertwined with factors such as age, tumor location, and prior surgeries, emphasize the need for personalized treatment approaches. Our findings underscore the imperative for ongoing research and the development of more refined treatment strategies for recurrent medulloblastomas. Given the observed disparities in treatment outcomes, a more meticulous tailoring of treatment approaches becomes crucial.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"1945b5cd07f6b4b52b2d61c961e441a7d6a731efd7f5fc7173e33b3899c984a7","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
