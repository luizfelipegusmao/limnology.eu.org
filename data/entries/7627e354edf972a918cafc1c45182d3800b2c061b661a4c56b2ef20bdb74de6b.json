{"title":"A Comprehensive Review of MAV/06 Varicella Vaccines: Safety, Immunogenicity, and Effectiveness","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202404.1937/v1","date":1714402339000,"content":"Varicella (chickenpox) is one of the most common infectious diseases in preschool children and can be prevented by immunization. While immunization program promotes higher vaccine coverage, there are still challenges with implementing vaccination programs particularly in low-income countries. Economic barriers can increase inequality in vaccination, which highlights the importance of distributing cost-effective varicella vaccines. Varicella vaccines have been developed with two main Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) strains globally: MAV/06 and Oka strains. Most of the vaccines are based on the Oka strain, while MAV/06 strain vaccines were exclusively developed by GC Biopharma. Although more than 30 million doses of MAV/06 vaccines as cost-effective vaccines have been distributed internationally, there is no comprehensive review on safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of MAV/06 vaccines in the literature. This paper aims to summarize and present more than 30 years of accumulated evidence from research on safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of MAV/06 vaccines. We expect that MAV/06 vaccines as cost-effective varicella vaccines make a significant contribution to improving global public health and health equality in children.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"7627e354edf972a918cafc1c45182d3800b2c061b661a4c56b2ef20bdb74de6b","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
