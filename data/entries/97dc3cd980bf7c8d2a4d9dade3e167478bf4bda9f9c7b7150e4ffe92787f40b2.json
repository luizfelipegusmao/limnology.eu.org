{"title":"Thermal Surface Properties, London Dispersive and Polar Sur-face Energy of Graphene and Carbon Materials by Inverse Gas Chromatography at Infinite Dilution","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.1631/v1","date":1716544612000,"content":"The thermal surface properties of graphenes and carbon materials are of crucial importance in chemistry of materials, chemical engineering, and many industrial processes. (1) Background: The determination of these surface properties is carried out using inverse gas chromatography at infinite dilution which leads to the retention volume of organic solvents adsorbed on solid surfaces. This experimental and fundamental parameter actually reflects the surface thermodynamic interactions between injected probes and solid substrates. (2) Methods: The London dispersion equation and the Hamieh thermal model were used to quantify the London dispersive and polar surface energy of graphenes and carbon fibers as well their Lewis acid-base constants by introducing the coupling amphoteric constant of materials. (3) Results: The London dispersive and polar acid-base surface energies, the free energy of adsorption, the polar enthalpy and entropy, and the Lewis acid-base constants of graphenes and carbon materials were determined. (4) Conclusions: it was showed that graphene exhibited the highest values of London dispersive surface energy, polar surface energy, and Lewisâ€™s acid-base constants. These highest characteristics of graphene justify its great potentiality and uses in many industrial applications.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"97dc3cd980bf7c8d2a4d9dade3e167478bf4bda9f9c7b7150e4ffe92787f40b2","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
