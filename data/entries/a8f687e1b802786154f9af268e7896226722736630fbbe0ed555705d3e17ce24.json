Methods: Thirty-two hemodialysis (HD) patients were randomly assigned to three groups: Exercise (EX)-MEL, EX-Placebo (PLA), and Control (C)-PLA. Participants in the EX-MEL and EX-PLA groups underwent 12 weeks of concurrent training. Before nocturnal sleep, they ingested either 3 mg of MEL (EX-MEL) or a placebo (EX-PLA and C-PLA). Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention to assess lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)], antioxidant biomarkers [ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), reduced glutathione (GSH), total thiol (THIOL)], total bilirubin (TBIL), uric acid (UA), biomarkers of muscle and liver damage [aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Gamma-glutamyltransferase (Gamma-GT)], and inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP)]. Results: EX-MEL demonstrated a decrease of MDA (p","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"a8f687e1b802786154f9af268e7896226722736630fbbe0ed555705d3e17ce24","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
