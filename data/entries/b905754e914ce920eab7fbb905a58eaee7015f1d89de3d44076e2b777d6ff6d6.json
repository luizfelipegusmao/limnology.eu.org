{"title":"Structural and genetic basis for the binding of a mouse monoclonal antibody to Flavobacterium psychrophilum lipopolysaccharide","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.13958?af=R","date":1717520300000,"content":"<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb FL100A) previously prepared against <i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i> (<i>Fp</i>) CSF259-93 has now been examined for binding to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of this strain and <i>Fp</i> 950106-1/1. The corresponding O-polysaccharides (O-PS) of these strains are formed by identical trisaccharide repeats composed of <span>l</span>-Rhamnose (<span>l</span>-Rha), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-<span>l</span>-fucose (<span>l</span>-FucNAc) and 2-acetamido-4-R<sub>1</sub>-2,4-dideoxy-<span>d</span>-quinovose (<span>d</span>-Qui2NAc4NR<sub>1</sub>) where R<sub>1</sub> represents a dihydroxyhexanamido moiety. The O-PS loci of these strains are also identical except for the gene (<i>wzy1</i> or <i>wzy2</i>) that encodes the polysaccharide polymerase. Accordingly, adjacent O-PS repeats are joined through <span>d</span>-Qui2NAc4NR<sub>1</sub> and <span>l</span>-Rha by <i>wzy2</i>-dependent α(1–2) linkages in <i>Fp</i> CSF259-93 versus <i>wzy1</i>-dependent β(1–3) linkages in <i>Fp</i> 950106-1/1. mAb FL100A reacted strongly with <i>Fp</i> CSF259-93 O-PS and LPS but weakly or not at all with <i>Fp</i> 950106-1/1 LPS and O-PS. Importantly, it also labelled cell surface blebs on the former but not the latter strain. Additionally, mAb binding was approximately 5-times stronger to homologous <i>Fp</i> CSF259-93 LPS than to LPS from a strain with a different R-group gene. A conformational epitope for mAb FL100A binding was suggested from molecular dynamic simulations of each O-PS. Thus, <i>Fp</i> CSF259-93 O-PS formed a stable well-defined compact helix in which the R<sub>1</sub> groups were displayed in a regular pattern on the helix exterior while unreactive <i>Fp</i> 950106-1/1 O-PS adopted a flexible extended linear conformation. Taken together, the findings establish the specificity of mAb FL100A for Wzy2-linked <i>F. psychrophilum</i> O-PS and LPS.</p>","author":"John O. Cisar, \nXiaocong Wang, \nRobert J.
