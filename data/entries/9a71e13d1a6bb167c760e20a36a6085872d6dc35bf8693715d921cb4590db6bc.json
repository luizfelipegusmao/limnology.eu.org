{"title":"Properties of Co-free Ni-Rich LiNi0.8Mn0.1Fe0.1O2 as Cathode Material for Lithium-Ion Batteries","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.2320/v1","date":1722254390000,"content":"This study throws more light on the new Co-free and Ni-rich LiNi0.8Mn0.1Fe0.1O2 cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. This cobalt-free cathode material is prepared using a two-step process: the formation of an oxalate precursor by co-precipitation followed by a solid-state reaction with lithium hydroxide and iron citrate. The physico-chemical properties of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Fe0.1O2 are characterized using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The LiNi0.8Mn0.1Fe0.1O2 electrode tested at at C/2 rate within voltage window of 3.0-4.4 V vs. Li+/Li delivers a specific capacity of ~80 mAh g-1 and retain about 45% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"9a71e13d1a6bb167c760e20a36a6085872d6dc35bf8693715d921cb4590db6bc","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
