{"title":"Quaternion Spin","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202302.0055/v5","date":1718691332000,"content":"We present an analysis of the Dirac equation when the spin symmetry is changed from SU(2) to the quaternion group, $Q_8$, afforded by multiplying one of the $\\gamma$-matrices by the imaginary number. The reason for doing this is to introduce a bivector into the spin algebra. This complexifies the Dirac field which separates into two distinct and complementary spaces: one describing polarization and the other coherence. The former describes a 2D structured spin and the latter its helicity, generated by a unit quaternion.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"750477e4a9e8377bd05437ca11eb18b6ad4dffa217013eaa7b72a5d9817bdf46","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
