These human-modified ecosystems have largely changed in (meso)carnivore communities, wolves themselves (genetics, behavior), woody plant communities and the playing field for predator-prey interactions (landscape structure). The recognition of the novelty of human-modified ecosystems logically leads to novel pathways of how wolves can influence ecosystem functioning, which we discussed in our study Kuijper et al. 2024. The photo shows a wolf close to the village Białowieża in Poland.
