{"title":"Connection-Aware Digital Twin for Mobile Adhoc Networks in the 5G Era","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202410.0367/v1","date":1728292353000,"content":"5G Mobile Adhoc Networks (5G-MANETs) are a popular and agile solution for data transmission in local contexts, while maintaining communication with remote entities via 5G. These characteristics have established 5G-MANETs as versatile communication infrastructures for deploying contextual applications, leveraging physical proximity while exploiting the possibilities of the Internet. As a result, there is growing interest in exploring the potential of these networks and their performance in real-world scenarios. However, the management and monitoring of 5G-MANETs is challenging due to their inherent characteristics, such as highly variable topology, unstable connections, energy consumption of individual devices, message routing, and occasional inability to connect to 5G. Considering these challenges, the proposed work aims to address real-time monitoring of 5G-MANETs using a connection-aware Digital Twin (DT). The approach provides two main functions: offering a live virtual representation of the network, even in scenarios where multiple nodes lack 5G connectivity, and estimating the performance of the infrastructure, enabling the specification of customized conditions. To achieve this, a communication architecture is proposed, analyzing its components and defining the involved processes. The DT is implemented and evaluated in a laboratory setting, assessing its accuracy in representing the physical network under varying conditions of topology and Internet availability. The results show 100% accuracy for the DT in fully connected topologies, with ultra-low latency averaging under 80 ms, and suitable performance in partially connected contexts, with latency averages below 3000 ms.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"5de734a66c29746936ec9c98b2ea8d88956cbc8649194798cfeb64f02a4797e9","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
