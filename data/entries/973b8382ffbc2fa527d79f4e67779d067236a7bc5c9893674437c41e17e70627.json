The integration of Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and advanced analytics has reshaped organizational practices, enabling real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making in supply chain management (SCM) and marketing. Through semi-structured interviews with 25 professionals, including supply chain managers, marketing executives, and IT specialists, insights were gathered into the adoption, integration, and impact of digital technologies within organizational contexts. Key findings highlight IoT's contribution to enhancing supply chain visibility, predictive maintenance, and operational efficiency through continuous monitoring and data-driven insights. AI technologies support demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and personalized marketing strategies, improving customer engagement and satisfaction. Blockchain enhances supply chain transparency, traceability, and security, reducing risks associated with fraud and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Advanced analytics provide organizations with actionable insights into consumer behavior and market trends, guiding strategic decision-making and optimizing marketing campaigns. Despite these benefits, organizations face challenges such as technological complexity, integration issues, data privacy concerns, and organizational resistance to change. Strategic planning, leadership support, and investment in digital infrastructure are essential for overcoming these challenges and maximizing the potential of digital technologies. Future research directions include exploring sustainability initiatives in digital SCM, advancing AI-driven analytics, and understanding digital transformation in emerging markets.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"973b8382ffbc2fa527d79f4e67779d067236a7bc5c9893674437c41e17e70627","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
