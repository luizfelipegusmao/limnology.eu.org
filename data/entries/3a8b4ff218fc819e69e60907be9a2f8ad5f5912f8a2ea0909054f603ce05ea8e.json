{"title":"Plant-Based Diet and Supplements Reduced COVID-19 Severity and Mortality in Elderly Patients with Multiple Comorbidities (Part 2: Exploring the Underlying Mechanisms of Successful Intervention)","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0100/v2","date":1712649602000,"content":"The potential advantages of plant-based interventions in decreasing the incidence and lessening the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are yet to be widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, recent publications propose that these interventions could be effective. Our cardiology center conducted an interventional study in which we incorporated plant-based foods and provided supplementation to 3470 elderly COVID-19 patients with multiple comorbidities. We pay close attention to the precise selection of food items, the application of appropriate processing methods, and the provision of nourishing meals to our patients. Our outcome was highly successful as we achieved a zero mortality rate, and none of our patients experienced worsening conditions or required hospitalization. In this review article we present the mechanisms how plant-based and supplement interventions can mitigate COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. And experts have validated our hypotheses very recently. The measures and methods used to address the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through plant-based interventions and supplements are effective and may help prevent or manage future pandemics.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"3a8b4ff218fc819e69e60907be9a2f8ad5f5912f8a2ea0909054f603ce05ea8e","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
