{"title":"Dynamic of Quantum Correlation in Qubit-Qutrit States (Perpendicular Direction) under Multilocal and Global Dephasing: Classical Noises Effect","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0765/v1","date":1710310729000,"content":"Time evolution of the quantum correlation of the hybrid qubit-qutrit system in multilocal and global dephasing under the effect of a classical noises environment is presented. We considered the qutrit in z direction and the qubit x direction. In addition, our system presents two configurations: the different and the common environment and our discussion involves three types of noises: A Static Noise (SN), Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and Ornstein- Uhlenbeck noise (OU). By using the density matrix approach to determine the evolution of the state of the system, the found that the static noise is fatal for the quantum entanglement, the quantum correlation and for RTN and OU noises the quantum entanglement, the quantum correlation decreases monotonically with a sufficiently long time. Therefore, we can say that, entanglement and the quantum correlation are more robust to the noise precisely those Random telegraph noise and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"bad0ce08c9a52bbe57c1f21cddc3293adde7161346508346d39206e1fe1adabb","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
