Here, we used core body temperature (<i>T</i>\n<sub>b</sub>) patterns to examine the degree to which maternal body temperatures support the infant during periods of gestation and lactation.\n\nWe implanted 30 wild vervet monkeys (<i>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</i>) with miniature data loggers to obtain continuous measurements of core <i>T</i>\n<sub>b</sub> during periods of typical (i.e. non-drought periods) and limited (i.e. drought period) resource availability.\n\nWe tracked maternal <i>T</i>\n<sub>b</sub> profiles across the gestation and lactation periods, associated with 23 births, and compared those with <i>T</i>\n<sub>b</sub> profiles of non-reproductive females. This allowed us to examine the flexibility in maternal body temperatures and test whether limited resource availability shifts priority away from offspring investment and towards self-maintenance.\n\nVervet monkeys demonstrated the predicted pattern of gestational hypothermia and improved homeothermy in the gestation period during typical conditions, consistent with the maintenance of a thermal gradient to facilitate heat loss from the foetus. During periods of limited resource availability (i.e. drought), mothers were less homeothermic and more hyperthermic during the gestation period.\n\nVervet monkeys showed no evidence of lactational hyperthermia during typical conditions. During the drought, lactating mothers demonstrated hyperthermia and increased variability in body temperature, consistent with the increased metabolic demands and water requirements for milk production required to support growing infants.\n\nAlthough a mother's degree of homeothermy during gestation and lactation was unrelated to her infant's chance of survival to weaning, mothers did show flexibility in the degree to which they prioritized the maintenance of a thermal environment that supports their infant's development. Together, our findings demonstrate that flexibility in a mother's investment in thermoregulation during gestation and lactation may reflect a bet-hedging trade-off between self-maintenance and offspring investment.\n</p>\n<p>Read the free <a href=\"https://fesummaries.wordpress.com/2024/01/26/monkeys-hedge-their-bets-when-making-babies/\">Plain Language Summary</a> for this article on the Journal blog.</p>","author":"Richard McFarland, \nS.
