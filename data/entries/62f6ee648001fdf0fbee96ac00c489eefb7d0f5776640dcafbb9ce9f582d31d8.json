Today, the US produces more crude oil than any other country, ever, leads the world in natural gas production by a very wide margin, and has overtaken Qatar and Australia as the largest exporter of liquified natural gas. And according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) there is enough technically recoverable natural gas available domestically to continue production at this rate for nearly another century.<sup>1</sup></p>","author":"Caroline Trum, \nAmrit Nagi","siteTitle":"Wiley: Climate and Energy: Table of Contents","siteHash":"01686a434fe9726855d20acdab7b574b16fd10c446f32d3e4ecc1a064dc9d796","entryHash":"62f6ee648001fdf0fbee96ac00c489eefb7d0f5776640dcafbb9ce9f582d31d8","category":"Environment"}
