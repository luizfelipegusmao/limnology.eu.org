Scanning transmission electron microscopy has a key role to play supporting our improved understanding of nanocatalyst synthesis and the materialâ€™s structural and chemical evolution during catalyst activation. Yet to fully characterize these complex systems requires atomic spatial resolution and spectroscopy to be performed in reactive environments.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"dc3c580f345cca8b87b52e26f625bb8678d458fb247434e6b1537dbc03562da6","category":"Environment"}
