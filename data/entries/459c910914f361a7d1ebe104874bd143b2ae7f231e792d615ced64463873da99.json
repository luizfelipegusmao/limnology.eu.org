{"title":"On the Use of a Cluster Identification Method and a Statistical Approach for Analyzing Atom Probe Tomography Data for GP Zones in Al–Zn–Mg(–Cu) Alloys","link":"https://academic.oup.com/mam/article/30/1/1/7503553?rss=1","date":1703808000000,"content":"<span><div>Abstract</div>Early-stage clustering in two Al–Mg–Zn(–Cu) alloys has been investigated using atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy. Cluster identification by the isoposition method and a statistical approach based on the pair correlation function have both been applied to estimate the cluster size, composition, and volume fraction from atom probe data sets. To assess the accuracy of the quantification of clusters of different mean sizes, synthesized virtual data sets were used, accounting for a simulated degraded spatial resolution. The quality of the predictions made by the two complementary methods is discussed, considering the experimental and simulated data sets.</span>","author":"","siteTitle":"Microscopy and Microanalysis Current Issue","siteHash":"4696c64d0a05ab8306669645a687c52cc4f52f5a57db1c180736d38256b41e79","entryHash":"459c910914f361a7d1ebe104874bd143b2ae7f231e792d615ced64463873da99","category":"Environment"}
