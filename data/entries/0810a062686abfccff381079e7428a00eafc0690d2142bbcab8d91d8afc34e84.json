{"title":"Opting out of Medicare: Characteristics and differences between optometrists and ophthalmologists","link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310140","date":1725890400000,"content":"<p>by Michael J. Maywood, Harris Ahmed, Ravi Parikh, Tedi Begaj</p>\r\nObjective <p>To determine the rate of Medicare opt-out among optometrists and ophthalmologists and to contrast the differences in the characteristics and geographic distribution of these populations.</p> Design <p>A retrospective cross-sectional study.</p> Setting <p>Using a publicly available Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) data set, we collated data for ophthalmologists and optometrists who opted out in each year between 2005 and 2023. We calculated the rate of opt-out annually in each year window and cumulatively from 2005 to 2023. Comparative analysis was used to identify clinician characteristics associated with opt-out.</p> Main outcomes and measures <p>Both annual and cumulative rate of ophthalmologist and optometrist opt-out from Medicare.</p> Results <p>The estimated prevalence of Medicare opt-outs was 0.52% (77/14,807) for ophthalmologists and 0.38% (154/40,526) for optometrists. Ophthalmologists opting out were predominantly male (67.5%), had a longer practice duration (average 31.8 years), and were more often located in urban areas (83.1%), compared to optometrists (53.2% male, average 19.6 years in practice, 59.1% in urban areas, p = 0.04, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001 respectively). Approximately 83% of ophthalmologists were either anterior segment or oculoplastics specialties, while the majority (52.1%) of optometrists were in optometry-only practices; &gt;75% of identified clinicians were in private practice. Geographical distribution across the US showed variable opt-out rates, with the top 3 states including Oklahoma (3.4%), Arizona (2.1%), and Kansas (1.6%) for ophthalmology and Idaho (4.3%), Montana (3.1%), and Wyoming (1.4%) for optometry.</p> Conclusions and relevance <p>Few ophthalmologists and optometrists opt-out of Medicare but this trend has significantly increased since 2012. Of those who disenrolled from Medicare, 83% of ophthalmologists were in urbanized areas while 41% of optometrists were in non-urbanized areas. Because reasons for Medicare opt-out cannot be solely determined by administrative data, further investigation is warranted given the potential impact on healthcare accessibility.</p>","author":"Michael J.
