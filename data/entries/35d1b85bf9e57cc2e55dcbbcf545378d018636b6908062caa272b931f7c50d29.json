{"title":"Prevalence and Genetic Analysis of Porcine Circovirus Type 2 That Circulated between 2014 and 2021 in Jiangsu, China","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202409.0712/v1","date":1725918173000,"content":"Porcine circovirus-associated diseases, caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), are widespread and result in significant economic losses to the global swine industry. It is generally believed that PCV2 can be divided into nine genotypes (PCV2a to PCV2i), with the dominant being the PCV2d genotype. In this study, 2675 samples from pig farms in 13 cities in Jiangsu Province, China, were collected between 2014 and 2021 and subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis to investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of PCV2. The results showed that 41.42% (1108/2675) of samples tested positive for PCV2. The researchers further analyzed the genetic characteristics of 251 PCV2 strains and found that they belonged to the following four genotypes: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2d, and PCV2i. The dominant genotype was PCV2d, with a prevalence of 49.80% (125/251). The detection rate of PCV2b was significantly higher than those of PCV2a and PCV2i, at 35.46% (89/251), 7.57% (19/251), and 7.17% (18/251), respectively. We have further revealed the fingerprint of PCV2i genomic nucleotides for the first time. In conclusion, this study illustrates the high prevalence and evolutionary features of PCV2 in Jiangsu Province over the past few years.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"35d1b85bf9e57cc2e55dcbbcf545378d018636b6908062caa272b931f7c50d29","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
