{"title":"A Representation of an Octonionic Interaction of Color Quarks with the Application of Feynman Diagram","link":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202406.1351/v1","date":1718793788000,"content":"In this work, to gain a complete understanding of quark color theory in the framework of complex octonionic space, we have derived the relationship between octonions and the SU(3)c color group. With the help of Feynman diagrams, we examined the octonionic interaction of color quarks (such as quark-quark, quark anti-quark, and anti-quarks anti-quarks interactions). For the interactions, we have obtained the octonion algebraic form of the interaction term, propagator, vertex factor, and color factor.","author":"","siteTitle":"Preprints.org - The Multidisciplinary Preprint Platform","siteHash":"abac34b0506002eba4392ac15186820b9b5d7a0f2e5fce3a3511408258fb1a7e","entryHash":"14cc64c769749d6d09388bd81c64f2e8cffb6bb0692f54b3123e3b42f895169f","category":"Interdisciplinary"}
